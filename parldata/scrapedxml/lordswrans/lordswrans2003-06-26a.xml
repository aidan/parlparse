This decision was taken on the basis that the existing residence is larger and more expensive than we need. The new residence will meet well the operational requirements of the post, offer better value for money and will make a net contribution to the FCO's stretched capital funds&mdash;required for Estate, IT and security modernisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.0/1">The United Kingdom played an active role in this year's session of the Commission on Human Rights. As in previous years, there was progress in some areas but setbacks in others. We were pleased that the commission passed important resolutions on issues such as the death penalty, torture, the right to education and the protection of human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS as well as on the human rights situations in a number of countries including Burma, Iraq, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cuba and, for the first time, North Korea, Turkmenistan and Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/2">We were, however, disappointed that the commission failed to adopt resolutions on Zimbabwe, Chechnya and Sudan. We welcomed the increased time allotted to interactive dialogues with the Special Rapporteurs and the equitable distribution of speaking time to non-governmental organisations. While we did not endorse the election of a representative of Libya as chair of this year's session, she conducted proceedings in a competent and objective manner for much of the commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.8/1">At the NATO Ministerial meeting in Brussels on 12 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-13">13 June 2003</phrase>, new command arrangements for the alliance were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/2">The new NATO Command Structure will be leaner, more flexible, more efficient and better able to conduct future military operations. At the strategic level, there will be one command with operational responsibilities, Allied Command Operations, and a new functional command, Allied Command Transformation, to take responsibility for promoting and overseeing the continuing transformation of alliance forces and capabilities. Below the strategic level, the structure will be significantly streamlined, with a reduction in the number of headquarters, from over 20 to 14. A number of countries within the alliance will be affected by the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/3">For the United Kingdom, the number of NATO headquarters will reduce. We will retain the major maritime headquarters at Northwood, HQ NAVNORTH which will subsume the task of RHQ EASTLANT (also currently in Northwood). The NATO element of Combined Air Operations Centre 9 (CAOC) at RAF High Wycombe will close.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/4">RHQ EASTANT in Northwood has 230 service personnel, of whom 106 are UK nationals. There are 24 civilian personnel. Decisions on any transitional arrangements, including what tasks might be subsumed into HQ NAVNORTH and the timing of any changes, are still under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/5">The NATO CAOC at RAF High Wycombe is manned by some 94 service personnel, of whom 46 are UK nationals. There are no civilians. Decisions on the transitional arangements and the timing have not yet been taken. It is anticipated that the multinational element of the CAOC would return to their home countries. The total number of personnel at High Wycombe is over 2,100.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.8/6">These changes will help to achieve a more streamlined overall NATO Command Structure, thereby enabling the alliance to operate more efficiently and effectively, and taken together with the work on the NATO Response Force, should provide the alliance with a real improvement in future capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.2/1">The performance ratings system provides a high level overview of National Health Service Trust performance across the full range of trust functions. Acute and specialist, mental health and ambulance trust performance indicators are based around capacity and capability, clinical and patient focus including attainment of key targets. Primary care trust performance is assessed across the full range of primary care trust functions: service provision, access to quality services and improving health and attainment of key targets. The 2003 performance ratings contain a number of indicators, which relate to specialised services across all NHS Trusts with the exception of ambulance trusts. These include the reduction of waiting times for cancer services, 24-hour access to specialist mental health services and expansion of revascularisation services.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">Opinion surveys commissioned by the British Fluoridation Society regularly show that about 70 per cent. of the population are in favour of fluoridation. The Systematic Review of Fluoridation undertaken by the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York identified 3,246 research studies with reference to fluoridation many of which considered claims of an association between fluoridation and different illnesses or disabilities. Further claims continue to emerge. York found no evidence of risks to overall health from fluoridation, other than dental fluorosis, and were critical of the quality of some of the research. Accordingly, we asked the Medical Research Council to advise how the research base could be strengthened. We have already acted on its main recommendation by commissioning a research study into the absorption of fluoride.</p>

It will draw up practical advice to enable publicly funded clinical trials involving medicines to comply with the law while making best use of existing good practice, minimising additional bureaucracy and making maximum use of public resources to avoid unnecessary expense.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.3/3">The project is about to start, under the chairmanship of Professor Kent Woods, Director of the NHS Health Technology Assessment Programme. It will draw extensively on expert advice from trialists and from the charitable and public sector.</p>

Because of changes in postcode boundaries, these three sectors no longer exist. The population figures are for the 2001 areas most closely corresponding to the abolished areas. The postcode search tool which allows claimants to identify whether relief is due takes account of such postcode changes, as do processes in the Stamp Offices.</p>

However, my department has not received an application for a licence to release grey squirrels for any such purpose. Any application would be considered on its merits but it is unlikely that we would consider granting a licence without compelling evidence that introducing new bloodlines would reduce, rather than add to, the environmental damage caused by grey squirrels currently living feral in Britain.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.0/1">A government-funded study from 2000 predicted that a total of 186,314 tonnes of batteries would arise as waste in 2002. Of these, 2,279 tonnes were predicted to be nickel-cadmium batteries and 162,993 automotive and industrial lead-acid batteries. This corresponds to 396 tonnes of cadmium and 104,044 tonnes of lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/2">Ninety per cent of waste automotive and industrial lead acid batteries in the UK are recycled at one of two UK lead smelters, Britannia Refined Metals in Kent and H.J. Enthoven &amp; Sons in Derbyshire. Button cells containing mercury are recycled in the UK at Odin Technology and Mercury Recycling. Spent silver oxide batteries are reprocessed by Engelhard Ltd. A scheme called Bat-Re-Back has been established to collect industrial nickel cadmium batteries. These are currently sent to France to be recycled. According to the European Batteries Recycling Association 424 tonnes of nickel-cadmium batteries, from the UK, were recycled in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/3">In addition to these types of waste batteries, around 20,514 of waste primary consumer batteries were predicted to arise in 2002. A major pilot scheme for collecting consumer batteries is currently underway in Bristol which hopes to collect batteries from every household in the city. The scheme planned to send the batteries collected to Britannia Zinc for recycling, but due to the closure of the zinc smelter the batteries will now be recycled abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.2/1">The Doha declaration commits all WTO member countries to negotiations aimed at reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies for agricultural products. The Government fully supports this commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/2">The proposal which the EU submitted to the WTO in January suggested an average 45 per cent cut in the budgetary outlay on export subsidies over six years and a permanent phasing out of some export subsidies, especially where developing country markets were affected. This is a good start but falls short of the proposal made by the chairman of the Special Session of the Agriculture Committee, Stuart Harbinson, that developed countries should phase out all export subsidies over nine years.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/3">The negotiations are to continue in Special Sessions of the Agriculture and the fifth WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun in September. The Government will press for an outcome on export subsidies which properly reflects the commitment in the Doha declaration.</p>
