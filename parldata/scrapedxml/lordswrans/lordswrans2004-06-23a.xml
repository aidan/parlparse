The viability criteria for the establishment of a new post-primary integrated school includes the requirement that a school must achieve a minimum year-eight intake of 50 pupils to be approved for receipt of recurrent grant, and to demonstrate its long-term viability before capital grant is made available.

	<p pid="a.127.3/1">The National Contact Point (NCP) has received four complaints since the guidelines were revised in 2000, three of which are ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/2">A complaint was made against Anglo American plc by Rights and Accountability in Development and others in February 2002. The NCP first responded in March 2002. The investment committee of the OECD issued a clarification on the applicability of the guidelines in this case in April 2004. The company's detailed response was passed to the complainant in December 2003 and the NCP is awaiting the complainant's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/3">In April 2003 the NCP received a complaint from Friends of the Earth and others against the BTC Consortium (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan). The NCP first responded in May 2003. The company response was passed to the complainant in March 2004 and the NCP is awaiting the complainant's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/4">A complaint was received in July 2003 from Citizens for a Better Environment against National Grid/Transco. The NCP first responded in July 2003 and the company's response was passed to the complainant in November 2003 and again, the NCP is awaiting the complainant's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/5">Finally, a complaint was received from the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) in September 2003 against British American Tobacco. The NCP first responded in October 2003 and following a dialogue between the parties, the case was withdrawn in February 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/6">In addition to the above, the NCP is also dealing with matters referred by a UN expert panel on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Thus far, the issues relating to the evidence presented against one company (DeBeers) have been concluded. The NCP statement is available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ewt/debeers.doc">www.dti.gov.uk/ewt/debeers.doc</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/2" qnum="HL2826">What steps they are taking to preserve the native red squirrel from extinction; and what action they are taking to control grey squirrels.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-06-23a.133.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="133"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040623/text/40623w03.htm#40623w03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.133.2/1">The red squirrel is protected under Section 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which prohibits the unauthorised killing, injuring, taking, possession, sale or disturbance in a place of shelter or protection, any wild animal listed on Schedule 5 to the Act. It is also protected under Section 11 of the Act which prohibits certain methods of killing and taking of wild animals listed on Schedule 6 to the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/2">Under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan an individual species action plan has been prepared for the red squirrel. The UK Red Squirrel Group, a partnership of public, private and voluntary organisations led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, is responsible for delivery of the red squirrel action plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/3">The UK Red Squirrel Group has consulted widely among scientists, woodland managers and conservation bodies on a prioritisation process for the UK's surviving red squirrel populations. This identified the areas where action to maintain red squirrels is most likely to be effective in the long-term, including the Isle of Wight, the Poole Harbour Islands and the North Tyne area. The continuing expansion of the grey squirrel is to be expected and red squirrel conservation is focused on limiting that expansion in areas where the two species overlap. Some significant progress has been made in developing more effective and targeted ways of defending healthy populations of red squirrels against replacement by the grey squirrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/4">In northern England, these priorities have now been translated into management plans for key forest areas, where we believe a combination of large-scale habitat management in forests and buffer areas allied to surveillance and targeted grey squirrel control gives the red squirrel the best chance of survival. These plans will form the basis of a bid for Heritage Lottery funding within the next few months by a consortium of government agencies, wildlife trusts and private landowners.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/5">The Isle of Wight Red Squirrel Forum, led by the Isle of Wight Council has drawn up an action plan for the red squirrel population on the island. The plan, which is supported by the UK Red Squirrel Group, includes contingency arrangements that will trigger immediate actions in the event of grey squirrel incursions. The owners and managers of Poole Harbour islands are working with the Forestry Commission and English Nature on a joint Poole Harbour red squirrel management plan, including contingency arrangements in the event of a grey squirrel incursion.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/6">Landowners and others may take action to control grey squirrels which are not a protected species. The Forestry Commission is preparing a new policy statement on grey squirrel control. This is one of the commitments contained in the &quot;Sustaining England's Woodlands&quot; review. The widespread UK eradication of grey squirrels is not currently considered practicable but this will be kept under general review in the light of experience and research, in particular into non-lethal control methods.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.1/2" qnum="HL3249">Whether the temperatures in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs offices at Nobel House on 8 June were in line with guidance on optimum working conditions for office employees.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">In common with a large proportion of offices in the United Kingdom, Nobel House is a naturally ventilated building. On those days when the external temperature rises to become particularly hot the temperature in Nobel House does likewise.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/2">On the <phrase class="date" code="">8 June</phrase> the temperature in London rose to 31 degrees, one of the hottest days of the year so far and considerably above the average for the month.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/3">There is no legal maximum temperature for office buildings: for some days every year it will feel hot inside and out and will be above an optimum comfort level. This is countered with the judicious use of fans; and works currently under way in Nobel House to make the building more open plan will improve the free circulation of air.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/4">Full air conditioning is not favoured because of the negative impact on the environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.5/1">The 10 railway lines which will serve the proposed Olympic Park in Stratford are made up of four London underground lines, four mainline railway lines, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL).</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/2">The Underground lines are the Jubilee and Central lines through Stratford station and the District and Hammersmith and City lines through West Ham station. They and the DLR are the responsibility of the Mayor and Transport for London. Investment in the underground lines will be largely delivered through the PPP contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/3">The mainline railway lines are the Great Eastern mainline, North London line, Lea Valley line and C2C line. In addition to normal track maintenance and renewal works, investment plans for the railway network are set out in the Government's 10-year transport plan, the Strategic Rail Authority's strategic rail plan for 2003 and the Network Rail business plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/4">CTRL phase two serving Stratford and London St Pancras is currently under construction. Work on the line, including the new Stratford International Station, is expected to be completed by 2007.</p>
