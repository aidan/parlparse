	<p pid="a.134.3/1">At present there are two EU channels for delivering aid to which the UK contributes. The EU Budget finances aid to Asia, Latin America, the EU Neighbourhood and pre-accession countries. It also provides funds for cross-cutting assistance, such as humanitarian support or support for non-government organisations (NGOs). Our contributions to the EU Budget are non-discretionary and imposed by the EU treaties. Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 gives effect to EU law within the UK. The UK also contributes to the European Development Fund (EDF), a member states' voluntary fund that provides support to 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific states.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/2">All UK aid channelled through the EU is currently being assessed under the Multilateral Aid Review to ensure it is as effective as possible and brings real benefits to the world's poor. The UK considers the EDF to be the most effective, flexible and poverty-focused of the EU's external instruments which shares many of the UK's strategic development priorities, and enables UK aid to reach countries and regions with no UK presence. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has, however, made clear that the European Commission needs to step up its efforts to demonstrate results and the impact of its aid. He has urged the Commission to adopt a Europe-wide aid transparency guarantee, similar to the recent commitment made by Britain.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.5/1">Electricity shortages in Gaza have been more common and prolonged in recent weeks, harming the delivery of essential services. Until recently the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO), which runs the Gaza power plant, had an arrangement with the Palestinian Authority (PA) whereby the PA purchased fuel from Israel that was imported into Gaza, and GEDCO reimbursed the PA through utility revenues. At the beginning of 2011, GEDCO stopped this arrangement and began importing cheaper diesel fuel through the tunnels with Egypt at Rafah. However, tunnel supplies have been severely disrupted due to the recent instability in Egypt, and GEDCO has re-approached the PA to resume fuel transfers from Israel. We call on both parties to come to a swift agreement that allows full resumption of fuel supplies to Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/2">We have therefore not made any specific representations to Israel on this matter as we do not see restrictions on imports of Israeli fuel into Gaza as being the cause of the latest electricity shortages. However, we continue to work closely with the office of the quartet representative, UN agencies and other partners to support broader improvements in access to Gaza. We welcome Israel's recent announcement to revive discussions with the Palestinian Authority on exploiting the Gaza Marine gas field, and the approval in principle to both the supply of Palestinian offshore gas to Gaza power plants, and for a new power station. It is important that these commitments are implemented in a timely manner.</p>

The draft code makes clear the Government's preference for a threshold of &#163;58,200 to apply to disclosure of senior salaries in local authorities. The code will be issued in exercise of the Secretary of State's powers under Section 2 of the Local Government, Land and Planning Act 1980.

Individual salary information for senior civil servants in pay bands 2-4 is published on departments' websites. In addition, departments have also published on line the total numbers and grades of non-senior Civil Service staff reporting to each senior Civil Service pay band 1 and 1A post, a description of the role of the team and the total salary cost of that team. The same guidance applies to staff of non-departmental public bodies and arm's-length bodies. The level of disclosure for senior civil servants is going to be reviewed prior to the next exercise, in April 2011, with a view to increasing transparency further.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.8/2">According to the comprehensive closure survey completed by the UN at the end of March 2010, Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) field teams documented and mapped 505 obstacles throughout the West Bank. Theseinclude 65 permanently staffed checkpoints, 22 partial checkpoints (staffed on an ad-hoc basis) and 418 unstaffed obstacles, including roadblocks, earth mounds, earth walls, road gates, road barriers, and trenches.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.8/3">The total of 505 obstacles represents a net reduction of 121 obstacles (19 per cent), compared to the previous reporting period in March 2009 (626).</p>
	<p pid="a.140.8/4">The noble Lord may be aware of reports that Israel plans to transfer overall responsibility for the operation of checkpoints to the Crossing Points Administration (CPA). It is too early to judge what effect this will have on the daily lives of Palestinians needing to pass through checkpoints, but early indications are not positive. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and raise with Israel the importance of easing restrictions on movement and access for ordinary Palestinians</p>

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">A UK parliamentary by-election could still take place on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-05">5 May</phrase> but would not be combined with the referendum on the voting system and the other planned polls taking place on this date. In effect, this would mean that separate polling stations would be used for the poll and that other aspects of the poll, for example the issuing and receipt of postal ballot packs, would not be combined.</p>
