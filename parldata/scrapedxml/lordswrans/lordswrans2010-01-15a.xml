	<p pid="a.189.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has a long-standing policy not to issue commemorative medals to service personnel other than for Royal Coronations and Jubilees.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.5/2">Since the end of World War II, the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals (known as the HD committee), which is responsible for recommending to Her Majesty The Queen on the award of new medals, has a consistent and well-established policy that it will not consider the belated institution of awards and medals for service given many years earlier. The reason for this policy is that the present HD committee cannot put itself in the place of the committee which made the original decision and which would have been able to take account of the views of all interested parties at the time. In addition, if an exception were to be made for one case, then it would be almost impossible to refuse to reconsider every other claim for the retrospective institution of an award or medal.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.5/3">There were no medals awarded purely for service in a particular command during World War II. Those who completed the minimum qualifying period of service in operational areas were eligible for the 1939-45 Star and those with long service in non-operational areas received the defence medal. In addition to the 1939-45 Star and defence medal, a series of campaign stars were created for participants in particularly hazardous campaigns, and many Bomber Command personnel qualified for the much prized aircrew Europe Star or, for example, the France and Germany Star.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.0/1">We lobby the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) vigorously through our embassy in Kinshasa on the human rights situation in the country and we welcome President Kabila's zero tolerance policy on human rights abusers. We continue to press for measures to be taken on impunity for serious abusers, including the handover of Bosco Ntaganda to the International Criminal Court. We take the issue of impunity seriously, and have lent support to developing the justice sector in DRC. We are providing around &#163;80 million over five years to increase accountability of the security sector through strengthened oversight mechanisms, technical assistance and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/2">We also lobby strongly for, and support, action to be taken on sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). Our action to combat this is focused on four levels: prevention; strengthening medical and psychosocial response; support during the judicial process; and advocacy to generate political action by the DRC Government. The Security Council recently passed Regulation 1888 which was co-sponsored by the UK. It renews Security Council Regulation 1820 on women and conflict, and creates a technical task force to look at sexual violence, as well as a UN special envoy.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/3">The UK in addition continues to push for legal action against five senior commanders of the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) accused of committing sexual violence and who were named by the UN Security Council during their visit. We will continue to stress the importance of ensuring the implementation of the UN peacekeeping mission's policy of withdrawing support from FARDC units implicated in serious human rights abuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/4">We are working with the international community, particularly the World Bank, European Commission, International Monetary Fund and the UN Development Programme, to tackle corruption in the DRC. We are supporting government institutions to develop a more efficient and transparent public financial management system, and are working to improve the quality of government audit and budgeting processes. In addition, through a new civil society fund, we are starting work to make Parliament and civil society stronger in holding government agencies to account.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.2/1">(a) Any permanent ceasefire in the Kivus will require close co-operation between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda. We welcome the recent rapprochement between Rwanda and DRC-including the recent exchange of ambassadors-which has lead to greater co-operation and stability in the region. Our ambassador in Kinshasa and High Commissioner in Kigali are in close contact with their respective host Governments and continue to engage on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/2">(b) The UK fully supports the work of the UN Group of Experts which has led investigations into the companies and individuals benefiting from the illicit trade in natural resources. We are working with the Government of DRC to promote the mining sector and the trade of minerals in a more regulated and transparent way which will inhibit the opportunities of illegal groups to exploit the mining and trade. We also take very seriously our obligations under sanctions and will not hesitate to support sanctions against any person or company against whom there is sufficient evidence, including UK-based companies or individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/3">(c) The UK supports international efforts to prevent crimes against humanity. We have been working with partners on an emergency justice project to help bring the most serious crimes in eastern DRC to justice, including specific provision for crimes of sexual violence. We are working within a security sector reform programme to end the culture of impunity for the security forces, for example providing barracks, pay, etc, to reduce the predation of the army on civilian populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/4">The UK is equally committed to playing an active role in international efforts to protect children affected by armed conflict as a member of the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict and through the European Union. The UK has also provided very significant financial support to a number of programmes that help children affected by armed conflict. The UK strongly supports the work of international courts and tribunals which are trying the alleged perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community including those against children.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/5">(d) The Department for International Development (DfID) supports a programme of HIV/AIDS prevention, which includes the distribution of condoms and behaviour change and helping the Government develop a national strategy for tackling HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/6">(e) DfID leads the international donor group in DRC on education and supports the Government's aspiration to achieve universal free primary education. It is supporting the DRC's primary and secondary education strategy through a teacher census and a school mapping exercise, and we continue to support universal access to education through a scheme for providing insurance for primary school children to attend school.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/7">The UK works with a range of partners on these issues, including the EU and the United States.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.5/1">My department has received many representations about the framework for registering new town or village greens, and particularly requests for assistance and explanation from members of the public. We have also received representations from Members of Parliament, local authorities and others about the consequences of applications for registration, in so far as they affect local authorities, landowners and others.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.0/1">The Government are aware that several EU member states have adopted legislation recognising the crimes and massacres of 1915 and 1916 as genocide. Terrible suffering was inflicted on Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. We must ensure that the victims of that suffering are not forgotten. The Government's main concern is how we can ensure that the lessons are learnt and relationships are rebuilt to ensure a peaceful and secure future for everyone living in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/2">For this reason, we believe that it is first and foremost for the Turkish and Armenian people to address their common history. We welcome the recent signature of protocols on establishing and developing relations between Turkey and Armenia as an important step in this direction. In particular, we welcome the fact that the protocols provide for an intergovernmental sub-committee to examine historical issues. It is important that this process is owned by the parties directly concerned.</p>
