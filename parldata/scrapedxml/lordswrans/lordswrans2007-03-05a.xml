	<p pid="a.2.3/2">This is what happened in relation to Iraq in 2003. While there is a particular need for certainty and clarity in relation to military action, the public interest would not necessarily be served by publication of the legal advice itself, which may refer to secret intelligence or military plans and could include references to the arguments both for and against what is proposed. It would be for the Prime Minister of the day to determine how best fully to explain the legal basis for action to Parliament, including whether that could be done by disclosing the legal advice received in that respect.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.8/5">One of the means by which the Commission can monitor these issues is through regular missions conducted by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) to individual member states and to countries outside Europe. These FVO missions produce reports on the visited country's capability, resources and levels of compliance, among other issues. They are reviewed by the Commission and other member states at regular meetings of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH).</p>

The MHRA received feedback from the Guernsey authorities on three cases. In two cases there were no offences under Guernsey law and in the third case the company was not actually based in Guernsey. The MHRA received feedback on three cases from the Jersey authorities. In all three cases the companies were not actually based in Jersey.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/2">A prohibition order on the sale, supply and importation of kava kava in unlicensed medicines, other than for external use, came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-13">13 January 2003</phrase>. The order was made following advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Medicines Commission (the independent advisory committees advising the Secretary of State) that kava kava poses a rare but serious risk of liver toxicity. Similar action was taken in relation to kava kava in foods. The Guernsey authorities have investigated the supply of kava kava by a company apparently based on that island. The investigation showed that the product was not actually being distributed from Guernsey but from Cyprus. A complaint has been referred to the authorities in Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/3">There are no special legislative restrictions on the sale or supply of the hormone melatonin. Unless it is being supplied as an unlicensed medicine in accordance with the relevant statutory controls, a medicinal product containing melatonin requires a marketing authorisation before it may be lawfully sold or supplied. The status of melatonin under medicines legislation was first considered in 1989. The MHRA is unaware of any implication for public health by the classification of melatonin as a medicinal product. The MHRA refers complaints about the sale and supply of melatonin from the Channel Islands to the relevant regulatory authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/4">The MHRA considers that the claims made for beres drops bring the product within the definition of a medicinal product. No assessment of the accuracy of those claims has been made as no application for a marketing authorisation has been received. Although the product was being sold by a Guernsey-based company, the MHRA took action to prevent advertising by a United Kingdom publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/5">There are no specific powers in the medicines legislation administered by the MHRA or in the Postal Services Act 2000 to control direct-mail advertising from the Channel Islands. The legislation administered by the MHRA does not apply to the Channel Islands. Advertisements issued from the islands would be the responsibility of the relevant authorities within those islands.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/6">The legislation administered by the MHRA does not apply to the Channel Islands. The islands have their own legislative Assemblies and are responsible for the regulation of activities relating to medicinal products that take place from those islands; therefore, any suspected illegal activity is referred to the relevant authority in the Channel Islands for investigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.2/1">National Lottery funding is distributed to athletes in two ways. Indirectly, they receive the benefit of the substantial investment made by UK Sport in the world-class performance programmes of sporting national governing bodies (NGBs) to support their training and competition needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/2">Lottery money is also distributed directly to athletes via UK Sport's athlete personal awards (APAs). In 2006 APA payments totalled &pound;6,768,282, with 769 individual athletes receiving support during the year. &quot;Podium&quot; APA payments were made to 506 athletes and &quot;development&quot; APA payments to 263 athletes.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/3">The table shows the total APA payments made by UK Sport to athletes grouped by their sport, together with the number of athletes who received an APA during 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/4">Given the number of athletes who received an APA, it is not possible to say how much each athlete received. By way of illustration, the annual average total of an APA is &pound;6,783 at &quot;development&quot; level and &pound;16,300 at &quot;podium&quot; level. However, as athletes are selected for and removed from the APA system by the NGBs at different times throughout the year, not all athletes received APAs for a full calendar year.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.8/1">The department currently has five contracts, established following specific invitations to tender, worth &pound;1 million or more, with the Transport Research Laboratory. This represents 1.6 per cent of all the department's contracts for specific assignments worth &pound;1 million or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/2">In addition, the department has a number of frameworks in place, which are typically with a number of suppliers through which it expects to place orders on a &quot;call-off&quot; basis. Such arrangements are based on an estimated value of spend over their duration and may include accumulated orders worth &pound;1 million or more, often placed following further competition. The Transport Research Laboratory is included in a number of such framework arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.0/1">Any scheme to provide discounted travel for benefit claimants would be treated for the purposes of income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance and pension credit as akin to a payment in kind. As the rules for these benefits fully disregard these types of payments, the travel concession being proposed by the London Assembly would not have an impact on benefit entitlement.</p>
