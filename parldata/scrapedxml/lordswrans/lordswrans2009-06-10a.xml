	<p pid="a.154.5/1">The Ministry of Justice led a delegation of officials from several government departments and devolved Administrations. Most of the issues raised in relation to Northern Ireland in the combined fourth and fifth periodic report fell within the remit of the Northern Ireland Executive. Given the limited role for the Northern Ireland Office in relation to this examination, it was not considered to be an effective use of public money to send Northern Ireland Office officials to the examination.</p>
