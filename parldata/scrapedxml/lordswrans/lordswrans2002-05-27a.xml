There have been delays in delivering the software application but discussions are currently under way with Fujitsu Services (formerly ICL) on this aspect of the project.

We have already provided considerable assistance to the Nepalese Government in the form of logistical equipment, training and support for the RNA and substantial development aid. We are actively considering early additional assistance including the supply of radios to improve communication within the Royal Nepalese Army&mdash;a key shortcoming&mdash;and training programmes developed to increase their awareness of human rights issues. My right honourable Friends the Prime Minister, Clare Short the Secretary of State for International Development, and my honourable Friend Ben Bradshaw held meetings with the Nepalese Prime Minister during his 13&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-05-14">14 May</phrase> visit, at which these matters were discussed.

Britain is the second largest bilateral donor to Nepal. The bilateral aid programme for this year is around &pound;22 million.</p>

Security considerations have so far prevented our embassy staff in Kabul visiting these prisons. But they are in frequent contact with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which closely monitors the situation and welfare of all prisoners in Afghanistan. Throughout the conflict last autumn, we urged the Northern Alliance to respect the tenets of the Geneva conventions and to treat humanely all those who surrendered and were taken prisoner. Since then, we have made clear to the Afghan Interim Administration that we expect them to respect their international obligations, including to treat their prisoners humanely.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.2/1">Under a 1945 agreement, the United States Government lent the United Kingdom a total of $4,336 million (around &pound;1,075 million at 1945 exchange rates) in war loans. These loans were taken out under two facilities: (i) a line of credit of $3,750 million (around &pound;930 million at 1945 exchange rates); and (ii) a lend-lease loan facility of $586 million (around &pound;145 million at 1945 exchange rates), which represented the settlement with the United States for lend-lease and reciprocal aid and for the final settlement of the financial claims of each government against the other arising out of the conduct of the Second World War. Under the agreement the loans would be repaid in 50 annual instalments commencing in 1950. However, the agreement allowed deferral of annual payments of both principal and interest if necessary because of prevailing international exchange rate conditions and the level of the United Kingdom's foreign currency and gold reserves. The United Kingdom has deferred payments on six occasions. Repayment of the war loans to the United States Government should therefore be completed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-31">31 December 2006</phrase>, subject to the United Kingdom not choosing to exercise its option to defer repayment. As at <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>, principal of $346,287,953 (&pound;243,573,154 at the exchange rate on that day) was outstanding on the loans provided by the United States Government in 1945. The Government intend to meet their obligations under the 1945 agreement by repaying the United States Government in full the amounts lent in 1945 and so no representation has been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.5/1">Implementing the age strand of the Employment Framework Directive (2000/78) is a significant undertaking. The directive includes proposals for outlawing unfair discrimination at work and in vocational training, on the new grounds of not only age, but also sexual orientation and religion or belief. This is a major step in itself, and the Government do not believe it would be sensible to be distracted from the difficult task of resolving the complexities associated with outlawing age discrimination at work and in training. Therefore, the Government have no plans at present to extend legislation to goods and services. There are significant practical issues to be worked through in consultation with employers, particularly small businesses, and others who may be affected. Unlike sexual orientation and religion, differences of treatment on the grounds of age are capable of objective justification under the directive in certain circumstances. The directive itself acknowledges that age is more complex than the other strands by allowing a longer time for implementation&mdash;December 2006 instead of December 2003. The Government will make full use of the extra time to make sure that eventual legislation is practical and helpful to employers and employees. We have already undertaken widespread consultation to identify what age-related practices employers have and why they might need to retain them. The consultation document Towards Equality and Diversity identified, and invited views on, key age issues. We want to prohibit unfair practices so as to remove the barriers which people of all ages can face in the workplace. We do not want to ban employment practices which can be clearly and objectively justified. We shall consider each of these areas in the light of the responses to the consultation, and will consult again with a set of firm proposals.</p>

The audit is due to be completed in June. We anticipate receiving a copy sometime that month. The intention is for the audit to be discussed by the partners locally and by a wider forum, which will involve users, to develop a local strategy for discussion at the Ridgeway Forum. The Countryside Agency are members of the Ridgeway Management Group and are very much involved in assessing the audit and providing recommendations resulting from it. As Alun Michael said recently in the House of Commons, we will support conclusions that are based upon evidence and a strong consensus at local level.</p>

Copies are available in the Library of the House. The Government's response sets out progress on sustainable development following the general election in 2001. We strongly believe that the creation of DEFRA has produced a department which is better equipped to champion sustainable development and ensure that sustainable development continues to be a priority for the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-24">Friday 24 May</phrase> we published four reports and copies are available in the House Libraries. These reports relate to: Target 1&mdash;Policy statements; Target 2&mdash;Provision of flood warnings; Target 3&mdash;Emergency exercises and emergency plans; and Target 9&mdash;Biodiversity. We are grateful to the Environment Agency for providing these reports and to the other operating authorities which have contributed to the work which is being reported upon. The severe floods of Autumn 2000 created inevitable delays in producing these reports. Some other reports will be produced later this year, covering a two-year period. The high level targets initiative is designed to secure a more certain delivery of the Government's policy aim and objectives for flood and coastal defence. In the difficult circumstances of the past year or so the results being reported today are encouraging though they do point to the need for further work to be done, including by some operating authorities, to offer a more consistent approach to service delivery. On target 1, we are pleased that the great majority of operating authorities have produced a suitable statement of their policy towards flood and coastal defence. While there is a significant minority of local authorities which have not produced statements, many of them are understood to have little or no flood and coastal defence responsibilities. Nevertheless there are some local authorities who have more significant responsibilities and we will be working with the Environment Agency and Local Government Association in encouraging them to produce statements. On target 2, I note that overall some two-thirds of the Environment Agency's severe flood warnings were issued in accordance with their service standards. This is encouraging especially in the face of the severe demands of the 2000 floods. The agency nevertheless recognise that there is room for improvement and are working on a new investment strategy. It is also worth recording that since autumn 2000 a further 322,000 properties are covered by the agency's flood warning arrangements. On target 3, programmes of emergency exercises were disrupted by the 2000 floods, foot and mouth disease and, to some extent, the events of September 11. Nevertheless, 22 emergency exercises were carried out in 2001 and lessons learned from them are identified in the report; 27 local or regional exercises are planned for this year and a national exercise is planned for 2003. We are also pleased to note that good progress has been made in ensuring that local emergency plans cover flooding and that there are arrangements in hand for these to be reviewed, particularly to cover the local sources of flooding and provision of sandbags. On target 9, the report shows that flood and coastal defence works have resulted in net gains in a number of habitats covered by biodiversity action plans. This work is often alleged to be damaging to the environment but the report provides evidence to the contrary. While this is very encouraging, work is in hand to ensure more rigorous collection of this information for future reports. We expect to publish further reports later this year. We will also be working with the operating authorities in reviewing the operation of high level targets with a view to refining and extending the initiative.</p>
