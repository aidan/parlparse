To be successful, this must include measures that will help build peace and create security across the continent. The Government believe that a legally binding international treaty covering the trade in conventional weapons would be an important step in tackling the problems caused by irresponsible proliferation of arms.

	<p pid="b.146.0/1">In accordance with Article 53 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the contracting states undertake to abide by the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The European Commission's 2004 regular report on Turkey's progress towards accession notes that Turkey has made increased efforts since 2002 to comply with the decisions of the ECtHR. Following the ECtHR ruling that the trial of Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan had not been fair, the Turkish Government confirmed that in this case too, Turkey would comply with the ECtHR judgment, and would reopen the case file to see whether the ECHR violations could have affected the verdict. The Turkish Foreign Minister indicated that any re-examination of the case would be conducted in a manner acceptable to the Committee of Ministers, whose role it is to oversee the implementation of court judgments, and who will consider the case in July. We will continue to follow developments.</p>

	<p pid="b.150.8/1">Professor Gorard did share his paper with us before its publication. Though the statistics from the small group of LEAs used in the paper differ slightly from the national picture, we do accept that factors other than just prior attainment affect pupil outcomes (though prior attainment remains by far the most important factor).</p>
	<p pid="b.150.8/2">This is why we have developed a contextual value-added methodology which takes into account those other factors which are outside a school's control, for example, levels of deprivation and gender. The prototype model is currently available for use by schools in their self-evaluation via the department's pupil achievement tracker. A further refined model will be used this year in an achievement and attainment tables pilot which, if successful, will see a contextualised 11-16 value-added measure published for all secondary schools in the 2006 tables.</p>

For the same period, total generation (UK electricity production less pumped storage) was 398.8 TWh.

The consultation raised no new issues not already considered by the CSM when its advice to make the medicine available over the counter was formulated.

To ensure complete transparency, the MHRA will publish on its website a full list of the responses received to all future reclassification consultations, together with links to the full text of those responses, except where a particular respondent withholds consent. The agency will also avoid summaries in terms of numbers of responses, reflecting the fact that the main purpose of consultation is to identify any new issues of substance not already considered to be addressed.</p>
