	<p pid="a.1.2/1">Subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimates for Class II, Votes 1 and 4, the overall Departmental Expenditure Limit for Class II, which includes the Department of Health and the Foods Standard Agency, will be increased by &pound;61,213,000 from &pound;45,029,542,000 to &pound;45,090,755,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">Of this increase, the Department of Health Departmental Expenditure limit for 2000-01 will be increased by &pound;49,616,000 from &pound;44,948,272,000 to &pound;44,997,888,000. The increase is the net effect of changes to Class II, Vote 1 (Hospital, community health, family health and related services, England) of &pound;48,357,000 made up &pound;50,000,000 from HM Treasury's Capital Modernisation Fund for Modernising Coronary Heart Disease services. In addition the following transfers will take place; &pound;1,357,000 from the Scottish Executive &pound;47,000 for the High Security Infectious Diseases Unit and &pound;1,310,000 for Out of Area Treatments. The overall increase is partially offset by a transfer of &pound;3,000,000 to Class 1, Vote 1 (Department for Education and Employment) for the Queen Mary Westfield Tomlinson merger.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">An increase of &pound;1,256,000 for Class II, Vote 2 (Department of Health, administration, miscellaneous health and personal social services, England) is the net effect of transfers (detailed below) and &pound;6,500,000 take-up of end year flexibility (as set out in Table 7 of the Public Expenditure Outturn White Paper Cm 4812 published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-18">18 July 2000</phrase>) and &pound;1,795,000 (running costs) from the Civil Service Modernisation Fund, transfers of &pound;75,000 (running costs) from Class IX, Vote 2 (Department of Trade and Industry: science) for the human genetics commission and &pound;36,000 from Class IV, Vote 1 (Home Office administration, police, immigration and other services, England and Wales) for central treatment fund pilot projects. The overall increase is partially offset by transfers of &pound;4,000,000 to Class 1, Vote 1 (Department for Education and Employment: programmes and central services) for the standards fund, &pound;3,000,000 to Class IV, Vote 1 (Home Office administration, police, immigration and other services, England and Wales) for unaccompanied asylum seeking children and &pound;150,000 to Class III, Vote 2 (Environment, Transport and Regions: Planning, roads, local transport and vehicle safety) for mobility centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">Within the department DEL there is also a transfer of &pound;11,837,000 from Class II, Vote 2 (Department of Health, administration, miscellaneous health and personal social services, England) to Class II, Vote 1 (Hospital, community health, family health and related services, England).</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5">The Department of Health's gross running cost limit will be increased by &pound;1,870,000 from &pound;300,620,000 to &pound;302,490,000 as detailed above.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6">The take-up of non-voted supplementary credit approvals for personal social services (DoH/LACAP) in England has increased by &pound;3,000 from &pound;18,700,000 to &pound;18,703,000 in respect of take up of end year flexibility entitlement as mentioned above.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/7">The Food Standards Agency Departmental Expenditure limit will also be increased by &pound;11,597,000 from &pound;81,270,000 to &pound;92,867,000. The increase is the net effect of the take-up of end year flexibility of &pound;8,366,000 (of which &pound;1,000,000 is running costs) from the Department of Health, an allocation of &pound;375,000 (of which &pound;280,000 is running costs) from the Civil Service Modernisation Fund and transfers of &pound;2,856,000 from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food comprising &pound;1,600,000 (of which &pound;350,000 is running costs) to cover set-up costs of the agency, which fell in 2000-01 rather than 1999-2000 as originally planned, and &pound;1,256,000 (of which &pound;1,125,000 is running costs) for the additional responsibilities taken on by the agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/8">The Food Standards Agency's gross running costs limit will increase by &pound;2,755,000 from &pound;104,835,000 to &pound;107,590,000 as detailed above.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/9">All increases will either be offset by transfers to or from other Departmental Expenditure Limits (detailed above) or charges to the DEL Reserve and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.</p>

The purpose of this document was to seek the views of local residents and professionals on three possible frameworks for acute services. Each framework involved the Princess Royal Hospital and the Royal Sussex County Hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">Written comments on the discussion document were requested by 13th October and the board is refining the options in light of comments received. The needs and safety of patients in Haywards Heath is one of its key considerations. If any significant changes to services are proposed these will be subject to formal public consultation before final decisions are made.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.8/1">We have given careful consideration to a number of ways in which the recognition of members of the Armed Forces who give their lives in the service of their country might be enhanced. In the light of discussion, we have concluded that the most appropriate would be the erection in central London of a memorial bearing the names of all those killed on duty and by terrorist attack since the end of the Second World War. In accordance with the long established custom for the erection of memorials, we would expect funds to be raised by public subscription. Further consultation will now take place with ex-service organisations and other interested bodies.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/1">The Prison Service offers a range of programmes that have been accredited by independent panels of experts against effectiveness criteria established in the light of extensive international research as being likely to reduce re-offending. These consist of:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">Reasoning and Rehabilitation and Enhanced Thinking Skills--cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at those at medium risk of re-offending with a high level of cognitive deficits;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">Controlling Anger and Learning to Manage it (CALM): a cognitive behavioural programme for offenders for whom anger and aggression feature as a component in current or previous offending;</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/5">Problem Solving: an offence-based cognitive skills programme aimed at a similar population to Reasoning and Rehabilitation and Enhanced. Thinking Skills, designed by Dr James McGuire of Liverpool University.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/6">The Service also offers a range of sex offender treatment programmes designed by the Prison Service to address sex offending, to challenge thinking patterns used by offenders to excuse and justify their behaviour and to teach new attitudes and behaviours related to positive, offence-free living. The courses consist of a core programme; an adapted programme for prisoners with learning difficulties; an extended programme for high risk sex offenders; and a booster programme for sex offenders who have already completed the core programme and are preparing for release.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/7">There is also a partially accredited rolling programme for low and high risk offenders who have undergone other treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/8">A Prison Service long-term reconviction analysis assesses reconviction rates of graduates of the programmes after release from prison against control groups. These studies will be subjected to external, independent assessment and the Prison Service will ensure that any other necessary independent verification of programme outcomes is put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/9">The data now beginning to emerge are encouraging but it is too early to draw firm conclusions at this stage from them.

	<p pid="a.10.5/1">As the noble Lord will be aware, consultation prior to the publication of statutory proposals is undertaken by the body publishing proposals, not my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. I therefore suggest that this Question is for Bristol City Council rather than my right honourable friend or myself. In reaching his decision my right honourable friend was, however, satisfied that widespread consultation was undertaken. As an illustration of this I can confirm that the consultation process included a community inquiry, public meetings and the circulation of 4,500 consultation questionnaires.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.6/3">The Government support the procedural convention by which the chairs of the General Assembly committees are selected. This in no way implies approval of the policies of the chair's home state. As is well known, the UK is one of Burma's fiercest critics in the UN.</p>
