	<p pid="a.157.2/1">Much will depend upon the characteristics of the firearm concerned, the target and the nature of the land over which the shooting takes place. For example, different considerations apply to the shooting of wildlife in uplands as opposed to lowland areas. It is also important that targets are killed and simply not injured or left to die. Different considerations again apply in relation to clay pigeon shooting. It is a fundamental rule of shooting that a shot should never be taken if there is the slightest doubt about the safety of either the shooter or the public.</p>

Increasing trade between countries will also increase the flow of investment, goods and services, helping to ensure that developing countries benefit from the advances in modern knowledge and technology.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.6/3">The group has not met since October 2000, following a decision by Adam Ingram to evaluate its role in light of the ongoing developments in the victims' field. The Victims Unit in OFMDFM, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's Victims Rights Working Group and the Civic Forum had all been established and the provision of core funding by the NIO had led to a growing number of victims' groups.</p>

The Royal Prerogative of Mercy has traditionally been exercised in three ways: in a free pardon, a conditional pardon or the remission, or partial remission, of the penalty imposed by a court. This is a flexible remedy, and the Government cannot restrict themselves as to how they might recommend its use. It is necessarily reserved for the most exceptional of circumstances.</p>
