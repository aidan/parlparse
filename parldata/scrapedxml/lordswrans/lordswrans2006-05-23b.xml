It is not a function of the Government to classify or to declassify any particular substance as waste or non-waste. The Government's understanding of the facts is that the EU animal by-products regulation ((EC) No.1774/2002) requires a range of animal by-products, and substances derived from them (for example, tallow) to be disposed of as waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-21">21 December 2005</phrase>, the European Commission published its <i>Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste</i> together with a proposed revision of the WFD. The draft revised WFD contains a proposal which would enable the Commission to adopt environmental and quality criteria for specified waste streams. Where these criteria are met, the effect would be to deem that the recovery of the specified waste had been completed and that it had ceased to be waste. The Commission's thematic strategy proposes that, subject to the outcome of an environmental study which the Commission is currently undertaking, the waste streams addressed by this system should include the use of tallow as a fuel.</p>
