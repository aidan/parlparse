	<p pid="a.55.2/1">We remain deeply concerned about the restrictions on freedom of movement for Palestinians into and within the Occupied Territories. These restrictions include the imposition of curfews, the construction of the barrier and tight access controls including permits and identity cards.

My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary and I have raised our concerns with the Israeli Government and the Israeli ambassador in London. Our ambassador in Tel Aviv has also raised these issues with the Israeli authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.8/1">We do not consider there is a need to introduce similar offences in England and Wales for attacks on workers in specific sectors. All assaults are wrong and the most important thing is that the severity of the sentence should reflect the relative seriousness of the crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/2">In England and Wales the maximum sentence for assault is up to six months' imprisonment, and or a fine of up to &pound;5,000. Where more serious injuries are suffered the more serious assault charges of causing actual bodily harm (maximum sentence of five years), and grievous bodily harm or wounding with intent (maximum of life imprisonment) or without intent (maximum of five years).</p>
	<p pid="a.55.8/3">Sentencing guidelines introduced by the Magistrates' Association establish a series of aggravating factors where assaults are concerned. These include whether the assault was on a victim who was serving the public. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 established the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which is charged with drafting and distributing a new set of consolidated sentencing guidelines applicable across all criminal courts in England and Wales. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure consistency and to require the courts to take account of all the relevant aggravating or mitigating features of a case. We expect that the guidelines will refer explicitly to the fact that a victim was at the time of the offence working with the public as an aggravating feature. We believe such guidelines are the right way to deal with aggravating factors in an offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.8/1">Regional spatial strategies (RSSs) prepared under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 set out policies relating to the development and use of land. The regional assemblies in the three northern regions are formally designated as regional planning bodies and are currently preparing draft RSSs. It is therefore the assemblies, in consultation with stakeholders, that will determine the content of those draft strategies. Draft RSSs will be subject to statutory processes, involving sustainability appraisal, public consultation and examination in public, before they are finalised by the First Secretary of State my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.8/2">The Northern Way steering group, of which the chairs of the three regional assemblies are members under Sir Graham Hall's chairmanship, prepared the Northern Way Growth Strategy (NWGS). This pan-regional strategy is based on an analysis of the north's economic assets, weaknesses and potential and how best to build on the north's strengths.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.8/3">The NWGS forms an important part of the context for the three northern RSSs and sets out principles which the Northern Way steering group considers should feature strongly in each RSS. The RSS will be a primary delivery vehicle for the NWGS and it is important that the three regional assemblies take it properly into account. The Government expect the spatial implications of Northern Way to be further developed, tested and delivered through the statutory RSS process.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.3/1">The distributing bodies for lottery grants make their funding decisions independently of the Government and consider each application on its own merits and against their published criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/2">The National Lottery has a good record of supporting mountain rescue activities. Distributors have given nearly &pound;1.8 million to ambulance services, mountain rescue groups and rescue groups for missing and injured people, including &pound;272,884 awarded over four years to the Mountain Rescue Council of England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/3">The National Lottery is a huge success story&mdash;over &pound;16 billion has been raised for good causes. Current reforms proposed by the Government will ensure the public are more closely involved in decision-making, and that it will be easier to apply for and use lottery funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.6/1">The demand for lottery funding greatly exceeds supply and overall around 64 per cent of applications to the Big Lottery Fund are unsuccessful.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/2">By way of comparison 61 per cent of applications from mountain rescue bodies and rescue associations have been unsuccessful. There are various reasons why applications are not successful. In the case of the community fund's Large Grants Programme around 5 per cent of applications fall outside the programme aims. In the case of Awards for All around 23 per cent of unsuccessful applications fail because other applications are given a higher priority for the limited funds available. Reasons for having a lower priority include a higher than average annual income or the applicant having already received one or more Awards for All grants.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">The information requested is not held centrally. However, the two national multiplexes transmit to about 86 per cent of the population of the UK. In addition, regional and local multiplexes have been awarded to cover 86 per cent of the population, but the build out of transmitters by the broadcasters in each area is not yet complete (the population coverage within a licensed area is currently normally between 70 and 95 per cent). A useful postcode checker for consumers is available from both the BBC and the Digital Development Radio Bureau websites.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/2">Responsibility for future plans to increase areas of reception rests with the broadcasters themselves. The BBC has said that it will increase coverage of its national multiplex to 90 per cent of the population during the life of the next charter.</p>
