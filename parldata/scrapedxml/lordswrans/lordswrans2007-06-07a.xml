These data highlight the importance of reducing deforestation as part of the global effort to combat climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/2">Developing countries can help to tackle climate change by hosting clean development mechanism projects. Unfortunately, the current scope of the Kyoto Protocol does not allow accreditation of projects that seek to avoid deforestation because of the risk that the deforestation would simply be displaced rather than prevented. However, the UK is working through international negotiations to find a solution that would allow the crediting of projects that aim to avoid deforestation.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">Public sector net investment (PSNI) includes all public spending on capital after accounting for the depreciation of the asset base. In real terms, PSNI is now at its highest point since 1976-77, increasing from 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2000 to an expected level of 2&amp;frac14; per cent of GDP in the forthcoming spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/2">Much of this increased investment has been focused on those areas with large amounts of infrastructure in order to address backlogs from previous underinvestment. Between 2001-02 and 2007-08 central government capital expenditure on:</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/3">transport has more than trebled, from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;5 billion;education has more than doubled, from &pound;1 billion to &pound;2.2 billion;science and technology has more than doubled, from &pound;280 million to &pound;610 million; andenvironmental protection has more than trebled, from &pound;360 million to &pound;1.1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/4">In addition to increasing public sector investment, the recent planning White Paper outlines new procedures to eliminate barriers or disincentives for private sector investment in infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/5">First, Ministers will issue national policy statements about the infrastructure that the country needs for the next 10 to 25 years. Secondly, we are replacing the sometimes overlapping &quot;consent regimes&quot; for major infrastructure projects with a single system. This will provide a clearer and more accessible application process than at present. Thirdly, we propose to create a new, independent infrastructure planning commission to oversee the planning inquiry process on specific major developments and take the final decisions on whether they should go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/6">These new procedures, set out in the White Paper, and the increase of investment over the past decade will help the public and private sectors to ensure that infrastructure is adequately maintained and expanded over future years to meet the country's social and economic needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.0/1">The Government are committed to a ban on reproductive cloning, and nothing in the draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill is intended to permit it. Provisions in the draft Bill, however, supersede the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001, which was introduced to prevent reproductive cloning. In updating the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, the draft Bill now prohibits reproductive cloning so the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 is accordingly repealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/2">The Bill has been published in draft for pre-legislative scrutiny by a parliamentary committee. Clause 16(5) introduces new Section 3ZA into the 1990 Act and defines which eggs and embryos can be placed in a woman. Only permitted eggs and embryos can be used in treatment. This excludes embryos created by reproductive cloning techniques.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/3">New Section 3ZA(5) allows for regulations to include, in the category of permitted eggs and/or embryos, those which have had applied to them in prescribed circumstances a prescribed process designed to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial disease. Any such regulations would be subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses.</p>

However, it is not a panacea, and great care must be taken that species are matched to the right ecosystem and that harmful non-native species are not inadvertently introduced. Improvement of the aquatic environment is often a more sustainable course of action than stocking. Permission to introduce any fish into English or Welsh inland waters must be sought from the Environment Agency, prior to their introduction.</p>

The 2007 Act will also make it an offence for any person to intentionally introduce live fish or the live spawn of fish into inland waters, or be in possession of such fish or spawn with the intention of introducing them to inland waters, without permission of the appropriate authority. Where the fish are salmon, and the waters are in a district for which there is a district salmon fishery board, the Act specifies that the authority shall be the relevant district salmon fishery board, replacing the current provisions. Where the fish are salmon but there is no board, or where the fish are other than salmon, the appropriate authority is the Scottish Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.2/2">The new procedure adopted since this event, as reported in the NDNAD annual report for 2005-06, is that all forensic laboratories which process individual profiles for police forces in England and Wales are now required to send weekly and monthly lists to the NDNAD data quality and integrity team (DQIT) of their individual profile records which have failed to load to the NDNAD. The DQIT checks these against PNC and returns the required information to the laboratory to assist in their resolution and resubmission of the load failures in a timely manner. The DQIT presents a quarterly trend report to the NDNAD operations group, chaired by an ACPO rank police officer, which shows the load failure rate.</p>
