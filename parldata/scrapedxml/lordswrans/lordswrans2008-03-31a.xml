	<p pid="a.128.0/1">A financial plan for the Armed Forces pension scheme (AFPS) is produced six months ahead of each new financial year. The plan estimates the various costs of the scheme using historical cost data from the previous year and increased to take account of any rise in costs as detailed in Her Majesty Treasury indices, as well as factoring in the variable costs such as members joining and leaving the scheme. Once agreed, the plan becomes the main estimate for the net cash requirement for the AFPS for the following financial year. However, whenever any of the assumptions used in the main estimate are at variance with actual performance during the year, additional funds can be obtained during the course of the financial year via the winter and spring supplementary estimates process. This is an entirely normal process that is designed to allow for unpredictable variations in factors such as the inflow and outflow of scheme members.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/2">The 2007-08 spring supplementary estimate for the AFPS sought an increase in the net cash requirement of &pound;150 million for the 2007-08 financial year due in the main to higher actual total terminal pension payments than had been included at the main estimate. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Defence in his role of accounting officer was advised on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-08">8 February 2008</phrase>. As part of this request, an advance of up to &pound;85 million was also sought from the contingencies fund to meet pension payment cash requirements predicted to arise before Royal Assent of the Armed Forces retired pay and pensions vote. The advance will be repaid following parliamentary approval to the spring supplementary estimate, expected on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-20">20 March 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/3">In the light of this occurrence, the mechanisms for estimating the cash requirement for AFPS will be carefully examined and any improvements identified will be fed into the main estimate process. All AFPS expenditure is subject to detailed National Audit Office scrutiny.</p>

A new national carers strategy is due to be launched later this spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/2">In the interim, to secure early progress on an issue already highlighted in the review, we are providing an additional &pound;3 million over the next three years to extend our planned Family Pathfinder programme, enabling selected areas to model and test better forms of preventive support around families with young carers. The main aim is to ensure that sufficient support is available around the person cared for and the family so that children do not fall into inappropriate caring roles. Over the next three years, the pathfinders will provide invaluable learning which will be shared across all areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/3">To build capacity and improve the quality of support offered to young carers across the range of local settings, the DCSF is also currently funding the Children's Society and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers to develop new, broad-based guidance on whole family working and good practice principles in relation to young carers. Based on that guidance, training and awareness-raising events will begin shortly and will reach all regions over the next two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.8/1">The climate change levy was introduced in 2001 as part of a package of measures to encourage business energy efficiency. The package consists of:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.8/2">the climate change levy;climate change agreements which entitle eligible firms to pay an 80 per cent discounted rate of the levy in return for emissions reduction targets agreed with Government;a 0.3 percentage point cut in employers national insurance contributions;enhanced capital allowances for energy efficient products; andthe Carbon Trust,</p>
	<p pid="a.131.8/3">Independent modelling from Cambridge Econometrics suggests that the CCL package has led to a reduction in costs for business as a whole. Because the package lowers costs for business, Cambridge Econometrics suggests the package will lead to a marginal increase in employment in the manufacturing sector.</p>

The initial results of this review have been subject to consultation with the relevant scientific communities, and the STFC is currently considering the responses it has received. The STFC has yet to take a decision on its future level of support for e-MERLIN.

However, clearly there are challenges ahead in feeding a growing world population, not least in developing countries, and doing so in a way that respects the limits of the world's natural resources. In the face of climate change, the UK is working with the United Nations, the EC, the World Bank, donor Governments and other organisations to improve understanding, globally, of the risks and impacts of climate change and how it may impact on food production systems.

	<p pid="a.139.11/1">The current rules for paying income-related social security benefits to people in a polygamous marriage have been in place since 1988 when income support was introduced. They reflect the fact that polygamy is only recognised in UK law in circumstances where the marriage ceremony has been performed in a country whose laws permit polygamy, and the parties to the marriage were domiciled there at the time of the marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.11/2">Contributory benefits based on spousal contributions are generally not payable where a marriage is actually polygamous.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.11/3">Any member of a polygamous marriage can claim a contributory or non-contributory social security benefit in his or her own right where he or she satisfies the relevant conditions of entitlement. There is therefore no financial advantage to claiming benefit as a member of a polygamous marriage.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.5/1">In contrast to dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were manufactured in large quantities and found a wide range of applications due to their high thermal, chemical and electrical stability. They were first produced commercially around 1930 and approximately 66,500 tonnes were manufactured in the UK between 1951 and 1976. Of this, around 27,000 tonnes were exported to other countries where it would have been used in a range of products. There are no figures available on quantities of PCBs imported into the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/2">Monsanto (Solutia) was the only known producer of PCBs until 1976, based at Newport.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/3">Commercial PCBs were manufactured by the direct chlorination of biphenyl leading to the production of oils containing mixtures of PCB congeners with between 21 per cent and 60 per cent chlorine. Commercial PCB mixtures were sold under a variety of trade names, the most common in the UK being the &quot;Arochlor&quot; range. While most literature focuses on only those PCB congeners with &quot;dioxin-like&quot; properties, sources will release a range of congeners, many of which will not possess such properties.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.0/1">Wastes are categorised as hazardous, non-hazardous or inert. Specific waste streams are then sub-categorised using the European Waste Catalogue. The term &quot;chemical waste&quot; is not a category that is currently in use.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/2">The Environment Agency authorises waste types that are appropriate for landfilling but does not normally authorise individual and specific waste sources. The Environment Agency is therefore not able to state categorically which of 1,500-plus operational and closed landfill sites (including Bradford, Milton Keynes and Abergavenny) in England and Wales have received chemical waste from Monsanto.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/3">Consignment notes held by waste management facilities would record the source of the waste. Prior to 2005, the Environment Agency was sent copies of these consignment notes, but the cost of extracting the required information from these records would be disproportionate. The Environment Agency retains these records for four years so would not be able to provide a full account of wastes deposited by Monsanto even if data were readily available.</p>

Professor Cave will advise Ministers on the scope to deliver benefits and drive innovation through developing competition and contestability in all aspects of the supply chain in the water and sewerage sector, and will recommend changes to the legislative and regulatory frameworks needed to deliver those benefits.

	<p pid="a.143.2/1">The Government are committed to tackling all forms of violence against women, and we recognise the difficulties that women who have no recourse to public funds face. We have been working within the statutory and voluntary sectors to find solutions to provide adequate support for this group of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/2">In February 2006, a letter was sent out from the Home Office to all local authority chief executives outlining the position of women who have no recourse to public funds and how local authorities can help and support these women within existing legislation. This was accompanied by a fact sheet, the purpose of which was to spell out the specific dynamics of domestic violence to assessors so that they are aware of the factors and circumstances that women can find themselves in.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">This was followed by an announcement, at the Home Affairs Select Committee this month, of a new scheme under which victims of domestic violence whose applications for indefinite leave to remain are successful may qualify for a contribution towards their housing and living costs. The proposals under the new scheme will strengthen the way in which domestic violence cases are considered, enabling those victims who are vulnerable to access additional support. Further details on this programme of work will be available later in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/4">In relation to women who are victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation, the Government recently made a commitment to ratify the Council of Europe Convention Against Trafficking in Human Beings by the end of 2008. This will enhance existing measures and provide victims of trafficking with support, including access to temporary residence permits.</p>
