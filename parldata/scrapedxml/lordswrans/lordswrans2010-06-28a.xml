	<p pid="a.219.3/1">We have no doubts about the validity of the 2002 Phase 2B Feasibility study which was conducted by a number of independent outside experts who won the open tender for the project. The report was drafted by the project team, checked by the project manager and approved by the project director. While the report concluded that short-term resettlement for limited numbers on a subsistence basis is possible, it also emphasised that any long-term resettlement would be precarious and costly. The outer islands, which have been uninhabited for nearly 40 years, are low-lying and lack all basic facilities and infrastructure. The cost of infrastructure and public services could become a heavy ongoing contingent liability for the UK taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.3/2">The European Court of Human Rights routinely asks parties to give their views on the suitability of cases for friendly settlements. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-15">15 January 2010</phrase>, the Registrar of the European Court of Human Rights was advised that the case brought by the Chagos Islanders was not considered suitable for friendly settlement as proposed by the applicants.</p>

Decisions on funding for existing policies and programmes are being reviewed.

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

This includes supporting UN projects within the judicial, penal and security sectors. The UK regularly engages with key regional partners to build relationships and encourage increased action against pirates, sharing the burden of prosecuting and imprisoning pirate suspects.</p>
