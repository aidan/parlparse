We will also continue to stress to the Indonesian Government the importance of a fair and transparent judicial system, and of applying the law in an even-handed way to all. In April 2003 the Indonesian Government accepted our offer of human rights training for Indonesian Supreme Court judges. Five judges attended a human rights training programme in 2003.
