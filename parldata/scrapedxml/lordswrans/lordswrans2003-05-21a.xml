Work on the building of the school was originally programmed to start in February 2002. Due to difficulties in obtaining full planning permission for the site at Purdysburn Road, Beechill, Castlereagh, it did not prove possible to meet this timescale. The issues surrounding planning permission have been resolved and detailed planning of the new school is well under way. It is estimated that work on site should begin in approximately six months' time.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.6/1">Northern Ireland fair employment legislation has been reviewed on two occasions, with reviews published in October 1987 and in June 1997. As a result of these reviews two White Papers were published. Fair Employment in Northern Ireland (Cm 380) was published in May 1988 and Partnership for Equality (Cm 3890) was published in March 1998. Copies of these White Papers are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.6/2">Following each review, the fair employment legislation was amended. In 1989 the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act included the extension of the law to cover indirect discrimination in employment, the introduction of compulsory monitoring by employers and the establishment of the Fair Employment Commission and the Fair Employment Tribunal. In 1998, the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 further strengthened the law and included the extension of coverage to goods, facilities and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.6/3">In relation to disability discrimination law, government set up the UK Disability Rights Task Force to consider how best to secure civil rights for disabled people and its report From Exclusion to Inclusion was published in December 1999. This covered both legislative and non-legislative issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.6/4">The Northern Ireland Executive response to these recommendations entitled Improving Civil Rights for Disabled People was published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-18">18 September 2001</phrase>. A report on the Northern Ireland consultation was published in December 2002. The consultation document and consultation report are available on the OFMDFM website: <a href="http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/equality/consultation/index.htm">www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/equality/consultation/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.80.6/5">Amendments to the legislation will be taken forward as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.6/6">The Equality Commission's strategic objectives and performance measures are agreed by government on a tri-annual basis. The commission will shortly publish its 2003&ndash;06 corporate plan. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland's annual business objectives and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by OFMDFM and are reported on in the organisation's annual report and accounts which is laid before Parliament and the Assembly. Non-departmental public bodies are normally subject to review on a five-yearly basis. Consideration is currently being given to such a review of the commission.</p>

This arrangement will be reviewed one year on from the cessation of scheduled passenger services to ascertain actual usage of the line for diversionary purposes. The review will consider the full range of options for the future usage of the line at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.5/1">DfID assistance for refugees in camps on the Thai-Burma border has focused mainly on meeting food needs and on UNHCR's protection role.We are not currently supporting programmes focused exclusively on meeting the needs of displaced people inside Burma.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/2">Financial assistance last year amounted to just under &pound;2 million. DfID is also providing support to refugees through the European Commission. In 2002, the European Commission allocated 3.5 million euros (&pound;2.5 million) for these purposes, 20 per cent of which is attributable to the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/3">For the financial year 2003&ndash;04, DfID's overall allocation for bilateral programmes for Burma is currently &pound;4 million. Additional support will continue to be made available for Burmese refugees outside the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.2/1">British officials paid a fifth visit to Guantanamo Bay between 21 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-28">28 April 2003</phrase>. The officials were from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Security Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/2">The purpose of the visit was to ask questions relevant to national security, to establish the identity and nationality of a detainee believed to be British and to check on the welfare of all UK detainees.The identity and British nationality of the detainee concerned was confirmed. There are therefore nine UK detainees in Guantanamo Bay. All were seen by the visiting officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/3">The FCO official saw all the UK detainees individually. US officials observed all the meetings. The FCO official passed family messages and mail to the detainees and brought replies back to the UK which have now been passed to the detainees' families. Detainees are able to send and receive mail through the camp authorities and ICRC. Delivery can be slow.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/4">The FCO official asked all the UK detainees about their health, medical and non-medical treatment, diet, accommodation, exercise and other camp facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/5">The UK detainees appeared to be in sound physical health. The medical issues raised by them are being addressed by the camp's medical services. The medical facilities available to the detainees are the same as those for US military personnel at Guantanamo Bay and are of a high standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/6">Overall, the UK detainees thought the diet provided satisfactory though repetitive. The detainees continue to be housed in accommodation with individual sleeping, washing and toilet facilities. They continue to have access to exercise, to practise their religion and to an expanded collection of reading material, which continues to include the Koran and Bible.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/7">The FCO official did not see or hear of mistreatment of UK detainees by the camp authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/8">The visiting official found the camp authorities open and co-operative within limits dictated by security considerations.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.1/2" qnum="HL2726">Further to the Written Answer by the Baroness Scotland of Asthal on 1 May (WA 120) whether they consider that legislation is necessary to give effect to decisions of the European Court of Human Rights where a breach by the United Kingdom of the European Convention on Human Rights relates not to a provision of incompatible domestic legislation but to an incompatible rule of common law.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">Legislation is not usually necessary when a rule of common law is found by the European Court of Human Rights to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, because the common law can be corrected by UK judges in the light of the judgment of the European Court. Under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act, a court or tribunal is bound to act compatibly with the convention rights unless prevented by primary legislation.</p>
