The contract identifies load carrying capacity, included within the contractually binding performance guarantees. As has been widely reported, the target design weight has increased since contract signature. The impact of this weight growth is constantly assessed against the performance guarantees to ensure that no degradation in operational performance occurs. A400M is forecast to meet these performance guarantees as specified in the original contract, despite the increase in design weight, including the maximum single load of 32 tonnes.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.11/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-27">27 October 2010</phrase>, over 12,400 businesses have been offered enterprise finance guarantee (EFG) backed loans with a value of &#163;1.27 billion, of which over 10,700 businesses have drawn down EFG backed loans totalling &#163;1.07 billion. By providing lenders with a government guarantee we are facilitating lending that would otherwise not be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.11/2">My department commissioned an early stage assessment of the impact of EFG on recipient firms published in December 2009. This research provides an assessment of the impact of EFG, associated with recipient businesses being able to access loans that otherwise would have not been available. The impact is assessed on a number of business outcomes, including jobs created and saved, impacts on sales and wider benefits such as on cash-flow, survival prospects and the introduction of new products and processes. The study also seeks to understand the experiences and the benefits for businesses receiving EFG loans, including the process of borrowing through EFG and the level of satisfaction of recipients.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.11/3">Approximately 60 per cent of firms reported the creation of jobs, either already or anticipated in the future, and 57 per cent of respondents reported that they had saved jobs, all attributed to EFG. In the 385 respondent businesses, some 1,870 jobs have been saved, 350 jobs have already been created and a further 550 new jobs are expected in the future, due to receiving EFG.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.11/4">The full report of findings is published on the BIS website at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/enterprise/au/research-evaluation/globally-competiti">http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/enterprise/au/research-evaluation/globally-competiti</a> ve/page38372.html.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.8/1">The links between disability and poverty are many and complex. Analysis suggests that it is not just the presence of disability which makes, for example, families with a disabled child more likely to experience poverty. It is related to other factors such as being in workless households or lone parent families. There is also some evidence<sup>1</sup> to show that disability is associated with changes in employment and family formation over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.8/2">The Government have made it clear that employment and personal responsibility are fundamentally important in tackling poverty. The aim of the new Work programme and increased conditions attached to payment of benefit is to support individuals and maximise employment. The Work programme will provide more personalised back to work support for long-term unemployed people and for those with more significant barriers to employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.8/3">The Government have also announced their clear commitment to disabled people by introducing a new programme called Work Choice, from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-25">25 October 2010</phrase>. It will sit alongside the Work programme and will help into work disabled people who face the most complex barriers to finding and staying in employment</p>
	<p pid="a.15.8/4">Work Choice is designed to help customers whose disability may result in them facing serious and often complex barriers to finding and keeping a paid job or progressing while in work. The programme provides specialist support where mainstream provision may not be appropriate or does not meet the particular needs of the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.8/5">The Government believe that the benefit system is too complicated and can encourage dependency rather than helping people into work. The financial gains from entering work are, at present, not clear enough and the complexity of the system means that some people think that moving into work may risk the security of their household income.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.8/6">Universal credit will improve incentives to work (especially for low earners such as disabled people) by a combination of earnings disregards and a single withdrawal rate to reduce the credit when earnings exceed the disregard. This will make the benefits of work clearer and simpler: encouraging people to move into work and see the financial benefits of increasing the number of hours they work.</p>

The preferred measure of low income (the poverty line) is defined as being in a household with a household income of less than 60 per cent of contemporary median income. The median income is the income of the middle person in the population. such that half the population have incomes below the median and half the population have incomes above the median. The median is used instead of the mean income because the mean is affected by outlying cases with very high income values.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.2/2">However, it was considered appropriate to restrict this right in electoral law to &quot;qualifying&quot; Commonwealth citizens.

The Government consider the funding for each election on a case by case basis and will make further announcements on funding for the referendum on the voting system and these elections in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/2">Under section 36 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, local authorities in England are responsible for paying expenditure incurred by the Returning Officer in administering local elections held in their area and for fixing any scale of payments for these elections. This money is paid from the revenue support grant which is administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Local authorities are therefore responsible for the level of funding of their own elections, including the level of funding for the verification of personal identifiers of postal votes returned. Funds for Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly elections are provided by the UK Government out of the block grant. For Scottish Parliament elections, decisions on the level of funding allocated to Returning Officers for the completion of functions, such as the verification of postal votes, are made by the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Wales, these decisions are made by Welsh Ministers and approved by members of the devolved legislature.</p>

We instead called for a freeze in the budget at 2010 levels. We also therefore oppose the European Parliament's suggested budget increase, which-while still representing a 6 per cent increase overall-is higher still than the European Commission's proposal. This is completely out of step with the very tough fiscal consolidation measures being taken not just in the UK, but also by governments across the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.5/1">The UK's decision to opt in to the draft directive for a European Investigation Order (EIO) and thereby participate in negotiations which will be subject to qualified majority voting (QMV) does not constitute a transfer of power from the United Kingdom to the European Union. The treaty on the functioning of the European Union provides an appropriate legal base under Title V for the Union to legislate in this area. This is subject to protocol 21 to the treaty providing for the UK to decide to opt in to the proposal. In taking the decision to opt in to this measure a number of factors, including the benefits of participating in the more effective arrangements which the measure proposes and the prospect of achieving the right outcomes for the UK through negotiations, were considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.5/2">Any new measure proposing amendments to the EIO after the current directive has been adopted would be subject to the UK's JHA opt-in and the UK could therefore choose whether or not it wished to participate in any future amended version.

	<p pid="a.26.9/2">From April 2013:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.9/3">up-rate local housing allowance rates in line with the consumer prices index rather than base them on local rental values;restrict housing benefit for working age social rented sector customers who are occupying a larger property than their household size and structure would warrant;reduce by 10 per cent housing benefit paid to customers who claim jobseeker's allowance for a period which exceeds 12 months; and reduce expenditure on council tax benefit by 10 per cent and localise it from 2013-14, giving councils a greater stake in getting people back to work and discretion to target benefits to local priorities, while protecting the most vulnerable.The following proposed changes will be achieved through secondary legislation.From April 2011:restrict local housing allowance levels to the 4 bedroom rate instead of the five bedroom rate;introduce caps for each property size to address excessively high rents to-&#163;250 a week for a 1 bedroom property; &#163;290 a week for a 2 bedroom property; &#163;340 a week for a 3 bedroom property; and &#163;400 a week for a 4 bedroom property or larger;remove the up to &#163;15 weekly excess currently payable within the local housing allowance rules to customers whose rent is less than the local housing allowance rate; andinclude in the size criteria an additional bedroom for a non-resident carer where a disabled customer has an established need for overnight care.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.9/4">From April 2011 to April 2014 stage increases in the rates of non-dependant deductions from April 2011. By April 2014, these increases will bring the rates to the level they would have been had they been fully uprated since 2001 to reflect growth in rents and council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.9/5">From October 2011 set local housing allowance rates at the 30th percentile of rents in each broad rental market area, rather than the median.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.9/6">From April 2012 increase the age threshold for the local housing allowance shared room rate from 25 years to 35 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.8/2">Since its launch in 2001, the LIFT programme has provided investment in the primary, community and social care infrastructure through a series of public private partnerships (involving the primary care trust and a private sector partner). In doing so, it provides modern, purpose-built facilities that, in many cases, co-locate services under the same roof. Across England, 49 LIFT companies have collectively provided 233 health, community and social care facilities with a capital value of more than &#163;1.9 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.8/3">A good example of this co-location is the Pendleton Gateway Centre (&#163;14.9 million, opened February 2009) in Salford. It brings together a wide variety of health and local authority services. This centre acts as a community hub, located close to local shops and housing. The services provided include two general practitioner practices (seven GPs), a fracture clinic, ophthalmology, orthoptics, podiatry, audiology, dentistry, mental health teams and a pharmacy. It also includes a Salford City Council &quot;one-stop shop&quot; for council services, a cafe, a walk-in centre and a library. It has a special focus on children and young people's services, including children's and adolescents' mental health and paediatric services.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.11/1">Under the proposals set out in the White Paper <I>Equity and Excellence</I> we will shift decision-making as close as possible to individual patients. Power and responsibility for commissioning services will be devolved to local consortia of general practitioner (GP) practices which will be overseen nationally and held to account by an independent NHS Commissioning Board. Primary care trusts will be abolished. This change will build on the pivotal and trusted role that primary care professionals already play in co-ordinating patient care, through the system of registered patient lists.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.11/2">These new arrangements are intended to transform the quality of care and health outcomes for patients. Giving GP consortia more responsibility and control over commissioning budgets will align clinical decisions with their financial consequences. This is an essential component of a more effective commissioning structure.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.8/1">Different inflation measures are appropriate for different purposes. In the case of benefits, pensions and tax credits, the objective of indexation policy is to maintain individuals' purchasing power in respect of the payment in question. As explained in paragraph 1.106 of the June Budget, Her Majesty's Government have decided that the consumer prices index (CPI) provides a more appropriate measure for this purpose. However, the use of CPI as an inflation measure for these policies is separate from inflation measures applied in relation to industry rail fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.8/2">The use of the retail prices index (RPI) for setting the cap on regulated rail fares is consistent with the general indexation approach adopted across the rail industry. Franchise payments, franchise financial models and network grant are all indexed at RPI. Similarly, the Office of Rail Regulation uses RPI as the index for Network Rail's revenues; namely, track access charges. It is also worth noting that RPI is the basis of price regulation for other networks; for instance, Ofgem uses RPI as the basis for regulating energy markets as does OFWAT in water rate regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/1">The Government have made it clear since coming to office that the victim in rape cases is their priority and have committed to publishing a full response to Baroness Stern's independent review into how rape complaints are handled by public authorities in England and Wales in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/2">In addition, the ACPO rape support programme, funded by the Home Office, is undertaking an evaluation of dedicated sexual offences units as per Baroness Stern's recommendation. This will help forces to understand the advantages of such specialised units and will support them in considering how best to use the resources at their disposal to ensure the best outcome. Chief constables and police authorities have maximum flexibility to make best possible use of resources and ensure they have the right workforce balance they need to deliver local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/3">In addition, we have so far provided &#163;2.2 million of funding to aid the development of sexual assault referral centres (SARCs) in England and Wales this year, and the provision of SARC services will also be a key theme in the response to Baroness Stern.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/4">SARCs are not the sole responsibility of the police, but should embody a partnership approach at a local level, particularly with the NHS which will already bear the cost of providing many of the services that SARCs offer. We will continue our work with the Department of Health to consider how we best support local areas in developing SARCs going forward.</p>
