	<p pid="a.301.2/1">In January 2008, the Government publicly consulted on proposals to replace air passenger duty (APD) with a per plane tax. These proposals, which included a new banding system, were accompanied by the appropriate impact assessment, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.2/2">Following consultation, the Government decided not to proceed with a per-plane tax, but instead to reform APD to create a new distance banded system. Further details can be found in the response to consultation published alongside the PBR. A copy of this document has been deposited in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.2/3">Ticketing systems are mainly based on national territories, and as such it is straightforward to base the tax on countries. The capital city is the most coherent and principled proxy. Calls for the tax to be based on the exact distance of flights, rather than distance to capital, would result in a more complex administrative system. In addition to the issues around administrative simplicity, such a system might be so closely linked to fuel consumption as to raise questions about legality.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.2/4">In line with Better Regulation Executive Office guidance, HMRC conducted an impact assessment of the new banding system and published it on its website (<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/apd-reform-ia.pdf">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/apd-reform-ia.pdf</a>). The assessment, which has been deposited in the Library of the House, states that changes to APD are not expected to have any significant impacts on race, disability, gender or human rights.</p>

Data provided by the Youth Justice Board indicate that, over the past seven years, there has been a 10 per cent decrease in the number of young people remanded into custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.307.3/1">&quot;Parent&quot; under the education Acts includes anyone who has parental responsibility and, for most purposes, anyone who has care of a child. There should therefore be no children without a &quot;parent&quot; with the possible exception of some young people aged 16 and over who are deemed to be capable of defending their own interests, with appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.3/2">For children who are looked after by the local authority (ie who may not have a birth parent who is able or willing to act in their interests), the Government have put in place a range of measures to ensure that their best interests are defended in the education system. The local authority has a specific duty to promote the child's educational achievement. It must also ensure that each looked-after child has a care plan, which must include a personal education plan developed with the designated teacher for looked-after children at the child's school (see below). The plan must be kept under regular review (at least every six months) and an independent reviewing officer (IRO) must be appointed to monitor the review process. The reviews look at the appropriateness of the child's education plan to ensure that it promotes their educational achievement. If the IRO has concerns that the local authority is in breach of its duties to the child or that the child's rights are being breached by the authority or any other person or body (including the child's school), then he has power to refer the child's case to CAFCASS (the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service) for consideration of legal proceedings to obtain redress for the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.3/3">Looked-after children are also entitled to support from an independent advocate when making any complaint or representation about their care, including education provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.3/4">In addition, from September this year, every school must have a designated teacher for looked-after children, who will take responsibility for ensuring that these children's teaching and learning needs are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.319.2/2">Disabled councillors who are paid a salary rather than an allowance, or who receive allowances other than reimbursement of travel, mileage and meal allowances can claim Access to Work support, provided that all other eligibility conditions are satisfied including being paid at least the national minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/3">For those people who are not eligible for Access to Work funding, other assistance may be available. People under the age of 65 who have walking difficulties and/or need personal care which results from severe disability may be entitled to the disability living allowance. People whose incomes are below the level agreed by Parliament may also be entitled to income-related benefits, such as housing benefit, council tax benefit, income-based jobseeker's allowance and income-related employment and support allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/4">People in receipt of incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance can continue to receive benefit if they are elected local authority councillors. For incapacity benefit customers and those in receipt of the contributory element of employment and support allowance, account is taken of the amount of allowance payable but benefit is affected only if the allowance exceeds the prescribed limit of &pound;92 in any week. In this event, benefit is reduced on a penny-for-penny basis by the amount that the allowance exceeds the limit. If a councillor is in receipt of the income-related element of 7employment and support allowance, a &pound;20 disregard is applied to allowance payments. There is no limit on the hours worked each week as a councillor.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/5">These special provisions for councillors recognise the particular obligations placed on them by disregarding such work for the purposes of deciding entitlement to benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/6">Jobseeker's allowance is a benefit for people who are available for, capable of and looking for work; we would treat any person seeking to become elected or elected as a councillor in the same way as any other person claiming jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/7">In the assessment of jobseeker's allowance, earnings paid to councillors are treated in the same way as other part-time earnings. They are taken into account and the relevant earnings disregard of &pound;5, &pound;10 or &pound;20 is applied. If a councillor receives a payment for reimbursement of expenses incurred while carrying out their duty, it will be wholly disregarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/8">Jobseeker's allowance is not normally payable to people who work on average 16 hours or more a week (or 24 hours in the case of partners of people receiving jobseeker's allowance). However, the hours worked as a local authority councillor are not taken into account when considering their eligibility for benefits. This means that people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance are not discouraged or excluded from becoming councillors.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/9">Jobcentre Plus works with a range of providers from the private, public and voluntary sectors to provide specialist disability programmes to help people with a disability or health condition, who need more extensive support, to overcome the labour market barriers they may face. Programmes such as Work Preparation, WORKSTEP, New Deal for Disabled People and Residential Training can be accessed through the Disability Employment Adviser (DEA). DEAs also have access to work psychologists to assist them in supporting customers if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/10">From autumn 2010 the new Specialist Disability programme will replace the existing WORKSTEP and Work Preparation programmes and will be designed as a single streamlined and flexible programme based on effective needs assessment and creation of tailored packages of appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.2/11">The Department of Health also operates several schemes which give exemptions from NHS costs, for example prescription charges, on grounds of low income or because of certain medical conditions or needs.</p>

Inspection reports are for licence committees to determine a centre's compliance with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, licence conditions and the HFEA code of practice. The reports focus on areas of compliance and non-compliance and, therefore, are not intended to be detailed scientific documents with a description of every protocol used.

	<p pid="a.325.0/1">In negotiations with the European Commission with regard to implementation of regulation 244/2009 concerning the domestic lighting part of the eco-design of energy-saving products directive 2005/32/EC, the Government successfully pressed for health impacts to be considered and for limits to be set on ultraviolet radiation emissions from compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). Since early on in the negotiation process, the Government have been in discussion with clinicians and support groups for partially sighted people and people with certain light-sensitive and neurological conditions about low-energy lighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.0/2">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) tested a sample of CFLs and found that some emitted UVR which could, under certain conditions, expose people above international guidelines. As a result of its findings the HPA issued precautionary advice on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-09">9 October 2008</phrase> to the general public concerning the use of open CFLs in close-working situations. The HPA's advice can be found at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;">www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;</a> HPAwebStandard/HPAwebC/1223445516605?p =1153822623869</p>
	<p pid="a.325.0/3">The HPA's research was considered alongside other available evidence to inform a report by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR). SCENIHR's opinion on light sensitivity can be found at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions/en/energy-saving-lamps/index.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions/en/energy-saving-lamps/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.0/4">In December 2008, the Government prepared an impact assessment, including health aspects, relating to regulation 244/2009. The impact assessment was published on the Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform website and is being transferred to the Business Innovation and Skills Department website.</p>

	<p pid="a.327.0/1">Section 89 of the Water Industry Act 1991 as substituted by the Water Industry Act 2003 requires strategic health authorities to consult and ascertain opinion before proceeding to make a request to a water undertaker to increase the fluoride content of its water supply. The Water Fluoridation (Consultation) (England) Regulations 2005 (SI 2005/921) make detailed provision about how consultation and the ascertainment of opinion is to be carried out. Regulation 5 sets out the pre-condition to a strategic health authority proceeding to request a water undertaker to increase the fluoride content of its water supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/2">Regulation 5 is in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/3">&quot;A Strategic Health Authority shall not proceed with any step regarding fluoridation arrangements that falls within section 89(2) of the Act unless, having regard to the extent of support for the proposal and the cogency of the arguments advanced, the Authority are satisfied that the health arguments in favour of proceeding with the proposal outweigh all arguments against proceeding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/4">The decision under Regulation 5 is to be made by the strategic health authority, not the Secretary of State. Regulation 5 therefore makes clear that it is for the strategic health authority to decide if the health arguments outweigh all other arguments taking into account not merely the cogency of the arguments, but also,</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the extent of support for the proposal&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/6">It is clear that, under Regulation 5, support is a relevant factor, but it is not the only factor or the conclusive issue. It can be outweighed by the health arguments. A majority of local support is not therefore a necessary precondition to the strategic health authority requesting a water undertaker to increase the fluoride content of a water supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/7">Government policy is not, and could not be, inconsistent with the regulations. In particular, it could not convert the reference in Regulation 5 to support as a relevant factor into a necessary precondition for a request for fluoridation.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/8">We accept that there may have been a degree of understandable confusion over these issues in the past. However, by way of clarification, the view given by the Chief Dental Officer in February 2008 that,</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a SHA cannot base its decision solely on a simple count of the representations for or against the proposal&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/10">correctly represents government policy. Regulation 5 sets out the law and government policy cannot and does not seek to add to it. It is the for the strategic health authority to take the decision to ask a water undertaker to increase the fluoride content of a water supply and to make the judgment required under Regulation 5 as to whether the health arguments outweigh all other arguments. Local support is a relevant factor but is not a precondition for a request.</p>

Many private providers within the English-language, further and higher education sectors had for years been voluntarily using the services of such bodies to quality-assure what they were doing. Rather than ignoring this, it was decided to use the services of those accreditation bodies that sought approval from UKBA, provided that they were found to offer an acceptable inspection service when checked by Ofsted.</p>

The UK Border Agency (UKBA) continues to work closely with the sector to address these problems, via regular meetings of the Joint Education Taskforce and its sub-groups, as well as through meetings and correspondence with individual education providers. The UKBA has listened to stakeholder views, leaking changes to policies and clarifying guidance where appropriate.</p>

The first seeks to estimate costs at a regional level (Africa, Asia and Latin America). The second is more detailed and looks at specific countries (India, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil). The global assessments will allow us to look at how much finance might flow from international carbon markets and therefore how much other finance (i.e. domestic finance or international public finance) might be needed.</p>

We are calling for all developed countries to provide additional public finance, over and above existing aid commitments, to help pay for developing country action on climate change. We are also proposing that all donor countries should ensure that they climate-proof existing commitments on official development assistance (ODA), and make available a small, limited proportion of ODA&mdash;in the case of the UK, up to 10 per cent&mdash; specifically for climate change objectives that also contribute to poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid="a.351.2/1">The proposals announced by the National Archives are supported by my right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor (Jack Straw) and the Minister of State for Justice (Michael Wills). The National Archives, like many organisations, faces significant cost pressures, driven in part by the need to meet the increasing expectations of researchers in the digital age and by the growth in numbers of people using its services. The Government are committed to keeping the National Archives' services world class, as well as guaranteeing access to its unique collection for generations to come. These proposals will allow the National Archives to offer its core services effectively and still adapt to the changing needs of its customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.2/2">The National Archives' five-year strategy, which has been also supported by honourable friends in the other place, is to develop its online services to support the widest possible researcher base. Last year, it supported the research needs of around 20 million people and delivered 100 million records online. Going forward, it will continue to invest in improving access to its records and expertise online by, for example, developing its online catalogue, continuing digitisation projects and launching innovative online tutorials. 174 documents are now accessed online for every original document accessed in the reading rooms at Kew, demonstrating the importance of using the resources at its disposal to support online service development.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.2/3">While the National Archives is proposing to reorganise its specialist staff teams, they will continue to deliver the same level and quality of services their researchers currently receive. The outcome of the proposed changes is that they will make it easier for these teams to work together to support the changing needs of their researchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.2/4">The National Archives currently opens its on-site facilities six days a week, and it is proposing to close on Mondays in order to allow some shift of its resources to support customers who use the service online. The Lord Chancellor and the Minister of State fully support this proposed reduction. Closing an extra day will allow the organisation to expand its online services whilst continuing to offer world-class on-site services. The decision was not taken lightly. Monday was specifically chosen as it is one of the quietest days of the week in terms of customer usage and allows the National Archives to continue to provide services to those who can only visit on evenings and weekends.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.2/5">The National Archives will continue to work with its partners in support of its strategic priorities. This will include educational visits offered to universities, including the services offered in Kew. It will be continuing to invest also in improving the services offered online, such as podcasts and videoconferencing. Equally, there are no current plans to relocate from Kew.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.2/6">The National Archives offers services to researchers both at its site in Kew and also online. At the Kew site, although the organisation proposes to close on Mondays, the quality of the service on other days will remain excellent. However, most researchers, whether academic or not, now wish to conduct research online, at a time and place which suits them. There is increasing demand for digitisation of material and excellent online services. The rationale behind the closure on Mondays is to allow the organisation to shift a higher proportion of its resources behind supporting online use of its material. The National Archives has already digitised, and provided electronic access to, significant amounts of important historical content, and is committed to doing more.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.2/7">The proposals will also ensure that the National Archives is best equipped to meet the challenge of ensuring that government records, which are all now created digitally, will survive until they are available for use by researchers in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.358.5/2">Customer demand at this office has been much lower than anticipated. After due consideration, we have taken the decision to close a number of offices in order to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. The last date on which Omagh will be offering appointments is <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-24">24 August 2009</phrase> and the office will be vacated shortly after this date.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.5/3">We have not actively promoted the location of the office in the community, because the office is for pre-arranged appointments only and delivers no other passport services. However, when calling our call centre, customers are offered the office closest to their home or work. Press releases were issued to local media when the offices opened and the address of all sites is on the Directgov website.</p>

	<p pid="a.360.8/1">The Government are unable to estimate the number of unlawful polygamous households that exist under Islamic law in the UK. Polygamous marriage is not supported or condoned by the Government, and it is not possible to contract a polygamous marriage that will be legally recognised in England and Wales, nor is it possible for anyone domiciled in England and Wales to enter into a legally recognised polygamous marriage overseas. It is a criminal offence for anyone knowingly to enter into a second or subsequent legally recognised marriage while still legally married. Any such marriage would be bigamous and void under our laws.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.8/2">If people enter into purely religious marriages in ceremonies that do not comply with UK marriage law, these marriages will be recognised by that religion, but not by the state. A separate civil ceremony will be required if the marriage is to be accepted as valid under the law of England and Wales. Polygamous marriages are not valid and a separate civil ceremony would not alter this position.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.8/3">The Government believe that the most practical and effective way of ensuring that people who enter Islamic marriages are protected is to encourage the registration of mosques and imams for the purpose of carrying out marriages that comply with, and will be recognised under, the Marriage Act. We are currently working to achieve this and to raise awareness, particularly amongst Muslim women of the formalities required for a legally recognised marriage in England and Wales.</p>
