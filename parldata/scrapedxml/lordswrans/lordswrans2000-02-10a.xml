	<p pid="a.105.5/1">While we have deep concerns over the humanitarian effects of Russian action in Chechnya, unlike Kosovo, there is no evidence to suggest that the Government have a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing or to create a humanitarian tragedy in Chechnya.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, visited Chechnya in November, and her organisation has full access to the internally displaced people in the region. During her visit Mrs Ogata said that the humanitarian situation in Chechnya would improve with better security and an enhanced international effort. This has been borne out. Russia has provided better protection for UN agencies, and international donors have provided additional resources--the UK &pound;1.4 million in all. In recent weeks UNHCR has estimated that up to 70,000 internally displaced persons have returned to Russian controlled areas of Chechnya from Ingushetia.</p>

Although the regime continues to violate human rights, particularly those of ethnic minorities, it is well aware that it cannot enjoy normal international relations until it addresses these concerns.</p>

While in prison each burglar is assumed to be prevented from committing at least three recorded crimes per year.

	<p pid="a.111.5/1">All 43 police forces in England and Wales bid for a share of the Crime Fighting Fund to recruit 5,000 police officers over and above the number they had otherwise planned to recruit over the next three years commencing April 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/2">The total number of officers which forces bid for came to 8,220. As all forces meet the gateway criteria set out in the Bidding Guidelines, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has, in allocating funding for the 5,000 officers between forces, taken into account the information which they provided in support of their bids.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/3">The table shows the number of police recruits each force has bid for, the number they have been allocated in each year of the scheme and in total and the funding each will receive in year one of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/4">The numbers of officers in years two and three are provisional at this stage. They are dependent on forces meeting the continuation criteria for benefiting from the fund in those years.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/5">Forces tell us that, without the additional resources from the fund, they are planning to recruit a total of 12,478 police officers (new recruits to the service) in the three years commencing in April 2000. Their estimates reflect the decisions they and their police authorities have made about the way in which they will use the resources available to them next year and the assumptions they have made about funding and budget levels in the two following years which have yet to be settled. The money from the Crime Fighting Fund will be used to recruit 5,000 officers over and above the number forces plan to recruit over the three-year period.</p>

The agreement provides a framework within which law enforcement agencies and prosecuting authorities in our two countries can develop their close working relations in preventing, detecting and investigating all forms of serious and organised national and international crime. It is an important step forward in combating the common threat from criminal activity both within and beyond Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.5/1">The information is set out in the tables. At the end of September 1999 the total number of police officers in England and Wales was 125,464. The number of officers in the 43 forces (excluding officers seconded to the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and central service) was 123,050.

The working group recommended that greater recognition should be given to the important contribution that civilian support staff make to operational policing. Civilian staff now account for 30 per cent of total police service personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/1">As part of the department's ongoing efforts to reduce overstretch in the Army, we are pleased to announce that a contract has been let to provide for less manpower intensive and more modern communications equipment in the Balkans. The contract, with BAe Systems, will provide for wide area communications in support of the UK's contribution to the NATO Multi National Divisions in Bosnia and Kosovo. While maintaining the UK's responsibility to NATO's peacekeeping forces, it will enable us to bring home some 150 Royal Signals personnel by the end of the year. It is also an excellent example of the SMART procurement initiative by demonstrating the advantages of working closely together with industry to deliver the equipment our front line troops need. The contract is specific to the Balkans theatre of operations and does not affect the Army's wider communications requirements. The cost of this equipment will be met from the Contingency Reserve.</p>

The PRILIF studies have included questions about family welfare, involving debt in terms of borrowing, use of credit and financial difficulties families were facing in the form of problem debts. Questions have also been asked about mortgage and rent arrears, difficulties in paying household bills, problems in the repayment of consumer credit, the use of financial services/loans and any consequent problem debts. Income support recipients have been asked about their use of Social Fund grants and/or loans.</p>

The recent publication of the Connexions strategy document illustrates our commitment to transform the support young people receive as they make the transition from adolescence to adult and working life.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/2">The information on young people living independently which informed the Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-20">20 January</phrase> was drawn from the Family Resources Survey 1997-98 and covered people living in private households. The information gathered indicated that, for those young people who were not living with their natural parents and/or stepparents, all had access to some source of income. The survey did not cover young people in institutions nor those who were homeless at the time of the survey.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.2/1">The provisions in the Transport Bill require local authorities to provide half-price travel concessions for people who have attained pensionable age. The Government take the view that entitlement to concessionary travel is not a pecuniary right falling within Article 1 of the First Protocol to the convention and that consequently the United Kingdom is not subject to the provisions of Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) in respect of the grant of such a concession. The Government have already announced their intention to equalise pensionable age at 65 for men and women over a transitional period between 2010 and 2020.</p>
