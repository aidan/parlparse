	<p pid="a.43.2/2">From the outset of the accommodation centre project, archaeology has been dealt with in accordance with government guidance as set out in PPG 16 Archaeology and Planning. At the site option screening stage, archaeology was one of many factors used to identify sites where an accommodation centre might be developed without significant adverse impact to heritage interests, to preclude other sites where unacceptable impacts would occur and to identify those possible sites where desk studies, field evaluation or other archaeological measures would be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/3">Archaeological desk and field evaluation studies have been commissioned by the Home Office for the accommodation centres proposed at Newton, Bicester and Pershore. Field evaluation trenching has also been undertaken at Newton and Bicester, and is under consideration at Pershore.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/4">At Newton and Bicester the results of the desk and field studies have been submitted as part of the planning notification process, and documentation for Pershore will similarly form part of the planning submission. In due course, if development goes ahead any archaeological investigations in advance of development will be published in accordance with government guidance and archaeological best practice.</p>

As part of this initiative an independent task group was asked to examine the scale of work-related road incidents and recommend measures aimed at reducing these incidents.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.5/2">The National Health Service has a duty to determine eligibility for NHS funding of care from a registered nurse in a care home. This is done through the directions issued by the Secretary of State for Health and the practice guide and workbook that explains how the registered nursing care contribution should be carried out by nurses, rather than through the model contract. There are no current plans to amend the workbook. If someone disagrees with the decision to place someone in a particular band, they can ask for a review to be undertaken. Ultimately, people also have access to a local continuing care panel to consider this further if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/3">People who are currently supported by a local authority, to whom NHS funding will be extended from April 2003, will have the benefit of NHS involvement in their care and improved access to other NHS services. The directions to the NHS that currently apply to those who fund the costs of their care themselves will be amended prior to April 2003 to reflect the NHS's new funding responsibilities for residents receiving care from registered nurses in care homes who are also supported by local authorities.</p>
