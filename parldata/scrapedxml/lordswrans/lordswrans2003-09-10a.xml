	<p pid="a.124.2/1">On the basis of monitoring information gathered by a number of government departments since the 1960s, I am satisfied that water quality in Lough Neagh is being maintained at a sufficiently high quality for use as a potable water supply, to sustain a commercial fish population, and to support a range of recreational activities. However, specific water quality problems, mainly related to enrichment by plant nutrients from agricultural and urban sources within the catchment area of the lough, have been identified. These probems have led to a number of cross-departmental actions aimed at preventing further deterioration and achieving improvements in water quality, where possible. A nutrient control strategy, designed to co-ordinate activities in this area, will be issued by the Department of the Environment's Environment and Heritage Service by the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.8/1">The Government are committed to maintaining effective immigration control while at the same time ensuring that genuine passengers are able to pass through our ports with the least possible inconvenience.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.8/2">An essential part of our effort to maintain effective immigration control is to prevent passengers entering or remaining in the United Kingdom using forged documents. We have therefore been working with our EU colleagues on a new secure vignette to be used when people are granted permission to remain in this country. The new vignette, which will be placed in the holder's passport, follows a common EU-wide format allowing easy identification across the whole EU. This does not alter the conditions on which a person may enter the UK, or allow those people granted permission to remain in other EU countries to come to the UK. The vignette is solely a uniform and secure way of granting people permission to remain within each member state of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.8/3">The new common format permit will be introduced in the UK from mid-September 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.8/4">In parallel with this initiative we are introducing changes to the Immigration Rules which will require non-EEA nationals who wish to come to the UK for more than six months to obtain an entry clearance before travelling here. The entry clearance will be obtained from a British diplomatic mission overseas. This change reflects the need to manage the flow of passengers through UK ports effectively and at the same time to provide a first class service to travellers. By introducing this change we intend to streamline the service provided to people who are coming to the UK. For people who are coming to this country for more than six months we do not believe that applying for entry clearance in advance of travel will prove an unreasonable burden. This approach will provide the best service to passengers and allows for the most efficient use of our resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.8/5">It is our intention that the new entry clearance arrangements will be introduced in stages over a two-year period. The first stage will involve introducing this requirement for nationals of 10 countries and will come into force from <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-13">13 November 2003</phrase>. We will be publicising this change in advance but recognise that there may be some passengers who are not aware of this change. There will therefore be transition arrangements to ensure that genuine passengers are not unduly inconvenienced. A &quot;grace period&quot; will operate until 23.59 p.m. on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-13">13 January 2004</phrase>, during which any passenger who arrives at a UK port, and would qualify for entry except for the absence of the necessary entry clearance, will be admitted.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.5/1">The Health Protection Agency was established as a special health authority on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year and works in partnership with the National Radiological Protection Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/2">As announced in November 2002, we intend to introduce legislation to establish the agency as a non-departmental public body as soon as parliamentary time allows. We intend that the non-departmental public body will take responsibility for the National Health Service Act functions currently discharged by the special health authority (which will be wound up) and for the other functions identified in the consultation paper Health Protection: A consultation document on creating a health protection agency (June 2002). These include advice to the United Kingdom Government, the National Assembly for Wales and (should they so wish) the Northern Ireland authorities on radiation protection. Detailed arrangements for the non-departmental public body will be set out in the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/3">The Scottish Executive has conducted a separate consultation exercise on future arrangements for health protection in Scotland. Decisions in the light of this, including any implications they have for the functions to be given to the Health Protection Agency, will be announced in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.5/1">There are no plans to review the provision for fieldwork within science GCSE or A-level. The existing science national curriculum at key stages 1 to 4, together with current GCSE and A-level syllabuses, encourages fieldwork. There is also a pilot at A-level which places particular emphasis on it. Additionally, all primary and secondary schools are required to make provision for fieldwork for all pupils as part of the geography curriculum. The department has considered the document Teaching Biology Outside the Classroom: is it heading for extinction? published by the Field Studies Council and the British Ecological Society. No assessment has been made of the implications for environmental awareness through pupils' access to fieldwork as part of the science and biology curriculum. The department does not collect information centrally about the provision of science or biology fieldwork opportunities for pupils. Growing Schools encourages schools to use the &quot;outdoor classroom&quot; as a resource in all subjects including science. The chief executive of the Field Studies Council and a representative of the National Association of Field Studies Officers are members of the Growing Schools National Advisory Group.</p>
