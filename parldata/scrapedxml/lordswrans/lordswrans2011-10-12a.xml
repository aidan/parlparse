Indications should be clear, accurate, unambiguous and easily identifiable as applying to the currency in question. Our advice to consumers is that this is a competitive market and they should shop around to find the best deal for them, whether a business charges a commission or chooses to offer a higher rate of exchange instead. Bureaux de change, like other businesses dealing with consumers, are subject to the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, which make it a criminal offence to mislead consumers as to the price of services or goods.</p>

The new minimum standard for those with insulin-treated diabetes who drive cars and motorcycles has been in place in GB since then.

	<p pid="a.240.2/2">While we fully support the principles in the new International Labour Organisation convention concerning decent work for domestic workers, the Government have no plans to ratify it. This is because the final text would not provide sufficient flexibility to meet the UK's needs in a few areas, including health and safety law, where the UK differentiates for good reason between domestic workers and other workers. For example, the Government do not consider it proportionate or practical to extend criminal health and safety law, including inspections, to private households employing domestic workers. This would place a huge regulatory and administrative burden on individuals, and could have detrimental social consequences: for example, if increased burdens were to prevent elderly or disabled individuals from employing nurses or carers in their own homes.</p>
