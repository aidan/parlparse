	<p pid="a.59.5/1">Our embassy has been able to attend some of the many trials currently taking place in the national safety courts, including the trials of the 48 medical staff. Our primary concerns in the legal process have been the methods of arrest, early access to legal counsel, allegations of abuse in detention, methods of interrogation, alleged coerced confessions, the charges brought against defendants, and the implications that medical professionals may not be allowed to carry out their duties without fear of recrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2">In the hearings we attended, the judging panel appeared to give due attention to the points raised by the defence and prosecution teams. One key difference between the national safety trials and the civil court hearings we observed is that the defendants have had little chance to speak, other than to confirm their names. We have also observed that many defendants do not have legal representation until after the first hearing, suggesting that they have not had access to legal counsel beforehand. The Government have told the embassy that some defendants may have refused counsel and that the court has therefore had to appoint a lawyer at the first hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/3">We will continue to monitor the legal proceedings.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.2/5">In addition, care providers of regulated activities are regulated by the Care Quality Commission, in accordance with statutory regulations.

	<p pid="a.62.2/1">In my earlier Answer I restated our position that using income transfers alone is not the way to solve poverty and that a comprehensive approach is required. Thinking beyond income transfers to in-kind support is supported by the recent OECD report <I>Doing Better for Families</I> which highlighted that child poverty is lowest in those countries with strong service and childcare-based interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/2">Our child poverty strategy demonstrates that we are making a sustained, long-term attempt to lift people out of not only poverty of income but poverty of aspiration and poverty of outcomes. We have maintained funding for Sure Start, with a refocused core offer that supports disadvantaged families, introduced new grants for the most disadvantaged young people through the fairness premium and the 16-19 bursary fund, and our welfare reforms are also based on the principle that work is key to reducing poverty.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">The Witness and Victim Experience Survey (WAVES) was a useful source of information on victims' and witnesses' experiences of the criminal justice system. However, following a review, it was concluded that although WAVES provided valuable information on a subset of victims and witnesses, the department's future evidence requirements would best be met through alternative approaches, and the survey was ended.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.2/2">The main reasons for this were that the principal findings from WAVES were stable over time, and the survey excluded some victim and witness groups of interest, such as domestic violence and sexual offences, victims and witnesses aged under 18, and cases that resulted in an out-of-court disposal or remained undetected. The data collected from WAVES are still relevant and continue to be analysed and used. Alternative methods for measuring victim and witness experiences are currently being explored by analysts within the department.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.2/1">It is likely that the additional sitting week in October will disrupt works planned as part of the mechanical and electrical works programme, the purpose of which is to refit the mechanical and electrical building services within the Palace of Westminster. The contract for this programme will not be rescheduled, but the additional sitting week means that some work, previously scheduled for that week, will now need to be carried out when the House is not sitting and at weekends. It is estimated that these changes could cost approximately &#163;25-30,000, of which the House of Lords will pay 40 per cent. It is also likely that the additional sitting week will disrupt the programme of occupation for Millbank House, but the cost implications of this have not yet been quantified.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">The student proposals are estimated to reduce output because some students and their dependants will no longer contribute to economic output through work, either because they no longer come to the UK, or because their right to work while in the UK is removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2">The extent to which output is lost depends in part on the extent to which non-migrant labour fills the gap. The evidence from existing economic literature implies that there will be no displacement of non-migrant workers by migrants. However, it is not clear that this necessarily applies at a time when growth in the economy is less well established. If there was some displacement, the economic impacts would be significantly lower. The Migration Advisory Committee has been commissioned to research the labour market, social and public service impacts of migration, including the issue of displacement, and is due to report in November.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/3">The impact of providing housing for students, for example on rents or capacity, was considered but we were unable to estimate the impact this might have due to the absence of suitable data, and the complex way these impacts are felt.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/12">Sport England is a statutory consultee on planning applications that affect playing fields. This means that any planning application that affects a playing field has to be referred to Sport England for comment by the local authority. As part of Sport England's &#163;135 million mass participation initiative Places, People, Play, the Minister for Sport and the Olympics and Sport England recently launched Protecting Playing Fields, the &#163;10 million fund to protect and improve sports fields across the country. The programme will fund projects that create, develop and improve playing fields for sporting and community use and offer long-term protection of the site for sport.</p>
