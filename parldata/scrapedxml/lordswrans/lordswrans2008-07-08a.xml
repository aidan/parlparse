	<p pid="a.76.9/1">The interception modernisation programme (IMP) will require a substantial level of investment which will need to tie in with the Government's three-year CSR periods. The scale of overall economic investment is very difficult to calculate because of the complexity of the project and wide ranging implementation solutions currently being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.9/2">Given this complexity and the commercial and national security sensitivities, the precise costs of the programme cannot be disclosed. Further detail on budgetary estimates for the IMP will, however, become available once the draft Communications Data Bill is published.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">The development of low-carbon travel is an increasingly important theme to be addressed in the implementation of local transport plans (LTPs). Guidance published in December 2004 on the second round of LTPs, which runs from 2006-07 to 2010-11, encouraged local highways authorities to take account of the 2003 energy White Paper, <I>Our Energy Future&mdash;Creating a Low Carbon Economy</I>.<I></I>Since the publication of the guidance, a range of further research, advice and funding has been made available to assist authorities, particularly as they seek to encourage behaviour change. For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June</phrase> we announced a &pound;100 million investment package to pioneer innovative ways to increase cycling.
