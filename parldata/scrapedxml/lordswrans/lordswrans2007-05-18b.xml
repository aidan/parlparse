The mining code was written and is being implemented with the assistance of the World Bank and is widely regarded as a useful framework. The Congolese Government have created a commission to review existing mining contracts, which is supported by the Carter Centre and with offers of help from the World Bank and the Belgian Government. It has not sought our assistance.</p>
