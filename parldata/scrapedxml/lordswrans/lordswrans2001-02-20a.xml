Sir Anthony started his review on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">Thursday 25 January</phrase>. After an initial reading of the papers, Sir Anthony has decided that, in order to fulfil the terms of reference of his review of the application for naturalisation of S P Hinduja, it is appropriate for him to look at the circumstances of the granting of naturalisation in respect of G P Hinduja because the circumstances of both applications are closely related. For the same reason, he has also decided that it is appropriate for him to look at the circumstances surrounding the inquiries about naturalisation in respect of Prakesh Hinduja.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/2">Sir Anthony aims to complete his review as quickly as possible, consistently with the need to conduct a thorough investigation. I understand that on the information currently available to Sir Anthony, he hopes to complete the review by the end of February.

	<p pid="a.89.2/1">A criminal record is not necessarily a disqualification for service in the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) or any other force in England and Wales. Police regulations require a candidate for appointment to a police force to produce satisfactory references as to character. It is for chief officers to decide whether or not a conviction should be a bar to the recruitment of an applicant.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/2">In considering an applicant with a previous conviction(s), the overriding rule adopted by the MPS is that no one is eligible for appointment if they have been convicted of any criminal offence which if committed by a serving police officer would result in their dismissal from the MPS; would cause embarrassment to the service; or would create difficulties to the individual in carrying out his/her duties.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.5/2">The changes are the result of a review of the minimum standards applied to recruitment by the MPS Recruitment Task Force. They are designed to bring the criteria applied by the MPS into line with those of other forces in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.5/1">The UK air traffic forecasts produced by my department in June 2000 showed that unconstrained demand for passenger air travel may more than double by 2015, reaching approximately 340 million passengers per annum. Cargo air traffic is also predicted to grow. Future unconstrained growth is projected at a rate of 7.5 per cent a year to 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/2">We intend to publish a new White Paper on air transport that will provide a framework for the future development of aviation in the UK. We issued a consultation document last December on the future of aviation. This is the first major step towards the White Paper. It invites views and ideas on a wide range of aviation and airports issues that underpin our air transport policy. The consultation document does not specifically address new capacity at airports. We have commissioned a series of regional air service studies that assess options for future capacity. Later this year we will issue individual regional consultation documents on options in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the south west of England, the north of England and the Midlands. They will examine options for the development of a capacity at regional airports and include an appraisal of the economic, environmental and social impacts of these options. We are also studying issues in the south east and east of England on a separate timescale. The South East and East of England Regional Air Service Study (SERAS) is examining all options for the future development of airports in the south east, ranging from no development other than that already included in the planning system, to additional runway and terminal capacity to meet demand in full. This study will be followed by public consultation that will follow the decision on Terminal 5. All of these strands of work will feed into the White Paper on air transport.</p>
