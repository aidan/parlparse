	<p pid="a.167.2/1">We deeply regret all civilian casualties. The Government do not record figures for insurgent or civilian casualties in either Iraq or Afghanistan because of the immense difficulty and risks that would be involved in collecting robust data. The UN Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) released its own report on civilian casualties in March 2011, which recorded a total of 2,777 civilian deaths in 2010, 75 per cent of which were attributed to anti-government forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2">Throughout its military engagement in Iraq, the UK has sought at all costs to avoid civilian casualties and took seriously its responsibilities and obligations under the Geneva convention. The prevention of civilian casualties is of paramount concern to force commanders operating in Iraq and the risk of this occurring is minimised by the tactics and training of our forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/3">Protecting the Afghan civilian population is a cornerstone of the International Security Assistance Force's mission, and all British troops undergo comprehensive training on the strict rules of engagement. This contrasts directly with the attitude of the insurgents, whose indiscriminate use of suicide bombs, roadside explosive devices and human shields cause the majority of civilian deaths and injuries in Afghanistan.</p>

The Rural Payments Agency is considering a number of options, including manually validated payments for the full claim value, to help ensure that this happens in practice.

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2"><I>Letter from Stephen Penneck, Director General for ONS, to Lord Laird, dated March 2011.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking why the 2011 census question on ethnic group on England and Wales had five options for &quot;White&quot; when the Scottish version had nine options which included Polish, and has a different wording for Gypsy and Irish Traveller which excludes the word &quot;Irish&quot;, and how overall United Kingdom figures will be calculated and displayed given those differences. (HL7713)</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/4">In England and Wales the form and content of the ethnicity questions have resulted from extensive consultation with users and other key stakeholders as part of a formal consultation exercise on census topics generally in 2005, and a further consultation focused on ethnicity, identity, language and religion issues from November 2006 to March 2007, including a round of public meetings. This consultation aimed to determine not only requirements for information but also changing public attitudes towards the acceptability of the question among particular ethnic minority communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/5">In Scotland, a wide-ranging review of the way that ethnicity was classified was undertaken following the 2001 census, to ensure the development of a classification for use in Scottish surveys that reflected modern circumstances, met users' information needs and had broad community support. The Scottish Government worked in partnership with the General Register Office for Scotland to conduct the review. The result was an ethnicity classification recommended for use in Scottish surveys and Scotland's 2011 census.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/6">Some amendments were then made to the classification for use in the census in Scotland, following parliamentary consideration of the draft Census (Scotland) Act, in April 2010. These changes included, in the &quot;White&quot; category, the replacement of separate tick boxes for English, Welsh and Northern Irish, with an &quot;Other British&quot; tick box. As a result, the &quot;White&quot; category in Scotland's 2011 census ethnic group question has six tick boxes.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/7">While the National Statistician and the Registrar General for Scotland have sought to retain as much comparability in questionnaire design and question wording for the censuses in England and Wales and in Scotland, some small variations must inevitably occur to reflect significant socio-demographic differences and user requirements north and south of the border. The ethnicity question is a good example of where such differences have occurred in each census since it was first introduced in 1991.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/8">The &quot;White&quot; categories are broadly equivalent, only differing, in Scotland, in the addition of a &quot;Polish&quot; category-where this group form a significantly larger proportion of the ethnic minority population than in England and Wales, justifying a separate tick box-and a separate category for &quot;Scottish&quot; to provide consistency with the 2001 question. The omission of &quot;Irish&quot; from the title of the new &quot;Gypsy/Traveller&quot; group reflected particular sensitivities to the wording of this category in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/9">Consultation with users is currently under way to determine the scope and detail of the statistical outputs to be produced including those for a set of harmonised UK tabulations. However, although slightly different forms of the question are being adopted. the variants will, nevertheless, as noted in the White Paper <I>Helping </I><I>t</I><I>o Shape Tomorrow</I>, allow statistics to be produced which will be broadly comparable both throughout the UK and with statistics from the 2001 census.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.5/1">Light rail vehicles tend to be sensitive to lower quality track as they have less sophisticated suspension systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.5/2">In the case of the class 139 Parry People Mover, the wheelbase is short compared with the length of the vehicle and it has a simple rubber chevron suspension system that gives it a relatively hard ride. This vehicle has proven to be sensitive to features of jointed track common in secondary line such as dipped and misaligned joints.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.5/3">The Stourbridge Town branch had many dipped and misaligned joints at the time the class 139 Parry People Mover was introduced, although this was not a serious problem for class 153 single car diesel unit that had traditionally provided the service.</p>

We have used the approach in these countries of having an academic core as the basis for the English baccalaureate. Moreover, subjects included in the English baccalaureate have been included to ensure that all pupils have the opportunity to study such a broad core and that doors are not closed off to them in terms of progression to further and higher education. We very much welcome the Russell Group guide on making informed choices for post-16 education<sup>1</sup> that explicitly points to the value of studying these subjects.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.0/1">We are concerned that the number of pupils, especially those in disadvantaged areas, who receive a broad education in core academic subjects is far too small. We want to encourage more pupils to take these core subjects and to bring about greater fairness of opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/2">The English baccalaureate does not include all the subjects worthy of study. We recognise that study in other subjects will be just as valuable to pupils and we encourage all pupils to study non-English baccalaureate subjects alongside the English baccalaureate in order to benefit from a well rounded education. This is why we have kept the number of core subjects in the English baccalaureate small enough to allow wider study. Subjects, such as music, which do not count towards the English baccalaureate, can and will play a part in a well rounded, rigorous education. Achievement in these subjects, as with all GCSEs, will continue to be recognised in the performance tables as part of the A*-C measure. However, we remain open to arguments about how we can further improve every measure in the performance tables-including the English baccalaureate.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/3">We recognise the importance of music. That is why we commissioned Darren Henley's review of music education. We will respond to his recommendations with a new national plan for music education in the summer. We would encourage all schools to make opportunities available for their students to study music to GCSE as a valuable subject in its own right and to support those who want to progress to further study in the subject and to associated careers.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.5/3">A significant part of our development aid to Uganda is dedicated to helping improve accountability in the spending of public funds. We are helping the Government of Uganda implement a financial management and accountability programme (together with other development partners) that will improve the transparency and comprehensiveness of the budget process, streamline public procurement procedures and provide technical support to key oversight mechanisms, such as the Office of the Auditor General. We have also provided technical assistance to the Inspectorate of Government and the Director of Public Prosecutions properly to investigate CHOGM related corruption offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/4">Our development aid is now being targeted to support local accountability mechanisms and civil society organisations to work more constructively with the Government of Uganda, in order to ensure that corruption and accountability issues remain high on the political agenda.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.2/1">The big society presents a great opportunity for voluntary and community organisations as we open up public services and devolve power. However, we fully recognise that in the short-term many organisations may be concerned about potential budget cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/2">The Government have therefore put in place a &#163;100 million Transition Fund to support those organisations most reliant on state funding to make the transition to new opportunities. Successful applicants are currently determining how best to spend this funding to reshape their organisations. Therefore, it is not currently possible to say what proportion of this fund will be spent on redundancy payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/3">Spending decisions are a matter for local authorities. However, at the start of February, the Minister for Decentralisation wrote to local authorities to gain a better understanding as to how they are strengthening their ties with the voluntary and community sector. In addition, the Secretary of State said, at the start of this month, if councils were being high-handed and disregarding reasonable expectations, Ministers would take action. We are paying close attention to what local authorities, individuals and community groups have been telling us, and we are considering how best to respond.</p>
