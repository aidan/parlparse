	<p pid="a.128.8/1">We expect that Saddam Hussein will be tried before the Iraqi Special Tribunal, which is part of the Iraqi criminal justice system and is composed of senior Iraqi judges. The tribunal was established to try members of the former regime accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and certain other serious crimes under existing Iraqi law including the manipulation of the judiciary, squandering public resources and the threat or use of force against other Arab states. It is a matter for the Iraqi judiciary to decide precisely who should be brought before which court.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.6/1">Responsibility for the administration of competitions rests with local authorities. Section 70 of the Education Act 2002 requires local authorities to publish a notice inviting proposals for new schools where there is a need for an additional wholly new secondary school. The local authority has then to publish a summary of all proposals put forward, and any it wishes to make itself, giving all local people the opportunity to comment on the options.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.6/2">The Secretary of State is responsible for the decision on which of the proposals should be approved and has not outsourced any element of this process.

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">The Financial Ombudsman Service is funded by a combination of annual levies and case-fees. A general levy is payable by firms covered by the ombudsman service and the case fee is paid by firms in respect of each chargeable case the ombudsman service handles against them. In the year 2004&ndash;05, the ombudsman service introduced the policy of only charging firms a case fee for the third and any subsequent chargeable case handled by the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">Each year, the ombudsman service consults on the case-fee to levy ratio; for 2004&ndash;05, the ratio split is 70:30 (the majority of the ombudsman service's funding is, therefore, recovered by the &quot;user pays&quot; case-fee element). The case-fee for 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;360. The ombudsman service reports to a board of non-executive, public interest directors, who are appointed by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The chairman of the board is appointed by the FSA with the approval of HM Treasury.</p>

The figure of &pound;3 billion is a broad estimate of the amount overpaid each year across all benefits. This estimate is subject to substantial rounding because fraud and error loss is not measured continuously across the less vulnerable benefits. As a result, this estimate will not necessarily reflect the reported decrease where specific benefits are examined in isolation. The resulting figure is rounded to the nearer &pound; billion to reflect this uncertainty.

To help address this we have agreed with European colleagues a new directive requiring newly registered large goods vehicles to be fitted with additional mirrors. These mirrors will provide better vision along the side of the vehicle and also a better downward view of the traffic adjacent to the side of the vehicle.
