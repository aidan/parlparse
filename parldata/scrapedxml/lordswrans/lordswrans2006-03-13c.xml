	<p pid="c.187.8/1">The Pensions Appeal Tribunals did not find that Gulf War syndrome exists as a discrete medical condition in any of these cases. The decisions of the tribunals were received by the Ministry of Defence as follows: Mr Daniel Martin on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>, Mr Mark McGreevy on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-09">9 December 2005</phrase> and Mr Richard Hilling on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-22">22 December 2005</phrase>. The Veterans Agency issued an individual entitlement and assessment notification, which included the use of Gulf War syndrome as an umbrella term to cover accepted conditions which are caused by service and linked to the Gulf conflict, to Mr Daniel Martin and Mr Richard Hilling on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March 2006</phrase>. Mr McGreevy's notification will be issued shortly. The backdating of any increase in the level of an award will be in accordance with the rules of the War Pension Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.187.8/2">There are no proposals to contact every veteran of the Gulf conflict concerning these decisions. Where individuals wish to have the umbrella term included in their own case, the agency will, on request, conduct a review and apply the term if it is considered appropriate. However, there can be no increase to the level of award as the term in itself does not attract a separate assessment and individuals will be, or have already been, compensated for any disablement due to their Gulf service.</p>
	<p pid="c.187.8/3">Ex-service organisations are aware of the Government's position with regard to the use of the umbrella term. My honourable friend the Minister for Veterans in his Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November 2005</phrase> (Official Report, col. 129WS) explained how the term will be applied and that this matter has been debated in Parliament. The latest edition of the periodical Veterans World published by the Veterans Agency, which is widely circulated to ex-service organisations, advisory groups, MPs and the press, has also included a short article on the use of the term.</p>

	<p pid="c.188.5/1">Entry clearance and family visitor appeals can be lodged either directly to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) or with the relevant entry clearance post, in accordance with the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005. If an application is lodged with the entry clearance post, it must be endorsed and forwarded to the AIT as soon as is reasonably practicable, and in any event within 10 days of receipt.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.5/2">The current timescales for hearing and deciding entry clearance appeals within the AIT must reflect the time provided in the tribunal's procedure rules for international transit of documents, in addition to the time the respondent has to prepare and file the appeal bundle with the tribunal. These timescales are set out in UK visas' diplomatic service procedures and have been agreed with the tribunal. In non-settlement and family visitor cases, 11 weeks are provided; in more complex settlement cases, the time allowed is 19 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.5/3">At the end of these periods, or if the respondent's bundle is received earlier, family visitor and non-settlement appeals are aimed to be listed within four weeks from the receipt of the appeal bundle with settlement cases listed within eight weeks from receipt.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.5/4">The AIT is currently working very closely with UK visas and the Home Office to introduce improvements to the entry clearance appeals process, aiming to reduce the overall time an appellant waits for their appeal to be heard by an average of seven weeks, mainly by removing the need for surplus document exchange to and from the embassy.</p>

	<p pid="c.193.0/1">Since 2001 additional and replacement cardiac catheter laboratories have been funded as part of the implementation of the national service framework through two main programmes:</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/2">The Big Lottery Fund programme: an allocation of &pound;125 million to fund 90 additional and replacement laboratories. This programme formally ended in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/3">Treasury-funded cardiac capital programme: a national cardiac capital programme of some &pound;600 million to achieve major capital developments&mdash;mainly in tertiary cardiac centres across the country. Capital developments generally include a range of facilities that may include catheter laboratories, cardiac theatres, critical care beds, ward beds and outpatients facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.0/4">The summary position for catheter laboratories for each of the programmes is as follows.</p>

	<p pid="c.202.2/1">The UNHCR position paper on asylum seekers from Darfur issued in February 2006 sets out the general security, humanitarian and human rights situation in Darfur and for Darfuris living elsewhere in Sudan. The UNHCR recommends that: non-Arab ethnic Darfuris are granted refugee status; some form of subsidiary protection is granted to those not granted refugee status; particular attention is paid to vulnerable groups such as female heads of household, medical cases or victims of past persecution; and that the Article 1(F) exclusion clause may be applied in individual cases. The UNHCR's position paper provides a broad assessment of the situation in Darfur and Sudan more generally and we do not dispute that it presents an accurate overview of the general humanitarian situation and the serious social and security problems inherent in Sudan. However, asylum and human rights claims are not decided on the basis of the general situation&mdash;they are based on the circumstances of the particular individual and the risk to that individual. Every effort is made to establish each individual applicant's personal circumstances and full basis of claim before a final decision is made. We agree that particular attention should be paid to claims from vulnerable groups of Darfuris and that the Article 1(F) exclusion clause should be applied in appropriate cases. However, we do not accept the UNHCR's recommendations, based on its overview of the general situation, that all claimants who present themselves as non-Arab ethnic Darfuris should, irrespective of their individual circumstances, automatically receive some form of protection.</p>
