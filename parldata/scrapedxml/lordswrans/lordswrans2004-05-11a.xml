	<p pid="a.17.5/1">DfID has set aside &pound;56,000 for support to affected households through the International Federation of the Red Cross, having judged this assistance to be the most effective way to meet the unmet needs. Initial appeals for support are well covered, and while the UK was ready to fund the replenishing of disaster relief supplies, the European Commission has pledged 200,000 euros for this purpose.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-05-11a.19.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="19"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040511/text/40511w01.htm#40511w01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.19.0/1">The Government define the Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) as those assets, services or systems that support the economic, political and social life of the United Kingdom whose importance is such that any loss or compromise would have life-threatening, serious economic, or other grave social consequences for the community, or would otherwise be of immediate concern to the Government. It is not possible to give exact details of the numbers of computers and communications systems that comprise the CNI as these details are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/2">The National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC) was formed in 1999 as an interdepartmental organisation to co-ordinate and develop existing work within government departments and agencies, and organisations in the private sector, to minimise the risk to the CNI from electronic attack. While owners of CNI systems are responsible in the first instance for the protection of their systems, they are supported in this role with advice and technical expertise from NISCC.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/3">There are three strands to NISCC's approach:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/4" class="indent">investigating and assessing the threat of electronic attack;</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/5" class="indent">promoting protection and assurance within Government and the CNI; and</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/6" class="indent">responding to incidents and new vulnerabilities with information, practical help and advice on mitigating action.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/7">NISCC is able to assist organisations in effective risk management and assurance of their systems through information exchanges with the UK CNI and with international partners. Part of NISCC's role is to promulgate regularly updated advice and warnings to reduce the vulnerability of critical systems to attacks. There is of course a limit to what government resources can do&mdash;it is for companies and organisations to take prime responsibility for their own IT protection and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/8">Within that operating framework it is therefore not possible to give exact figures on how many Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) systems were infected by the My Doom, Netsky and SoBig viruses, or what the exact extent of the fiscal damage was as this information is not collected centrally. However, NISCC overall assessment of these attacks is that their impact on the CNI was minimal, and that they did not significantly degrade CNI systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/9">As part of its information exchange work, NISCC has well established and extensive links with the financial sector. The Government are not aware that advice has been issued by financial organisations to their security departments to cease checking for computer system vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/10">In terms of vulnerability testing more generally, again this is primarily the responsibility of individual system owners. NISCC is able to support the CNI in this role by providing the necessary support and information on current threats and the steps needed to protect against such threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/11">NISCC's work is spread across a number of government departments including the Home Office, Cabinet Office, Security Service, Ministry of Defence, National High Tech Crime Unit, CESG and DSTL. Anyone who is interested in the work of NISCC can visit its website or approach any of the relevant departments for further information.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/12">NISCC's staff is drawn from those central government departments that carry out its work. It's core staff is around 60. However, NISCC has the option to buy in technical expertise from other government departments and the private sector as needed. NISCC's annual budget for running costs for 2003&ndash;04 was &pound;5.15 million. Budgetary provision for NISCC is assessed annually in the light of the overriding assessment of the threat to the CNI from electronic attack and alongside other central government resource considerations.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">The speed with which a passport is recorded as cancelled from when the UK Passport Service (UKPS) receives notification of a loss or theft can vary depending on the circumstances of the case and completeness of the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">The UKPS will record a passport as cancelled only once it is satisfied that the correct passport record has been identified from the loss or theft reported and that the report is genuine. In some cases, such as those in which notification of the loss or theft is received automatically via the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, cancellation will take place well within 24 hours. In other cases, particularly if further inquiries are necessary the process may take longer. Work is ongoing on a programme to reduce the time between lost/stolen passport reports lodged overseas and cancellation of the record on UKPS's computer system.</p>

Such a punitive charge would be inequitable, particularly in a significant number of cases where it would penalise people who are already the victims of crime. However, passport fees are reviewed regularly to ensure they cover the cost of services provided and the next review in spring 2005 will assess whether a different fee should be levied to replace a lost or stolen passport.</p>

As part of its counter fraud strategy and as part of achieving its strategic objectives, the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) intends to share information relating to lost and stolen passports with law enforcement agencies at home and abroad. To this end, UKPS has been in discussion with the relevant authorities to provide data to Interpol and, within the European Union, the Schengen Information System.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.5/1">Sports college status has been used to accelerate schools' performance, in spite of the fact that a large proportion of sports colleges serve areas of social disadvantage (44 per cent have a higher than average proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals). Since 1999, the average GCSE 5+ A*&ndash;C performance of sports colleges has risen from 41 per cent to 48 per cent which means that sports colleges are raising attainment at a higher rate than the national average (17 per cent increase compared to 10 per cent). Other measures of performance also show that sports college status confers benefits in terms of improved school performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.8/1">The quality of petrol and diesel fuel is controlled by EU Directive 98/70/EC (as amended) with the aim of reducing harmful emissions either by controlling the quality of the fuel itself for example, by limiting aromatic content) or by improving its compatibility with emission control devices used on vehicles (for example, by limiting sulphur content to improve catalyst efficiency). The Government have undertaken research on vehicles to investigate the effects of such fuels on regulated pollutants, but has conducted no research with the specific aim of changing fuel parameters to reduce pollutants further. A summary report (DP 01/05/0515) of a joint study by the former DETR, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the oil industries research body (CONCAWE) to investigate, among other things, the effect on fuel quality on particulate emissions is an illustration of the type of research normally conducted.

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">The National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory includes estimates for 16 polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs), but 3-nitrobenzanthrone is not included and there is no data as to its emissions from buses. The Department of Health reviewed work carried out in Japan several years ago on 3-nitrobenzanthrone and indicated that no conclusions could be drawn from the data on its potency as a mutagen or a carcinogen.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/2">Nevertheless, PAH emissions remain a concern and the UK Government and the devolved administrations for Scotland and Wales introduced a new objective for PAHs into the Air Quality Strategy in 2003, based on a recommendation by the Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards. This recommendation is intended to reduce any risk to the population from exposure to PAHs to a level that the panel believes would be so small as to be undetectable. Evidence on human carcinogenicity of these compounds is based on studies of the effects of exposure to mixtures of PAH compounds. Setting health-based standards for individual PAH compounds is not currrently feasible.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.2/3">Information on current trends in PAH emissions is available to the public at <a href="http://www.naei.org.uk">www.naei.org.uk</a>. National emissions from all sources have decreased from 8,231 tonnes in 1990 to 1,944 tonnes in 2002 due to controls on emissions from industry, less use of coal for domestic heating and introduction of cleaner road fuels and tighter particulate standards for diesel cars and heavy vehicles. Total road transport emissions have decreased from 1,664 tonnes in 1990 (28 per cent of total emissions) to 1,050 tonnes in 2002 (54 per cent of total emissions).</p>

	<p pid="a.29.15/1">Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) can often be difficult to diagnose, both at birth and later on in life, as it can be difficult to isolate the effects of the syndrome from other factors, particularly those relating to general maternal health during pregnancy and other inequalities that the mother and child may have experienced in the years following the birth.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.2/1">The Government remain committed to ensuring that help is available to those who need it on charges. Currently around a quarter of all adults accessing general dental services pay no charges at all or pay a reduced rate, with the following groups being exempt from charges, that is a patient who was under 18 years; was under 19 and receiving qualifying full-time education; was pregnant; or had given birth within the previous 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/2">Help with health cost are available under the low income scheme to others. We have no plans to change these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/3">A working group under the chairmanship of the Department of Health's Director for Patients and the Public, Harry Cayton, was established to advise on a suitable structure for dental charges once a new contract reflecting the provisions of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 is implemented, breaking the link between the fee paid to dentists and the patient charge as is the case currently. We will be publishing our response to the Patient Charges Working Group in due course.</p>
