	<p pid="a.31.5/1">The Government's proposals for commonhold and leasehold reform were the subject of extensive consultation with landlords, leaseholders and other interested parties. The consultation paper on leasehold reform issued in late 1998 received over 950 responses, 77 per cent of which came from leaseholders, leaseholders' resident associations or leaseholder representative organisations. The consultation paper on the draft Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill issued in August 2000 received over 1,050 responses, 76 per cent of which came from leaseholders, leaseholders' resident associations or leaseholder representative organisations. These included responses from the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association (LEA) and the Campaign for the Abolition of Residential Leasehold (CARL).</p>

My right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and my honourable friend the Member for Exeter have all been intensely engaged on the crisis in the Middle East. We have been in close touch with the Israelis and the Palestinians, with the United States, with our European partners and the governments in the Arab world.

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">We cannot waive visa charges for visits by Romanian teachers and students under a schools twinning programme arranged by the Anglo Romanian Educational Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2">It has been the policy of successive governments that costs incurred in running a global visa operation should be met from visa fee income alone and should not burden the UK taxpayer. The FCO is also required, under a service delivery agreement with Treasury, to reduce the number of gratis visas issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/3">If an exception were made for the Anglo Romanian Educational Trust, it would put pressure on the self-financing visa operation worldwide, and go against our efforts to fulfil this service delivery agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/4">It would also be unfair to waive fees in the case of these teachers and students but not for similar applicants&mdash;from Romania and elsewhere, now and in the future. To waive fees for all such applicants would place an excessive financial burden on the visa operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.5/1">My right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Minister for Europe represented the UK at the fifth Ministerial Conference of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership process in Valencia. The meeting took place against a backdrop of high tension in the region. In these circumstances the presence of representatives of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and most neighbouring states was in itself a significant achievement. Ministers discussed the Middle East peace process, noting their deep concern at the current situation, the serious threat it posed to regional security and the risk of a grave humanitarian crisis. The Foreign Secretary held bilateral discussions with the Foreign Ministers of Israel and Egypt and with Nabil Sha'ath of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.5/2">The conference adopted, by consensus, an action plan including a number of initiatives to give renewed impetus to the Euro-Med Process. The Government particularly welcomes the action plan to promote an effective dialogue on culture and civilisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.5/3">My right honourable friends took the opportunity of the Valencia Ministerial to have bilateral meetings. The Foreign Secretary discussed the situation in the Great Lakes region with his French and Belgian counterparts. The Minister for Europe discussed the state of play in the Cyprus negotiations with Foreign Minister Cassoulides.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.5/4">They also had bilateral meetings with their Spanish conterparts in which they took forward discussions on Gibraltar. The Minister for Europe also discussed Gibraltar with his Spanish counterpart in Madrid on <phrase class="date" code="">18 April</phrase>. Our objectives remain to preserve Gibraltar's way of life, establish greater self-government, deliver lasting practical benefits and a stronger economy, and secure a lasting agreement on sovereignty so that Gibraltarians can enjoy security for their way of life. Negotiations continue. Our aim remains, if possible, to reach agreement by the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">Standard eight of the National Service Framework for Older People requires the NHS to develop a co-ordinated programme of action to promote the health and well-being of older people, including action to promote exercise. Local programmes to promote physical activity are already being developed as part of the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">To support the development of these programmes, the Department of Health published a National Quality Assurance Framework for exercise referral systems in April 2001. This document offers guidance to primary care and fitness professionals, who work together to offer tailored exercise and physical activity programmes to patients whose health would benefit from increased exercise, including older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">The National Lottery policy directions issued by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport require distributors to take into account the promotion of access to sport for people from all sections of society. Older people are a priority for funding in many of the lottery funding streams in place. So far &pound;1.3 billion of lottery funding in England has been distributed to 3431 projects since its inception. In addition, lottery funding of &pound;232.5 million has been allocated to develop a network of Healthy Living Centres across England. The New Opportunities Fund has so far approved and announced 113 Healthy Living Centres in England (correct at 17/04/02) and a number of these are targeting older people, and offer exercise and fitness programmes as part of their activities.

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">The number of doctors currently training as specialists in obstetrics and gynaecology is sufficient to provide around a further 400 trained specialists available to take up consultant posts by 2004. This is a significant level of growth, which the Government believes will meet the projected levels of demand for consultants. The number of consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology has increased by 187 since 1997, an 18 per cent. increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/2">The Department of Health has been in discussions with all bodies involved in delivering obstetric and gynaecology services though the Maternity and Neo-natal Working Group.

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">The Osborne Estates Acts 1902 and 1914 provide for the parts of the House in the personal occupation of Queen Victoria to be kept open to the public and the rest of the House and grounds to be used for the benefit of the Armed Forces and Civil Service. They do not provide explicitly for a convalescent home.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/2">We are currently considering with English Heritage a range of options for that part of Osborne House which was formerly used as a convalescent home. These include using the lower floors to enhance visitors' appreciation of the house and the estate; using the upper floors for holiday lets and conferences and opening the gardens previously restricted to convalescent home use. English Heritage is undertaking external repairs to the property which it estimates will be complete by December 2003.</p>
