	<p pid="a.85.2/1">My right honourable friend the then Lord Privy Seal (Baroness Jay of Paddington) announced the decision to set up a European Police College during her Statement to the House on the Tampere European Council on <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-19">19 October 1999</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, cols. 946&ndash;948). Other agencies were not covered in the Council's conclusions. A comprehensive list of the Council's conclusions were placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">(a) The European Police Training College (CEPOL) was established by Council decision (2001820/JHA) in December 2000 to improve police co-operation, to identify and disseminate good practice, and to develop and deliver training to senior police officers involved in the fight against international and cross-border crime. CEPOL has produced annual progress reports for each of the years 2001, 2002 and 2003, which have been sent to the European Council. The 2002 annual report marking the first complete year of operation was sent to the European Scrutiny Committee. A three-year report was sent to the European Council in December 2003. The 2004 report will be published early next year and will be sent to the European Scrutiny Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">(b) The Fisheries Protection Agency has not yet been established.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">(c) The Tampere 1999 conclusions cover the work of the body set up to draft the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. This work is now complete so the body is no longer in existence. The conclusions also refer to the EU Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), in operation since 1998. A Commission communication of <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-25">25 October 2004</phrase> has asked for views on the extension of the EUMC to establish a human rights agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5">(d) A proposal for a regulation establishing a European Railway Agency (COM(2002)23 Final) was published in January 2002. It was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-29">29 April 2004</phrase> as Regulation (EC) No 881/2004. The first annual report of the agency is not due to be published before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-30">30 April 2005</phrase>. A proposal for a regulation establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency&mdash;(COM(2000) 595 Final) was published in the official journal in May 2001. It was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-15">15 July 2002</phrase> as Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002. The regulation requires the management board to adopt before <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> each year a general report for the agency for the previous year and forward it to the European Parliament, Council, the Commission and member states. The report for 2003 was forwarded to the European Parliament, Council, Commission and member states in July 2004 and is available on the agency's website <a href="http://www.easa.eu.int/home/index.html">www.easa.eu.int/home/index.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.8/1">The <i>Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England</i> (published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-15">15 March 2004</phrase>) contains several recommendations to tackle underage drinking, through education and communication, and greater and more effective use of existing powers. The Home Office and the Department of Health are working closely in partnership with the police and the alcohol industry to take this work forward. The Government currently have no plans to use price as a lever to reduce overall consumption of alcohol. The strategy sets out how we aim to tackle the problem of alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.8/2">During the summer, the Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign focused attention on tackling sales to under 18 year-olds and underage drinkers. The campaign has continued during the Christmas season (<phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-03">3 January</phrase>). On <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase> new fixed penalty notices were introduced for the selling, delivery, and purchase of alcohol for children and individuals under 18. The penalty notices also make it illegal for persons under 18 to drink alcohol in a bar. Under the Licensing Act 2003 penalties for selling alcohol to children are also being increased from a maximum of &pound;1,000 to &pound;5,000. These increases are expected to come into effect in November 2005 at the end of the Act's transitional period.</p>

This was offset by a downward adjustment of 25,000 per annum that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) termed &quot;unattributable change&quot;. This gave a &quot;net migration and other changes&quot; estimate of 99,000 per annum. The &quot;unattributable change&quot; was ONS' estimated correction for difficulties in estimating emigration accurately and accounting for people spending part of their time in the UK and part abroad. This was revealed by the 2001 Census. ONS has since reviewed this adjustment and concluded that it is now not required.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.2/28">In 1998 the net international migration figures rose to 144,500 people from 59,900 people in the previous year. This increase was a result of more people entering England as well as fewer English citizens leaving. In 1998 the inflow of people rose from 298,700 in 1997 up to 361,200. The outflow fell from 238,800 in 1997 to 216,700 in 1998. The highest increase in net inflow was from migrants coming from the Old Commonwealth, particularly from Australia and South Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">Defra has promoted the deer initiative which is advertising to fill the new post of deer liaison officer for the South West. The National Park Authority is also considering the issue of maintaining a sustainable red deer herd on Exmoor.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">Defra recently announced its national strategy for achieving the sustainable management of wild deer in England, which is as much about safeguarding populations of native deer as it is about reducing numbers where they are causing problems. Under this national framework the responsibility for local deer management rests with local deer managers. The deer initiative will offer advice where needed and encourages the use of deer management groups to bring deer managers together to provide a cohesive local approach to ensure sustainable populations of native deer are maintained.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.5/1">The &quot;spend to date&quot; figure in the press release should have read &quot;spend to March 2004&quot;, as it did not include the figures for the 2004&ndash;05 financial year. The budget for the 2004&ndash;05 financial year is &pound;17 million, and much of this has already been spent, although the forecast spend by year end has been reduced to &pound;15 million.</p>
