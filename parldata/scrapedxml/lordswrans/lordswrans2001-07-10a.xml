Detailed information on the evidence laid before the courts in each case is not held centrally. However, the authority advises that all persons subject to complaint proceedings, including those prompted by Section 21B notices, have convictions for violence or public order offences, not necessarily connected with football, committed within the time-scale specified in the Act.</p>

We do not see a role for a joint committee. As I told the House in the debate on the Address, our proposals will be based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission (<phrase class="date" code="2001-06-21">21 June 2001</phrase>, col. 110). We will consider carefully all representations made within this context, but we will not allow consultation to become an excuse for excessive delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.6/1">Saver tickets are regulated and restrictions on their use are limited by the SRA. Train operators are able to adjust availability of saver tickets provided they remain within the specified limits. Since Hatfield and Heck, GNER has been running a reduced timetable and has withdrawn the saver ticket from the 0625 Skipton through service to Kings Cross. It was entitled to do this and may decide to reinstate the saver ticket to this service at its own discretion. Saver tickets continue to be available on trains arriving at Kings Cross after the business peak.</p>
