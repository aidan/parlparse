Thousands of leaflets have been requested by gangmasters and businesses as well as voluntary groups, trade unions, foreign embassy consular services and citizens advice bureaux. The leaflets are handed out by GLA officers during inspections and are small enough for a worker to conceal so that those who are not confident to speak out at the time can check their rights and contact the GLA at a later date.</p>

We oppose the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. The rate of executions has grown year-on-year since 2005. There were more than 300 executions in 2007 and 318 in 2008.

In December 2008 we co-sponsored a resolution on Iran's human rights situation in the UN General Assembly. The resolution expresses deep concern at &quot;the continuing high incidence of executions carried out in the absence of internationally recognised safeguards, including public executions of juveniles&quot;.

	<p pid="a.152.0/1">Information on the number of people in the city of Manchester who have received support from the National Health Service to stop smoking in each of the past four years is not available in the format requested. However, information on the number of people setting a quit date and successfully quitting through the NHS Stop Smoking Services is available for Manchester primary care trust (PCT) in 2006-07 and 2007-08, and for Central Manchester, North Manchester and South Manchester PCTs in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07.

	<p pid="a.152.0/8" class="indent">1. The Information Centre for health and social care collects data from the NHS Stop Smoking Services as part of the NHS Stop Smoking Services quarterly monitoring returns forms, undertaken since 2005 on behalf of the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/9" class="indent">2. On the basis that the clinical viewpoint tends to be that a client should not be counted as a 'failure' if he/she has smoked in the difficult first days after the quit date, a client is counted as having successfully quit smoking if he/she has not smoked at all since two weeks after the quit date. The four-week follow-up (and Carbon Monoxide (CO) validation, if appropriate) must be completed within six weeks of the quit date. Persons not contacted within this time are treated as lost to follow-up for evaluation purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/10" class="indent">3. Only people who set a quit date through the NHS Stop Smoking Services are included in the quarterly monitoring returns; those who attend the service but do not set a quit date are therefore excluded.</p>

This is incorrect. Following the judgment by the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-22">22 October 2008</phrase>, all visitors to the territory require a permit. The BIOT Administration have asked the British consulate-general to amend its list.</p>

Each yacht has to apply for a permit in advance from the BIOT Administration.
