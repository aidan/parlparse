	<p pid="a.164.9/1">Studies of the impacts of aircraft exhaust emissions on the upper atmosphere have been undertaken by the scientific community in the UK in collaboration with other countries for some years. Most recently, the EC TRADEOFF project looked at the potential to change the global fleet's operations in order to minimise climate change impacts. This work suggests that total impacts may be reduced if flight altitudes were lowered but further work is required. More generally, global civil aviation emits approximately 2 per cent of the global anthropogenic CO emissions. However, because of additional effects caused by aviation emissions and the formation of extra cirrus clouds, the total effect of aviation was estimated by the International Panel on Climate Change to be of the order 2.7 times larger than the effect of CO alone (uncertainty range two to four times). Impacts on the ozone layer refer to exhaust emissions of supersonic aircraft in the stratosphere; only computer-based studies of such effects continue since the cessation of commercial supersonic operations. The UK, in conjunction with EU partners, will continue to fund atmospheric research as a foundation for evidence-based policy development.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.2/1">The criteria used for determining the level of provision for a road are based on the five over-arching objectives for transport&mdash;environment, safety, economy, accessibility and integration, defined by the <i>New Approach To Appraisal</i> (NATA).</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/2">To support the appraisal, a traffic assessment is undertaken in which the annual average daily traffic flow in the scheme's opening year is used. Technical Advice Note TA46, which provides advice on determining carriageway provision, states that a single carriageway may be appropriate for an opening year traffic flow of up to 21,000 vehicles per day while the minimum opening year traffic flow for a dual carriageway would be 11,000 vehicles per day. However, the level of provision adopted for a particular scheme is based on consideration of a range of factors in NATA including forecast traffic growth, operational efficiency, safety, cost and environmental impact.</p>
