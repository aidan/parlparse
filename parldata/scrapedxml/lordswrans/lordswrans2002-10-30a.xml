	<p pid="a.34.5/1">Data on the amount and composition of household waste are generally by weight, not volume. Recent estimates indicate that newspapers and magazines comprise at least 1.5 million tonnes of household waste in England, approximately 7 per cent by weight.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/2">Though highly variable, the average collection cost to local authorities operating kerbside collection of paper for recycling is estimated to be about &pound;75 per tonne, as opposed to an average &pound;25 per tonne for bring sites. Again reflecting local variations in the market for waste treatment options, costs of disposal vary considerably, landfill showing a range of about &pound;6 to &pound;16 per tonne (without adding landfill tax).</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/3">The market value of the recovered paper will depend on its quality and on the demand for it. The Waste and Resources Action Programme is working to overcome barriers in markets for recovered materials and recycled goods; this should help local authorities find buyers for recovered paper, as well as making recycling more economic across all waste streams.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/4">Assessing the proportion of used newpapers that are recycled is difficult; current estimates are that between 40 per cent and 55 per cent of the 1.5 million tonnes is collected for recyling. There are few data on what happens to the remainder, but it is likely that much of it is landfilled, as 78 per cent of all household waste is currently landfilled.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/5">Newpapers may be recycled more than once and they comprise roughly 80 per cent of household paper waste sent for recycling in the UK. Under the voluntary agreement that the Newspaper Publishers' Association has with Government, newspapers already contain over 60 per cent recycled material.</p>

This is an increase of some 57,000 properties. Since autumn 2000 a further 322,000 properties are covered by the flood warning arrangements. Target 10&mdash;Water Level Management Plans. This report summarises the agency's progress in developing and implementing water level management plans (WLMPs) on European sites. Target 12&mdash;Development in Areas at Risk from Flooding. This is the first report published since PPG25 was introduced in July 2001 and is the starting point to consider whether these guidelines are working. PPG25 is due to be reviewed in 2004. Future reports will provide a clearer picture as the guidelines are embedded. In general, we are pleased to note that Environment Agency advice on flood risk developments is being accepted and followed by local planning authorities (LPAs).</p>

Translink has advised that the final cost of the project is not yet available as a number of claims from contractors have to be checked, substantiated and agreed. There are also complex contractual and legal issues to be resolved, many of which are related to a change of project management engineer for the works and the delays which arose following a fatality of a contractor's employee. The final costings may not be known for some time. However, indications are that the final cost will significantly exceed the contract price.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">Aviation security measures remain at an enhanced level following the attacks on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase> last year. The Government keep these measures under constant review and from time to time additional protective steps will be taken as the situation demands.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">In May this year, as part of the process of continuing review, my right honourable friends the Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Transport appointed Sir John Wheeler to conduct an independent examination of airport security. The terms of reference for this work, set out in full in the report Sir John submitted to them on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-13">13 September</phrase>, included a focus on the threat from serious and organised crime at UK airports and the role of the police service.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">The Government are grateful to Sir John for the care with which he analysed the issues, and we have considered carefully his findings and recommendations. These, together with his introduction to the report, are today being placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The main body of the documents contains information about operational security matters, and for that reason it would not be appropriate to publish the report in its entirety.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">The report endorses the National Aviation Security Programme and the commitment of those working to deliver its objectives. It also makes some valuable recommendations around the need to strengthen strategic direction, to undertake a detailed multi-agency assessment of the potential threats from serious and organised crime, and to overhaul the arrangements by which airports may be designated for policing by uniformed officers. The Government are happy to accept in principle all of Sir John's recommendations. The Department for Transport and the Home Office are working closely together on implementation, which will bring in the police and other control agencies and the airport industry.</p>
