These estimates ignore behavioural effects, which could be expected to reduce the yield from the higher marginal rate of tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.5/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has had no such discussions. The named companies have made no representations about the Gambling Bill, although the former has in the past sought information about it. Ministers in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have had regular meetings with representatives of the named companies concerning the Greenwich Peninsula developments and associated commercial transaction; but these have not involved any substantive discussion of the Gambling Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.5/3">We understand that Kerzner has entered into an agreement with Anschutz Entertainment Group to build and operate a hotel on land adjacent to the Dome site and to provide a regional casino at the Dome site if the Gambling Bill is enacted, if Greenwich is designated as an area in which a premises licence for such a casino may be awarded by the local authority, if the company obtains the necessary operating and premises licences, and subject to any planning consent that may be required.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.5/4">We have made it clear that we cannot anticipate decisions about the designation of the areas suitable for regional, large or small casinos, which will be taken on the basis of advice from an independent expert panel which has not yet been appointed; and that under the Bill it will be for the local authority to decide whether or not any casinos may be established in its licensing area, and, if so, to consider applications for premises licences on their individual merits under the procedures set out in the Bill.</p>

This has entailed building the systematic consideration and management of risks into existing core business functions whilst managing risks at all levels within the business. To this end both the volume and content of the mitigation plans held within the agency remain fluid. Plans are subject to regular review and updating as the business changes and risks are identified, managed or eventually closed. The agency's high-level risk processes are referred to within both our externally published business plan and our annual report and accounts. Agency high level risks are monitored/reviewed monthly through the agency's business information bulletin.

	<p pid="b.45.5/1">The Government's market transformation programme estimates that the 60 million television sets in the UK consume, on average, approximately 90 million kilowatt hours per month while they are in stand-by mode&mdash;approximately 8 per cent of their total average monthly energy consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.5/2">In order to try to reduce the overall energy consumed by televisions the market transformation programme (<a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the &quot;on&quot; and the &quot;stand-by&quot; power consumption of televisions through the adoption of design improvements, an EU-wide voluntary code of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.5/3">The EU-wide voluntary agreement on televisions has been particularly successful in reducing the average energy consumed by televisions in stand-by mode with the majority of new televisions sold in the UK soon to consume around one watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the three to eight watts consumed by older models. We expect this agreement to be extended to cover additional consumer electronics shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.5/4">In addition, the Government's initiative on sustainable procurement, announced last autumn, includes a requirement for government departments which purchase televisions to specify televisions with stand-by power requirements of less that one watt.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.1/2" qnum="HL1416">Of the &pound;84 million allocated to the Waste Implementation Programme for England and Wales, what is the breakdown of spending; whether there has been a shortfall; and, if so, whether any such shortfall can be allocated to school-based waste-education work.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.2/1">Reform of the landfill tax credit scheme allocated approximately &pound;84 million, &pound;92 million and &pound;92 million to sustainable waste management in England between 2003&ndash;4 and 2005&ndash;6. These funds are administered through Defra's Waste Implementation Programme, which aims to ensure that legally binding targets to reduce significantly the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/2">There are no expected shortfalls in the budget for the rest of the 2004&ndash;05 financial year, which ends on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase>. Planned levels of expenditure for 2005&ndash;06 mean that no significant shortfall is likely to be available to support major new programmes of work.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/3">Major areas of funding include: &pound;40 million to take forward a programme of four waste reduction measures; &pound;25 million for programmes designed to help local authorities increase access to doorstep collection of materials for recycling; &pound;22 million for two programmes to improve the quality and availability of data and research; &pound;37 million for a programme of development of new technologies, including pilots; and &pound;4 million for a programme to support voluntary and community waste group initiatives which include delivery of waste education work.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/4">Other waste implementation programmes contribute to informal methods of environmental education and awareness raising. For example, &pound;30 million over three years has been allocated to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) for national and local waste awareness campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/5">The Waste Implementation Programme contributed &pound;29 million in 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to boost Defra's Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund, which provides project-based funding to local authorities to enable them to roll out high-quality recycling schemes in their areas. The programme also provided &pound;20 million in targeted grants to local authorities in 2004&ndash;05 to reduce pressure faced by councils to fund services such as waste management through increases in council tax.</p>
