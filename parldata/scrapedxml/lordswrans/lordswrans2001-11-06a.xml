	<p pid="a.12.2/1">The Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate has completed a thorough review, after extensive consultation with stakeholders, including certificate holders and licensees under the 1986 Act, animal welfare organisations and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/2">The findings, which the Government accept, are that the ethical review process has generally worked well and as intended since its introduction in April 1999 in the interests of the welfare of animals used in licensed scientific procedures. There are variations between establishments, more related to the efficiency than the effectiveness of the process, but overall the picture to emerge is positive and encouraging, given that the ethical review process is relatively new and still evolving.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/3">There is increased awareness both of compliance issues and, more importantly, of the need for full application of the 3Rs at all stages of a project&mdash;replacement of animal use wherever possible, reduction of the number of animals used when there is no alternative, and refinement of procedures to minimise animal suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/4">The main inspectorate recommendations are that the ethical review process in establishments should continue to develop on the basis on which it was introduced, with account being taken of observations offered in the review report on best practice. We accept these recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/5">We shall ensure the widest possible circulation of the review report, within both the scientific and animal welfare communities, with the aim of encouraging all research establishments to examine and improve their own ethical review processes. To help to achieve those aims we will, making use of additional resources recently provided to the inspectorate, initiate a number of awareness-raising activities and events. These will ensure that those involved with local ethical review processes, and those with responsibility for the welfare of animals produced for and used in laboratories, benefit fully from the advice on best practice that the report contains. We will as part of this activity be urging greater use of lay members in ethical review processes. A copy of the review report will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">The regional development agencies used Business Links to appraise, approve applications and pay out grants under the Business Recovery Funds. Business Links also gave out advice to businesses affected by the foot-and-mouth outbreak. The level of involvement of the Business Links varied from region to region.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/2">Of the &pound;39 million allocated for the Business Recovery Fund, approximately &pound;1.44 million&mdash;just under 4 per cent&mdash;was passed to Business Links to meet its adminstration costs.</p>
