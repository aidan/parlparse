	<p pid="a.135.5/1">The reports of the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) present findings and a range of options for different stakeholders (governments, private sector, academics and civil society) to consider. We are assessing these in taking forward the Government's international support to developing countries on agricultural knowledge, science and technology. Through our financial contribution to the IAASTD, we are supporting the publication and dissemination of the IAASTD reports to a wide range of international stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/2">We are also already taking action in line with IAASTD's findings. In April, the Department for International Development (DfID) announced that it planned to increase its investment in agricultural research to &pound;400 million over five years. This investment will include research on environmentally sustainable solutions, focus on the needs of farmers, address gender issues, look to build public-private partnerships, look at the impact of markets on poor farmers, and support traditional and modern technologies. All of these are advocated by IAASTD.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.2/1">Before bluetongue was detected in the UK, Defra worked in partnership with industry to produce the bluetongue control strategy which sought to limit the impact of an incursion of bluetongue in the UK. We are currently working with experts and industry to update the bluetongue control strategy to reflect the latest available information on all bluetongue serotypes and the lessons learnt from this year's roll-out of protection zones and vaccine for BTV-8.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/2">Defra remains vigilant to the threat of BTV-1 incursion. To that end, Defra is closely monitoring the situation in Europe. Post-import testing of cattle and sheep is carried out to detect BTV-1. If BTV-1 is detected in imported livestock, our short-term strategy will be to slaughter affected animals, establish control zones with movement restrictions, and carry out investigations, in the same way as when BTV-8 first entered the UK in September 2007. This will continue to be our policy unless evidence suggests that BTV-1 is circulating in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/3">However, the longer term strategy for BTV-1 will depend on how the virus spreads in Europe and the movement restrictions imposed in affected member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/4">If BTV-1 continues to spread to the point where incursions via midges become more likely, vaccination may become more important as a control strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/5">There are no vaccines currently licensed for use against BTV-1 in the UK. However, Defra is in discussion with potential vaccine providers, the veterinary profession and industry stakeholders about plans for 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">My department has not attempted to estimate the numbers of cattle likely to be slaughtered under the bovine tuberculosis (TB) control regime in the next three years, or the likely costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">It is very difficult to make such forecasts due to the chronic, multifactorial and insidious nature of bovine TB. The number of cattle slaughtered as TB reactors and direct contacts largely depends on (i) the underlying prevalence of the infection in the cattle (and badger) population and (ii) the intensity and accuracy of the TB screening programme for cattle herds. The former is subject to cyclical changes in the endemic TB areas that are difficult to predict, whereas the latter is subject to annual changes as TB herd testing frequencies are reviewed every year in response to the incidence of herd breakdowns in the previous years. Furthermore, the enhancements to the TB testing regime introduced over the past two years (such as pre-movement testing and gamma-interferon blood testing) are expected to result in higher numbers of reactors being identified each year, at least in the short to medium term.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">In relation to costs, compensation rates and salvage income will vary over time with market prices.</p>

However, we are aware of announcements by at least five major corporate contributors, amounting to over &pound;3 million, and a reported &pound;10 million in contributions from individuals. There has also been some aid provided in kind&mdash;such as other states providing teams of doctors from medical colleges.

This is working well, making a positive contribution to the overall relief effort through the provision of food, clothing and cash assistance to those affected by the floods. Some contributions are taking place outside organised channels, and ensuring the effective co-ordination and delivery of the different resources will continue to be a challenge.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.6/1">During the Welfare Reform Bill regulatory impact assessment it was acknowledged that the majority of disabled recipients lived in the social rented sector and would not be covered by the local housing allowance (LHA). It was, therefore, not appropriate to carry out a detailed disability impact assessment prior to introducing LHA. It is estimated that 5 per cent of pensioners and 10 per cent of working-age people who are disabled live in the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.6/2">In circumstances where disabled tenants are limited in the type of property they can rent in the private sector, because they may need certain additional facilities, local authorities are able to consider the use of discretionary housing payments (DHP) to ensure that tenants can find decent accommodation that meets their need. The DHPs are entirely at the discretion of the local authority concerned, and are subject to annual cash limit. As they are administered by local authorities, the number of customers who may have applied for DHPs is not known.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.6/3">The provision of extra housing space for a disabled person with live-in carers is not automatically classified as a housing need or a social care need. The LHA rate that a disabled person is entitled to would be based on the number of people who occupy the property in the same way that it is for other people.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.6/1">Those committed to prison in Northern Ireland are assessed by prison education departments to ascertain literacy and numeracy standards, using classifications set by the Department of Employment and Learning (Northern Ireland).

	<p pid="a.149.3/1">The lack of UK recycling capacity for portable batteries reflects the relatively low level (about 3 per cent) of batteries that are currently collected for recycling. There is greater recycling capacity for industrial and automotive batteries where the percentages of batteries collected are much higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.3/2">The EU batteries directive requires large increases in collection, treatment and recycling of portable batteries over the next few years. The targets are for at least 25 per cent of portable batteries to be collected, treated and recycled by 2012 and 45 per cent by 2015. These increases will provide opportunities for UK companies to invest in recycling capacity.</p>
