	<p pid="a.66.5/1">The additional financial pressure for local authorities has been reflected in the local authority CSR07 spending settlement, and for the current financial year &pound;36.6 million (England) has been added to the formula grant so that councils can meet the cost of the higher fees. The changes to the fee structure are part of the Government's intention to create a sustainable self-funding system for civil and family courts. The fees will ensure that the family courts are properly funded and should encourage cases to be managed efficiently and in line with the requirements of the public law outline and the revised volume 1 of court order guidance. The implementation of the public law outline will bring better case preparation by local authorities and improved case management. Local authorities have legal duties under the Children Act 1989 to take action to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need in their area, including through the initiation of Section 31 care and supervision order court applications where necessary. We expect local authorities to continue to operate in accordance with the terms of the statutory guidance issued by the Secretary of State and to continue to fulfil their Children Act 1989 duties and functions.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.6/1">The department has received no specific representations about an underresourcing of expertise in National Health Service chronic pain services.

	<p pid="a.69.6/2">There has been no specific review of underresourcing of expertise in NHS chronic pain services.

In addition, the department has consulted associated groups such as the British Pain Society about the development of both an 18-week commissioning pathway for chronic pain and a section on chronic pain for the NHS Choices website.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.5/1">I have arranged for Her Majesty's Chief Inspector's response to Lord Morris to be published in the <I>Official Report</I> and a copy of the letter to be placed in the Library of the House. The Government take the issue of bullying involving children with special educational needs and disabilities very seriously. We are currently considering how best to work with Ofsted in our continuing drive against such bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/2">Letter from Christine Gilbert, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, Ofsted, to Lord Morris of Manchester dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-21">21 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/3">Lord Adonis has written to me about your exchange in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-20">20 March 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/4">The bullying of disabled children is an issue that Ofsted takes very seriously. I know colleagues within the Education Directorate in Ofsted have recently met with representatives from Mencap to discuss the implications of their report: Bullying Wrecks Lives. Eileen Visser HMI discussed with Lesley Campbell and Rachel Hughes (Managers for the Stop the Bullying Campaign) what more inspectors might look for in relation to bullying of disabled pupils in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/5">A consequence of this meeting has been to provide a platform for a young woman with a learning disability to address our forthcoming Education Directorate conference, which will include references to disablist bullying in schools. At this same conference, training will be given to inspectors on the inspection of learning difficulties and/or disabilities in schools. The issue of bullying as a result of a disability is included.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/6">In February this year, the Children's Rights Director in Ofsted published a report which had canvassed children and young people's views about bullying and what could be done to improve this problem. This survey included residential special schools and the views of 153 children who declared themselves as having a disability were taken. The report can be found at <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/assets/Internet_Content/Shared_Content/Files/2008/feb/chldrnonbllyng.doc">www.ofsted.gov.uk/assets/Internet_Content/Shared_Content/Files/2008/feb/chldrnonbllyng.doc</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/7">Referring now to your comments about the Disability Discrimination Act, I can advise that Ofsted recently carried out a rapid response survey looking at schools' compliance with equalities legislation. This report was sent as an internal briefing paper to the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). In this small scale survey one in four schools indicated a shortfall in their compliance with legislation. This shortfall was reported in their inspection report where it had a negative impact on the overall judgment about equalities. Concerns about compliance are also included in a school's inspection report where there is an impact on the outcomes for learners. Over time this should lead to improvement in schools' compliance with legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/8">We are conducting a survey of SEN provision and outcomes in 2009-10 and bullying could be a factor in this work. Furthermore we have indicated that it would be possible to include a separate survey solely looking at this issue in the 2009-10 work programme and will discuss that with the DCSF.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/9">I hope this is helpful. Do please contact me if I can provide you with further information.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.3/1">National insurance contributions are credited to women for each week of their maternity allowance period for which they receive maternity allowance. In 1979, the maternity allowance period covered a maximum period of 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/2">Whether women who were paid maternity allowance gained a qualifying year in 1979-80 or any other year would depend on their employment and on their level of earnings before and after the maternity allowance period&mdash;which may straddle two tax years.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/3">Women who did not return to work or took low-paid work were eligible for home responsibilities protection for each complete tax year from 1978-79 where they received child benefit throughout the tax year for a child under 16 provided they did not have a reduced rate election in force. Home responsibilities protection works by reducing the number of qualifying years a person needs to get a basic state pension. However, it cannot presently reduce the number of qualifying years needed to get a full basic state pension below 20. Where a woman reaches state pension age on or after <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2010</phrase>, any years of home responsibilities protection she has acquired will be converted to qualifying years, when home responsibilities protection is replaced by a weekly credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/4">Women may top up their national insurance record by paying class 3 voluntary contributions in order to gain a full basic state pension provided they meet the qualifying conditions for doing so. These contributions have to be paid within certain time limits. Currently, the time limit for paying is generally six years. However, for tax years before 1982-83, these contributions needed to be paid before the end of the second year following the deficient year. Class 3 contributions cannot be paid for any years for which a reduced rate election was in force.</p>
