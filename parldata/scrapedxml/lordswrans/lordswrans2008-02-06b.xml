She was suspended under Parliament's Rules of Procedure. Ms Joya has the right to challenge the decision, but has not yet chosen to do so. The Government, together with EU partners, regularly raise the importance of freedom of expression in Afghanistan and look forward to Ms Joya and Parliament resolving this internal parliamentary issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.190.5/3">In April 2004, an amendment to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 came into effect which enabled the police to take and retain DNA and fingerprints from persons who had been arrested for a recordable offence. In the period April 2004 to December 2005, the retention of DNA profiles of arrested persons who had not been charged or proceeded against had resulted in matches with crime scene profiles from over 3,000 offences including 37 murders, 16 attempted murders and 90 rapes.</p>

From these, approximately 8,500 profiles of individuals have been linked with crime scene profiles, involving nearly 14,000 offences.

The remainder of the A13 up to the A130, which is not trunk road, is the responsibility of Thurrock Council and Essex County Council. Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 litter clearance is the responsibility of the local authorities except for motorways and a few all-purpose trunk roads. For the Highways Agency section of the A13 the responsibility for litter clearance falls to Thurrock Council.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.2/1">The security situation in Northern Ireland has vastly improved in recent years. However, the serious attacks on two PSNI officers last year and the recent decision by the chief constable to alert the public to an increased risk of terrorist activity highlight the continued threat posed by a small number of individuals. I have every confidence in the PSNI's ability to combat the threat posed by these individuals. The PSNI work tirelessly to thwart the activities of all those involved in criminal activity in Northern Ireland and bring them to justice for their crimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/2">Northern Ireland now has a successful devolved administration with a focus on improving life for all the people of Northern Ireland. This future must include engagement with the IICD by all paramilitary organisations and paramilitary activity.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.5/1">The Environment Agency is currently undertaking its &quot;Thames Estuary 2100&quot; project to deliver a flood risk management plan for the tidal Thames through to the end of the century.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.5/2">It will recommend what will be required to manage increasing flood risk, and when it will be required, depending on the impacts of climate change. An assessment of the current estuary defences, including the Thames Barrier, and the options for future flood risk management will be included in this research.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.5/3">The project is due to report its recommendations to the Government at the end of 2009. Findings currently indicate that the tidal defences provide a better standard of protection than previously understood and so are unlikely to require any major changes until after 2030. Under the Government's current climate change guidance for future sea level rise the Thames Barrier, with some modification, may even continue to provide protection to London through to the end of the century.</p>
