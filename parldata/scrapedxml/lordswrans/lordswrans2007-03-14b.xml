	<p pid="b.121.1/2" qnum="HL2413">Whether the current concentration of British troops in Helmand province has diverted attention from reconstruction and development throughout the country; and, if so, how this can be rectified under the revised strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.2/1">The current concentration of British troops in Helmand province has not diverted DfID's attention from reconstruction and development throughout Afghanistan. Afghanistan is DfID's fifth largest programme and the UK is Afghanistan's second largest bilateral donor, with a planned spend of &pound;102 million in 2006-07. Over 70 per cent of our assistance goes directly to the Government of Afghanistan in support of their own priorities. This includes support for the Government's national priority programmes, which operate throughout the country. For example, the national solidarity programme (NSP) operates in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. It has helped to establish over 16,000 community development councils to identify local needs and has funded over 22,000 projects in areas including agriculture, education, health, irrigation and transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.2/2">Helmand is a priority for the Governments of both Afghanistan and the UK. We have committed up to &pound;20 million a year to support development in the province. This will help to build the capacity of Afghan institutions and promote economic and social development. The major obstacle to reconstruction and development in Helmand is the lack of security. The presence of the British military, in support of the Afghanistan national security forces, will help to overcome that obstacle and establish a better environment for the effective implementation of the Government of Afghanistan's national priority programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.5/1">The UK is working closely with German and other G8 colleagues to ensure a strong focus on Africa at the Heiligendamm summit in June. This will build on earlier G8 commitments to support investment and development in Africa, particularly those made at Gleneagles.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.5/2">Africa's prospects have improved significantly over recent years, with average growth reaching 5.5 per cent in 2005. However, longer-term projections are uncertain. We will, therefore, highlight the importance of efforts to support sustained positive growth. We will emphasise fundamental requirements such as good financial governance, strengthened financial markets and a more conducive investment climate. We will also encourage continued G8 support to related Gleneagles initiatives, such as the Investment Climate Facility, the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund and the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa.</p>

If the applicant has income in excess of the limit, funding is refused.

From <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-02">2 October 2006</phrase>, where the proceedings are in the magistrates' court, the defendant must satisfy a new means test. An individual is financially eligible for a representation order if his gross annual income, adjusted to take account of any partner or children, is &pound;11,590 or less, and ineligible if it is &pound;20,740 or more. Those applicants whose adjusted income falls within the two thresholds are subject to a more detailed assessment of their disposable income in order to determine their financial eligibility under the new scheme. Legal aid applications for defendants appearing before the Crown Court are not currently means-tested.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.164/1">Although the majority of all MTIC fraud seen so far has been perpetrated using mobile phones and computer chips, a wide range of other goods have been, and continue to be, used. HMRC has also seen evidence of traders historically linked with the mobile phone sector diversifying their trading into goods as disparate as cosmetics and soft drinks.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.164/2">HMRC has a duty to protect tax revenues, and does so through a multi-faceted strategy using a range of interventions, including taking steps to counter inaccurate, fraudulent or abusive repayment claims. HMRC is entitled to verify VAT repayment claims to ensure that they are properly payable. Decisions to verify repayment claims or to take other action to improve taxpayer compliance are made on the basis of perceived risk and are applied across the whole VAT register.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.164/3">Last year, the level of VAT repayment claims from those suspected of trading in supply chains associated with MTIC fraud rose very rapidly, without known economic or commercial reason. As a result, HMRC is verifying a greater proportion of VAT repayment claims from such traders, regardless of the nature of their trading activity. In order to ensure that its action is proportionate, HMRC has deployed an additional 700 staff to enable these verification checks to be carried out efficiently and effectively. However, HMRC does not collate information by specific products, and to do so would incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.164/4">HMRC has received a number of challenges to its in-depth verification of repayment claims from those suspected of trading in transaction chains affected by MTIC fraud. HMRC has received over 170 letters before claim, the first stage in the judicial review process. Subsequently, HMRC has been served with 42 judicial review claim forms. Of these, 19 cases are awaiting a decision from the administrative court as to permission, and two substantive and two permission renewal hearings are pending. The courts, to date, have supported HMRC's policy and practice.</p>
