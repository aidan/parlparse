	<p pid="a.228.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2"><I>Letter from Stephen Penneck, Director General for ONS, to Lord Alton of Liverpool, dated July 2011</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking (a) what was the registered cause of death, and (b) what secondary references were included on the certificate, in each case since 2005 where a sufferer of Clostridium sordelli died subsequent to infection. (HL11061)</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">Information on deaths involving Clostridium sordellii is not directly available from the statistical information derived from death registrations. To obtain figures on deaths related to C. sordellii it would be necessary to identify all deaths with an International Classification of Disease code relating to Clostridium infection, and then study the text of the death certificate for the word &quot;sordellii&quot;. This exercise cannot be completed without disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">It is not always possible from the information given at death registration to state whether the deceased had a specific infection at the time of death. Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to the death to be recorded on the death certificate. Medical practitioners and coroners are not required to record all of the diseases or conditions present at or before death, and whether a condition contributed is a matter for their clinical judgement.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">The number of deaths involving Clostridium difficile registered in England and Wales each year by sex and age are published annually on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp">www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp</a> ?vInk=14782.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7" class="indent">1. Currently it would not be easy to adapt death registration data for routine monitoring of C. sordellii as the International Classification of Disease does not contain a code for this infection. The only way to obtain data is using the methodology described in the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/8" class="indent">2. C. sordellii is a rare bacterium that causes pneumonia, endocarditis, arthritis, peritonitis, and myonecrosis. C. sordellii bacteremia and sepsis occur rarely. Most cases of sepsis from C. sordellii occur in patients with underlying conditions. Severe toxic shock syndrome among previously healthy persons has been described in a small number of C. sordellii cases, most often associated with gynaecologic infections in women and infection of the umbilical stump in newborns.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/9" class="indent">3. There is currently no routine surveillance scheme for C. sordellii infections.</p>

European Union regulation 1828/2006 of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December 2006</phrase> sets out rules for the implementation of the ERDF and other structural funds. These rules include the detailed requirements for funding recipients to publicise information on the source of their funding, including statements to that effect in all related documents. It is standard practice for funding providers in general to ask that their role in supporting a project or organisation be recognised and communicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.0/2">The managing authority may withdraw some or all funding from a beneficiary if the project does not comply with the regulations. This is a financial correction, not a fine and there is no right of appeal under the regulations. The European Commission also has powers to impose financial corrections on the basis of examinations it has carried out, but these are generally at operational programme, not individual project, level.</p>

Croatia, Iceland, Montenegro, Macedonia and Turkey are all candidate countries. The EU is also committed to the European perspective of the western Balkans. My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe, David Lidington, restated the Government's support for eventual EU membership for the countries of the western Balkans subject to them meeting the accession criteria, at the EU-Western Balkans Forum on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-20">20 June</phrase>. The European Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) play a useful role in the EU enlargement process. The Commission, with input from the EEAS, monitors and assesses progress in the reforms necessary for EU membership in those countries with an EU perspective, the result of which is an annual progress report on these countries and an annual EU enlargement strategy which suggests the proposed direction of this policy. The UK fully endorses last December's council conclusions, which stated &quot;that by making solid progress in economic and political reform and by fulfilling the necessary conditions and requirements, the remaining potential candidates in the western Balkans should achieve candidate status, according to their own merits, with EU membership as the ultimate goal&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.2/1">The aim of the best-practice tariff (BPT) for hip fracture is to reduce unexplained variations and to raise the quality of care and improve outcomes for patients. The BPT is based on elements of care which are consistent with best practice and the recently published hip fracture guidance from National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). BPT was introduced in April 2010 and data received over the past 12 months have demonstrated a steady increase in the number of patients whose care is in line with the standards of care required for compliance with the BPT. At this stage, it is not possible to express improvements in outcomes in terms of QALYs. The department has commissioned an evaluation of the impact of the introduction of the BPT, which is due to report later this year. This report will comment on the improvement in care for patients, using the most appropriate means of measurement.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.2/1">Manufacturers of surgical instruments (medical devices) must designate them as single-use only or as being suitable for reprocessing. Although a manufacturer may employ the same materials in a single-use medical device as in a reusable device, the design of the single-use device may not be appropriate to allow for effective decontamination and sterilisation of the product.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.2/2">A reusable device must include guidance on the reprocessing of the product in the instructions for use. Any medical device that includes a sterilisation process must involve a notified body in the validation of this process prior to the application of a CE mark.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.2/1">Operation Podium is the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) response to deal with criminal networks targeting the economy of the 2012 Games. Its remit is to investigate Games-related serious and organised criminality, focusing on acquisitive crimes including money-laundering, organised ticket crime, corruption, bribery, fraud, counterfeiting and false identity abuse. Operation Podium has worked with the MPS Directorate of Public Affairs to prepare key messages for the public on this issue. The intention is to raise awareness nationally and internationally on where to safely purchase tickets, providing consumers with some top tips on how to protect themselves from being a victim of a fraudulent ticket sale. Maximum media exposure will be sought while also utilising internal law enforcement networks, community groups, stakeholders and international contacts to heighten impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/2">Operation Podium is working closely with internet providers (ISPs) to ensure that fraudulent websites are taken down quickly and, where appropriate, will use the range of existing fraud legislation to seek prosecutions against offenders. Anybody applying for London 2012 tickets can use LOCOG's online website, <a href="http://www.london2012.com/about-this-website/ticketing-website-checker.php">http://www.london2012.com/about-this-website/ticketing-website-checker.php</a>, to ensure the site they are using is an authorised ticket reseller. The Government are also committed to tackling the illegal touting of Games tickets. The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (Amendment) Bill, currently before Parliament, proposes increasing the maximum penalty for illegal reselling of Games tickets from &#163;5,000 to &#163;20,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.0/1">The Department for Transport's contingent liabilities in respect of the Channel Tunnel are published in its resource accounts for 2009-10 at <a href="http://www">http://www</a>. dft.gov.uk/about/publications/apr/resourceaccounts 0910/pdf/resourceaccounts0910.pdf.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/2">The department classifies contingent liabilities in accordance with accounting rules. There is an agreement relating to the &quot;underpinning&quot; of access charges for domestic passenger services for HS1. This was entered into in July 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/3">The maximum amount which may be payable under this agreement is approximately &#163;3.2 billion in 2009 prices (for the period 2010 to 2040).</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/4">Whether any moneys are actually paid depends on whether or not the Secretary of State chooses to specify the relevant services in future franchise agreements. It is his present intention to do so and the agreement is therefore unlikely to be of a nature that is accounted as a contingent liability in the 2010-11 resource accounts.</p>
