	<p pid="a.78.8/1">The Government will continue to do whatever is necessary to support essential services, and to provide advice to businesses and householders on steps they can take to help themselves and others during severe winter weather.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/2">A cross-Whitehall Ministerial Resilience Team, chaired by the Secretary of State for Transport, has met on a number of occasions since November 2010 to monitor the weather situation and to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to minimise the disruption of key services across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/3">Local Highway authorities, including Northumberland County Council, have a duty under section 41 of the Highways Act 1980 to maintain the local highways network in their area. It is for each individual authority to assess which parts of its network are in need of repair and what standards should be applied, based upon their local knowledge and circumstances. In relation to snow, a local authority's section 41 duty includes the requirement &quot;to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that safe passage along a highway is not endangered by snow or ice&quot;. Central government has no powers to intervene in these matters in relation to local authority roads. Winter service planning and salt stock supplies are therefore the responsibility of the respective highway authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/4">The Department for Transport endorses <I>Well-</I><I>M</I><I>aintained Highways</I>, the code of practice for highway maintenance published by the UK Roads Liaison Group (UKRLG). The section on winter service recommends that local highway authorities should draw up a winter service plan, which should determine how snow and ice on the roads will be tackled. It also recommends that highway authorities should review their winter service plans annually in consultation with a range of stakeholders. The guidance recognises that authorities may need to prioritise which roads need to be cleared of snow and ice and recommends that they include arrangements for keeping road users informed of their winter service plans. The UKRLG has recently produced additional advice to local authorities for obtaining maximum de-icing effort from available salt stocks, based on experience gained from winter 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/5">Following previous severe winters, an independent panel reviewed the transport sector's response to last winter and produced an interim report in July 2010. This report concentrated on actions that can be taken by local and national highways authorities, salt suppliers, the Government and others to improve resilience for this winter, as well as some longer term actions. A final report was published in October 2010. The findings were welcomed by the Government and took action in on those recommendations which were for this department to take forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/6">Recommendations included sourcing a volume of imported salt to establish and manage national strategic stockpiles of up to 250,000 tonnes, monitoring salt stocks around the country on a weekly basis, as well as producing and publishing guidance on clearing snow and ice from footways outside their property without having to worry about health and safety or other public liability issues. This guidance, entitled <I>Clearing Snow </I><I>a</I><I>nd Ice </I><I>from Pavements </I><I>Yourself</I>, is available on the DirectGov website at: <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_191868">www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_191868</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/7">In light of the early and severe onset of winter, the Government asked David Quarmby CBE in December 2010 to follow up his earlier review of winter resilience with an urgent audit of how well highway authorities and transport operators in England have coped with the cold weather between <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-24">24 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December 2010</phrase>. This report, along with copies of earlier reports on winter resilience, can be found at the following weblink: <a href="http://transportwinterresilience.independent.gov.uk/">http://transportwinterresilience.independent.gov.uk/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.8/8">The audit found that the country's transport systems coped well with the early severe weather during that period. However, to ensure that disruption of transport services are kept to a minimum in the event of any further wintry weather, the Department for Transport will continue to work with the local government sector and transport operators.</p>
