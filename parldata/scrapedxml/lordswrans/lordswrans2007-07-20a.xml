	<p pid="a.58.2/1">There have been no discussions with primary care trusts (PCTs) about commissioning radiotherapy in light of the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group (NRAG) report nor has any guidance been issued to PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">Ministers have asked that the issues and recommendations in the NRAG report are considered as part of Cancer Reform Strategy. The NRAG report was shared with the various strategy working groups so that they could consider and advise the National Cancer Director on the implications of these recommendations in more detail. Work on the Cancer Reform Strategy is still ongoing. The strategy is due to be published by the end of the year. However, as the report is not just about increasing radiotherapy capacity but also about improving current productivity from existing resources and reducing existing variation in current provision, it is important for the National Health Service locally to consider this report in parallel with the work on the Cancer Reform Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/3">The National Cancer Director therefore shared the report with cancer networks on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-11">11 May 2007</phrase> so that they could start to consider the local implications of what it is saying; for example, so that they could consider if they are meeting the needs of their local populations and if they can improve current productivity. In addition, PCT chief executives were informed that the report had been issued and that the National Cancer Director had sent it with a letter to cancer networks. This notification was done via the department's chief executive's bulletin which alerts chief executives to publications, circulars and announcements from the department. It is emailed to NHS chief executives, including PCTs, as well as council chief executives and directors of social services. Issue 370 of the bulletin (18 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-24">24 May 2007</phrase>) included details about the NRAG report.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.0/1">My Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March 2006</phrase> (<I>WS 84</I>) informed the House that the Administration and Works Committee had agreed that the large room in the south-east corner of the Palace previously occupied by the Lord Chancellor's private staff would be converted into a Writing Room with refreshment facilities. Work will take place this summer to create a larger Writing Room facility in the former Lord Chancellor's office next door and to reorganise the furniture in the corner room to provide an informal space for Members. The nearby kitchenette facilities will also be enhanced to enable the Refreshment Department to provide an afternoon tea service for Members upon the House's return in October.</p>

This was published as part of a wider package of reforms designed to ensure that the Government better engage with Parliament and the public. As such, it does not represent the Government's concluded view of the contents of the programme or of any specific Bill. The Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill is specifically referred to in the document on the draft programme (pages 15 and 48). The Government look forward to the report of the Joint Committee and the contribution that it will make to the ongoing development of legislation in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.5/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2" qnum="HL4829">What is the future of Oakington as a detention and removal centre; and what has been done to improve conditions for detainees there, in particular in the removal and transport of detainees to and from airports and courtrooms by night.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-07-20a.59.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70720w0001.htm#07072057000044">
	<p pid="a.59.6/1">Oakington is leased by the Border and Immigration Agency from English Partnerships. They are currently discussing revised lease arrangements that will keep Oakington open in the short term, but there is no long-term prospect, as the site is being redeveloped for housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.6/2">The contractor at Oakington, in liaison with the on-site Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) team, will continue to look at ways of improving the facilities and services for detainees. All immigration removal centres are subject to The Detention Centre Rules 2001, and these make provision for the regulation and management of removal centres. All contractors are subject to detailed contracts that are monitored rigorously by BIA staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.6/3">The movement of detainees to and from airports at night is inevitable in certain circumstances. For example, detainees often arrive at ports late at night and are transferred from port holding rooms into centres, often arriving early in the morning. In addition, because many flights depart early in the morning, it is sometimes necessary to effect early collection in order that the persons can be taken to removal. It is recognised, however, that this activity needs to be undertaken as sensitively as possible and should be kept to a minimum, both for the sake of the individual concerned and to avoid disturbing other detainees. The movement of immigration detainees to and from courtrooms during the night should not occur, as courts are closed outside business hours.</p>
