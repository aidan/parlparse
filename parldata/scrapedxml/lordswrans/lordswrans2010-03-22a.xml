	<p pid="a.240.0/1">Human rights remain central to UK and EU policy on Cuba and are a key element of the EU-Cuba political dialogue. We are particularly concerned about the high levels of political prisoners (including those in poor health) and prison conditions in Cuba. We routinely raise this issue together with a range of human rights concerns in bilateral and EU discussions with Cuba. I myself recently raised human rights in general, and specifically called for the release of all political prisoners in a letter to the Cuban Foreign Minister, Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla. Our embassy in Havana also recently raised these issues formally with the Cuban Government on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-12">12 December 2009</phrase>, and regularly raises them in the margins of other meetings. Further, at Cuba's Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council in February 2009 we raised specific concerns about political prisoners and the lack of independent access to Cuban prisons. We recommended that Cuba establish a recurrent system of review of its prisons by UN or other relevant international observers.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/2">At every session of the EU-Cuba political dialogue (in October 2008, May 2009 and November 2009) the EU has called for the release of all political prisoners, and encouraged Cuba to allow international humanitarian organisations to visit Cuban prisons. The EU has also handed over a list of prisoners in poor health who remain a particular concern. Most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-25">25 February 2010</phrase> (following the death of a Cuban hunger striker) a spokesperson for the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs issued a statement which highlighted the Cuban Government's responsibility to protect all prisoners under their jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/3">We will continue to raise these issues with the Cuban Government, both bilaterally and through the EU, and encourage them to arrange dates for a proposed visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, who has said he want so visit all categories of detention facilities and types of detainee in Cuba.</p>

There are a number of aspects of Defra's marine programme contributing to this aim, including the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). In most cases, the CFP governs what measures we can take and meaningful reform of the CFP is essential to deliver the right fisheries governance framework. At a national level, the Marine and Coastal Access Act provides for inshore fisheries and conservation authorities to manage local fisheries within their districts, and requires them to ensure that marine protected areas (MPAs) are protected.</p>

This network is one element which will contribute to realising the Government's vision for clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas. This network aims to conserve UK biodiversity, whether rare, threatened or representative. It is not intended that the network will directly be used to conserve commercial fish stocks, although some indirect benefits may be seen. Site-specific measures, such as MPAs are not always the best tool to protect highly mobile species, such as many key fish stocks.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.6/1">Militancy and violent extremism, extra judicial killings and arbitrary detention affect all the provinces in Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan faces a difficult law and order situation in Balochistan in tackling militant and criminal activity. In our dialogue with the Government of Pakistan we urge that action to counter militant or insurgent activity is conducted in line with Pakistan's obligations under national and international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.6/2">Officials from our High Commission in Islamabad attended a joint sitting of Pakistan's National Assembly and Senate on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-24">24 November 2009</phrase>. The Government of Pakistan announced the &quot;Start of Balochistan's Rights&quot; policy to implement constitutional, political and economic reform in Balochistan. This received political consensus for initiatives to address human rights, development and instability in the province. We will be following progress on these reforms as well as the issue of political autonomy which has been referred to the Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Reform for consideration.</p>
