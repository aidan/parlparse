	<p pid="a.87.2/1">The recent decision by the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government and for Transport to allow for an increase in the number of flights and passengers using Stansted Airport was taken in accordance with Section 266 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The reasons for the decision are set out in decision letter of the Secretaries of State dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October</phrase>, copies of which are available in the House Libraries, together with The Planning Inspectorate's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/2">This was an important and complicated case. It was important that all the evidence was considered, along with other representations received, before any decision was taken. The Planning Inspectorate submitted its report in January 2008, following a public inquiry held between May and October 2007. In March 2008, the Departments for Communities and Local Government and for Transport asked for further information on local air quality issues, and in July 2008 they asked for views on the inspectorate's proposed night-noise condition. Ministers were involved throughout this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/3">The remarks made by Baroness Andrews on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-06">6 October</phrase> were in the context of a wide-ranging debate on how the reforms proposed in the Planning Bill would in future improve the decision-making process for major new infrastructure projects. They do not in any way call into question the particular decisions that have been taken under the current procedures.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-11-10a.88.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100960" speakername="Lord Darzi of Denham" colon=":" colnum="88"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81110w0001.htm#81110w0001.htm_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.88.2/1">The department's study, <I>The cost of alcohol harm to the NHS in England: An update to the Cabinet Office (2003) study</I>, used similar methodology to the Cabinet Office interim analytical report, alongside new data on relevant costs, attributable fractions and usage rates, to estimate the cost of alcohol misuse to the National Health Service. A copy of the department's study has already been placed in the Library and fully explains the methodology used and where it differs from the interim analytical report.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">The difference in estimated cost between the 2008 department's study and the 2003 interim analytical report is a result of the five-year gap between each study. This gap allowed the department's study to take into account increases in costs since the interim analytical report was written and to use more recent and more accurate data on alcohol consumption and harm in its calculations. Section 4 of the new study contains an analysis of why the estimated cost has increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/3">Tackling harmful consumption of alcohol is a priority for the Government, and in June 2007, <I>Safe. Sensible. Social</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>The next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy</I> was launched, which updated the national alcohol strategy and set out a comprehensive strategy to tackle harmful consumption of alcohol and associated problems. This includes public information campaigns, toughened enforcement of underage sales and more help for people who want to drink less.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/4">A crucial element in the strategy is to impress on people the need for them to take responsibility for their own actions, supported by an ability to make informed decisions, based on accurate and consistent unit and health information, about their drinking habits and behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/5">Additionally, we have put in place a new NHS indicator to measure the change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol-related harm from April 2008&mdash;the first ever national commitment to monitor how the NHS is tackling alcohol health harms.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/6">This indicator is expected to encourage primary care trusts to invest in earlier identification of people who drink too much, linked to advice and support from general practitioners or other healthcare staff&mdash;shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of everyday drinking which over time leads to liver disease and other problems, including dependency.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/7">Between <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July 2008</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-14">14 October</phrase>, we carried out a major consultation asking for the views of the public and key stakeholders on what action the Government should take in response to the rising levels of alcohol health harm and crime and disorder. Responses to the consultation are being logged and analysed and will be taken into account, along with the developing evidence, in our future decisions on tackling alcohol health harm and crime and disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/8">Additionally, the department's policy research programme has commissioned Sheffield University, School of Health and Related Research to carry out an independent review of the evidence on how and in what circumstances price and promotion drive consumption of alcohol and harms from alcohol, and explores the potential impact of potential policy changes on consumption of alcohol and harms from alcohol. The review is expected to be published by the end of November.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.2/1">There are no legislative requirements for benefits to be paid into a bank account and we do not insist on it. We do encourage payment into bank accounts, as this is the safest and most reliable method of payment. Around 98 per cent of customers are paid directly into an account. The small minority of customers who are unable to open an account are paid by cheque.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/2">Although banks are legally required to check their customer's identity before opening an account, they are able to accept a wide range of documents to prove identity, including a letter from a government department confirming benefit entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.0/1">The work capability assessment and work-focused health-related assessment are intended to be combined. The work-focused interview has a different purpose and administration arrangements. The work capability assessment determines whether the claimant has limited capability for work and limited capability for work-related activity. The work-focused health-related assessment looks at the support individuals need to help them return to work; for example, health interventions or workplace adaptations. Both these assessments are conducted by healthcare professionals, employed by Atos Healthcare, on behalf of the department. They will be covered in a single appointment, although there will be occasions when a work-focused health-related assessment is not required.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/2">The work-focused interview is designed to help the claimant move closer to the labour market. The first work-focused interview is conducted by a Jobcentre Plus personal adviser, who will explore the claimant's work options, explain the services and support available, such as training opportunities, and help to develop the claimant's employment action plan. The work-focused interview is informed by the report from the work-focused health-related assessment. Work-focused interviews are arranged at regular fixed points during the individual's claim, the first being as soon as practicable after the eighth week.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.3/1">New criteria have been agreed with the Confederation of Passenger Transport, the trade association for the bus and coach industry, for determining whether a route is a separate route for the purposes of the 50 kilometre threshold contained within the EU regulation on drivers' hours. This should provide greater certainty for operators who wish to change their services to operate outside the EU regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.3/2">As a result, separate routes may now be advertised as connecting services.

	<p pid="a.94.5/1">Gas and electricity suppliers are obliged to ensure that customers' meters are physically read and inspected once every two years. Most suppliers try to read meters quarterly or six-monthly. If the supplier is unable to gain access to the meter, it will estimate the energy use for the billing period based on the customer's historic consumption records. If customers are dissatisfied with the estimate, they can provide the supplier with a reading, which the supplier must either accept or arrange to read the meter. On average, over 87 per cent of domestic customers receive at least one bill based on an actual meter reading each year. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) is responsible for rules governing meter readings and for policing those rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.5/1">Unaccompanied children seeking asylum in the United Kingdom are only held in detention in exceptional circumstances, and then only normally overnight, while alternative arrangements are made for their care and safety. In addition, detention of individuals under 18 who have been convicted of a criminal offence and have completed their custodial sentence may be authorised in exceptional circumstances where it can be shown that they pose a serious risk to the public and a decision to deport or remove them has been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.5/2">Information on the number of such cases is not collected centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.5/3">Formal detention powers are also used to facilitate the return, with appropriate escorts, of such children. Great care is taken with the return arrangements in such cases, including close liaison with the child's local authority social worker and the authorities in the receiving country, and will take place only when reception arrangements are in place. The return will be scheduled to take place during the course of a single day. In the period June 2007 to September 2008, there were approximately 60 such cases. This figure has been rounded to the nearest 10 in line with standard statistical procedures and is based on management information; it has not been quality assured under National Statistics protocols, is subject to change and should be treated as provisional.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.2/1">Of the contracted workforce of 2,701 currently on the Olympic site, 24 per cent (637) are residents of the Olympic host boroughs. This compares favourably to the average local workforce of 5 to 10 per cent of other recent major construction projects. The Olympic Delivery Authority is seeking to maintain and improve on this as the build programme continues, working closely with local agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.2/2">The Games provide a catalyst to improve the employment prospects for disadvantaged communities across London. The London Employment and Skills Action Plan for 2012, co-owned by the London Development Agency, Learning and Skills Council and Jobcentre Plus, aims to reduce worklessness in London by 70,000, (20,000 of these in the host boroughs). Supporting local people into jobs on the Olympic Park is just one element of this work. In the longer term, we shall build on the collaborative work of agencies in the host boroughs as a basis for tackling endemic problems of high unemployment through a strategic regeneration framework for the area incorporating the Olympic Park post-2012. This will be as much about removing barriers to employment, such as benefits entitlement, childcare and language skills, as providing training in jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.2/3">Both the immediate work in securing Olympic jobs for local people and the longer-term aim to reduce worklessness in the host boroughs will be subject to a longitudinal evaluation of all this work to measure its impact beyond 2012 to 2015. This will also look at the impact on employment of other contractors (non-construction) in delivering the Games and its legacy.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.11/2">The ratio of standing passengers to seats varies according to the type of rolling stock, but for modern sliding door stock is generally around 35 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.11/4">New (class 376) purpose-built vehicles ordered for Southeastern are configured to serve short-distance Metro passenger flows, and the stock has been specifically configured with low density seating and appropriate grab rails for standing passengers, to ensure that passengers can stand in relative comfort for short-distance journeys. The same is true for class 455 units operated by Stagecoach South West Trains, on services that stop within 20 minutes of leaving London Waterloo. In these cases, the standard is varied to 0.35 and 0.25 square metres respectively.</p>
