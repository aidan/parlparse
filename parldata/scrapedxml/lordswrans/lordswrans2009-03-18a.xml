	<p pid="a.38.5/1">National Grid owns the high voltage electricity transmission system in England and Wales and operates the high voltage electricity transmission system across Great Britain. Distribution network operators (DNOs) own and operate the lower voltage distribution networks. Typically, small generators&mdash;eg small wind turbines and small wind farms&mdash;connect to the lower voltage distribution networks throughout Great Britain, rather than the high voltage transmission network. DNOs manage wind generation connected on their network.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/2">Small scale embedded generators can normally be connected to the distribution networks without the need for the DNO to carry out detailed network studies to assess the impact of the connection. Therefore, embedded generators can then generate without restriction.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/3">Small wind turbines&mdash;the DNO would assess the connection to ensure that the distribution network would be capable of accepting the output from the generator and this would identify any remedial works required. Once any remedial work was completed, the generation would be able to operate without the imposition of any restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.5/4">Small wind farms&mdash;the DNO will make an assessment of whether the connection and operation of the generator will impact on the transmission system. If it will not have, then as for small wind turbines, the generation would be able to operate without any restrictions being imposed by the DNO. If there is an impact on the transmission system, then National Grid in some cases, when balancing the electricity system, could request the DNO to reduce output which will in turn, request this of a generator connected to its network. However, more typically, when balancing the high voltage network, National Grid will ask generators directly connected to its network to reduce demand.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.5/2">In recent years public debate has focused on the term &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot;. The Intelligence and Security Committee has defined this as the extra judicial transfer of persons between jurisdictions for the purposes of detention and interrogation outside the normal legal system, where there is a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The Government unreservedly condemn any &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; to torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/3">With regard to the identification and prosecution of crimes, these are a matter for the relevant authorities. Where there is sufficient evidence of unlawful activity on board an aircraft, or anywhere else, in UK territory or airspace, be it a rendition operation or otherwise, this would be investigated by the UK authorities. Where appropriate, the UK law enforcement authorities work with colleagues abroad in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/4">With regard to the prevention of future rendition flights, our international partners are aware that we would grant permission for a rendition flight to pass through UK territory or airspace only if we were satisfied that it would accord with our domestic law and international obligations. We expect all states to abide by their international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/1">The economic and political mismanagement of Zimbabwe over the past few years has made it increasingly difficult to control the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Health services have deteriorated significantly as trained health workers are unable to survive on meagre state salaries and vital medicines have been hard for the Government to source and distribute. Outreach services, which are essential to managing all three of these diseases, have broken down as a result of failing maintenance of vehicles, poor salaries, and a shortage of fuel and supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/2">While the HIV prevalence rate has decreased to 15.6 per cent, the number of people requiring anti-retroviral medicines (ARVs) continues to rise. Currently, 132,000 people are able to access ARVs while about 340,000 require them. The UK is providing &pound;24 million this year for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of critical health needs in Zimbabwe. This includes &pound;10 million to respond to HIV and AIDS including support to ARVs, prevention and mitigation, &pound;6 million for the procurement and distribution of vital medicines to treat all three diseases, &pound;250,000 to support an emergency indoor spraying programme to avert a malaria epidemic this year and &pound;5 million to address the particular needs of pregnant women and their newborns, including the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. The Board of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has also approved a $500 million grant to Zimbabwe as part of its round 8 allocations. Around 5 per cent of this could be attributed to UK through core contributions to the Global Fund.</p>

The G8 has made significant commitments to promote international development and accelerate progress on health related targets since then.

	<p pid="a.49.5/1">The NHS Redress Act 2006 is a piece of framework legislation that will need to be enacted through secondary legislation.

	<p pid="a.49.5/2">The department considers it is currently more important to embed the general principles of wider redress across the National Health Service&mdash;those of apologies and explanations, a spirit of openness, a culture of learning from mistakes and robust investigation&mdash;rather than focusing on financial redress only for those cases:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.5/3">which are of low monetary value (currently envisaged to be under &pound;20,000);which satisfy set principles in tort law; andwhere financial compensation would be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.5/4">The significant and important area of work around complaints reform is currently underway and will be implemented in April 2009. It will lay the general foundations of redress, in its wider sense, across health and social care by:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.5/5">putting the patient or service user at the heart of any complaints process and ensuring that it will be easier and simpler for people wishing to make a complaint;moving to a more open, accessible, flexible and sensitive approach to responding to complaints;ensuring robust and appropriate investigation;emphasising the benefits of responding to complaints properly to help improve services; andlearning from mistakes.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.5/6">Once these principles are embedded across health and social care organisations, applying redress measures more specifically to any particular scheme or initiative (such as in the area of clinical negligence) can be considered further.</p>

This does not mean they are without a school place. In the majority of cases, local authorities will have made offers of a place at an alternative school or given the parents the opportunity to express further preferences for schools with vacant places. In addition, places are reallocated throughout the summer as a consequence of successful appeals and parents turning down the place they were offered.</p>

There is no evidence that small classes in the junior and secondary phases have such a decisive impact on standards or child development.

	<p pid="a.59.2/2">In September 2003, Ofwat provided guidance (RD35/03) to companies on charging non-household premises for surface water drainage by site-based area. It said that companies which are thinking of introducing site-area charging need to assess possible impacts on all customers' bills. In particular, companies will need to take into account the scale and speed of any bill changes to see whether they are reasonable and acceptable to customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">The Government support site-area charging for surface water drainage in principle because it encourages measures such as permeable paving and soakaways which reduce the amount of water routed into the public sewers, which themselves have limited drainage capacity. However, they recognise that it is wrong if customers such as faith buildings are facing hikes in their bills of several hundred per cent, and where there are massive variations between what is being charged in different areas by different companies.</p>
