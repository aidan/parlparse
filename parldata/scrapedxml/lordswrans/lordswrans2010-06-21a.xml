The assessment of glyphosate, which was carried out as part of the first review under Council Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances used in the European Union, concluded that it was of low acute toxicity to earthworms and posed a low risk. Studies on soil micro-organisms noted no effects, even when glyphosate was applied at rates substantially higher than those authorised for field use, while studies on leaf litter concluded that glyphosate had no or only slight effects on litter decomposition at concentrations that occur in the environment after treatment. The soil's ability to provide nutrients should not be affected by glyphosate, since its structure and function are not affected by the substance.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.6/1">In her statement of <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-21">21 May</phrase> on the Nagorno Karabakh &quot;elections&quot;, Baroness Ashton recalled the EU's readiness to offer further support to the work of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Minsk Group and efforts to find a negotiated solution to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. EU efforts in support of the Minsk Group are rightly guided by the advice and wishes of the co-chairs and the parties to the conflict. Present efforts include the work of the EU's Special Representative for the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby. The EU has also recently launched a new &#8364;2 million programme to support people to people peace-building projects in the region. The programme builds upon previous work funded by the UK Conflict Pool-which until the launch of this new EU programme was the only international funding for this sort of work on Nagorno Karabakh. UK bilateral funding, through the Conflict Pool, continues, as do our own bilateral efforts to encourage Armenia and Azerbaijan to work with the Minsk Group to resolve the conflict.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">We believe there is a need for both patients and clinicians to be able to access patient records in an electronic form. This is part of our thinking about making information transparent and available, while involving patients in decisions about their healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/2">Effective use of the summary care record (SCR) depends on patients and doctors feeling an ownership of the records rather than them being perceived as something imposed by Government. We believe the current processes that are in place need to be reviewed to ensure that both the information that patients receive, and the process by which they opt-out, are as clear and simple as possible. In addition, should patients choose to opt-out they must be able to do so as early in the process as is feasible. Foremost in our minds is the need to ensure the security of the data contained in the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/3">We intend to review the content of the record and consider whether we can improve the process whereby patients can opt-out. We will also agree with the key stakeholders what should be added to the record and over what timescale. This work will form part of a wider project to review how information and technology can be leveraged within the health service. Strategic health authorities have been informed that no further information letters should be sent out to patients about the SCR until after the review has concluded.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.5/1">The Secretary of State has announced that government funding for regional local authority leaders' boards-which took over most of the functions and staff of the old regional assemblies-has been ended. This does not need to await the repeal of Section 5 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 and will produce an annual saving of &#163;16 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.5/2">The dismantling of these boards will remove a needlessly complex bureaucracy and see local authorities put firmly back in control of planning in their areas. This will ensure local people can hold their leaders to account.</p>

In the case of Somaliland, there are a number of relevant factors, including UN resolutions and the UN-sponsored peace process, as well as the positions of Africa Union member states.
