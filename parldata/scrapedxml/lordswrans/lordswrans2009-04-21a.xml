The understanding from our US colleagues is that these individuals have been sentenced for charges related to murder, terrorism, insurgency and kidnapping. The UK is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances and works proactively with EU partners for its abolition around the world.

In Iraq, the legal position is unclear. The law appears to criminalise homosexual acts with individuals under the age of 18. We are seeking to clarify whether homosexuality is criminalised per se. The UK continues to press the Government of Iraq and members of the Iraqi council of representatives to protect all of Iraq's communities, regardless of faith, political persuasion and sexual orientation and to take tough action against those responsible for violence and intimidation.</p>

Working with international partners, the Department for International Development (DfID) has made available a &pound;10 million support package of direct responses to the epidemic itself and to boost essential medicine and supplies to help keep people alive through the worst of the crisis. The numbers of new cholera cases is now dropping sharply and the worst of the outbreak appears to be over. We continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

We and the international community stand ready to support with development assistance when we see evidence of a commitment to economic and social reform and to the welfare of the population as a whole. In the mean time, we will continue to provide humanitarian and other essential help.
