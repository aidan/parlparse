The submission of evidence by selected organisations is a key element in pre-legislative scrutiny. It is also quite common for Select Committees, in this and another place, to take evidence on Bills which are before Parliament. The Government are willing to explore further how stakeholder organisations, and the public more widely, might be more closely involved in the legislative process, for example by more effective use of new communications technology.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.5/1">We are encouraging the World Food Programme (WFP) to undertake an impact assessment of the effects of the food cutbacks that were made in 2003 in order to understand the implications of the shortage on the most vulnerable sections of the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/2">Monitoring and access remain a key concern to us. There have been small improvements in terms of monitoring, including better access to government warehouses, a more systematic distribution system and better tracking of commodities. We remain engaged with WFP on the issue of diversion and believe that it is ensuring to the best of its ability that the food reaches the most needy.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/3">While not directly funding WFP in North Korea, we contribute 19 per cent of the EC's aid budget, under which food assistance is provided. The latest contribution of 5 million euros for six months' assistance will take the form of therapeutic food, vitamins and minerals, to both treat and prevent the deterioration of the nutritional status of vulnerable North Korean children and their mothers. This intervention will take place through specific healthcare centres and children's homes, and their clinical nature will make diversion less likely. In addition, the nutritional status of the target group can be monitored routinely, thus ensuring the assistance reaches its intended beneficiaries.</p>
