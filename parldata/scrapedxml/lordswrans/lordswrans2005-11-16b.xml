	<p pid="b.148.0/1">The education system in England is widely recognised as a success. In 1997, a third of children left primary school without the skills to make proper progress to secondary school; in 2005, 79 per cent. of pupils at key stage 2 are now achieving at least level 4 in English and 75 per cent. are doing so in maths. This summer, 56 per cent. of 15 year-olds achieved five or more good GCSEs, compared with 45 per cent. in 1997. The greatest progress is being made in our most disadvantaged areas. For example, 50 per cent. of pupils in inner London now get five or more good GCSEs, compared with a third in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.0/2">We must now ensure that the needs of every pupil are catered for. The attainment gap between different socio-economic groups is still too great. While there has been a sharp improvement in the number of good schools, there are too many children being let down by schools that are coasting.

	<p pid="b.148.3/1">This case concerned the tax treatment of maintenance payments made by a father to the mother of his daughter for the benefit of their daughter. The couple in question had never been married. The court decided that as parents (whether previously married or not) had a legal obligation to maintain their children after a relationship had broken down, there was no objective justification for differentiating between previously married or unmarried fathers in terms of the tax treatment of the maintenance payments. The Government have decided not to appeal against the decision and the decision became final in October. The ruling focuses on tax treatment for payments made to support children after the breakdown of a relationship and gives no grounds for the Government to be concerned about impacts on marriage or inheritance.</p>

	<p pid="b.152.2/1">As stated in my previous Answer, individuals arrested under the Terrorism Act may be charged and convicted under a range of other legislation including that for murder, explosives, firearms and so on. Since your Question, work has been commissioned for the provision of a breakdown of proceedings under the Terrorism Act 2000. Our statistics show that from <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, 23 people have been convicted under the Terrorism Act 2000. It should be noted that the information in the attached tables, taken from the Home Office court proceedings database, relates to the number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates' courts, found guilty and sentenced at all courts for offences under the Terrorism Act 2000 for England and Wales in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Because the figures do not relate to the same period the available tables will not reflect all 23 convictions. The figures in the attached relate to persons for whom these were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been proceeded against for two or more offences it is the offence for which he/she is found guilty, and where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe. The figures given are a further breakdown of those published in <i>Criminal Statistics, England and Wales</i> for 2001, 2002 and 2003, supplementary tables, volume one, table S1.1(A) and the annex. Since it takes several months for court proceedings data to be received by the Home Office, validated and corrected, RDS will not publish statistics on court proceedings for 2004 until the end of November 2005.</p>
