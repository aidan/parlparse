An extra company of US troops will support ISAF in Kabul, in addition to 1,000 extra US troops who will operate as part of the coalition. NATO will have further troops ready to respond if required. As announced by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-25">25 August</phrase>, in addition to our existing commitments, the UK is deploying six RAF Harrier GR7 aircraft to Kandahar for an initial period of nine months, supported by some 230 personnel.

	<p pid="a.3.5/1">It is clearly essential that Afghan National Army (ANA) and Police Force (ANP) personnel are properly paid. We are aware that there have been some limited problems with payments and we have encouraged the US (which leads international support for the ANA), Germany (for the ANP) and the Afghan Government (whose ministries oversee the payments) to improve the system of payment. But this has not affected security outside Kabul. On the contrary, ANA and ANP units regularly contribute to resolving conflicts in the regions, most recently in Herat following the removal of former Governor Ismael Khan. And the ANA has also contributed effectively to coalition missions in the south and east.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/2">The process of demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) of militia personnel has been slower than we would have liked. But progress is being made. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-07">7 September</phrase>, President Karzai issued a decree adding a further 27,000 to the total number of militia to be disarmed, in addition to the 13,000 processed so far.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.2/1">Under the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, members of the diplomatic staff of an Embassy or High Commission who are British nationals may not be appointed without the consent of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Where such cases arise, they are decided on their individual merits. In accordance with long-standing arrangements, members of a diplomatic mission of a Commonwealth country and of Ireland who are both nationals of that country and British nationals are treated, for the purposes of privileges and immunities, as if they were not British nationals. They are therefore entitled to full diplomatic privileges and immunities. Members of foreign diplomatic missions who are British nationals or permanent residents of the United Kingdom are not entitled to any privileges or immunities beyond immunity for acts performed in the course of their official functions. It is not the practice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to make public details concerning individual diplomats, other than those published in the London Diplomatic List.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.0/1">Revised Military Tasks were detailed in the volume of Supporting Essays accompanying the 2003 Defence White Paper, <i>Delivering Security in a Changing World</i> (Cm 6041). The United Kingdom maintains forces to ensure the integrity of its territorial waters and, where necessary, in the surrounding seas, as a Standing Home Commitment (Military Task 2.3). This includes maritime counter-terrorism and protection against renegade shipping. Any requirements for the protection of merchant shipping outside this area are considered on a contingent basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.3/1">The threat from terrorists and piracy is kept under constant review, and the Ministry of Defence works closely with other government departments on the protection of merchant shipping. The Royal Navy's world-wide Maritime Trade Operations&mdash;known as UK MTO arrangements&mdash;enable a number of options to be offered in support of merchant shipping, graduated to the prevailing threat. These range from the provision of routine advice and guidance through to a more formal arrangement of naval supervision, which might for example, include specific routing. The appropriate level of MTO support required in a given area remains under constant assessment. For example, UK MTO arrangements in the Gulf have been enhanced since October 2001 by the establishment of a UK MTO Liaison cell in the region. If necessary, from this position, higher level Maritime Trade Operations can be implemented very quickly.</p>

A waiver of these requirements may be granted, in exceptional circumstances, to applicants who are British or Commonwealth citizens, or Republic of Ireland nationals, at the time of their application. In the interest of the Service, and for the individuals' careers themselves, a small number of Royal Navy Commonwealth personnel are opting to apply for either dual or full British citizenship.

	<p pid="a.18.5/1">Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are useful for law enforcement purposes for a variety of reasons and not simply to instigate money laundering investigations. For example, SARs may be used to enhance intelligence relating to on-going law enforcement or revenue investigations, where money may not be the main predicate offence; they may be used for providing leads for targeted cash seizure; or they may be held on relevant intelligence databases for use in future cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/2">Given the variety of ways in which this information is used, it is not possible to link particular SARs with particular prosecutions and convictions. But the reporting system is a key element of the United Kingdom's defences against money laundering. In their 2003 review for the Government of the SAR regime, the consultants KPMG examined a sample of SARs. Of those whose impact could be specifically identified, one-third were found to have contributed to a positive law enforcement outcome such as prosecution, confiscation of criminal proceeds or cash seizure. More recent analysis by National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) in relation to the impact of one category of SAR (those where an institution has sought consent to proceed with a transaction) suggests that during 2003 &pound;25 million of assets have been seized, restrained or returned to the victim.</p>

Detention at Dover and Haslar, as with other immigration removal centres, is most usually appropriate in the following circumstances: initially, to establish identity and the basis of claim; where there are reasonable grounds for believing that an individual will not comply with the conditions of temporary admission or release; or to effect removal. In all cases detention is subject to regular and frequent review at successively higher levels within the Immigration Service to ensure that continued detention remains appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.5/3" class="indent">introduce a new offence of protesting outside homes in such a way that causes harassment, alarm or distress to residents;</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/4" class="indent">amend the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 to extend it to harassment of two or more persons who are connected, for example employees of the same company.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.5/5">These new proposals will strengthen ongoing action by the Government, police and Crown Prosecution Service and the courts to enforce existing legislation robustly and to ensure effective co-ordination to combat the criminal activities of extremists.</p>

Smallpox vaccine contains 'live' vaccinia (Cowpox) virus which induces immunity against variola virus, the cause of smallpox. The vaccinia virus in smallpox vaccine is known to cause adverse effects in some vaccinees and there is a wealth of evidence from studies conducted during past vaccination campaigns both in the United Kingdom and the United States from which the risks of such effects are quantified.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/1">The lack of centrally maintained data mentioned in my earlier answer makes a detailed response impossible. Damages may be awarded under Section 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 only where a person establishes that his convention rights have been or would be infringed by the act of a public authority. The statutory regime of Section 8 is more restrictive than the principles which govern the award of damages for breaches of private law obligations. Damages are only to be awarded where necessary to afford just satisfaction to the claimant and in many cases the award of damages will not be so necessary. In making this assessment Section 8(4) requires the court to take into account the principles applied by the European Court of Human Rights in awarding compensation: the European Court does not make such awards as a matter of course and the amounts awarded tend to be modest. The courts also recognise, where damages are necessary, that a balance must be struck between the interests of the claimant in being compensated and the wider interests of the public at large. The statutory regime therefore guards against both excessive awards and a compensation culture.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">A research study funded by Defra which reported in 2000 suggested that beef herds were three times less likely to have a TB breakdown than mixed dairy/beef herds and five times less likely than dairy herds. It also indicated that between 1986 and 1996, annual TB incidence increased and this increase was particularly marked in dairy herds and larger herds.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/2">Defra is not carrying out any research into the effect on TB incidence of factors such as in-breeding of dairy stock, increased milk yields and cross-breeding beef cattle might have.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/3">Defra has only recently introduced a comprehensive cattle tracing database that allows the impact of cattle movements to be analysed accurately as a variable affecting the occurrence of TB. Analysis of data from the ongoing TB99 epidemiological survey has identified a number of factors which appear to put a farm at greater risk of suffering a TB breakdown and these include the movement of animals on to the farm. Further analyses of TB99 data are being undertaken, and these include the use of cattle movement data (given the early indications of cattle movement as an important factor in the spread of cattle TB, locally and nationally). The TB99 survey also attempts to identify, among other things, if organic farm status and, more generally, the herd type have any influence on TB risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/4">An analysis of pre-foot and mouth disease outbreak TB99 data, covering factors that have emerged as having significance for TB in herds, is expected to be published soon in the Royal Society journal <i>Biology Letters</i>.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.5/1">The survey being conducted in the Furness Peninsual is not part of the road traffic accident (RTA) survey being carried out in the seven counties. The purposes of the two separate RTA surveys differ&mdash;in Furness the objective was to check if TB was in the local wildlife populations, by using road-killed carcasses as a sample resource, since this would help to inform us of the appropriate TB testing frequency to apply. As the absence of TB in any carcasses checked was informative within the broad purpose of the survey, it was logical to disclose the information to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/2">The purpose of the much larger survey in the seven counties is to obtain region-specific estimates of infection prevalence in badgers. The independent scientific group has advised that before these prevalence estimates can be interpreted, the data must be compared with those from the randomised badger culling trial, matching the two datasets in time and location as far as possible. This comparison will, it is hoped, tell us how well such surveys reflect the level of TB in badgers, and whether such surveys could be used reliably to detect the spread or the increase of TB to, or within, an area and hence flag an increased risk for cattle. Release of data should await the time when they have been suitably analysed and conclusion reached. This work is in hand and results are expected to be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">Yes. The Government do regard this as a priority. As part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan process the red squirrel was identified as a priority species and has its own species action plan, a commitment of government resources to protect the red squirrel in the UK. The UK Red Squirrel Group was set up as a partnership to lead this action plan and continues to co-ordinate action for the conservation of the red squirrel in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.5/1">Assuming that the survey sample and the opinions expressed were a true representation of the UK public then it is heartening to see that a conservation issue appears to have reached so many people, as communication and awareness raising are important objectives of the species action plan for the red squirrel in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.5/2">This is encouraging support for the work that is currently being planned or undertaken in priority sites for red squirrels throughout the UK. Active grey squirrel control to reduce the possibility of their incursion into red squirrel woodland is part of the recommended actions of the UK Red Squirrel Group to land owners and is being carried out by the partners of UKRSG that are land owner/managers. This targeted control is seen as an essential part of a strategy that also includes habitat management, to make these sites less attractive to grey squirrels. For this strategy to work there needs to be wide co-ordination and partnership co-operation of all the connecting woodland owners. Increased support for this method would serve to strengthen this strategy and further help to protect the red squirrels.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">The department issued and consulted on the Government's response to the review of non-native species policy in December 2003. The response set out the Government's initial views in responding to the detailed review report.

	<p pid="a.41.2/2" class="indent">(i) preventing new introductions of non-native species; (ii) early detection and control of new introductions; and (iii) management of established invasive non-native species.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/3">The Government agreed with the review working group that the development of comprehensive risk assessment procedures to assess the risks posed by non-native species is a priority, as it would inform further prevention action.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/4">The department has commissioned research to develop a standardised system that would enable the risk of species becoming invasive to be routinely assessed.

The purpose of this meeting was to explore how Defra can work with FARMA on the common goals of reconnecting farmers to their markets and helping them to add value. The meeting included a discussion on FARMA's priorities and how projects to take these forward might be supported under various grant schemes&mdash;in particular the rural enterprise scheme (RES) and the agriculture development scheme (ADS). Farmers' markets at both a regional and national level have received funding under those schemes in the past. Most recently, an award of &pound;100,256 to the National Association of Farmers' Markets (NAFM), now FARMA, was made in April 2003 to raise the profile of farmers' markets across England and to increase public awareness of them. The meeting also covered how FARMA could raise its profile with the regional development agencies (RDAs). As a result representatives from FARMA have been invited to give a presentation to Defra's regional food cross-cutting group, which includes representatives from the RDAs, the Countryside Agency and the Food Standards Agency, at the end of this month.</p>

Defra has already provided &pound;24,364 to NAFM to help it to develop the certification scheme for accrediting farmers' markets. The scheme is an important factor in preserving the integrity of and, therefore, consumers' confidence in, farmers' markets. Any further request from FARMA for funding to address this issue would be considered in the same way as any other application for grant.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.5/1">Public procurement is based on value for money, defined as the optimum combination of whole-life cost and quality to meet the user's requirement. Strengthening sustainability considerations in public procurement provides an opportunity to drive up standards and to achieve social and environmental as well as economic objectives consistent with public procurement policy. In accordance with the recommendations in Sir Peter Gerson's report, the Government will be seeking deals at national, regional and local levels depending on which is most appropriate. In working to achieve those deals we will take account of our policies on sustainable procurement and the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in public sector contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/2">Defra is implementing category management as its preferred delivery mechanism for the contracting of common commodities across the Defra family. This approach to supply chain management involves extensive market analysis and consultation (including supplier conferences) to ensure that the construction of tenders is inclusive and encourages a variety of bids and innovative approaches having full regard for sustainability principles and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/3">The UK's farmers and growers have an important part to play in our sustainable development objectives. They have the potential to supply food to public sector organisations either as direct contractors or as lower-tier suppliers under a subcontract. The public sector food procurement initiative, as part of the food chain work stream helping to implement the sustainable farming and food strategy for England, is encouraging local producers to compete for more public sector business. It is important that local producers are made aware of the opportunities that arise and of the procurement process. They need to consider their capacity for meeting demand and whether they should collaborate with other producers to increase their chances of winning contracts and subcontracts. Above all, it is right and proper that local producers win public sector business following fair and open competition for contracts that are designed to be efficient and so provide best value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.5/1">The stalking of wild mammals, including mink and otters, and flushing them out of cover is exempt hunting under the Bill if certain conditions are observed. These relate to the purpose of the hunting, the land on which it takes place, the number of dogs used, the use of dogs below ground, and the care of the hunters to despatch the quarry quickly and to maintain control of their dogs. The hunting of rats is exempt subject only to the hunter owning the land or having the owner's permission. The Government would be pleased to work with others to develop a code of practice to ensure that pests can be controlled effectively within the new regulations.</p>

Some of the material, however, cannot be released before the end of the 100-year closure period because it contains sensitive information.</p>
