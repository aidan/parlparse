	<p pid="a.211.2/1">Trade relations between the EU and Moldova are covered by a partnership and co-operation agreement under which Moldova's exports to the EC receive most favoured nation (MFN) treatment. In addition, as a developing country, Moldova benefits from the EC's generalised system of preferences (GSP) under which a large proportion of Moldovan exports to the EC enjoy a preferential tariff rate below that of the MFN rate. Since 2000, Moldova has also received additional reductions of customs duties under GSP as an ILO application country. Currently Moldova does not take full advantage of existing preferences offered under GSP.</p>

It has been used to respond to the crises in southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, Palestine and elsewhere. DfID has a budget of just under &pound;100 million for responding to rapid onset emergencies in poor countries, as well as the contingency reserve for 2003&ndash;04, which is unallocated, both of which we would draw on for any Iraq emergency to supplement funds available from the Iraq aid framework. Combined with the department's existing programme of humanitarian support for Iraq, this might mean up to around &pound;65 million could be available for Iraq for response to immediate needs. Discussions are taking place with other government departments on how Iraq's further funding needs could be met.</p>

It is, however, ultimately up to individual authorities to develop their own systems for monitoring the effectiveness of the support provided for children with special educational needs in their areas in the light of local needs and circumstances. They may of course want to approach other successful authorities for information and advice in doing so. The Government welcome and encourage the sharing of practice in this way, rather than commending one particular approach as a model, given differing local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.3/2">Guidance on approaches to the distribution of resources for meeting the needs of children with special educational needs is given in The Distribution of Resources to Support Inclusion, which was published by the Department for Education and Skills in November 2001. The network of 11 special educational needs regional partnerships brings together local education authorities, health and social services and voluntary agencies to share knowledge and expertise. The partnerships have focused on effective practice on monitoring and accountability for SEN. Monitoring and accountability will also be developed further as part of the special educational needs action programme, to be published later this year.</p>
