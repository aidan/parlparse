	<p pid="b.117.2/1">The Government are already implementing a range of initiatives to improve the administration of Section 4 support. As a result, the time taken for initial decisions has been reduced to less than five days, dedicated helpline numbers and an e-mail inquiry point have been established, and housing inspections are taking place on properties occupied by those on Section 4 support. We will continue to liaise with external stakeholders, including the Citizens Advice Bureaux (CAB), on administrative issues that are identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.2/2">While the Government have made clear that they do not intend to provide Section 4 support in cash, we have already been reviewing a number of the areas where the CAB has criticised the current arrangements. This includes ensuring that the handling of cases by the new asylum model supports the transition to Section 4 support in appropriate cases, and also maternity and healthcare provision. We will continue to engage with stakeholders on matters relating to Section 4.</p>

	<p pid="b.117.35/1">Extradition to the United States is governed by Statutory Instrument 2003, No. 3334, which designates the US as a territory not required to provide prima facie evidence in support of extradition requests made to the UK. The Government have no intention of removing the US from this order. The decision to remove the prima facie requirement from the US addressed a previous imbalance in that the UK required a higher standard of evidence than the US.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.35/2">The US was required to present a prima facie evidential case in support of extradition requests made to the UK, whereas the UK only had to demonstrate &quot;probable cause&quot;. Probable cause is a requirement of the US Bill of Rights, which it cannot amend. The Government are happy to respect that requirement. Total reciprocity in extradition relations is not possible because of the differences between separate legal systems, rules of evidence and case law. However, the new treaty and the Extradition Act 2003 have improved the balance in extradition relations between the UK and the US.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.35/3">The &quot;probable cause&quot; test is broadly comparable to the requirement under Section 71 of the Extradition Act 2003 for,</p>
	<p pid="b.117.35/4" class="indent">&quot;information that would justify the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person accused (or convicted) of the offence within the judge's jurisdiction&quot;,</p>

	<p pid="b.117.38/2">The Police Service of Northern Ireland has advised that figures are not available on the numbers of recorded incidents of arson, as these are recorded against the owner's address rather than as an &quot;alleyway incident&quot;. &quot;Alleygating&quot;, whereby locked gates are placed at both ends of an alley, thus making it a private space to which residents have a key, is being rolled out across Belfast. This citywide initiative is being co-ordinated by Belfast City Council Community Safety Unit. Initial pilots have seen a remarkable reduction in levels of anti-social behaviour in those areas. The community safety wardens scheme in the Holylands area has improved the local environment and should reduce bin burning in the area.</p>

On the basis of a site selection exercise undertaken by the Strategic Investment Board (SIB) on behalf of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) between 2004 and 2005, Ministers decided in March 2005 that the Maze/Long Kesh was the only suitable location in Northern Ireland for a proposed multi-sports stadium. DCAL and SIB officials are, as a consequence, currently considering a range of issues in relation to the construction of the stadium at the Maze/Long Kesh.</p>
