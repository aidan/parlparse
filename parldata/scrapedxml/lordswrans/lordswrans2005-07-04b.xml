This includes photographic records. English Heritage's staff and volunteers have the right to enter publicly accessible land surrounding listed buildings. Privately owned land is generally entered only with the consent of the owner or occupier. However, in very limited circumstances any person may be authorised to enter any land by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a local planning authority or, where a building is in Greater London, English Heritage. This can only be for specified purposes relating to the protection of the historic environment, for example, to ascertain whether an offence has been committed of carrying out unauthorised works to a listed building or to ascertain whether any building on the land is being maintained in a proper state of repair.</p>

An evaluation of the dialogue by the EU in October 2004 found that there had been little overall progress in the human rights situation since the start of the process.

I regret that the original reply was based on this data rather than the data contained in the recorded crime. Since 2002&ndash;03, the recorded crime database has stored numbers of offences recorded by the police at basic command unit (BCU) level and crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP) level. Birmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool and Manchester are all CDRP areas. The average rate per year of homicides for the period 2002&ndash;03 to 2003&ndash;04 is Birmingham 3.01, Cardiff 0.98, Liverpool 2.95 and Manchester 4.31.

Regrettably, we fell well short of that standard of service in this instance and I apologise for the administrative oversight which caused such a delay. During 2004&ndash;05 IND received over 38,700 letters from Members of Parliament. This represented an increase of 53 per cent over 2003&ndash;04. Such an increase has inevitably resulted in replies to some letters being delayed. We are however currently putting in place an action plan to get us to the 95 per cent target.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.6/1">The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of October 2001 estimated that 468,563 oil storage tanks in the commercial sector would be affected by the Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations 2001. Costs to a typical business were estimated at &pound;265 to &pound;487 and estimated costs for all sectors (commercial, industrial and institutional) discounted to 1999 prices were:</p>
	<table>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.62.6/10">The RIA did not seek to distinguish costs for the three sectors but it did make allowance for the fact that some tanks affected would already be wholly or partially compliant.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.6/11">The regulations are being brought into force in three stages. The final date when all tanks must be compliant is <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.6/12">Further details of costs and assumptions are given in the Regulatory and Environment Impact Assessment included in the guidance note for the Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations 2001.

	<p pid="b.64.3/1">The UK Government work in partnership with a number of countries and organisations to promote sustainable management of rainforests and to protect the livelihoods of indigenous people.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/2">In west and central Africa the Department for International Development (DfID) has recently designed a new programme of work on forest governance and trade. This will focus on reforms in Ghana and Cameroon, where EU forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) partnership agreements will help strengthen forest governance and tackle illegal logging. Support is being provided to civil society organisations and advocacy groups to strengthen demand for accountable and transparent forest governance that benefits the poor. We are also supporting civil society strengthening and dialogue between governments, the private sector and NGOs in the wider Congo Basin region.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/3">In Indonesia we have a programme of work under a memorandum of understanding, signed in 2002, that commits both governments to tackle illegal logging and associated trade. We also support the Multi-stakeholder Forestry Programme (MFP), which funds forestry initiatives driven by Indonesian citizens committed to improving local and national forestry conditions. It has successfully promoted the case for forest management for the benefit of the forest-dependent poor through its work in over 30 regencies across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/4">In Cambodia DfID has supported work on independent forest monitoring carried out by Global Witness. This project was aimed at building networks of local communities, local and national non-government organisations, industry members and government officials to monitor forestry infractions and to help bring about increased transparency in the forestry sector. Protecting the rights of indigenous people was central to this work but this aim has not yet been achieved in Cambodia.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/5">In Brazil DfID has contributed approximately &pound;14 million since 1993 to the &pound;186 million multi-donor pilot programme for the preservation of Brazilian rainforests. The ongoing indigenous peoples demonstration project has enhanced the capacity of indigenous peoples' organisations throughout Amazonia to preserve indigenous cultures, protect indigenous lands against encroachment from outsiders, and to identify and generate opportunities for economic development.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/6">In addition to our bilateral work, the UK Government work in partnership with a number of organisations to promote the sustainable management of rainforests and protect the livelihoods of indigenous people. The Department for International Development has provided support for the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) to carry out a detailed study of the impacts of illegal logging&mdash;and improved governance and law enforcement&mdash;on the livelihoods of the poor, including indigenous people. The Forest People's Programme, which represents the interests of indigenous people, helped to carry out this research. The results of this work have informed the EU's thinking about partnership agreements under its forest law enforcement, governance and trade action plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/7">DfID is also working with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations in support of the National Forest Programme Facility. This programme is enhancing the participation of civil society in the development of forest policies and programmes and is improving the organisation of forest-related civil society groups. It has provided financial support direct to civil society organisations in more than 20 countries so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/8">The World Bank's programme on forests (PROFOR), which DfID supports, focuses on building more people-centred and poverty-focused approaches to sustainable forest management. PROFOR is providing guidance on ways of integrating forest issues into poverty reduction strategies. Its work on the changing roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in forest management is giving greater voice to indigenous people's interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/9">DfID also supports the Forest Governance Learning Group, an alliance of independent agencies and partners in Sub-Saharan Africa facilitated by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). This group is working to make forest governance work for marginalised groups&mdash;including indigenous people. It has developed a series of practical guides and tools for pursuing improved governance.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.2/1">Illegal logging of the world's rainforests was discussed at the fifth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests in May 2005. UNFF is a high-level UN body for international debate and co-ordination on forestry issues. A side event on illegal logging was held to raise awareness of the issue among all countries. Illegal logging was also raised during the high-level ministerial segment attended by Mr Elliot Morley, Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). UNFF will meet again in February 2006 to consider future action on forest issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/2">The UK Government hold regular discussions with other EU member states on this issue. We are taking an active role in Europe to implement the EU's action plan on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT). This will close our borders to illegally logged timber. We will do this by the EU entering partnership agreements with timber producing countries and providing them with assistance to tackle illegal logging. The EU FLEGT Regulation&mdash;which we hope will be agreed by the end of the year under the UK's EU presidency&mdash;will deny access to EU markets of illegally harvested timber from partner countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/3">G8 Environment and Development Ministers met in Derby in March. Illegal logging was one of two main agenda items discussed at the meeting. Ministers agreed that tackling illegal logging requires action by both timber producing and consuming countries. G8 Ministers committed themselves to a range of actions to tackle their own demand of illegally logged timber and to help timber producing countries improve their forest governance. The recommendations of G8 Environment and Development Ministers on illegal logging will be put to heads at the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July for endorsement. In 2006 we will review progress against these commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/4">The UK is in discussion on this issue with those countries with whom we have a bilateral aid programme, including those with large areas of rainforest where illegal logging is a serious problem. Under the EU's action plan on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT), the Government aim for the EU to conclude partnership agreements by the end of 2006 with Cameroon, Ghana and Indonesia. Under these agreements partner countries will receive development assistance to help them implement reforms, improve forest governance, and tackle illegal logging. We will work with other member states who will lead on partnership agreements with other countries in central Africa, Asia and Latin America. Further details on our bilateral work are provided in the accompanying Answer to Parliamentary Question 736.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/5">The UK Government have been in discussion with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations in the preparation of guidelines on forest law compliance. FAO will now take this forward with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) to disseminate the guidelines at regional workshops.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/6">The UK is in discussion with the World Bank on the issue of illegal logging and supports their work on forest governance, livelihoods and finance under the Programme on Forests (PROFOR). With support from the UK and others, the World Bank facilitates regional forest law enforcement and governance (FLEG) processes in Asia, Africa and Europe and North Asia. This work helps to raise awareness of the problems of illegal logging, associated trade and corruption, and builds commitment to tackle them. Ministerial declarations on forest law enforcement and governance have been signed in East Asia (2001) and Africa (2003). Russia will host a ministerial conference for Europe and North Asia in November this year when it is hoped a similar declaration will be signed.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/7">The Department for International Development (DfID) provides financial support for a range of programmes conducted by the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and DfID.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/8">One of these assesses the implications of illegal logging&mdash; and the measures taken to control it&mdash;for the livelihoods of poor people. A second is promoting better due diligence in the finance sector that will encourage investors to check that environmental and social safeguards are being respected, A third is helping Asian countries to understand the dynamics of trade in the region and how it can drive illegal logging. DfID support to CIFOR is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/9">DfID supports the World Agroforestry Centre in its long-term research programme on the domestication and market development of indigenous tropical fruit trees. The aim of this research is to provide alternative income sources for poor people who depend on forest resources for their livelihoods. DfID support to the centre is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.2/10">Other work relevant to this subject that DfID supports is the policy research on illegal logging undertaken by Chatham House (the Royal Institute for International Affairs). DfID also supports the forest governance learning groups initiative facilitated by the International Institute for Environment and Development.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.5/1">The Rural Land Register (RLR) digitisation project was launched in April 2002 with the aim of converting alpha numeric land data, previously used by farmers to support subsidy claims, into a series of digital maps. Copies of the digital maps were sent to farmers to either confirm the land area concerned or make any amendments that might be required. The number of farmers whose holdings were digitised in this way was 76,587 and the percentage of farmers who required an amendment was 80 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.5/2">With the introduction of the single payment scheme and entry level stewardship scheme, farmers were advised that they could pre-register land. As a result RPA received 3,924 new land registrations in 2004 and 13,902 to date this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.5/3">Farmers can request modifications to their land registrations on an IACS 22 form. For years 2001&ndash;03 no separate record of the number of these applications was kept, but historically it has been a steady 9,000 per year. In 2004 RPA received 15,976 amendments and to date in 2005 has received 31,857.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.8/1">The Rural Land Register (RLR) digitisation project was launched in April 2002, through a team of external contractors based at the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) offices in Exeter and Northallerton. All the contractors received extensive training. They had access to comprehensive instructions and their work was subject to regular quality assurance checks, which were undertaken on the work of the team rather than on individual team members.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.8/2">During the digitisation process all farmers received a copy of their digitised maps. Some farmers sought to modify RPA's record of their land holding. In such circumstances the amendments provided were accepted where the changes adhered to scheme rules, such as measuring to the edge of a large ditch rather than the centre. Where the change did not meet scheme rules the digitiser would follow an agreed protocol rather than the amendment suggested by the farmer.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.8/3">Where farmers did not return their maps within the required time scale, or did not return them at all, RPA staff confirmed the digitised area through a final set of RLR maps. In total, 25,470 holdings for farmers who had previously received subsidy had their digitised area confirmed. Of these, 12,998 holdings were digitised by staff based at Northallerton. All such farmers were advised to send in an IACS 22 (amendment form) to confirm any changes required.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-07-04b.69.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050704/text/50704w05.htm#50704w05_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.69.2/1">While the numbers of medically downgraded personnel are centrally held, it is not possible to ascertain whether an individual has been downgraded below the standard for their arm or service, as the data only records when an individual has been medically downgraded to a level below which they are deployable. Deployability is determined by either the physical efficiency standard for Army or the medical employment standard for Navy and RAF. Fitness for arm or service is determined by the PULHHEEMS code (a system of medical classification) and differs for each arm and service.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.2/2">Of the three services, only the Army and the RAF are running redundancy programmes. In the Army, some 120 officers were selected for redundancy, all of whom, at the time of the redundancy board, met the appropriate medical standards. A second phase of redundancy is still to be made but no personnel have yet been selected for or invited to express an interest in redundancy. In the RAF, of the 855 personnel permanently medically downgraded since April 2003, still serving in the RAF and still medically downgraded, some 15 are due to leave on redundancy terms. All personnel selected for redundancy are entitled to the appropriate redundancy &quot;compensation&quot;.</p>
