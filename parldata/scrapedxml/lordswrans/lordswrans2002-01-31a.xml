	<p pid="a.47.2/1">I have today written to the Law Commission asking it to undertake a scoping study to consider whether there are any problems arising from the use of intimidatory tactics, such as gagging writs and gagging letters. A copy of the terms of reference for this work has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The Law Commission will produce a short paper by the end of March 2002. It will also undertake some preliminary work with a view to a possible further scoping study on defamation and other issues arising from publication on the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/2">Concerns over gagging writs were originally raised during the passage of the Defamation Act 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/3">The Government subsequently announced that they intended to consult publicly on the perceived abuses of defamation procedures. We have since reconsidered the scope of the project, in the light of the rapidly developing case law in the field, to ensure that it deals aptly with all relevant areas of concern, including those raised by advances in electronic communication.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/1">The Cabinet Office guide on non-departmental public bodies states that &quot;NDPBs should hold Annual Open Meetings, where practicable and appropriate.

	<p pid="a.48.2/2">The guide advises that the summary reports of meetings should be easily obtainable. However, it goes on to state that, &quot;where the nature of the business is sensitive, commercial or political, an open meeting is not appropriate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/3">Determining the extent to which its discussions could be deemed sensitive, commercial or political is a matter for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/4">We understand that the commission does not hold open meetings but instead publishes the minutes of those meetings on its website. The commission's policy is to put out the minutes as soon as they are cleared for publication.</p>

We will ensure therefore that any police powers that might need to be used are appropriate for use by civilians. We will take account also of the need for escorts to have appropriate training and experience, the confidence of hauliers who use their services and appropriate recognition by other road users.

	<p pid="a.51.5/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary's meeting with Mme Guigou on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-21">21 January</phrase> was extremely constructive and built on the close relationship which has developed on immigration matters between the United Kingdom and French Governments. Amongst the issues discussed was the situation at Sangatte. My right honourable friend made it clear that we were prepared to consider innovative approaches including possible joint initiatives. Bilateral discussions will continue, including at official level.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/2">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary and Mme Guigou did not discuss the accidental deaths of several potential asylum seekers. Any death in such tragic circumstances is regrettable. However, we do not believe that there is any need for people to take such risks to reach the United Kingdom when, if they are in need of protection, they can apply for asylum in France.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.5/1">The Government have not set out any benefits associated with vehicles being equipped with bull bars, though some owners clearly see a certain utility value otherwise they would not fit them in the first place. When options for possible national action on bull bars were examined in 1997, it was estimated that the cost to the owner of removing a bull bar would include &pound;75 related to assumptions linked to loss of utility. In arriving at this figure no attempt was made to identify or value lost benefits. Some owners would obviously not bother with a replacement, but others might be willing to pay for a new &quot;approved&quot; replacement bull bar. An assumption was made that on average owners would replace their existing bull bar with a new pedestrian friendly one if the cost to them was &pound;75.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.2/1">We have today launched a package of measures to help the smooth introduction of the national minimum standards. This comprises:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/2" class="indent">(i) Comprehensive statutory guidance from Ministers under Section 6 of the Care Standards Act to the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) setting out the supportive way in which the standards should be applied. The guidance indicates that the standards should be used to help guide care homes on action they can take to improve their services. Time will be given to enable homes to meet the standards. Failure to meet standards will only be used as a reason to pursue de-registration in cases where services are a danger to vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/3" class="indent">(ii) An information pack will be distributed to all registered care providers during February explaining how the national minimum standards and regulations will be operated and how the NCSC will work.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/4" class="indent">(iii) A help line will be set up by the NCSC next month to answer questions from owners and managers of care homes about how the national minium standards might apply in their service.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/5">The NCSC has been set up to encourage the provision of good quality care in care homes, not to close them down. This package is designed to help the NCSC to achieve that.</p>

The website also features an interactive calculator where women can type in their date of birth to find out their state pension age and the date they will reach that. The department's state pension forecast letters and the accompanying leaflet also show the recipient's state pension age and explain who is affected by the changes to the state pension age for women.</p>

The Government take every opportunity, often working with our EU partners, to urge states to pursue laws and practices which foster freedom of expression. HMG regulary raise specific cases, where these rights, including those of journalists, have been breached. Freedom of expression is not absolute. National security is one area where restrictions may be placed on freedom of expression. Whether suspects are tried before civilian or military courts, it is clear that anyone who faces prosecution is entitled to a fair trial in accordance with international norms.</p>
