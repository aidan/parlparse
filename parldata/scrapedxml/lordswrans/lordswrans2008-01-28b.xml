	<p pid="b.77.5/1">Although a number of blood-based diagnostic tests for the detection of Mycobacterium bovis (M.bovis) infection in badgers have been developed through Defra-funded research, none of these is suitable for extensive field use. Post-mortem inspection and culture of M.bovis remains the most reliable method of diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.5/2">The currently available blood tests have been validated using blood from both infected and uninfected badgers. They are currently used to measure immune responses in research projects such as the development of vaccines for badgers. A difference between the two populations can be measured, but no test is 100 per cent sensitive or specific, so some false positive and false negative results will occur. It is difficult to find populations of badgers that are truly negative for bovine tuberculosis.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.0/3">The Prison Service conducted a detailed visitors survey in October 2006 in which over four-fifths of respondents said that they did not have any problems with travel arrangements to Magilligan prison, over three-quarters of respondents normally travel to Magilligan by &quot;private car&quot;. The Prison Service currently funds NIACRO to provide a transport service to Magilligan originating from Belfast (three days per week) and Dungannon/Cookstown (once a month).</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/4">In addition the prison provides a bus service from Bellarena station to the prison on Wednesdays and Saturdays. In recognition of the distance to Magilligan, the service operates extended morning and afternoon visiting sessions. Special arrangements can be made for family visitors to attend both morning and afternoon, especially where they have been unable to attend frequently.</p>

	<p pid="b.96.2/1">We have drawn international attention to the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) by: raising the issue at multilateral institutions such as the UN and the EU; through resolutions and statements, eg the EU's recent statement on the CPA's third anniversary and the UN's recent statement on the Sudan People's Liberation Movement's resumption of participation in the Government of National Unity; ministerial visits to and calls on key Sudanese leaders, for example, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development's July 2007 and my September 2007 visit to Sudan; and frequent contact with our closest international partners on matters related to CPA implementation.</p>

It is not possible to provide further details of the transactions or a breakdown of this figure due to the need to protect ongoing operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.6/1">Following a consultation exercise, vehicle excise duty for lorries was comprehensively reformed in 2001 better to reflect the environmental and road track costs of these vehicles. This reform simplified the number of bandings for lorries making vehicle excise duty less burdensome for hauliers to administer.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.6/2">The Treasury factors in a variety of evidence in assessing the overall effectiveness of vehicle excise duty across all vehicle types in helping to achieve the Government's priorities, but has not singled out rural affects for a specific assessment of lorry rates.</p>
