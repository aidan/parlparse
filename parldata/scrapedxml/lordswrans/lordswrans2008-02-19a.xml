	<p pid="a.30.5/1">The minimum age of entry into the UK Armed Forces is the school-leaving age of 16 years; recruitment is totally voluntary. The services provide challenging and constructive education, training and employment to many young people and provide them with valuable transferable skills. In the financial year 2006-07, 30 per cent of all new recruits were under 18 years of age.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/2">Across European Armed Forces the minimum recruiting age varies, with the lowest outside the UK being 17 years of age at last birthday.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/3">No young person, under the age of 18 years, may join the UK Armed Forces unless their application is accompanied by the formal written consent of his or her parents or guardian. Throughout the recruit selection process, the staffs at the Armed Forces Careers Offices provide comprehensive written and verbal guidance to all potential recruits, in particular those of less than 18 years of age, and their parents or guardians. This guidance covers the potential recruit's terms and conditions of service, the commitments that they would be undertaking, and their rights to discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/4">It is defence policy that service personnel under the age of 18 are not deployed on any operation, outside of the UK, which would result in them becoming engaged in, or exposed to, hostilities. In addition, in line with UN policy, service personnel under 18 are not deployed on UN peacekeeping operations.</p>

The detailed distribution of funding between the regions is based on objective analysis of relative needs for funding to support affordable housing, local authority decent homes and private sector regeneration.</p>

Our scientists have found that many reports on the subject on the world wide web and in media articles conflict with what is in the published scientific literature. It also conflicts with what is in the reports of independent and internationally respected organisations, such as the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Health Organisation and the Royal Society. Most recently, a paper published in the <I>Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology</I> concluded that &quot;veterans and civilians who did not occupy DU-contaminated vehicles are unlikely to have internalized quantities of DU significantly in excess of normal internalization of natural uranium from the environment&quot;. This reflects the international scientific consensus that neither the level of DU in the environment nor the risk to the health of civilians in Iraq is significant.</p>

The president requested technical assistance from the EU to support the Philippine Government's efforts to address the issue.

	<p pid="a.48.8/1">The Government's strategy for inter-urban rail services is to make the best use of existing networks by lengthening existing trains, increasing service frequencies and tackling key congestion pinch points.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.8/2">In other countries distances are often greater and congestion lower, so in some cases high-speed rail makes sense. The same does not necessarily apply to the shorter, more congested, corridors found in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.8/3">However, the Government have not ruled out high-speed lines in the future. Any work done by industry contributes to our understanding of the issues around new lines. We will view any ideas in a multi-modal context.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.0/1">We helped to convene two meetings in New York in January between the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and a number of countries to discuss helicopter provision for the African Union/UN hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID), after which the DPKO is following up with potential contributing countries. We remain in close contact with the DPKO and partners to discuss how we can continue to support efforts to find helicopters, as well as other support to UNAMID.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.3/1">The measures announced at PBR change established personal tax rules. Regulatory impact assessments are intended for measures which have a regulatory impact upon business.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/2">The Government announced a review of the residence and domicile personal tax rules in Budget 2002. The Chancellor announced the closure of this review as part of the recent Pre-Budget Report. HM Treasury is currently consulting on how the measures announced in the Pre-Budget Report will be implemented. This consultation runs until <phrase class="date" code="">28 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/3">Treasury Ministers have recently sought to clarify that there will be no retrospection in the treatment of trusts and the tax changes will not apply to gains accrued or realised prior to the changes coming into effect. The inheritance tax rules were outside the scope of the residence and domicile review.</p>

DfT published a progress report alongside the 2007 Pre-Budget Report. The study has raised a number of legal, technical and practical issues and DfT is considering the way forward.</p>
