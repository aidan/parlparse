	<p pid="a.125.5/1">Responsibility is placed on users of all weapons to ensure that their use complies with legal principles, including the requirement to focus attacks on military objectives and to seek to ensure that attacks are proportionate to the direct military advantage anticipated. The United Kingdom takes extensive steps to ensure that all weapons in our inventory can be used in this way and that attacks comply with the law affecting the UK. We choose weapons that are appropriate to the task and, depending on the operational and tactical circumstances, such munitions may include free-fall bombs. While our Armed Forces have made increasing use of precision guided weapons, unguided munitions provide a military capability that cannot be immediately replaced.</p>

The last study contained 124,743 workers of whom about one-third were MoD radiation workers or former radiation workers. The data are used to undertake epidemiological studies. In its second analysis of the data, published in July 1999, the National Radiological Protection Board concluded that overall death rates among radiation workers are below those in the general population. This is known as the healthy worker effect. The National Radiological Protection Board is intending to undertake the next analysis in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
