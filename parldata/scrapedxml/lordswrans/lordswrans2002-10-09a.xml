	<p pid="a.24.8/4" class="indent">(b) Primary Care Epidemiological studies report that the prevalence of personality disorder in primary care lies between 10 and 30 per cent (Dilling et al 1989; Casey &amp; Tyrer 1990).</p>

It will also be represented on commissioning consortia for specialist services and provide support and experience as well as ensuring consistency across primary care trusts. In cases of extreme failure by PCTs to fulfil their duties/functions, provision is made for an intervention order under Section 84A or a default order under Section 85 of the National Health Service Act 1977 as a result of which strategic health authorities could be directed to undertake the duties on behalf of the PCT.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.5/1">Ofwat has recently undertaken a consultation on flooding from sewers and in publishing the results has said that it will consider proposals from sewerage undertakers to spend more in carrying out more flood alleviation schemes in the period up to 2005. This should help to reduce the risk of sewer flooding cases. The report also said that for the period beyond 2005, consideration for increased expenditure will be taken account of in the periodic review of water prices. The Environment Agency, which incorporates the former National Rivers Authority and Pollution Inspectorate, will be involved in the periodic review process. The agency will also be required to assess the potential pollution from flooding of sites storing or processing toxic material, which would include sewage treatment facilities, as part of their future responsibilities under the Water Framework Directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.8/1">The Scotland Act 1998 established a Scottish Parliament and devolved to it the power to pass legislation within the boundaries of that Act. Her Majesty's Government do not oversee the vires of Scottish Parliament legislation for that is properly the function of the courts. Rather, Her Majesty's Government work closely with the Scottish Executive to ensure that legislation is prepared so as to be within the competence of the Scottish Parliament. The Government have a strong interest in ensuring that devolution works, and checking that legislation is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament plays a vital part in ensuring it keeps working. In the event that any legislative provision is thought to be ultra vires, then the Scotland Act provides that the matter may be referred by the Attorney-General, the Advocate-General or the Lord Advocate to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to decide on the issue. No such references have been made to date.</p>
