	<p pid="a.1.5/2">The services aim to manage in an appropriate manner the return from the rigours of active service to the very different conditions pertaining at home, acknowledging the stresses to which personnel have been subjected. The three services accord this normalisation process a high priority; although their procedures, which meet their particular needs, differ. All personnel are given a series of briefings covering a wide number of relevant issues such as driving safety, relationship expectation management and coping with stress. They are also given relevant points of contact to whom they can turn should they find themselves in need of help. Where a whole unit has been on active service, its personnel go together through a 36-48 hour decompression package in Cyprus. Bespoke arrangements are made for reservists which include interviews and specific aftercare briefs to ensure that they aware of the support available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3">The MoD has resettlement arrangements in place for all service leavers. Those who have served six years or more are entitled to the full resettlement programme which includes; a three-day career transition workshop, use of a career consultant, <sup>-</sup>a job finding service, re-training time and a re-training grant. Those who have served between four and five years are assisted with job search using career consultants while those with less than four years service are advised during internal unit resettlement interviews. The standard of MoD's resettlement provision was praised in the National Audit Office's July 2007 report <I>Leaving the Services</I>.</p>

The first MoD civilian chaplains to the Armed Forces from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faith communities were appointed in October 2005.

	<p pid="a.13.2/1">Warm Front is the Government's flagship scheme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England for vulnerable householders. The scheme currently provides grants for specified insulation and heating measures up to the value of &pound;2,700 or &pound;4,000 for oil central heating (including properties with no access to the gas network).</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/2">The Government recognise the specific challenge of assisting hard to treat properties in rural communities. The Warm Front Scheme Management Board considers on a regular basis whether to approve appropriate alternative technologies for the scheme, where they might prove cost-effective. The board will consider whether the technology is readily available and reliable, as well as whether there are sufficiently skilled people to install and repair the proposed measure and also how easy it is to use. One example is through Warm Front and National Energy Action and we are currently carrying out a pilot using solar thermal technology together with electric heating.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/3">In addition, Warm Front has a networking team which operates in rural areas to help bring assistance to vulnerable households in rural communities. Pro-actively engaging with local organisations and area-based schemes, it helps to increase the take-up of grants and energy efficiency advice in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/4">The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) is the Government's principal policy for driving up household energy efficiency in Britain out to 2011. Under CERT the major energy suppliers have an obligation to direct at least 40 per cent of carbon savings at priority group households. This includes important measures for hard-to-treat homes such as solid wall insulation and central heating. Suppliers installed around 80,000 heating measures through fuel switching in the previous three-year obligation period to March 2008 (Energy Efficiency Commitment Two). The Government recognised there is a high up-front cost for these measures and therefore under CERT we have introduced specific incentives to help improve the financial viability of fuel switching, with a particular focus on homes which are off the gas grid.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/5">The principal barrier to providing new connections to communities and households beyond the mains gas network is the cost to the customer. Ofgem recognises the benefits that access to gas offers low income households and has incentivised the large gas networks to connect deprived communities under the 2008-2013 Gas Distribution Price Control. This packages a range of existing funding sources and uses independent gas transporters with an aim of ensuring the maximum number of vulnerable and fuel poor households should be connected to the gas network at least cost. Those households assisted under the scheme qualify because they either reside within the 20 per cent most deprived areas according to the index of multiple deprivation, qualify for assistance under Warm Front (or similar schemes in the Devolved Nations) or fall within the priority group under CERT.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.0/1">For staff travelling with Select Committees, the House reimburses the costs of any reasonable insurance required, and would also reimburse reasonable losses if not covered by an insurance policy. Staff travelling outside the EU are advised to take out insurance; staff travelling within the EU are advised to carry the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/2">The House of Lords Staff Handbook makes provision for staff travelling on official business other than with Select Committees as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/3">&quot;30. Staff travelling overseas (and in the UK) are covered for death and injury benefits under the House of Lords Staff Pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/4">31. Illness not arising from an accident is not covered by these arrangements. Staff are expected to pay their own medical or dental charges which will be reimbursed by the House on production of receipted bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/5">32. It is sometimes difficult to obtain medical treatment overseas without evidence of private health insurance. Staff travelling overseas are therefore advised to take out comprehensive travel insurance to cover health and other insurable losses - money, baggage etc. The cost of the premiums is deemed to be covered by the elements within the subsistence allowances&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/6">The House of Commons offers personal accident and travel insurance cover to staff travelling on parliamentary business outside Great Britain. The House of Commons Staff Handbook provides that &quot;Staff who travel overseas on official business will be covered by the House's personal accident insurance policy&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.5/1">&pound;2.3 billion was the budget agreed under the Comprehensive Spending Review for the first three years of a programme that was always expected to take at least 10 years to deliver in full. In its latest report on the programme, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May 2008</phrase>, the National Audit Office made it clear that there have been no cost increases on the original contracts and that the increase in the eventual total cost from an estimated &pound;12.4 billion in 2006 to &pound;12.7 billions in 2008 was attributable to the procurement of additional systems and services. Of this total, some &pound;3.5 billion has been spent to date, as suppliers are paid only when systems have been successfully deployed and are working satisfactorily.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.0/1">The Written Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-26">26 January</phrase> (<I>WS 2-5</I>) included revised weighted capitation target figures per weighted head for primary care trusts (PCTs). The revision was required because of an administrative error in the preparation of the Answer to a Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-12">12 January</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-01-12.178"><I>Official Report, </I>col. 178W</phrase>). It was not due to the completion of the review of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation. PCT allocations for 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011 based on the new weighted capitation formula recommended by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-08">8 December</phrase> (<I>WS 34-44</I>).</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/2">The weighted capitation formula determines PCTs' target allocations based on the weighted needs of each PCT'S population. Weighted needs reflect the need for healthcare due to age and additional need over and above that due to age. The measure weighted capitation target per weighted head gives a very similar figure for each PCT to the average for England. This is because each PCT's weighted need is included in both their weighted target and weighted population. The alternative measure of weighted capitation target per unweighted head gives a wider range across PCTs, reflecting PCTs' populations' relative needs for healthcare services.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">The Sustainable Communities Plan, published in 2003, set out a long-term vision and programme of action to create decent homes in good quality local environments across England. As part of this plan, the Government set out actions related to construction methods. This included actions to promote modern methods of construction (MMC). MMC can be defined as construction that uses modern processes to provide more, better quality houses in less time. It can apply to homes built on and off-site.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/2">The Sustainable Communities Plan set out that some 25 per cent of the homes funded by the (then) Housing Corporation in the south-east would be built using MMC. In the two years following publication of the Sustainable Communities Plan (2004-05 and 2005-06) the Housing Corporation approved investment in London and the south-east which is resulting in the construction and delivery of 13,297 MMC units. This represents some 40 per cent of the total number of homes delivered in both regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/3">The vision set out in the Sustainable Communities Plan was for new housing to be more sustainable. It proposed that building regulations would be kept under review with this in mind, and set a new requirement that, as a condition of grant, all new homes funded by the public sector should achieve the Eco-Homes pass standard. This was put in place. However, since 2003, the Government have taken more steps to improve further the sustainability of new homes. The Code for Sustainable Homes (the code) became operational in 2007 and replaced Eco-Homes as the sustainable standard in house building. All homes supported by funding from the Homes and Communities Agency must now be built to code level 3. The code, like building regulations, is outcome based and does not require a particular construction method. However, using MMC may be useful to achieve code levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/4">Steps have also been taken to strengthen building regulations. In 2006, the Government published revisions to part L of the building regulations which set higher standards for energy performance. A policy commitment was published in July 2007 to control the water efficiency of new dwellings through changes to the building regulations. And in 2008 a consultation was launched on proposed changes that would add to part G of these regulations a requirement for new homes to be built to a water efficiency standard of 1251itres/person/day. We plan to publish a final revised version of part G and the accompanying guidance later in 2009 with the intention of it coming into force before the end of this calendar year.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/5">In July 2007, the Government confirmed their objective for all new homes to be zero carbon from 2016, to be achieved through a progressive tightening of the building regulations from the 2006 standard. And in their 2008 Budget, the Government set out an ambition for all new non-domestic buildings to be zero carbon from 2019, with an earlier target (2018) for new public sector buildings. The <I>Definition of Zero Carbon Homes and Non-Domestic Buildings </I>consultation, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-17">17 December 2008</phrase>, sets out the Government's current thinking in this area and calls for further evidence in anticipation of an in-depth consultation on new non-domestic buildings in 2009.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-02-23a.33.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100797" speakername="Baroness Morgan of Drefelin" colon=":" colnum="33"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90223w0006.htm#0902235000574">
	<p pid="a.33.0/1">The department does not give specific advice on fundraising related to any particular country. General advice to schools on fundraising for schools abroad is made available on the Global Gateway, the department's website for international links and partnerships for schools (see <a href="http://www.globalgateway.org/default.aspx?page=2798">www.globalgateway.org/default.aspx?page=2798</a>). The Government recommend that any assistance from the UK to Zimbabwean schools should be channelled through registered non-governmental organisations working in the education sector in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/2">UK schools seeking to establish a partnership with a school abroad can do so through the Global Gateway (<a href="http://www.globalgateway.org">www.globalgateway.org</a>), which includes a database of all schools that have registered an interest in establishing international school partnerships. The Global Gateway is available to all schools throughout the world wherever there is an internet connection and includes general advice on creating and maintaining sustainable school partnerships. More detailed advice to schools may be given on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/3">Schools can also form partnerships through DfID's Global School Partnerships programme. This promotes partnerships between schools in the UK and schools in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean (see <a href="http://www.globalgateway.org/default.aspx?page=3124">www.globalgateway.org/default.aspx?page=3124</a>). There are currently no active Global School Partnerships with Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.0/4">Teachers arranging study visits as part of their partnership are advised to check Foreign Office travel advice before they travel. Current travel advice for Zimbabwe is against all travel to high density, low-income suburban areas at any time; and all but essential travel to Harare city centre, rural Manicaland and farming areas.</p>
