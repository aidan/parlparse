	<p pid="a.147.5/1">A written consultation on these regulations was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-07">7 November 2007</phrase> and closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-19">19 December 2007</phrase> with the Farriers Registration Council (FRC), the Worshipful Company of Farriers, the UK Horse Shoers Union (UKHSU) and the National Association of Farriers, Blacksmiths and Agricultural Engineers. Responses were received from the FRC and the UKHSU. We also consulted regularly during the previous 18 months with the FRC as the regulator and competent authority as concerns farriery.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/2">The consultation paper made it clear that we were not consulting on the principles underlying directive 2005/36/EC. Its main provisions had already been transposed by the European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/2781) (&quot;the DIUS regulations&quot;) and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-19">19 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/3">The Farriers' Qualification (European Recognition) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/646) amend the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975 to give full effect to the DIUS regulations and to provide for registration of providers of temporary farriery services so that the Farriers Registration Council can regulate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/4">Concerns were raised during the consultation exercise that the directive's provisions, as concerns the freedom to provide services on a temporary and occasional basis, undermine the standards of farriery in the UK and threaten animal welfare. However, the provisions that determine whether a farrier from another EU member state is eligible to provide temporary services are covered by the DIUS regulations. DIUS consulted with the Farriers Registration Council on these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/5">Regarding the Farriers Qualifications (European Recognition) Regulations, some concern was expressed about the value of registering temporary services providers because it was thought they could escape disciplinary proceedings in this country by returning to their home country or another EU country. However, the directive imposes an obligation on competent authorities to exchange information about disciplinary action taken with each other which provides a safeguard against this. The Farriers Registration Council agreed that registration of temporary providers of farriery was the most appropriate way of managing them.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/6">In response to concerns raised, Defra explained that anything that stems from the wording of the directive is not amenable to mitigation, and cannot be changed. We also explained that the UK must transpose the directive in a way which is compatible with principles of EU law as derived from the treaty and case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).</p>

	<p pid="a.148.2/1">These regulations are necessary in order to fully implement directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications. Article 63 of directive 2005/36/EC imposes an obligation on EU member states to bring into force laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/2">The purpose of directive 2005/36/EC is to make it easier for qualified professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than their own by simplifying the recognition procedures. It is a consolidation of a number of existing directives relating to the recognition of professional qualifications including directive 1999/42/EC which previously dealt with farriers and gave rise to amendments to the Farriers Registration Act under SI 2002/1597.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/3">The main provisions of the directive were transposed by the European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/2781) (&quot;the DIUS regulations&quot;) including provisions concerning farriers, and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-19">19 October 2007</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.150.8/2">Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue and, as such, there are many possible measures of poverty. While income alone does not provide a wide enough measure of poverty, it is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement.</p>

We do not present information covering 40 per cent of median income in our <I>Households Below Average Income</I> series as it is not a sound measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards.

	<p pid="a.150.8/29" class="indent">5. This response includes a lower income threshold of 40 per cent of the contemporary median income. The data for households with an income lower than 50 per cent of median are not considered accurate as an indicator of living standards. Many of these households having very low incomes would not be considered poor, but genuinely have few sources of income in the short-run. These figures are not National Statistics and caution must be applied because those people stating the lowest incomes in the FRS may not actually have the lowest living standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.8/30" class="indent">6. Figures have been presented on both a &quot;before housing cost&quot; and &quot;after housing cost&quot; basis. For &quot;before housing cost&quot;, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage-interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for &quot;after housing cost&quot; they are. This means that &quot;after housing cost&quot; incomes will generally be lower than &quot;before housing cost&quot;.</p>
