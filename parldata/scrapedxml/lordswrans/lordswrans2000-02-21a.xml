	<p pid="a.1.2/2">UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1160 imposed an arms embargo on the FRY.

We have notified the UN Sanctions Committee on this export and they have raised no objection. The export of the equipment required for demining purposes is not prohibited by the EU arms embargo.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/2">Tenants should be in no doubt, however, that anti-social or nuisance behaviour, either by themselves, or by their family or visitors, is unacceptable and may lead to the loss of their tenancy. Ground 2 of Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985, as amended by the Housing Act 1996, enables local authority landlords to seek possession of a tenancy if a tenant, or a person residing in or visiting the dwelling house, has been convicted of an arrestable offence committed in, or in the locality of, the dwelling. It is for the courts to decide, taking into account all the circumstances, whether to grant an eviction order for the tenant concerned. The tenant has the right to make representations to the court about his and his family's circumstances.</p>

As at <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-31">31 December 1999</phrase>, &pound;11.75 million had been spent on pilots offering extra help and support for people on incapacity benefits who want to work. We hope to make an announcement shortly about the next stage of the New Deal for Disabled People taking account of emerging findings from the pilots. None of the &pound;195 million has been set aside specifically for care packages for severely disabled people in full-time employment. However, it is open for personal advisers to provide a wide range of in-work support, including arrangements to supplement care packages where necessary to meet individual needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.3/1">We recognise that there needs to be a substantial improvement in participation and achievement at every level of attainment. That is why we are devoting significant additional resources to post-16 learning to allow access to learning for all those who need it: &pound;3.9 billion in 2001-02, compared to &pound;3.1 billion in 1998-99: an extra &pound;800 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/2">However, we have made clear that the learning and skills council will be required to give priority to the learning of 16 to 19-year-olds, fulfilling our commitment given in the White Paper Learning to Succeed to give all 16 to 19 year-olds an entitlement to education and training, whether full-time or part-time, if they want it.

	<p pid="a.7.0/2">We have set out in the LSC Prospectus the importance of the LSCs activities being integrated with local economic development. Local LSCs will achieve this by consulting about their plans with RDAs, local authorities, the Employment Service and local economic development partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/3">In support of workforce development and regeneration activities, the LSC is expected to develop a system which is responsive to the needs of the economy, local areas and particular industries and sectors. In particular, the LSC will support workforce development by working with employers, trade unions and many others, including Investors in People UK, the Small Business Service and the University for Industry. It will also work closely with National Training Organisations and their developing frameworks for sector workforce development plans. At a local level the LSCs will prepare local workforce development plans which reflect the national framework and build on the work of local Learning Partnerships. This work includes an analysis of local labour market and skills needs and build on the work of RDAs in identifying regional skill needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/4">Also, local LSCs will have a range of flexible budgets amounting to around 10-15 per cent of the overall funding to support workforce development, local regeneration initiatives, equality of opportunity projects and initiatives, improving access to learning opportunities and marketing and promotion activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.3/2">We are committed to creating a new system which is coherent, accessible and responsive to the needs of individuals, businesses and communities. The allocation of the majority of the LSC's funds will therefore depend on demand from individuals and businesses about the learning opportunities they wish to pursue, which will in turn inform the decisions taken by the local LSCs.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/3">The majority of funds will be allocated to national rates within a funding formula. However, we expect that 10-15 per cent of LSC budgets will be for provision which is not included in the national tariff and will be made at the discretion of the local LSC and can be used, for example, for improvements in the quality of local provision and workforce development.</p>

The proposals in the Corpus Juris project would have a major impact on national criminal law in all member states, and are therefore excluded. Some of the proposals in Corpus Juris could be introduced through legislation under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, but they could only be adopted through unanimity. Alternatively, they might be introduced as a proposal for closer co-operation between a majority of member states under Article 43 of that Treaty. A proposal under Article 43 would require the unanimous support of the member states concerned, and member states which did not wish to take part in the closer co-operation would not be affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.1/2" qnum="HL1040">Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Bassam of Brighton on 3 February (WA 48), whether they will list for each police force the number of recruits whom it had planned to recruit over each of the next three years from April 2000 before the grant of money from the Crime Fighting Fund was announced.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-02-21a.10.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="10"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000221/text/00221w03.htm#00221w03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.10.2/1">In their bids for a share of the recruitment scheme of the Crime Fighting Fund, forces provided information on their planned recruitment over the next three years. The table shows the projected appointments on probation, excluding transfers in from other forces. Actual recruitment levels will depend on the chief officer's decisions in the light of the available resources--including the outcome of the 2000 Spending Review now under way.</p>
