	<p pid="a.1.2/1">I understand that the Members of the House of Lords were selected on the same principles as the Members of the House of Commons. Priority was given to those who participated in the joint seminar of British and French parliamentarians earlier that day, to the Lords members of the various Franco-British all-party and friendship groups, and to members of the House Committee and chairs of relevant Select Committees. The size of the Robing Room and the need to accommodate a large presidential entourage limited the numbers invited.</p>
