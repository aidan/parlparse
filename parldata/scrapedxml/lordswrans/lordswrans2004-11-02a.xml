	<p pid="a.24.2/1">The White Paper <i>Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services</i> announced our intention of having floors and ceilings within the local government finance settlement. The floors are necessary to ensure that all authorities receive a reasonable increase in grant each year on a like-for-like basis. These must be paid for within the total amount of grant that goes to authorities each year. Every authority above the floor level therefore contributes to the cost of the floor.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/2">A table has been placed in the Library of the House showing the difference in formula grant before and after floors and ceilings for 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 for all authorities, and expresses this difference as a proportion of their revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/3">The revenue expenditure data have been taken from the revenue expenditure line in the Revenue Accounts Budget Estimates Returns for 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05. Revenue expenditure is defined as the sum of council tax requirement; government grants including police grant, general Greater London Authority (GLA) grant, revenue support grant, special and specific grants inside aggregate external finance (AEF), redistributed non-domestic rates; and the use of reserves and other adjustments.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/4">It should be noted that combined fire authorities became precepting authorities in 2004&ndash;05. Before that, they were funded by contributions from the county councils and unitary authorities within their area. On becoming precepting authorities the combined fire authorities received formula grant directly; before this the formula grant for fire services with respect to areas covered by the combined fire authorities was paid to the county councils and unitary councils, i.e. those authorities upon which the combined fire authorities levied.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">The results of the European Road Assessment Programme 2004 report on British roads show that in addition to the 11 persistently high risk roads a further 17 road sections have joined the list of Britain's most improved roads published in 2003. The total number of sections of road in the higher risk categories has reduced by 46 per cent from 158 to 86. That there remain high risk roads is a matter of concern, but the results show that the application of simple engineering measures is highly effective at reducing crashes and casualties, with speed cameras making a contribution to this reduction on about half of the road sections. The introduction of lower speed limits in isolation is unlikely to be the solution, although highway authorities may consider this as part of a wider package of speed management measures when carrying out road safety assessments. My department will shortly consult on revised guidance to highway authorities on the setting of local speed limits. The guidance will include advice on how to assess the most appropriate speed limit on a particular road.</p>
