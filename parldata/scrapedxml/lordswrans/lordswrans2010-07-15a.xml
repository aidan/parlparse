	<p pid="a.149.2/1">In the coalition agreement, the Government set out a clear programme of reform around alcohol licensing to tackle the crime and anti-social behaviour that is too often associated with binge drinking in the night-time economy. This included a commitment to ban the sale of alcohol below cost price.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/2">The Home Office will work closely with other government departments, as well as representatives of the licensed trade, including the supermarkets, to determine how best to effectively implement this commitment, without unduly adding a bureaucratic burden for businesses or impacting on responsible drinkers.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/3">These changes will be implemented through legislation in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.5/1">There are no plans to review the reservation made by the Ministry of Defence to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities or to establish an independent review to determine the risk of withdrawing the reservation. The continuing need for the Armed Forces exemption was confirmed when Parliament considered what is now the Equality Act 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.5/2">The Armed Forces were exempted from the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA). This exemption was secured because all Armed Forces personnel need to be combat-effective in order to meet a world-wide liability to deploy and to ensure that military health and fitness remain matters for Defence Ministers based on military advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.6/1">The 43 police forces of England and Wales currently have access to 31 helicopters that are able to provide the entire range of air support capabilities. These aircraft are managed through a mixture of in-house and outsourced arrangements. The decision on how this capability should be delivered is currently one for individual police forces to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/2">Some police forces have chosen to contract in this service. This generally incurs a higher hourly rate than those forces that purchase and operate their own aircraft and have responsibility for the pilotage and maintenance costs. It is therefore difficult to provide an accurate hourly operational cost that applies equally across the country. However, it is estimated that this figure is somewhere in the region of, on average, &#163;1,800 to &#163;1,900 per flying hour.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/3">Chief Constable Alex Marshall, aviation portfolio holder for the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), is leading a review into the way police air support is currently provided across England and Wales. The review, supported by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), will identify significant savings that can be made by greater collaboration between forces to deliver the service nationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.2/1">We have a frank and soundly-based relationship with Saudi Arabia and will continue to make clear to the authorities our concerns about reform at ministerial, ambassadorial and working level. Our strategy remains to work with those in Saudi society and government who are advocating reform in order to build indigenous and governmental institutions. This includes raising the issue of reform with members of the Saudi royal family, including King Abdullah, through bilateral meetings and fora such as the Two Kingdoms Dialogue, and working directly with government departments and institutions through targeted project work.</p>
