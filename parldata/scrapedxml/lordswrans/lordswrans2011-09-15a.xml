The Chancellor has said that the euro area must accept the logic of monetary union that leads from a single currency to greater fiscal integration. A strong and stable euro area is in the UK's national interest and offers valuable prospects for UK trade as more than 40 per cent of our exports are to the euro area. But the Government have also made clear that stronger euro area fiscal integration must be done in a way that protects the UK's national interests. A critical part of that means ensuring that issues of strategic importance such as the single market continue to be discussed between all member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.0/1">The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) collects data on the destinations of graduates six months after qualifying through their Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/2">The latest data relating to graduates from the 2009-10 academic year show 27,975 (7 per cent) graduates were unemployed six months after qualifying. This covers graduates from postgraduate and undergraduate courses. However, it cannot be assumed that the graduates who reported themselves as unemployed had actively sought work. The dates for this survey were April 2010 and January 2011 depending on when the graduate qualified. More detailed findings from the DLHE survey can be found on the HESA website: <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2150&amp;">http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2150&amp;</a> Itemid=161.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/3">The department does not calculate projections of labour market success for future cohorts of graduates. The unemployment rate from the 2009-10 DLHE survey has decreased from 8 per cent in the previous year. Although findings from the DLHE survey are useful, six months is often too early to judge the extent to which graduates have integrated into the labour market. HESA also collect data on graduates three and a half years after graduation, and the most recent survey related to the 2006-07 cohort. When the 2006-07 cohort was surveyed at six months, the unemployment rate was 4.7 per cent. This reduced to 3.6 per cent after three and a half years. More detailed findings from this survey are available on the HESA website: <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/component/option.com">http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/component/option.com</a> _pubs/task,show_pub_detail/pubid,1714/Itemid,286/</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/4">The recruitment market is still not easy for graduates, but in recent months it has been showing signs of improvement for the first time since the recession. For example, a recent survey by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), published in July, found that both vacancy numbers and graduate starting salaries are expected to rise during 2010-11 compared to 2009-10.</p>
