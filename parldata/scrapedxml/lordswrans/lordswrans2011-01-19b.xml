	<p pid="b.31.0/1">Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) are tradable and have no fixed price. The amount a supplier pays for a ROC is dependent on bilateral negotiations between supplier and generator.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/2">The nominal value of a ROC in any particular year depends on the gap between the renewables obligation level, and the number of ROCs presented to Ofgem. The obligation is set higher than the expected ROC generation to ensure that there will be a gap between the number of ROCs suppliers can purchase and the number needed to meet the obligation. The gap between the two is made up by suppliers paying into the buyout fund at a set price (the &quot;buyout price&quot;) for every ROC they do not present to Ofgem. This buyout fund is then redistributed to suppliers on a pro-rata basis depending on how many ROCs they presented to Ofgem. This is the &quot;recycle value&quot; , which forms part of the overall value of a ROC.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.0/3">The value of a ROC in any given year is therefore equal to the buyout price plus the recycle value for that year. The nominal value represents the maximum worth of a ROC to a generator but is not necessarily the amount paid by a supplier. The nominal value of a ROC for the past four years is given in the table below.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.8/1">There is a legally binding target for the UK to source 15 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. It is estimated that this may require around 29 per cent of electricity to come from large-scale renewable sources, but there is no target for the electricity sector, nor for individual technology targets. The exact shares of effort between sectors and technologies will depend on how investors respond to the renewable financial incentives put in place, and the relative success in overcoming non-financial barriers to renewables deployment such as planning, supply chain and grid issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.8/2">Modelling by Redpoint consultants in 2009 of a scenario to deliver around 29 per cent large-scale renewable electricity suggests that around 70 per cent of renewable generation in 2020 might come from offshore and onshore wind. Assuming, as per the question, no increase from average current turbine sizes of, say, 3MW for offshore wind and 1.5MW for onshore wind, this wind generation would come from around 10,000 onshore turbines and around 4,000 offshore turbines. This is based on 2009 analysis of one potential scenario amongst many. Turbine sizes vary and we also expect to see offshore turbine sizes increase to 5mw or more.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.8/3">We are currently reviewing the level of support for all renewables technologies, and will consult on any changes to RO bands this summer. As part of that process, we have asked our consultants Arup and Ernst &amp; Young to provide updated assumptions on potential deployment and costs for each renewable electricity technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.8/4">DECC calculations suggest these levels of wind imply a subsidy cost of around &#163;5 billion in 2020 through the renewables obligation and around &#163;360 million through the climate change levy exemption (both figures in 2010 prices, undiscounted). Note that these figures represent the total spending. <I>The </I><I>UK </I><I>Renewable Energy Strategy</I> of 2009 published lower subsidy cost figures based on the additional level of spending resulting from the increase in renewables ambition, on a different price basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.5/3">Furthermore, if adopted, the EU Bill, currently under consideration by Parliament, would significantly strengthen Parliament's oversight of EU matters by providing, for the first time, that an Act of Parliament would have to be sought before the UK Government could agree to future treaty changes under either the ordinary or simplified revision procedures. The Bill also provides for greater parliamentary control over the use of the so-called &quot;ratchet clauses&quot; in the existing treaties which allow changes to the treaties, or the exercise of one-way options, without the need to use the ordinary or simplified revision procedures.</p>

	<p pid="b.40.2/1"><I>Improving Outcomes-</I><I>A Strategy for Cancer</I>, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January</phrase>, sets out a range of measures to improve cancer survival rates in England. It shows how we intend to tackle preventable cancer incidence, improve the quality and efficiency of cancer services and deliver outcomes that are comparable with the best in Europe. Through these approaches, the aim is to save an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014-15. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/2">The earlier a cancer is detected, the sooner treatment can begin and the better the outcome is likely to be. This is why achieving earlier diagnosis of cancer is central to the strategy. To achieve earlier diagnosis of cancer we are investing over &#163;450 million over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/3">This money will give general practitioners (GPs) increased access to key diagnostic tests such as chest X-ray to aid in diagnosing lung cancer, non-obstetric ultrasound to support the diagnosis of ovarian and other cancers, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy to support the diagnosis of bowel cancer and magnetic resonance imaging scans to support the diagnosis of brain cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/4">With this funding, we will also work to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer, and to encourage symptomatic patients to visit their GP. We have already launched 59 local initiatives across 109 primary care trusts that are using a range of approaches to raise awareness of bowel, breast and lung cancer. Later this month, we will launch two centrally led regional bowel cancer campaigns that will be used to test the impact of a national bowel cancer campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/5">Overall, we are providing more than &#163;750 million to drive forward the improvements that will deliver the best cancer outcomes. This includes funding for the introduction of flexible sigmoidoscopy to the NHS bowel cancer screening programme, the expansion of radiotherapy services, and ensuring that all high-priority patients with a need for proton beam therapy get access to this innovative treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/6">Improving cancer survival rates in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved Administrations.</p>

This will include a requirement to participate in the new &#163;150 million national scholarship programme. The national scholarship programme forms part of a package of measures to support disadvantaged young people through their education, including the introduction of the &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium which will support them to achieve at school and turn that into success at university.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/3">Access will remain a focus for all institutions, who will continue to submit a widening participation strategic assessment to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Universities charging above the &#163;6,000 threshold will draw up a new access agreement with the Director of Fair Access, who will expect most from those whose records show they have furthest to go in securing a diverse student body. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-06">6 December</phrase> we published draft guidance to the Director of Fair Access setting out our expectations on how he might approach the approval and monitoring of universities new access agreements.</p>

Under current arrangements HE institutions have the main responsibility for ensuring high quality and standards are maintained, independently overseen by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA). Additionally, the Higher Education Funding Council for England has statutory responsibility for ensuring that academic quality is assessed in the institutions that it funds which it delivers through the QAA.

	<p pid="b.47.3/1">It is possible for a local authority to decide to cease managing land as a local nature reserve, but any decision to do so must be made reasonably.

Under Section 21(6) of the 1949 Act, the local authority would also need to consult with Natural England and consider its views before ceasing to manage the land as a local nature reserve. The local authority's ability to cease managing the land will also be subject to the terms of any management agreement and byelaws in place for the land.</p>

Implementing such a proposal would be complex and costly. In addition, research into labelling prescription medicines with prices has shown a much more complex impact on patient attitudes towards their medicines than may be expected. High and low prices on medicines could lead to patients not taking their medication appropriately as they may be perceived to indicate the quality of the drug, the seriousness of the illness, the importance of the condition, and the patient's self-worth.</p>

	<p pid="b.51.0/1">Research conducted by Allen and Burgess in 2010, <I>Evaluating the Provision of School Performance Information for School Choice</I> found that CVA is a less strong predictor of how well a child will do academically than raw attainment measures. We have decided to end the use of contextual value added because the measure is difficult for the public to understand and because we feel it is wrong to support a measure which entrenches low expectations of certain groups of pupils. However, it is important to reflect what a school does to bring out the best in all its pupils, regardless of where they start from. This is why one of the key changes we have announced is the introduction of a new school floor standard which is based on measures of both attainment and progression. It will identify and offer support to schools below the floor. In addition, we will also publish all available information which we hold on schools in an easily accessible online format. This will enable schools, parents, governors and the public to view, analyse and judge schools' performance on whichever information they feel is important.</p>

	<p pid="b.51.3/1">While the network of school sport partnerships helped schools to increase participation rates in areas targeted by the previous Government, the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. The 2009-10 PE and sport survey showed that only around two in five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools. All maintained schools in England took part in that survey, with over 99 per cent of them responding. This included schools in Brighton and Hove. There was no further consultation with schools or local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.3/2">All schools across the country, including those in Brighton and Hove, will benefit from the planned changes in the Government's approach to competitive school sport, and we aim to achieve a rise in participation rates in competitive sport. This will make a significant contribution to reducing the risk of obesity among our young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.3/3">The Secretary of State for Education announced in December 2010 the direction of travel, and initial funding, for the coalition Government's new approach on school sports. Schools will receive funding to allow PE teachers to embed competitive sport in schools across the country and raise participation. Every secondary school will receive funding up to the end of the academic year in 2013 to pay for one day a week of a PE teacher's time to be spent out of the classroom, encouraging greater take-up of competitive sport in primary schools and securing a fixture network for schools to increase the amount of intra- and inter-school competition. The detail of the time limited funding announced is:</p>
	<p pid="b.51.3/4">the department will pay school sport partnerships for the full school year to the end of the summer term 2011 at a cost of &#163;47 million from our 2010-11 budget. This will ensure the partnerships and their service can continue until the end of this academic year; anda further &#163;65 million from the department's spending review settlement will be paid to enable every secondary school to release one PE teacher for a day a week in the school years 2011-12 and 2012-13. This will ensure all the benefits of the current system are fully embedded.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Africa, Alistair Burt, visited Algeria in November and Morocco in December of last year where he raised the issue of Western Sahara with the relevant authorities. He reiterated the UK's support for the UN Secretary-General's personal envoy to Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, and called on parties to re-engage with the negotiation process.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.3/2">The Government also continue to support the development of confidence-building measures and independent verification of the human rights situation. We welcome the recent resumption of family visits by air between Western Sahara and the refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.6/1">The Children Act 2004 requires inter agency co-operation to safeguard the well-being of the child. Probation staff working in court or preparing pre-sentence reports have a responsibility to consider the impact of custody on an offender's children. If there is a likelihood of custody then children's services will be alerted to ensure arrangements are in place to safeguard the well-being of any children.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.6/2">Officials are currently working to ensure that this system of assessment and referral is as robust as possible by establishing minimum standard specifications for both pre-sentence report assessment and court practice. The court specification sets an expectation that processes are in place to ensure responsibilities regarding safeguarding are fulfilled appropriately by court staff which would include conducting post-sentence interviews with women offenders where there may be childcare issues.</p>
