	<p pid="a.90.2/1">The Government Actuary's Department's estimates the impact of civil partnership on public service pension schemes using as far as possible the normal actuarial assumptions on demographic and financial factors it considers appropriate for these schemes. But a key unknown factor is the level of civil partnership formation among members of these schemes. The regulatory impact assessment published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> illustrates the impact of different levels of take-up and explains the underlying assumptions and uncertainties. The capitalised cost of the high take-up case in the RIA was estimated by GAD at &pound;300 million if civil partnership rights applied to all the past service of the relevant scheme members. However, the costs could be higher or lower than the ranges illustrated depending on take up. For example, if the propensity of same sex couples to register matched that of opposite-sex couples to marry, this cost would be around &pound;3 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.2/1">In 2003&ndash;04, &pound;21.4 million was allocated through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme to provide homes for rent and low cost home ownership in Manchester for people in housing need generally, rather than key workers in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/2">In addition, the &pound;69 million key worker living programme is helping key workers, including midwives, into home ownership and intermediate rented accommodation in London, the south-east and the eastern regions where the high cost of housing is contributing to difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled staff in key public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/3">The assistance available under the programme is:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/4" class="indent">(a) equity loans of up to &pound;50,000 to buy a home on the open market or a newly-built property provided by a registered social landlord;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/5" class="indent">(b) shared ownership of newly built properties where a share of the property is purchased and a reduced rent is paid on the remaining share;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/6" class="indent">(c) intermediate renting of newly built properties where the rent is set at a level below market rents;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/7" class="indent">(d) equity loans of up to &pound;100,000 for some school teachers in London with the potential to become leaders of London's education sector in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/8">Key workers are also being assisted through the Housing Corporation's Challenge Fund scheme in London, the south-east and eastern regions which is providing newly built homes for rent and home ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/9">These programmes are in addition to any accommodation provided by employers for their staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.4/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.4/2" qnum="HL2814">What is the total public subsidy given to (a) onshore; and (b) offshore wind farms; and what is the cost of the subsidy per megawatt.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-05-19a.91.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="91"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040519/text/40519w02.htm#40519w02_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.91.5/1">Direct subsidies for renewables have only occurred in the form of capital grants. These have been awarded only for offshore windfarm sites&mdash;a total of &pound;117 million for the 12 Round 1 offshore sites, amounting to approximately &pound;7 million to &pound;8 million for each MW of capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/2">The other forms of support come from the renewables obligation, our main renewables support mechanism, and the climate change levy, a tax on commercial energy use from which renewable energy is exempt. However, these are not direct subsidies but effectively allow the supply companies to pass the costs of compliance on to consumers. Support is provided for each MWh of renewable energy that is generated and the costs to consumers are roughly &pound;30/MWh under the renewables obligation and &pound;4.3/MWh under the climate change levy. However, this is only an approximation, as supply companies do not necessarily pass all of these costs through to their customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/3">Due to this, it is difficult to quantify the total level of support for wind energy from these mechanisms. However, assuming all renewable energy generated from wind since the start of the renewables obligation (April 2002) up to December 2003 received support under both the renewables obligation and the climate change levy, the total level of support would be, very approximately, &pound;65 million for onshore wind and less than &pound;0.5 million for offshore wind.</p>

	NHS Modernisation Agency: Osteoporosis and Falls Work

	<p pid="a.92.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/2" qnum="HL2779">Whether, and if so how, the National Health Service Modernisation Agency's collaborative work, specifically in the area of osteoporosis, will be taken forward following the downsizing of the agency in April 2005.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-05-19a.92.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="92"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040519/text/40519w02.htm#40519w02_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.92.2/1">A number of strands of work undertaken by the NHS Modernisation Agency and the National Primary Care Development Team have impacted upon the area of osteoporosis. This work is linked to the delivery of the National Service Framework for Older Poeple, in particular Standard 6 on Falls: their prevention, improved diagnosis, care and treatment, rehabilitation and long-term support, leading to an integrated falls service by April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2">The Fractured Neck of Femur Programme, led by the Modernisation Agency, involved minimising delays, improving outcomes and improving patient focused care. A number of teams from the second Fractured Neck of Femur Programme championed work around osteoporosis management. That programme finished in March 2003, but the work has continued locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/3">The National Falls Collaborative, run by the National Primary Care Development Team, was a service led approach to reducing falls and the impact of falls on individuals, services and the community. This programme completed in December 2003, and resulted in many excellent initiatives around bone health and reducing falls. The impact and learning is to be disseminated via the National Service Framework for Older People.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/4">The Healthy Communities Collaborative is a community-led approach to reducing falls and integrating falls services within a geographical community. The Healthy Communities Collaborative is funded until March 2006 and will be taken forward by the National Primary Care Development Team.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/5">By April 2005 the NHS Modernisation Agency will transfer most of its staff to modernisation within local settings. The Modernisation Agency will be succeeded by a new, smaller national organisation, which will preserve a strong central focus on modernisation and innovation in the NHS. The Modernisation Agency's devolved staff will be well placed to provide any necessary on-going support to the local services that will have been established.</p>
