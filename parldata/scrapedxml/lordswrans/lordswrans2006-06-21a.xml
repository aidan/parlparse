<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-06-21a.85.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="85"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60621w01.htm#60621w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.85.2/1">The independent advisory Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE), which was established in 1985 in response to the final recommendation of the Black report (1984), has undertaken and published a number of studies on the incidence of cancer in populations in the neighbourhood of nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom. Details of all COMARE's publications are available on its website at <a href="http://www.comare.org.uk">www.comare.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">In 2005, COMARE published its 10th report, which reviewed earlier evidence and presented new data relating to childhood cancers around nuclear installations in Great Britain. By doing this, it has attempted to see if the claims of an excess of childhood cancer around some specific nuclear installations are a regular feature of the majority of the largest nuclear sites in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">The peer-reviewed report concluded that there was no evidence of excess numbers of cases in any local 25 kilometre area around nuclear power stations, which would include either primary exposure to radioactive discharges or secondary exposure from resuspended material. This report puts various allegations of other cancer clusters around nuclear installations into context.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">It is important to understand that the evidence that COMARE reviews is peer reviewed to ensure the scientific reliability of the collection and presentational methodologies of data. There are other reports on this subject that are not peer reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5">Children are expected to be the most sensitive members of the population as regards exposure to carcinogenic agents such as ionising radiation, so no excesses would be expected in the adult population. Cancer incidence data are held by cancer registries and are protected by the Data Protection Act. These bodies will only release anonymised data to researchers who have submitted research proposals via the proper ethical committees and received the relevant approval.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.5/1">The general rule is that administrative boundaries of local authorities in England and Wales extend as far as the low-water mark. Some authorities' boundaries extend below the low-water mark, for example, across harbours, rivers and river estuaries, and for internal waters&mdash;estuaries, bays, inlets, creeks and channels. In addition, accretions from the sea, whether natural or artificial, are also incorporated within the area of the local authority. Local authority planning functions extend to the authority's administrative boundaries and include any structures or buildings, such as piers and jetties, that extend into the sea from above mean low water.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/2">Some authorities' jurisdiction has been extended by statute beyond the administrative boundary for certain purposes. For example, coastal authorities also have power under Section 18 of the Coast Protection Act 1949 to control within three miles of the coast any marine dredging and other operations at sea that could affect coastal defences.</p>

We would expect the working patterns of dentists to reflect this contracted activity over a 12-month period. Dentists would not be paid any more for treatments above contracted activity without the prior agreement of the PCT, as their pay will be scheduled in 12 monthly instalments.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.3/1">Section 198 of the Water Resources Act 1991 requires anyone proposing to sink a borehole to a depth of more than 50 feet below the surface to give advance notice to the Natural Environment Research Council. Further information must be supplied when the borehole is actually sunk. Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, the abstraction licensing threshold has been 20 cubic meters a day. But these reporting requirements apply irrespective of the volume of abstraction taking place.</p>
