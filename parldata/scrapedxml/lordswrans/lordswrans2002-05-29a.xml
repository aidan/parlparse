It is virtually certain that civilians are suffering and dying as a result of the current military activity on both sides. That is why we are redoubling our efforts to achieve peace. We have seen a press release from the SPLM alleging a bombing involving civilian casualties. We are also aware of reports that civilians on the government side were killed and injured as a result of a landmine incident in the vicinity of Wau.

Of course such animals were showing signs of a serious neurological disease when they were slaughtered and would very likely have died anyway.

	<p pid="a.160.5/1">There is no central record of prisoners released using the Royal Prerogative of Mercy. However the records that have been traced by the NIO show that since 1990 the Royal Prerogative of Mercy has been used to release terrorist prisoners in the following circumstances:</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/2" class="indent">providing information or assistance to the authorities&mdash;five cases;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/3" class="indent">terminal illness&mdash;one case;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/4" class="indent">remission incorrectly calculated&mdash;one case;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/5" class="indent">to correct anomalies in the treatment of offenders convicted of the same offence(s) and given the same sentence as co-defendants but who would otherwise have served longer in prison&mdash;two cases;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/6" class="indent">to release prisoners who would have been eligible for release under the Belfast Agreement had they not transferred to a different jurisdiction&mdash;two cases;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/7" class="indent">to release prisoners who would have been eligible to be released under the Belfast Agreement had their offences (which subsequently became scheduled offences) been scheduled at the time they were committed&mdash;eight cases;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/8" class="indent">to release prisoners who would have been eligible to be released under the Belfast Agreement had they not served sentences outside the jurisdiction having been convicted extraterritorially&mdash;five cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/9">In addition, it was the practice before 1995 to release using the RPM terrorist and non-terrorist prisoners whose release date fell while they were on Christmas home leave.</p>

Steps are being taken to ensure that those bodies who may be affected by the new controls are aware of their obligations. I should like to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation for the co-operation we have received from the research community in improving standards of security for the substances in question in advance of the implementation of the new controls.</p>
