These countries are all part of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). The CAADP process has mechanisms in place for lesson-learning through regional peer reviews, joint assessments and information exchange. Through our regular dialogue with those countries, the UK Government also encourage them to pursue the CAADP target of 6 per cent average annual growth of the agricultural sector and the 10 per cent budgetary allocation target.</p>

The UK Government's approach to supporting agricultural development in southern Africa has been focused on three elements: first, strengthening trade facilitation and transport links generally-including support to the north-south corridor -as this helps to improve agricultural trade; secondly, working to ensure the north-south corridor's contribution to development serves to improve regional trade in staple foods, such as maize; and thirdly, addressing the links between agriculture and climate change. In pursuing this approach, we have been working with representatives of the Common Market for East and Southern Africa, the Southern Africa Development Community and the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.406.3/1">Residues of Roundup (active substance glyphosate) may be present in products derived from some Roundup Ready crop varieties as a result of treatment with this herbicide. The potential effects of these residues arising from the use of the herbicide in the European Union (EU) are considered under legislation concerning the placing on the market of plant protection products. Provided Roundup is applied in accordance with conditions of authorisation, any residues present will be below levels that may cause harm to animals and humans.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/2">Other EU legislation sets maximum residue levels (MRLs) in food and feed based on the conditions of authorisation of all pesticides used in the EU. MRLs are also set to the same standards for residues of pesticides in imported food and feed. MRLs for glyphosate have been agreed for a range of products including dry pulses, oilseeds and cereals. This legislation also establishes an EU programme for monitoring compliance with these MRLs.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/3">The active substance glyphosate was considered as part of the EU-wide review programme in 2002. All UK products were then reconsidered after this review and that exercise was completed in 2006. Any new glyphosate products or changes to approvals since 2002 will also have been considered to the same standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.3/4">Active substances are reconsidered on a cyclical basis and glyphosate will be reassessed again through the EU-wide review programme from 2012. This review is expected to be completed in 2014.</p>

	<p pid="a.409.2/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking whether the 1921 Census will be released early. (HL3057)</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/4">There are no plans to release the 1921 Census before January 2022.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/5">All censuses carried out from 1921 onwards have been taken under the powers of the Census Act 1920. This Act contained provisions prohibiting the release of personal census information and set out penalties for unlawful disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/6">The Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 has replaced parts of the Census Act 1920 and reinforces these confidentiality provisions by making it an offence to disclose personal census information while it remains in the custody of the UK Statistics Authority. Current Government policy is that the UK Statistics Authority should retain all census returns from the 1921 Census onwards, for 100 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/7">This policy was reiterated in the Government White Paper <I>Helping to shape tomorrow</I>, CM 7513 published in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/8">The partial release of the 1911 Census when it was in the custody of the National Archives was the result of a decision by the Information Commissioner. The 1911 Census will not however, be fully open to the public until January 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.414.8/2">Nevertheless, it is also important to provide assurance that the general health of the population is not adversely affected. Water fluoridation has been in operation in England for over 45 years, serving some 10 per cent of the population. Routine health monitoring has not revealed any adverse effects in those areas. In addition, the department monitors relevant research and also commissions research. There is no evidence of risk to people's health from the fluoridation of water at the level permitted in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.423.5/1">The installation is expected to become operational in 2011. The delay has been caused in part by the deficit in the Turks and Caicos Islands Government's public finances and by protracted negotiations to acquire land needed to gain full access to the radar site. Those negotiations have now been successfully concluded. The project board has been reconvened and work is expected to restart shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.423.8/1">The Council for Reconstruction of Zimbabwe, often referred to more simply as the Council for Zimbabwe, is an organisation based in New York that is concerned with supporting recovery in Zimbabwe, principally by rebuilding human resource capital from the Zimbabwean diaspora. Department for International Development (DfID) officials have been in touch with the Council for Reconstruction of Zimbabwe to inform the organisation of particular diaspora events in the UK. We do not maintain regular contact.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.8/2">The UK Government recognise the importance of the diaspora to recovery in Zimbabwe. DfID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) are in regular contact with the UK-based Zimbabwe Diaspora Focus Group to provide information and updates on relevant aspects of the UK' s foreign and development policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.424.2/1">The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe has improved significantly over the past 18 months, with substantially fewer numbers at risk of hunger and no significant recurrence of the cholera epidemic of 2008-09. Donor assistance has been crucial in contributing to this stabilisation. The UK Government, alongside others, are boosting food security systems, including local markets and production, for example by supplying seeds and farming inputs to over 2 million people.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.2/2">The UK Government also provide aid to protect livelihoods, improve the provision of basic services and encourage continuing much needed economic and governance reform. Information on all the Department for International Development's (DfID's) bilateral projects, including in Zimbabwe, is published on the DfID website at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/About-DFID/Finance-">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/About-DFID/Finance-</a> and-performance/Project-information/.</p>

	<p pid="a.424.5/1">The welfare of the people of Zimbabwe, including their health and education, is a major concern for the UK Government. In 2010-11 we continue to provide essential support through the UN and other NGOs and in co-ordination with other donors. Examples of this include: ensuring that 72,000 people living with AIDS will receive anti-retroviral treatment; and the supply of a stationery kit and a core set of textbooks to every state primary school pupil in Zimbabwe. We are also in dialogue with appropriate Ministries in the inclusive Government about how to reform and strengthen national health and education systems. None of our bilateral funding passes through governmental systems.</p>
