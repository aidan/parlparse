	<p pid="a.9.8/1">This is a maximum figure, which includes land acquisition and relocation costs, the construction of an access spur from Stratford International to Temple Mills, infrastructure modifications, design, procurement and project management costs. The construction cost of the depot building itself is less than half of the sum. The Temple Mills building is over 10 times the size of the Bedford depot because Eurostar trains are much longer than domestic rolling stock and because of the intensive maintenance regime required for these complex high-speed trains. The depot will also need to house specialist equipment which is required to maintain the multiple electrical and signalling systems installed on the trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.8/2">The cost will be offset by operational efficiencies, avoiding works that would otherwise be required on the North London Line, and the value of Waterloo International Terminal and North Pole international depot asset as they become available for alternative use.</p>
