	Afghanistan: Helmand Province
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="b.197.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/2" qnum="HL937">What targets are set for the reform and reconstruction of the Helmand province of Afghanistan during the United Kingdom's three-year deployment; and what progress the deployed forces have made on meeting these targets to date.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-01-22b.197.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="197"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70122w0001.htm#07012211000026">
	<p pid="b.197.2/1">A joint UK plan for Helmand was drafted by a cross-Whitehall team facilitated by the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU) in December 2005. The Helmand plan is jointly owned and implemented by DfID, the FCO and the MoD. The Helmand Executive Group based in Lashkar Gah is responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the plan. The overall strategic aim of the joint UK plan for Helmand is,</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/2" class="indent">&quot;an effective, representative government in Afghanistan, with security forces capable of providing an environment in which sustainable economic and social development can occur, without substantial security support from the international community&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/3">The strategic objectives of the plan are broken down into four categories&mdash;governance, security, economic development and counter-narcotics. DfID is responsible for the economic development part of the plan. The objective of the economic development strand is,</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/4" class="indent">&quot;greater economic opportunities and access to public services to reduce poverty and a sustainable improvement in the legal economy of Helmand&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/5">The economic development part will be measured by 1) a higher level of household income, 2) increased food security, 3) better health and 4) more people educated. The way in which progress will be measured is by using a combination of the National Rural Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) report and various UN reports. As development activities have been implemented in Helmand only since April 2006, it is too early to judge the impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/6">DfID is providing &pound;30 million over three years to support the Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme (HARDP). This programme aims to increase economic opportunities for the rural poor of Helmand by supporting the Government of Afghanistan in the roll-out of existing successful national programmes in Helmand. Priority preliminary tasks have been undertaken and, by the end of March 2007, this programme will have constructed 200 wells in and around Lashkar Gah city, and 49 kilometres of road will be under construction by then.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/7">In addition, DfID has committed &pound;4 million to the UK Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) funding allocation of &pound;6.5 million for the delivery of quick impact projects (QIPs) in Helmand to get short-term development results and help build a platform for longer-term activities. Of the &pound;6.5 million available, over &pound;4 million has already funded over 80 projects in Helmand. These funds have provided humanitarian assistance to victims of the drought, constructed permanent vehicle checkpoints to improve security, improved security around the shrine in Gereshk, reinforced the riverbank walls and provided flood defences for the Bowlan bridge.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/8">Through the &pound;3 million DfID-funded Research into Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF), the Restorative Agriculture and Rural Economy Research Project, implemented by Mercy Corps, in Helmand is working on export feasibility of grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms, eggplants and okra, and has made strong contacts with raisin importers (organic and fair trade). The programme is evaluating at least 10 different small-scale agri-processing industries, and producing case studies of enterprises that prove to have value added&mdash;for example, tomato paste.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.2/1">We are not aware of any UK airport imposing additional charges to individual passengers for provision of wheelchairs. Furthermore, the existence of established case law in this area should already deter airport operators from doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.2/2">Department for Transport officials are in regular contact with UK air transport industry stakeholders, including the Airport Operators Association, on accessibility matters and will be issuing a formal consultation later this year on the implementation of European Union regulation 1107/2006 within the UK. Under this regulation, the practice of charging disabled passengers for assistance will be unlawful.</p>

	<p pid="b.199.6/1">In December 2005, in accordance with the well established procedure known as a Shawcross exercise, I sought views from ministerial colleagues as to the public interest considerations raised by the SFO investigation. Such views were provided in December 2005 by the Prime Minister and the then Foreign and Defence Secretaries and updated in September 2006. Further such views were provided by the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Defence Secretaries in December 2006. I conveyed those views to the director of the SFO but (apart from the Solicitor-General and myself) no Ministers communicated directly with the SFO. In addition the Leader of the House of Commons raised the case with me in November 2006. The decision to discontinue the investigation was taken by the SFO in its capacity as the independent prosecuting and investigating authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.0/1">Electoral registration officers do not have to enter a person on the register until any checks they wish to conduct have been completed to their satisfaction. They have powers to request information from those applying for registration and to conduct a hearing of the application where they consider this necessary. They are not to enter a person on the register until the five-day period for making objections to the application to be registered has elapsed. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 clarified that objections to registration could be made not only to an application for registration, but to an existing entry in the register. The 2006 Act also conferred much broader powers on registration officers to review the entitlement to be registered of a person with an existing entry in the register. They can use this power, for example, if they are suspicious about someone's nationality or fraud. The 2006 Act also created a broader criminal offence of providing false information to registration officers in connection with electoral registration.</p>

	<p pid="b.204.0/1">The Command Paper, <I>Review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act: Proposals for Revised Legislation (including establishment of the Regulatory Authority for Tissue and Embryos)</I>, published on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>, sets out the Government's proposals for revision of the law on assisted reproduction and embryology. The Government's decision to review the law was based on, in particular, the rise of new technologies and probable changes in attitude since the passage of the original Act in 1990. Copies have been placed in the Library (Cm 6989). The proposals will go on to form a draft Bill to be published for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.0/2">A wide range of factors were taken into consideration in bringing forward the proposals, preceded by public consultation in 2005. With regard to embryo research, these factors included, inter alia, recommendations from the House Of Lords Stem Cell Research Committee (Session 2001-02, HL Paper 83(i)) and the House Of Commons Science and Technology Committee (Session 2004-05, HC 7-I), relevant legislation enacted since 1990 and the scope of delegated powers already within the 1990 Act itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.0/3">The proposals include revisions both to the purposes for which research projects using embryos may be licensed and to the scope of activities that may be authorised by a licence. These include the proposal to make clear that basic embryo research is permissible, subject to controls. Basic research, in this context, refers to research that underpins or enables applied research into, for example, serious diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.0/4">The Command Paper makes clear that, because of the considerable advances made in medicine and technology since the Act came into force in 1990, there are some areas within the remit of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 where greater clarity may be helpful. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has performed its duties well, working within the legal framework set out in the 1990 Act, and the Government remain confident that the authority will continue to do so, as will any successor body.</p>

	<p pid="b.207.2/1">The Commission proposal to develop an action plan to enhance the efficiency of freight logistics is supported by the UK Government. Freight logistics is a global industry and it is recognised that the industry is best positioned to select the type and size of container used to transport freight and that such containers should be able to move freely. The nine-foot six-inch-high container has been widely used throughout the world for many years and can already be transported inland by rail from the major ports in the UK using appropriate low-floor wagons where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.2/2">We are currently considering a number of rail freight schemes for funding from the first round of the productivity strand of the Transport Innovation Fund. These include gauge enhancement that would allow such containers to be transported on standard rail wagons.</p>

	<p pid="b.208.8/1">Guidance on whistleblowing in the National Health Service was issued in September 1999 following the coming into force of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.
