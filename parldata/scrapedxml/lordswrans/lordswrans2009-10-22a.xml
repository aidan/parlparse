National Health Service commissioners will continue to commission services from providers who can best meet the needs of their patients and population, regardless of whether they are NHS, voluntary sector or independent sector providers. The &quot;NHS as the preferred provider&quot; is about getting the best care for patients and looking after the NHS staff who care for them. This does not represent a change in commissioning policy but signals an improvement in commissioning practice. It is the important job of the commissioner to test whether services provide best value and real quality. Where a provider is not delivering quality, existing providers will be given the opportunity to improve these services before opening up the market to new potential providers.</p>

Outside of acute elective care, where national policy requires a model of competition driven by patient choice, it is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to decide when and how to use competition as a lever for improving services. Where PCTs utilise competition in the procurement of health services, then this must be compliant with national policy as set out in the PCT procurement guide. This guidance reflects cross-government policy on public procurement and is consistent with the European EU treaty principles of transparency, proportionality, non-discrimination and equality of treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/2"><I>Letter from Jil Matheson, National Statistician, to Lord Berkeley, dated October 2009.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking:</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/4">1. How many people in Greater London are estimated to have died prematurely as a result of exposure to particulate matter (PM10) on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April</phrase>. (HL5753).</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/5">2. What is the average number of life years lost per statistical victim dying prematurely in England and Wales for each of (a) short-, medium- or long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM10), (b) alcohol abuse, (c) drug abuse, (d) road traffic accidents, (e) obesity, and (f) smoking. (HL5757)</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/6">The accurate reporting of deaths by specific causes depends on the complete recording of all relevant causes of death by medical practitioners and coroners. Medical practitioners are required to complete the medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD) to the best of their knowledge and belief. Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to death to be recorded. The MCCD is not designed to collect information on risk factors or exposures related to the development of disease, such as exposure to particulate matter or smoking behaviour. It is therefore not possible to provide an answer to question 1 above, or question 2, parts (a) or (f), based on information collected at death registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/7">Calculations done for the review of the air quality strategy<sup>1</sup> estimated that, if all manmade fine particulate matter (PM2.5) present in the UK in 2005 were removed for the lifetime of' people born in 2005, the average life expectancy per person would be seven to eight months greater than if the level of manmade PM2.5 had remained at 2005 levels for a lifetime. This calculation represents the effect of long-term exposure to fine particles. A similar calculation has not been done for PM10.P</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/8">Studies of short-term exposure to PM10 do suggest a link with increased mortality but the studies do not give direct information on the life lost per person. It is thought that those affected are already seriously ill but that many of the deaths are brought forward by several months rather than just days or weeks. There are too few studies of the effects of medium-term exposure for calculations such as those above to be made. All information on the estimated impact of particulate matter on life expectancy mortality has been provided by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Neither ONS nor the HPA is aware of any figures that have been produced on how many people in Greater London are estimated to have died prematurely as a result of exposure to particulate matter (PM10) on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/9">ONS publishes annual figures on the number of years of life lost due to a selection of specific causes of death<sup>2</sup>, including land transport accidents. Table 1 below presents figures for years of life lost due to land transport accidents, including numbers of deaths, mean age at death and years of total life (to age 75) lost, by sex, for 2007 (the latest year available). Figures are not readily available for years of life lost due to alcohol abuse, drug abuse or obesity.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/10">Figures are available for the number of premature deaths, defined as deaths under the age of 75 for (i) deaths with an alcohol-related cause, (ii) drug misuse deaths where the underlying cause was drug poisoning and where any drug controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was mentioned on the death certificate, and (iii) deaths with obesity as the underlying cause of death, for England and Wales in 2008 (the latest year available), and are provided in Table 2 blow. These figures are presented to offer some information on the scale of premature deaths from these conditions in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/11">The figures provided in Table 2 relating to obesity reflect the number of deaths certified as due to obesity conditions. However, these figures are likely to underestimate the actual number of deaths in which this factor is involved since obesity may play an important role in deaths due to other conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, but it is rarely recorded on the death certificate.</p>
