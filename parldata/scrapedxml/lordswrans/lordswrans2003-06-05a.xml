	<p pid="a.179.2/1">I am today announcing a package of measures, which will help achieve better value for money in the legal aid system while ensuring that help continues to go to those who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">A consultation paper has been published today on the Criminal Defence Service (CDS), Delivering Value for Money in the Criminal Defence Service, which sets out a range of proposals to ensure that CDS expenditure is targeted on those areas where legal aid can best advance and protect a client's interests. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/3">A further consultation paper, Proposed Changes to Publicly Funded Immigration and Asylum Work, has also been published today. This sets out proposals to ensure that we obtain more effective controls of costs and quality in legal advice given to asylum seekers. Copies of this consultation paper have also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/4">I can also announce that we are setting up a project to consider the likely supply of and demand for lawyers over the coming years and to establish what remuneration rates may be necessary. This will provide an evidential basis for decisions to ensure a sufficient supply of lawyers of the right quality prepared to undertake legal aid work in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/5">Finally we are fully implementing the scheme for contracting very high cost criminal cases. These are cases which last (or are estimated to last) over 25 days at trial, or cost more than &pound;150,000. This scheme will ensure better value for money, help the aims of better and earlier case preparation and give the professions greater certainty about payment for work.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.3/2">For some while suggestions have been made, from different quarters and in various contexts, as to how the statistics might be improved, both as regards the information provided and the way it is presented.

	<p pid="a.181.3/3">In the government response to that Select Committee, we stated we would have the statistics reviewed to see how their content and presentation might be improved.

	<p pid="a.182.2/1">I have today placed in the Library of the House a copy of the Criminal Records Bureau's corporate and business plan for 2003&ndash;04. After a difficult first seven months of operations, the business plan builds on the steady improvements in performance since last autumn. The average number of disclosures issued each week since October stands at 40,000 compared with 24,500 a week last August. Turnaround times have reduced from over eight weeks to under five and the number of aged applications over six weeks old (and not awaiting further information from the applicant) has been reduced from a peak of 76,000 to under 10,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/2">For 2003&ndash;04, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has set the CRB challenging but realistic service standards which take into account the experience of the first year of operating. The CRB will now seek to process 90 per cent of applications for a standard disclosure within two weeks and 90 per cent of applications for an enhanced disclosure within four weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/3">As a result of the service improvements in recent months, the CRB is able to increase its capacity to 60,000 disclosures a week and consequently it can now commence criminal record checks on care workers postponed last November (Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-01">1 November 2002</phrase>, cols. WA 48-50)</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/4">Subject to consultation, the programme for introducing checks will be as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/5">Existing care home staff (care home staff who were in post just before <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>):</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/6" class="indent">The deadline for checks for this group will be brought forward from <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-31">31 October 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>. In order to make sure the CRB check has been completed by the new deadline, applications will need to be submitted to the CRB between <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-30">30 November 2003</phrase>. In order to make best use of the CRB's increased capacity these checks will be carried out at the level of a standard disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/7">Domiciliary care agency and nurses agency staff:</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/8" class="indent">In order to ensure a smooth introduction of these checks, we propose making a distinction between new and existing domiciliary care agency and nurses agency staff. We are consulting on the definitions of new and existing staff in order to ensure that they are clear both to agencies and their customers. All domiciliary care and nurses agency staff will be required to obtain enhanced disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/9" class="indent">From <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-01">1 October 2003</phrase>, a CRB check will be required before a new agency domiciliary care worker or agency nurse can take up their placement.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/10">Existing domiciliary care agency staff will be asked to submit applications for checks to the CRB between <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-30">30 November 2003</phrase>. The CRB will complete these checks by <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/11">Checks on existing nursing agency staff will commence in spring 2004 once those on existing domiciliary agency staff have been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/12">The Protection of Vulnerable Adults (POVA) list will be introduced as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/13">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has today issued a consultation paper on the necessary amendments to the Domiciliary Care Agencies Regulations 2002, Nurses Agencies Regulations 2002 and the Care Homes Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/14">The lower volume of throughput, as a result of the slower introduction of checks on the key groups mentioned above and the deferment of basic disclosures, together with other factors have resulted in higher unit costs. The costs for 2002&ndash;03 have been met by the three key departments, namely the Home Office, Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills. The business plan develops a costing regime retaining free checks for volunteers and a new full-cost recovery plan with full effect from 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/15">The Government made it clear when the current &pound;12 fee was announced (Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-02">2 April 2001</phrase>, col. WA 92) that it was our intention that the bureau would be self-financing in the medium term. That remains our objective. However, in the short term, the costs of the CRB will continue to be met by a combination of fee receipts and contributions from the Home Office, the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills. As we move towards full-cost recovery, it is necessary to increase the disclosure fees. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase> the fee for a standard disclosure will be &pound;24 and that for an enhanced disclosure will be &pound;29. Volunteers will continue to receive free disclosures. The necessary amendment to the Police Act 1997 (Criminal Records) Regulations 2002 has been laid before Parliament today.</p>

UK objectives more specific to Africa were to obtain G8 commitment to improving and harmonising preferential access schemes for African products, expanding the integrated framework for trade-related capacity building to low-income Africa countries, and obtaining agreement on a meaningful African trade initiative based on the French proposals.

	<p pid="a.185.0/2">The G8 agreed a statement on co-operative action on trade, which emphasises the importance of continuing to strengthen the multilateral system, and delivering the Doha Development Agenda including through decisions at Cancun. Specific actions identified are: to achieve further substantial opening of trade in particular in areas of interest to developing countries; to strengthen WTO rules and disciplines; to reach a solution on access to medicines for developing countries; to help with capacity building for trade; and to improve preferences for poor countries. There was limited progress on an African trade initiative following US objections to the proposed export subsidy moratorium proposed. Two of the original French proposals were referred to in the implementation report by Africa personal representatives to leaders on the G8 African Action Plan, in which G8 leaders reiterated commitment to the objective of duty-free quota-free market access for products originating from least developed countries and to improve the effectiveness and ease of use of their respective trade preference programmes. They welcomed the efforts underway by the World Bank Group to examine the potential for effective market-based mechanisms to help to mitigate weather and commodity shocks.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.2/1">The Leader of the House of Commons announced today at Business Questions our intention to recommit the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill to Standing Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/2">We have taken this decision to enable us to bring forward provisions which will end the Crown's immunity from planning control, subject to certain safeguards. Given the substantive nature of the proposed amendments, I think it is important that the House of Commons is given the opportunity to debate these new provisions fully before the Bill resumes its remaining stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/3">We will also be seeking to introduce further provisions which will help to implement the sustainable communities agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/4">Clearly this will mean that the Bill will not be able to complete its remaining stages in this Session. Motions have therefore also been tabled today to allow the Bill to be carried over into the next parliamentary session. We will be seeking to ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book as soon as possible in the next Session to lessen the impact of this slight delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/5">We propose that the provisions relating to Crown development extend beyond England and Wales, which would involve the Scottish Executive pursuing a Sewel Motion in the Scottish Parliament. We are, of course, discussing this with the Scottish Executive, which has been kept informed of our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/6">The intention to carry over the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill into the next Session does not signify any lessening in our commitment to reforming the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/7">Copies of a short progress report covering the large number of workstreams being taken forward as part of this commitment are available in the Libraries of the House. The note will also be available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.2/2">The Knowledge Network is now a successful ongoing service to government departments, with 32 departments and agencies using the infrastructure. As the main development stage is complete, it is in accordance with general government policy that the costs should be met by those benefiting from the service, hence the intention to introduce charges on user departments. The Office of the e-Envoy (OeE) is discussing details with users at the moment but charges are not expected to exceed &pound;150,000 per year even for the major departmental users.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.5/1">Lord Haskins's Rural Delivery Review will help improve the way rural policies are delivered and make a real difference to local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/2">The seven guiding principles of the review&mdash;the first outcome of Lord Haskins's work&mdash;were published today. They are:</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/3">Better accountability: policy development should be managed separately from policy delivery, whilst ensuring that proper communication exists at all stages between the two functions. Accountability for success or failure cannot be determined if there is confusion between the two.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/4">Readiness for policy change: the Government must prepare for the delivery of a major new agri-environmental agenda in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/5">Devolution: delivery of economic and social policy must be devolved in accordance with the principles of public service reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/6">Customer focus: the services available to rural businesses and rural communities, and visitors to the countryside, need to be more accessible and transparent.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/7">Simplicity: the complex range of agencies currently engaged in delivering the Government's rural policies should be simplified.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/8">Co-ordination: the environmental, social and economic elements of rural delivery should be better co-ordinated at a regional level.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/9">Value for money: the taxpayer must get better value for money as a result of changes to the current arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/10">Ministers are very grateful for all the work Lord Haskins has done so far, meeting hundreds of individuals and organisations throughout England, as well as visiting Scotland, Wales, France, Germany and Belgium. The principles he has developed are a very useful first indication of his thinking and are consistent with existing work across government bringing services closer to local people, for example through devolution and decentralisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.5/11">Ministers want to see real improvements in service delivery to rural people and we expect the Rural Delivery Review to build on these principles to produce imaginative and effective proposals. We now look forward to receiving Lord Haskins's final conclusions in the autumn.</p>
