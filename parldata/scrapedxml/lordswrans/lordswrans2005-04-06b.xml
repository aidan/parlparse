The creation of a new play park in the estate, for use by the general public, required the development of 59 car park spaces.

	<p pid="b.110.5/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government when the work on the footpath at Liscurry Brae in Artigarvan, County Tyrone, will be completed [HL1878]. I have been asked to reply as the issue raised falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/4">The scheme at Liscurry Brae in Artigarvan commenced in November 2004 and involves the provision of 280 metres of new footway and the resurfacing of the adjacent carriageway. Currently both the footway and the carriageway are at base course level. We also intend to extend the carriageway resurfacing work further into the village as far as Moorlough Road and this scheme is to commence after the Easter holidays.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/5">In order to minimise the disruption to the road user we decided that the surface course on both schemes should be laid under a single road closure. It is expected that this work will be completed within the next eight weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.5/6">In relation to the footpath to which you specifically refer, the surface course over the majority of the footpath can be laid in advance of the road closure and this work will be carried out within the next two weeks.</p>
