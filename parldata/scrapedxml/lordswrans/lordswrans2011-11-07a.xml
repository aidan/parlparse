	<p pid="a.1.2/1">British milk producers receive a range of prices for their milk. Those aligned to individual retailers for the supply of fresh drinking milk generally receive the best prices. Non-aligned producers supplying for other markets such as dairy products generally receive lower prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">The farmgate milk price in the UK and other countries depends on the market price transmission through the supply chains for these products in each country. Historically, UK farmers have received a lower milk price than the majority of their counterparts in Europe. This raises questions as to how the UK dairy supply chain works, the competitiveness of processing in the UK and the product mix for dairy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">The Government, through the Dairy Supply Chain Forum, are challenging senior sector representatives to discuss the health and future of the dairy sector and identify opportunities that should benefit dairy farmers. These include exploring new export markets or replacing imports with products made with British milk to improve our trade balance and therefore demand for British milk supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">We have encouraged and supported the industry's development of its own voluntary code of practice on contractual relations for farmers, and the Dairy 2020 project will produce an action plan to secure long-term industry sustainability.</p>

The statement uses the labour force survey for the February to April quarter. This follows the approach used by the previous Government, who also used an even earlier period, January to March 1997, as the baseline for economic calculations.

	<p pid="a.10.5/3">As Director-General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what is the reason for the further delay in the publication of the 2011 Pink Book (the United Kingdom balance of payments); and when they now expect it to be published. (HL13062)</p>
	<p pid="a.10.5/4">The 2011 Pink Book was initially scheduled for publication on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-01">1 November 2011</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-29">29 September</phrase>, after consultation with key users, the ONS announced a modification to the timetable for various publications, including the Pink Book. The ONS announced that the Pink Book would be delayed until <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-23">23 November</phrase>. The full announcement can be read at: <a href="http://www.ons">http://www.ons</a>. gov.uk/ons/media-centre/statements/national-accounts-publication-timetable.html.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.5/5">The delay to the timetable was announced to ensure that the ONS could fully implement significant changes in the 2011 edition of the UK national accounts-the Blue Book. The changes included the introduction of a new industrial and product classification required by European Regulations SIC07 and CPA08 respectively, improved methods of deflation and some additional improvement in the financial services area. Because the balance of payments estimates for the UK are produced as an integrated part of the whole national accounts, these changes had an impact on the Pink Book timetable.</p>

In certain cases, the return may be mistakenly coded as if no remand had taken place. For magistrates' court proceedings, the number of remands and more importantly, the number which are in custody, are believed to be under-recorded in total. As the breakdown of remands into bail and custody cases for a number of forces is not accurate for a number of forces, estimates had to be made to provide national figures.</p>
