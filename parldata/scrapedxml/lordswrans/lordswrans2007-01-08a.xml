The safeguarding of the aerodrome is regulated by the Government, with the assistance of Air Safety Support International, which makes regular visits to Gibraltar to ensure that the relevant standards are met. Gibraltar Airport has considerable capacity to expand and the increased traffic that is envisaged will not affect the capacity of the airfield to continue to meet its international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.8/1">BBC World Service (BBCWS) approached the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2005 with a proposal to launch a12-hour Arabic TV service. The proposal made it clear that BBCWS was confident, based on careful research, that a 12-hour service would make a significant impact. A 12-hour service was deemed to be correct when assessed against the availability of funding and the relative priority weightings attached to BBCWS's global aims and objectives. Arabic TV will be a very significant development in the history of BBCWS: its first ever vernacular TV service. Arabic TV will be part of a tri-media BBCWS offering in Arabic that will continue to include 24/7 services on radio and online. The BBCWS has an aspiration to move to a 24-hour service as and when funding can be made available and will bid to secure additional funding as part of Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.0/1">The simplest way of enabling direct flights would be a decision by the Republic of Cyprus to designate Ercan as an international airport under the terms of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. In the absence of such a decision there are legal obstacles. The Government do not intend to pursue a policy which would be in contravention of international law. An application for a licence is presently under consideration by the Department for Transport and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.3/1">The status of the divided island of Cyprus is unique within the EU and as such creates an unparalleled situation with regard to direct flights. There are no direct flights between Northern Cyprus and any EU member states. The Government fully support the work of the EU towards lifting the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. We welcome the ongoing implementation of the financial aid regulation and support further progress on trade liberalisation. However, a full solution to the difficulties faced by the Turkish Cypriots can be achieved only through a comprehensive settlement facilitated by the UN. We would echo the call of the UN Secretary-General in his latest reportto the Security Council, as well as the statement of the Finnish EU presidency on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase>, in urgingthe two communities to engage in discussions under UN auspices to achieve a resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement as early as possiblein 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.8/1">The EU has agreed guidelines in five areas; children and armed conflict, action against torture, death penalty, human rights dialogues and human rights defenders. There are no separate EU guidelines on compliance with international humanitarian law. However, we continue to stress to the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority the need to ensure that their actions comply with international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.8/2">We are a strong supporter of the EU human rights defender guidelines, which were last reviewed earlier this year. At the time of the review, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office sent out instructions to all posts, including our Consulate-General in Jerusalem, inviting contributions to this evaluation. Following the conclusion of the review on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July 2006</phrase>, we circulated the evaluation to all posts with instructions to support local EU presidency action as appropriate. Under the Austrian and Finnish presidencies in 2006, the EU has run a campaign on women humanrights defenders. This builds on a freedom of expression campaign launched under the UK presidency in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.8/3">We continue to take action to tackle human rights issues in Israel and the Occupied Territories. This action includes working with non-governmental organisations and raising our concerns bilaterally. We remain concerned at the restrictions of movement of Palestinians in and between Gaza and the West Bank. We continue to call on both sides to implement the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access in full. We also call on Israel to route the barrier on or behind the Green Line and freeze all settlement activity and dismantle all outposts built since 2001. The routing of the barrier and the construction of settlements on occupied land is illegal. We continue to raise these issues with the Israeli Government.</p>

He stated that the immediate priorities for the peace process are: an Office of the President in Palestine that is given the means to improve its capacity and effectiveness to act in the interests of the Palestinian people; an early meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas; and a relaunch of the political process leading to a two-state solution.</p>

Prime Minister Olmert agreed in principle to the release of $l00 million in withheld tax revenues and easing restrictions on movement and access in the West Bank.

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">As reported in the National Health Service financial performance report for quarter two of 2006-07, the NHS as a whole is forecasting a &pound;94 million net deficit, after the application of a &pound;350 million contingency established by strategic health authorities. We believe that the NHS overall remains broadly on track to deliver net financial balance by the end of 2006-07 and continues to perform well against key service targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2">The contingency in 2006-07 has not been created from new funding provided by the department. As part of their management of the &pound;5.5 billion central budget bundle distributed to them for the NHS, SHAs have established a level of contingency which currently stands at &pound;350 million. This contingency is a prudent approach by SHAs to manage financial risk in the NHS while ensuring that services to patients are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/3">There are a number of factors, not yet included in the NHS forecasts, which may have beneficial impact on the forecast outturn position. The most significant of which is the potential benefit arising from the lower reimbursement cost of generic medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/4">There will be redundancies resulting from the strategic health authority and primary care trust re-organisation which will release &pound;250 million to frontline services. The full benefit of the &pound;250 million saving will happen in 2008-09 when all of the costs have been paid.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">This clause has not been included in individual academies' articles of association. This is because Ministers decided that it would be more effective to include a clause in the body of the funding agreement stipulating that: the Secretary of State must be notified of any meeting at which the appointment of an academy principal will be considered, that a representative of the Secretary of State will be entitled to attend that meeting and that their views will be taken into account. This clause was introduced when we updated the model funding agreement earlier this year; where individual funding agreements do not include it we are currently seeking to re-negotiate this with academy trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.0/1">Incidents of restraint in secure children's homes (SCHs) have been reported centrally to the Youth Justice Board (YJB) since February 2006. At present, information is not collected about the use of restraint by gender and ethnicity but the YJB will also be collecting this additional data from February 2007. In this context, restraint refers to occasions when &quot;force is used to overpower a young person.&quot; The numbers of incidents of restraints reported to the YJB in Kesteven House; Kyloe House; Orchard Lodge; Redbank and Sutton Place SCHs are listed in the table.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">The Government's response was published in document HC 860-II Session 2005-06, October 2006, which can be foundin the Library of the House. The response reads in full:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The Government strongly supports the principle enshrined in the WHO constitution that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being. However, there are difficulties over Taiwan's involvement in a United Nations forum where statehood is a prerequisite for full membership. Additionally, observer status, of and by itself does not automatically confer any rights or benefits on the holder.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/3" class="indent">Consequently, the Government's approach has been to press for practical solutions. The Government, both bilaterally and through the EU, has sought to strengthen and deepen the relationship between the WHO and Taiwan. The EU has urged the WHO Secretariat to find mechanisms to allow medical and public health officials from Taiwan to participate in relevant activities of the WHO. Through the Secretariat's efforts, Taiwan is more involved now than before. We continue to monitor the situation closely&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/4">Recently, at the request of member states including the UK, the European Commission and presidency have agreed to approach the new WHO director-general regarding Taiwan's further participation.</p>
