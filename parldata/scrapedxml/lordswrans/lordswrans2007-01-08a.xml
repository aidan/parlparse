	<p pid="a.10.8/1">BBC World Service (BBCWS) approached the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2005 with a proposal to launch a12-hour Arabic TV service. The proposal made it clear that BBCWS was confident, based on careful research, that a 12-hour service would make a significant impact. A 12-hour service was deemed to be correct when assessed against the availability of funding and the relative priority weightings attached to BBCWS's global aims and objectives. Arabic TV will be a very significant development in the history of BBCWS: its first ever vernacular TV service. Arabic TV will be part of a tri-media BBCWS offering in Arabic that will continue to include 24/7 services on radio and online. The BBCWS has an aspiration to move to a 24-hour service as and when funding can be made available and will bid to secure additional funding as part of Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

Prior to Chen's trial on <phrase class="date" code="">25 August</phrase>, we raised his case at the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue, in Beijing in July. After Chen was sentenced, we included his name on a list of individual cases of concern handed over to the Chinese authorities during the visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on 12-<phrase class="date" code="">13 September</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary made a statement on <phrase class="date" code="">2 November</phrase> welcoming news of Chen's quashed sentence and urged the Chinese Government to guarantee due process at his retrial. We are working with EU partners to urge the Chinese authorities to ensure that Chen's forthcoming appeal will be dealt with fairly and transparently.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">The extensive US research findings have provided reassurance to UK 1990-91 Gulf veterans by broadly confirming the conclusions of the UK programme. Veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict from the different coalition countries demonstrate similar findings regardless of their Gulf experience. Gulf veterans consistently report more symptoms than those not deployed to the Gulf. Symptoms are similar despite very different exposures to vaccination, nerve agent pre-treatment, smoke from oil fires and other possible hazards. In addition they are not accompanied by consistent physical signs or laboratory abnormalities nor has research to date identified specific causal factors. US and other international research provides no evidence of a unique disease due to service in the Gulf.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">Benefits were made clear from a review of published research into Gulf veterans' illnesses undertaken by a team led by Professor Glyn Lewis of the University of Bristol. Three of the reports resulting from this work have already been made publicly available and the remaining three will be published shortly. We will continue to monitor US research for the future on the same basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.5/1">It would be inappropriate to comment on the particulars of an individual's case particularly when they are subject to appeal but we can confirm that Dr Hall lodged a number of appeals with the Pension Appeals Tribunal (PAT) between<phrase class="date" code="2005-04-28">28 April 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April 2006</phrase>, which have yet to be heard. In October 2006 a new statement of case was issued in support of one of these appeals, and replacement statements of cases were issued in respect of the others. This was necessary to ensure that each statement of case includes all of the available evidence including the substantial evidence provided by Dr Hall.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.3/1">I refer the noble Lord to the Written Ministerial Statement presented by my honourable friend the Minister of State for Nationality, Citizenship and Immigration on <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase>. (col. 39WS)</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/2">In that Statement the reasons for the changes to the highly skilled migrant programme (HSMP) were explained. The Statement went on to explain that the previous HSMP rules were being suspended and why: we took these steps to avoid a rush of speculative applications by people who would wish their applications to be considered under the old rules, which is what happened after the publication of the Command Paper on the points-based system. The suspension was to enable us to make the transition effectively to the new rules and to ensure that current levels of customer service were maintained when the new arrangements were introduced. In the interests of good customer service, we made sure that this would not disadvantage applicants substantively. The changes came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December 2006</phrase>.</p>

Following the conclusion of the review on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July 2006</phrase>, we circulated the evaluation to all posts with instructions to support local EU presidency action as appropriate.

We continue to call on both sides to implement the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access in full. We also call on Israel to route the barrier on or behind the Green Line and freeze all settlement activity and dismantle all outposts built since 2001. The routing of the barrier and the construction of settlements on occupied land is illegal. We continue to raise these issues with the Israeli Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">As reported in the National Health Service financial performance report for quarter two of 2006-07, the NHS as a whole is forecasting a &pound;94 million net deficit, after the application of a &pound;350 million contingency established by strategic health authorities. We believe that the NHS overall remains broadly on track to deliver net financial balance by the end of 2006-07 and continues to perform well against key service targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2">The contingency in 2006-07 has not been created from new funding provided by the department. As part of their management of the &pound;5.5 billion central budget bundle distributed to them for the NHS, SHAs have established a level of contingency which currently stands at &pound;350 million.

	<p pid="a.32.5/3">There are a number of factors, not yet included in the NHS forecasts, which may have beneficial impact on the forecast outturn position. The most significant of which is the potential benefit arising from the lower reimbursement cost of generic medicines.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">This clause has not been included in individual academies' articles of association. This is because Ministers decided that it would be more effective to include a clause in the body of the funding agreement stipulating that: the Secretary of State must be notified of any meeting at which the appointment of an academy principal will be considered, that a representative of the Secretary of State will be entitled to attend that meeting and that their views will be taken into account. This clause was introduced when we updated the model funding agreement earlier this year; where individual funding agreements do not include it we are currently seeking to re-negotiate this with academy trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/1">The composition and operation of governing bodies of local education authority maintained schools are set out under Chapter 1 of Part 3 of the Education Act 2002. In many respects the model funding agreement includes provisions equivalent to these and governing bodies of academies would be expected to carry out the same accountability, challenge, support and monitoring functions as governing bodies of maintained schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/2">However, the requirements and duties of academy governors do differ from maintained school governors because academies are conducted by charitable companies limited by guarantee (the academy trust) and the governors are the directors of those companies. Their powers and duties are therefore governed by the memorandum of association and articles of association of the academy trust and are subject to the general law relating to limited companies and the law relating to charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/3">Within these constraints academy governing bodies do have a number of additional freedoms beyond those available to maintained schools, including voluntary aided schools. For instance, they are not obliged to adhere to the school teachers pay and conditions document or the national curriculum.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.5/1">The Government do not wish to see the trafficking of any personal injury claims. The Compensation Act 2006 provides a robust statutory framework for the regulation of claims management services, including claims made for personal injury handled by previously unregulated third-party claims companies. Such companies will now need to be authorised and required to follow strict rules of conduct including how claims are obtained and referred to solicitors. Effective regulation of all aspects of claims handling is vital to ensure proper safeguards for consumers and the department is working closely with the Law Society, Financial Services Authority and other regulators to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">The Government's response was published in document HC 860-II Session 2005-06, October 2006, which can be foundin the Library of the House. The response reads in full:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The Government strongly supports the principle enshrined in the WHO constitution that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being. However, there are difficulties over Taiwan's involvement in a United Nations forum where statehood is a prerequisite for full membership. Additionally, observer status, of and by itself does not automatically confer any rights or benefits on the holder.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/3" class="indent">Consequently, the Government's approach has been to press for practical solutions. The Government, both bilaterally and through the EU, has sought to strengthen and deepen the relationship between the WHO and Taiwan. The EU has urged the WHO Secretariat to find mechanisms to allow medical and public health officials from Taiwan to participate in relevant activities of the WHO. Through the Secretariat's efforts, Taiwan is more involved now than before. We continue to monitor the situation closely&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/4">Recently, at the request of member states including the UK, the European Commission and presidency have agreed to approach the new WHO director-general regarding Taiwan's further participation.</p>
