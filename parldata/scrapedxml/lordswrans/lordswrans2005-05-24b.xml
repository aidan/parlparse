	<p pid="b.5.2/2">Detailed figures are, however, available for that part of the Lords website which is hosted by TSO. This allows access to the key documents of the House such as Bills, Hansard, the Minute, and Select Committee reports. The number of hits on this part of the website was as follows:</p>
