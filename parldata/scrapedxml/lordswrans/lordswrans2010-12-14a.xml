	<p pid="a.153.2/1">In 2009, the number of abortions fell by 3 per cent from 195,296 in 2008 to 189,100.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2">The department has been working to ensure that abortion providers are better integrated into the broader sexual health &quot;family&quot; of services, so that there are better pathways of referral to and from abortion services, which can help to ensure that women receive the other sexual health services that they need, particularly contraception.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/3">Contraception plays a vital role in preventing unintended pregnancy and repeat abortions. Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, any woman having an abortion on the National Health Service must be given advice about, and supplies of, contraception before they leave the clinic. In addition, a specification for abortion services has been issued to support implementation of this requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4">Abortion should be seen not in isolation but in the context of wider public health issues, as the public health White Paper <I>Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our Strategy </I><I>f</I><I>or Public Health </I><I>i</I><I>n England</I> highlights and the forthcoming sexual health strategy to be published in spring 2011 will make clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/5">Abortions must be performed within the requirements of the Abortion Act. Our focus has been on ensuring early access to abortion services as evidence shows that the risk of complications increases the later the gestation. The evidence referred to is contained within the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' evidence-based clinical guidance <I>The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion</I>, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.0/1">At the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) summit in Lisbon in November, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Heads of State/Government set out a clear plan for transition of security responsibilities to the Afghan Government, not a timetable for withdrawal.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/2">No specific discussions have taken place between the UK and individual nations on the withdrawal of troops. However, NATO/ISAF already have a number of agreements in place with neighbouring countries to allow the movement of equipment and supplies to and from Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.3/1">The decision not to bring the Nimrod MRA4 into service was difficult, owing to the nature of the military tasks to which it was designed to contribute, the amount of public money that had been spent on it and the impact of such a decision on the people who have dedicated their careers to delivering this capability or who depend on it for their livelihoods.

	<p pid="a.155.8/1">We welcome the endorsement by the G20 of the Basel reforms to strengthen international capital and liquidity standards, which address a number of the key weaknesses in financial regulation highlighted by the financial crisis. The Basel package represents a credible and crucial set of reforms that will strengthen the resilience of the banking system to the long-run benefit of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.8/2">The UK has consistently argued for a high standard of regulation, while recognising that the short-term impact on economic recovery should be mitigated through appropriate transitional arrangements and careful calibration.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.8/3">The Basel Committee has agreed an extended transition period, with most elements of the package phased in gradually from 2013 to 2019<sup>1</sup>. This strikes the right balance. Extending the transition further would unnecessarily delay the move to greater financial stability.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.8/4">Work completed by the UK authorities and Basel Committee indicates that strong net benefits will accrue from the package in the long run<sup>2</sup>. Overall, we believe that the agreed Basel package will deliver significantly greater future financial stability while supporting strong and sustainable economic growth.</p>

That element of the pay bill has been accumulated over time at the expense of consolidated pay awards. They have proven to be a cost-effective way of rewarding staff because they reflect individual performance in year and the payments are non-pensionable and do not add to future pay bill growth. The total pay settlement has been frozen by the Treasury for two years from 2011-12 as part of the Chancellor's emergency Budget. The pay freeze applies to any proposed increases in pay that grow the size of the pay bill, so we cannot, for example, increase the size of salaries, uprate allowances or indeed increase the size of the non-consolidated pot from which performance awards are paid. If end-of-year non-consolidated performance payments were withheld, the estimated net saving in the pay bill for the MoD in the appropriate financial years would amount to:</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">Independent schools registered as charities can convert to academy status. The Academies Act 2010 prevents academies from charging fees for admission or education subject to limited exceptions. Such exceptions might include after-hours clubs or tuition.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">Where independent schools convert to academies, they may have non-European economic area pupils who are eligible to remain in the UK only on condition that they do not access state (non-fee-paying) education. In such cases, the academy is required under its funding agreement to charge fees to meet the full costs of providing education for such pupils.</p>

The treatment of minority religious groups in Turkey, including Christians, is addressed in the European Commission's annual progress reports on Turkey's accession process. The 2010 report states that freedom of worship in Turkey continues to be generally respected. However, the report notes a number of areas for continued focus. These include full implementation of the law on foundations, continued dialogue with the Alevi and non-Muslim religious communities and establishing a legal framework in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

Table 1 includes the benchmarks for each institution listed. The benchmarks take into account a number of student characteristics: entry qualifications; subject of study; and age to calculate the sort of values that might be expected for an institution's non-completion indicator. Figures for the 2008-09 academic year will become available from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) in April 2011.
