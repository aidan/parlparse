	<p pid="a.91.2/1">Employer contributions for both the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Civil Service pension schemes are charged on a sliding scale. The rates are presently under review and are expected to increase. The current rates for Great Britain range between 12 per cent and 20.5 per cent while in Northern Ireland they range between 12 per cent and 18 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/2">Employee contribution rates are 1.5 per cent or 3.5 per cent dependent on the pension arrangement chosen by the individual scheme member with the exception of employees who opt to join the partnership pension arrangements who can contribute up to the Inland Revenue limit, 15 per cent of salary.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.2/3">Where an employee opts for a partnership pension account, which is a stakeholder pension, the employer makes a contribution as a percentage of pensionable earnings from 3 per cent to 12.5 per cent according to age. The employer also matches the contributions made by the employee up to a maximum of 3 per cent of salary. The employer makes a separate contribution, of 0.8 per cent, for centrally funded risk benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.8/1">The Ministry of Defence holds information on the numbers of Service personnel waiting for consultations and medical treatment at Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs); the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre; and directly managed units in Cyprus, Gibraltar and Northern Ireland. No information is held centrally on Service personnel who are treated within the NHS as NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.8/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">31 December 2003</phrase>, there were 6,226 patients awaiting medical consultation and 2,332 awaiting an operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.8/3">By the nature of the activities they are asked to do, many referrals within the military healthcare system are related to orthopaedics. To reduce waiting times for consultant appointments for such conditions, the MoD is developing the role of its regional rehabilitation units (RRUs) to enable sports injury-trained doctors to assess most new orthopaedic referrals. In this way those patients who do not require a hospital specialist opinion will begin an earlier remedial programme through the RRU. This can reduce waiting times by up to approximately six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.8/4">In addition, to reduce waiting times for surgical intervention a fast-track pilot scheme for orthopaedic injuries has been run in partnership with the South Tees NHS Trust. This has succeeded in getting military personnel back to work more quickly and the potential for future schemes with other NHS trusts in regions with high military populations is now being explored.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.5/1">The Government are investing more than &pound;1 billion in England to transform physical education (PE), school sport and club links. The funding will help to deliver an ambitious public service agreement target, shared with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to increase the percentage of five to 16 year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high-quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent by 2006. The strategy includes encouraging schools to use lunch and playtimes more effectively to promote greater physical activity through more structured activities. For example, the Sporting Playgrounds programme is supporting &pound;10 million of capital investment, between April 2003 and March 2005, to enhance primary school playgrounds which will increase physical and sporting activity. Best practice in developing the use of playgrounds and break times will be published later this year to further support schools.</p>
