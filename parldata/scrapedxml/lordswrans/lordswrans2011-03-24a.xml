	<p pid="a.199.6/1">The Government consider that the Holford rules form the basis of a common-sense approach to be applied to the potential routeing of new overhead electricity lines. As such the rules are included in the revised draft National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5). The Government have carefully reviewed the rules before including them in the revised EN-5 and have made one change, which has been to remove the words &quot;for lines other than the highest voltage&quot; with reference to the comparative costs of undergrounding electricity lines. This has the effect of meaning that National Grid will have to consider undergrounding even for the highest voltage electricity lines.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.2/1">Prices paid by consumers for transport fuels, domestic gas and heating oil are all unaffected by the traded value of carbon. The price of carbon allowances is a cost borne by electricity generators that we assume to be fully passed to consumers though their electricity bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/2">The exact relationship between the traded carbon price and the electricity price depends on the generation mix at the time. The cost of carbon allowances are currently estimated to make up around 5 per cent of consumer electricity prices. A relatively large change in carbon prices will have a small impact on consumer prices because carbon costs constitute such a small part of the final bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-16">16 February</phrase> the Home Secretary announced plans to consult on proposals to further strengthen the management of sex offenders and to close existing loopholes in the legislation, including making it compulsory for registered sex offenders to notify the police of all foreign travel. The consultation will also seek views on proposals to require a registered sex offender to notify the authorities if they are residing in a household where there is a child or children under the age of 18 and to notify weekly if they do not have a permanent address. And the rules will be tightened so that sex offenders can no longer avoid being on the register when they change their name (including by deed poll). The consultation will be launched shortly, and we anticipate that the necessary legislative changes will be brought into force by the end of the year.</p>

At the instigation of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), an internal review was carried out by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) into the case of PM, and it was conducted by the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Gloucestershire. The internal review was not intended for publication, but I have been advised that as a result of the review, a number of lessons have been learnt. All CPS lawyers and their managers across the south-west have been advised that any similar requests for advice from the police should be referred to the regional Complex Casework Unit for assistance and guidance. Furthermore, the DPP has ensured that legal guidance on international inquiries available to all CPS staff in England and Wales has been substantially updated to ensure that the service provided nationally is consistent with CPS core quality standards.</p>
