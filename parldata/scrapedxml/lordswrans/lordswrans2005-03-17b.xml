	<p pid="b.139.2/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the noble Lord in response to this Question.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Kilclooney.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government what proposals they have to reduce traffic congestion in East Newtownards; what is the timetable for the Ards/Down area plan; and what expenditure is committed to future road schemes in the Newtownards district [HL1137].</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/4">The <i>Draft Ards and Down Area Plan 2015</i> was published by the Department of the Environment's planning service in December 2002. It contains a number of road proposals for the east of Newtownards. Examples of these include the provision of a road linkage from the A20 Portaferry Road, at its junction of the Old Shore Road, to the Bowtown Road and a developer-led road connecting Bowtown Road to Donaghadee Road via Movilla Road. The roads service is also presently developing proposals for a further major works scheme at Frederick Street and statutory procedures have commenced on the proposed link from Portaferry Road to Scrabo Road via Comber Road, which will be largely funded by the private sector. All of these schemes, which are expected to cost in the order of &pound;5 million, have been designed to facilitate existing traffic as well as additional traffic generated by land use proposals in the Draft Ards and Down Plan and are expected to impact favourably on traffic congestion currently experienced in Newtownards.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/5">It is anticipated that work will commence within the next two to three years depending on the satisfactory outcome of statutory procedures, the successful acquisition of necessary land, and the availability of funding at the relevant time.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/6">The planning service advises that a public inquiry to discuss objections received following publication of the Draft Ards and Down Area Plan, is programmed to start on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-03">Tuesday 3 May 2005</phrase> and is expected to continue for several months.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.2/7">I trust this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.142.8/1">The State Pathologist, in collaboration with senior medical officials from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, developed a protocol in March 2004 for the conduct of infant autopsies in coroners' cases. This protocol includes the concept of double doctoring with consultant paediatric pathologists. The NIO is currently working with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to develop a regional protocol for the investigation of sudden and unexplained deaths in infants.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.8/2">Under the system of double doctoring there is no formalised arrangement for one pathologist leading over the other since these are &quot;joint&quot; examinations. However, in non-suspicious deaths it is usual for the paediatric pathologist to do most of the prosection and prepare the report which is then &quot;jointly&quot; signed. In suspected criminal cases, the forensic pathologist would do the majority of the examination and be largely responsible for writing the report. Further thought is currently being given to formalising this arrangement.</p>

At the level of central government, co-ordination is assured by the Cabinet Office, with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) taking a lead role as the investigative agency of choice. The SFO assumed this lead role for all overseas bribery cases in summer 2004, thereby simplifying co-ordination.

	<p pid="b.147.2/1">Although the issue of blasphemy has arisen throughout recent discussions on incitement, there has never been any suggestion on the part of the Government that the two are linked <i>a priori</i>. Moreover, this has been an important part of our message on the new offence. The Government have been at pains to emphasise that the proposed measure is not an extension of the law on blasphemy&mdash;that it is about protecting people, not beliefs.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.2/2">However, it is partly due to the understandable tendency to link the two that the Government have decided to pause before taking a serious look at the blasphemy offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.2/3">There has been substantial public debate on the issue of incitement which has, unfortunately, led to some unrealistic expectations. The Government believe that to tackle the issue of blasphemy would lead to confusion. We are keen to wait until the impact of incitement has been assessed and related expectations have been given time to settle.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.2/4">Furthermore, although the Law Commission and the Select Committee on Religious Offences have reflected on the matter in detail, there has not been a wide-ranging consultation on blasphemy, and nor has there been a consensus on what action should be taken. A recent ICM poll shows that public opinion is much more divided on blasphemy than on incitement to religious hatred, 57 per cent of those polled supporting the creation of this offence. Pausing before any further legislation is proposed will give the Government the opportunity to consult more widely.</p>

We welcomed the report <i>Lacking Conviction </i>which highlights some important issues about the use of custodial remands for women and provides some helpful ideas on how those issues could be tackled. The Government agree that more needs to be done to support greater use of community interventions and bail for women offenders, and to ensure that custody is used only for those who really need to be there.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.5/2">We are pursuing these aims through the Women's Offending Reduction Programme which contains action points designed to improve community interventions and services that are better tailored to the needs of women. One of our priorities is to increase opportunities to divert women away from custody at the pre-sentence stage. The programme will address a number of the Prison Reform Trust's recommendations, including: making support in the community more appropriate and accessible for women; developing a community multi-agency approach to tackling women's complex needs; and improving the effectiveness of court-based diversion schemes for women offenders with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.5/3">The report also calls for an increase in women-only bail hostels. The National Probation Service accommodation strategy includes a commitment to develop more women-only provision within the approved premises estate.</p>
