	<p pid="a.127.5/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) has not withdrawn any funding for the Inter-Country Support Programme on Health and AIDS in Southern Africa (ICS) as the programme was not approved.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/2">Following a mid-term review of DfID's regional programme in Southern Africa it was decided in October 2008 that the DfID-Southern Africa (DfID-SA) office should rebalance its commitments. It was agreed that DfID would not proceed with the design of ICS. Instead it will focus its work on other health and AIDS programmes; namely, a &pound;12.5 million new programme to improve access to quality essential medicines in countries; and delivering on an existing &pound;19 million programme providing behaviour change communication programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/3">The ICS programme was being designed to provide support to three key partners, the regional teams of UNAIDS and WHO and a challenge fund for regional civil society organisations (CSOs).</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/4">DfID remains very committed to UNAIDS and WHO. We recently agreed new institutional strategies for 2008-11 with both organisations. DfID will provide up to &pound;34.8 million core funding to UNAIDS and &pound;44 million core funding to WHO over this period. We rely on their management systems to ensure they allocate funds to regional and country programmes to deliver on their strategic objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/5">DfID has historic funding relationships with two CSOs: the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (ACSA) and the Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research Division (HEARD) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. DfID has taken steps to ensure the sustainability of these organisations, providing short-term funding and facilitating discussions to secure funding from other donors. DfID has also given advice and is providing technical assistance to ACSA on resource mobilisation. DfID has been able to provide some &pound;1 million support to ARASA (AIDS and RIGHTS Alliance of Southern Africa) through another donor.</p>

We remain active partners in the multi-donor group convened by the UNAIDS regional team, which is collectively monitoring whether there is any impact on the regional level approach to health and AIDS as a result of this and other donor decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.5/1">The following measures are in place to reduce the likelihood of avian flu entering the United Kingdom and to limit its economic and social impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/2">We keep the level of threat under constant review. This is done through monitoring the international reports of disease incidence worldwide and assessing whether there is a change in threat for the UK. These assessments are published on the Defra website and stakeholder organisations are advised when a new assessment is published. Our current assessment is that the UK is at a low but constant risk of the virus being introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/3">There are a number of pathways through which the virus might be introduced. Trade in domestic poultry, other captive birds and poultry products is regulated. Regulation is based on international veterinary standards and certification designed to reduce the likelihood of the virus being transmitted via legal trade routes. The UK's Border Agency is responsible for undertaking anti-smuggling controls on products of animal origin (including avian products such as poultry meat and eggs) from third countries. These controls are risk-based, taking into account information from Defra on the changing global animal health situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/4">Speedy detection of the virus in the UK and then swift action to contain and eradicate it is essential to limiting its impact. Keepers of domestic poultry and other kept birds practicing good biosecurity, maintaining vigilance and reporting suspicion of disease promptly to their vet is key. In addition, there is an official surveillance programme undertaken in all European member states to help detect the virus, including less virulent strains. In wild birds it is used to help detect a change in risk for domestic poultry and other kept birds allowing controls to be triggered that help prevent disease spread (eg housing of birds).</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/5">We have well developed contingency plans for dealing with outbreaks. These have been activated eight times since April 2006. In addition, we have undertaken exercises with stakeholder partners to test out different scenarios. No two incidents are the same and after each one there is a lessons learnt exercise the conclusions of which are published on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/6">In addition, vets from all the Governments of the EU meet at least once per month to discuss and adopt laws on animal health controls and meet more frequently if there is a major outbreak. The UK also attends OIE (the world animal health organisation) forums and provides funds for developing countries to help control disease and limit its spread worldwide.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.3/1">Since March 2008, the Cabinet Office has produced detailed guidance for departments on post-legislative scrutiny, available on the Cabinet Office website at <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/secretariats/economic_">www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/secretariats/economic_</a> and_domestic/legislative_programme/guide_html/post-legislative_scrutiny.aspx.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/2">A system has also been put in place to ensure that all departments will produce Command Papers for Select Committees on the implementation of each Act passed in 2005, within three to five years of Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/3">One Command Paper was published in December 2008 on the Electoral Registration (Northern Ireland) Act 2005 (Cm 7504). We expect to publish some Command Papers later this year on Acts passed in 2005. Command Papers on all remaining Acts passed in 2005 will, where appropriate, be published by summer 2010 and, for subsequent Acts, within three to five years of Royal Assent.</p>

These figures are not static and will reflect changes over time for a range of reasons. In a few cases, the same Muslim chaplain works at more than one prison. Some prisons will also have a sessional Muslim chaplain who does not attend regularly but who can be called on to provide cover when needed. The figures presented have been derived from manual records. This is liable to the normal inaccuracies associated with a reporting system of this type.</p>
