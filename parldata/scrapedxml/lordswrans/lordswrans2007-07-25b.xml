In those circumstances, I have instructed Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyers to take immediate steps to seek the early extradition of Andrey Lugovoy from Russia to the United Kingdom, so that he may be charged with murder&mdash;and be brought swiftly before a court in London to be prosecuted for this extraordinarily grave crime&quot;.</p>

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, QC, said: 'The Russian response has now been conveyed to us and the Russian authorities have declined to extradite Andrey Lugovoy. They have said that they are prepared to put Mr Lugovoy on trial in Russia if the evidence is forwarded to them. The allegation against Mr Lugovoy is that he murdered a British citizen by deliberate poisoning and that he committed this extraordinarily grave crime here in our capital city.

	<p pid="b.89.2/1">The UK recognises the Republic of Cyprus as the sole state foreseen in the 1960 constitution. The &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot; (TRNC), established by a &quot;unilateral declaration of independence&quot; in 1983, is not recognised by the UK (or by any other state apart from Turkey). Following the &quot;unilateral declaration of independence&quot; the then Foreign Secretary (the right honourable and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon) made the following statement in another place: &quot;Her Majesty's Government deplore this action by the Turkish Cypriot community, which amounts to a declaration of secession. We have issued a statement which makes it clear that this is incompatible with the 1960 treaties. Our position has always been that we recognise only one Republic of Cyprus. That remains the position today&quot;. The UK policy on recognition of the TRNC has remained unaltered since 1983.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.2/2">The Government continue to support the EU initiatives aimed at ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots described in the reply that my noble friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman, gave to the noble Lord on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June</phrase> (<I>Official Report,</I><I>WA</I><I></I><I>255-56</I>). In particular, the Government support efforts to bring the Turkish Cypriot community closer to Europe through, for example, financial aid and trade liberalisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.2/3">The continued division of Cyprus has an impact on the ability of Cypriots from both communities to enjoy the full range of freedoms and rights. The recent United Nations report from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the question of human rights in Cyprus (available at: www.ohchr.orb/english/countries/cy) highlights a number of ongoing concerns. However, as that report concludes, the situation of human rights in Cyprus would be greatly improved by the achievement of a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem. It is on this that the UK will continue to focus its efforts.</p>

A UN assessment team (the UN Children's Fund, the World Food Programme, the World Health Organisation and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)) concluded that no additional immediate assistance was needed, but the UNHCR and the ICRC continue to monitor the situation.
