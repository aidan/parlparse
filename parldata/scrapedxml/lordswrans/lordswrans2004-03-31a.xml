A range of preventive measures are being taken under the strategy including promoting coping skills, suicide awareness and outreach work with young people in areas of need and especially young men. In addition, action is being taken under the drug and alcohol strategies to offer support and counselling to young people affected by addiction difficulties. The North and West Belfast Trust is also working with other relevant public agencies and with local community organisations to raise awareness of the risks to young people's mental and emotional well-being and to develop the capacity of communities to deliver suicide prevention strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.3/1">The HIPC Initiative allows for additional assistance&mdash;so called &quot;topping up&quot;&mdash;to be granted at Completion Point for countries that have suffered a fundamental change in their economic circumstances due to external shocks. Completion point dates for Niger and Ethiopia have been delayed due to disagreement over the methodology for calculating &quot;topping up&quot;. The UK believes that the deterioration in the real debt burden these countries face provides sufficient grounds for additional relief to be granted. We have therefore been lobbying other member states to make good their promises and provide &quot;topping up&quot; to Niger and Ethiopia, so that their debts are reduced to a sustainable level. We are pleased that the informal paper prepared by the IMF supports the existing methodology. Provided there are no objections by <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> the methodology will stand, and Niger and Ethiopia are expected to be granted enhanced debt relief within the next month when they reach completion point.</p>

Over the same period the female prison population under sentence for motoring offences increased from 37 to 54, an increase of 46 per cent. Although the proportionate change is larger for females than for males the change for females is based on very small numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/3">The prison population under sentence at any point in time reflects the numbers given a custodial sentence as well as the length of these sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/4">Our analysis indicates that the increase in the prison population under sentence for motoring offences relates to more people being sentenced to custody rather than longer sentence lengths. This is because there has been little change in the average sentence length of those received into prisons for motoring offences, whereas the number of persons received under sentence for such offences has increased from 14,697 in 2002 to 15,385 in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/5">Court statistics for 2003 are not yet available and hence we cannot determine whether the increase is due to more persons being convicted of motoring offences, more severe sentencing of those convicted or a mixture of the two.</p>

In order to reduce the number of women in custody and increase the potential for diversion, the programme will focus on improving sentencers' confidence in community disposals that offer appropriate packages and interventions and are better tailored to meet the particular needs of women offenders, including those with mental health and substance misuse problems.

This limit applies to an ordinary teaching session, including ordinary PE lessons.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.2/1">Since 1999, the average GCSE 5+ A to C performance of sports colleges has risen from 41 per cent to 48 per cent. This means that sports colleges are raising attainment at a higher rate than the national average (17 per cent increase compared to 10 per cent). This is in spite of the fact that a large proportion of sports colleges are in areas of social disadvantage, with 44 per cent of all sports colleges having a higher than average proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals. In addition, average value added in sports colleges was higher in 2003 than in 2002 at both key stages 2-3 and 3-4.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/2">Another measure of specialist schools' performance is Professor David Jesson's 2003 study of educational outcomes, which uses slightly different measures. This suggests that whole school 5+ A to C GCSE performance in sports colleges is on average 1 percentage point higher than the average for mainstream maintained secondary schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.0/1">There are 180 National Health Service Research Ethics Committees (RECs) in England, including 10 multi-centre RECs. The numbers of members on each REC have not been recorded centrally. The maximum membership is 18, and committees should have enough members always to meet the quorum of seven.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/2">A training strategy for REC members has yet to be finalised, although training has continued to be made available, through an identified training budget. Discussions and meetings were held with key stakeholders including leading members of the Association of Research Ethics Committees (AREC) and potential training providers. An initial discussion meeting was held in October 2002, to which delegates were invited from RECs in the United Kingdom. A follow-up meeting was held in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/3">The AREC does not include all ethics committees. Through the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees (COREC), the department seeks to inform and consult all committees when necessary. The main current Department of Health guidance is Governance Arrangements for NHS Research Ethics Committees. The then chair of AREC was closely involved in drafting it. AREC will be consulted when this guidance is revised.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/4">All RECs have been given the opportunity to comment on developments in training at the national and regional level. They were sent information about the proposed scheme for quality assurance and many REC members have volunteered to be assessors. The chair of the Accreditation Working Group is the vice-chair of AREC. A representative working group of REC administrators devised the standard operating procedures with COREC. Comments have been requested. The then Medicines Control Agency consulted on the draft regulations electronically as well as by paper copy. Every REC was consulted, and responses included one from AREC.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/5">The standards of COREC include that correspondence is logged on receipt and distributed to the most appropriate individual for reply, if one is required. If an early reply is not anticipated, then a holding acknowledgement is arranged. Communication also takes place by telephone, electronic mail and at meetings.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.2/1">The Central Office for Research Ethics Committees (COREC) provides management, budget and support services for the ethical review system. It was created in 2000 to help National Health Service Research Ethics Committees (RECs) operate consistently within a framework of governance; and to prepare them for operational changes required by Directive 2001/20/EC. It is misleading to compare this with the situation in 1996, when health authorities had responsibility for supporting RECs and funded this work; and an official in the Department of Health maintained information on them for policy purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.2/2">In COREC there are 13 full-time posts and four part-time posts based centrally, and 11 full-time posts and four part-time posts based regionally. The first of the COREC regional managers was appointed in the autumn of 2002. Nine are in post at present, and one takes up post on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. A total of 13 regional managers have been appointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.2/3">The department decides the annual budget for COREC following discussion with St George's Hospital NHS Trust, which provides COREC under contract. The level of staffing is based on the activities the department requires COREC to carry out during the year in question.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.0/1">There is no reason to believe that the indemnity arrangements for National Health Service Research Ethics Committees (RECs) are inadequate. There is no indication of any significant number of resignations for this reason. The Government are not aware of any formal resignations because of the possibility that a committee may not be recognised for clinical trials under the proposed Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. Since 2001, it has been Department of Health guidance that it is unacceptable for RECs to review research protocols on which any of their members is a named researcher. Very few members are known to have resigned or not extended their membership because of this potential conflict of interest. Precise numbers are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/2">The Central Office for Research Ethics Committees would not be responsible for recognising ethics committees to review clinical trials under the regulations. This would be the responsibility of the proposed United Kingdom Ethics Committee Authority (UKECA). The number of ethics committees recognised for this purpose will depend on the number, type and location of clinical trials. RECs review many proposals for studies that are not clinical trials under the proposed regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/3">The regulations would require that ethics committees must be recognised by the UKECA before they may review clinical trials under the regulations. Research ethics committees outside the National Health Service will not be required to come within the NHS system if they have an acceptable appointing authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/4">The timescales in the proposed regulations will reflect those in Directive 2001/20/EC, which apply to any ethical review of clinical trials under that directive.</p>
