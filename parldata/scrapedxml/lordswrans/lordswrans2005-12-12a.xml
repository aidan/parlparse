	<p pid="a.142.6/1">Experience of battery collection in other member states shows us that it is necessary to engage local authorities, in order to collect significant levels of household batteries.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.6/2">The forthcoming Batteries Directive will require the UK to meet collection and recycling, targets for household (portable) batteries. As part of the BREW (Business Resource Efficiency and Waste) programme being run by Defra, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently undertaking work to develop battery collection infrastructure in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.6/3">WRAP will be working closely with local authorities as they will be running a series of nationwide trials on household battery collection (starting in 2006). The LGA (Local Government Association) has sat in on the batteries advisory group.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.0/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's policy is to be very selective about calling in planning applications and only do so where issues of more than local importance are involved. In deciding to call these applications in a view about their merits has not been taken. An inspector will hold a local inquiry into the applications and make a report and recommendations taking into account, among other things, the sustainability of the proposed development.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">There are no circumstances where officials of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) or public bodies answerable to the Secretary of State DTI can search or enter the homes or business premises of UK citizens. The noble Lord may however wish to know that nominated officials of the Office of Communications (Ofcom) have authority, under powers derived from the Communications Act 2003 and in accordance with Section 15 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949, to enter premises; vehicles; vessels or aircraft, to investigate cases of suspected illegal operation of radio apparatus. For example where such operation is causing interference to safety of life services. Ofcom officials also have powers under the Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (Amendment No.2) Regulations 2003 to enter any premises, other than premises occupied only as a person's residence, if they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is a contravention of the RTTE regulations. Ofcom is the independent regulator for the communications sector. It derives its powers from statute, rather than via delegation from Ministers and is answerable directly to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.3/1">The Department for Transport has not undertaken such research. However it held an expert workshop into the medical causes of daytime sleepiness in 2002. Following that it has strengthened the advice it provides to doctors and includes a question on sleep disorders in the medical report form that must accompany any application, and re-application (from the age of 45 years), for a vocational (i.e. heavy goods vehicle or bus/coach) driving licence.</p>
