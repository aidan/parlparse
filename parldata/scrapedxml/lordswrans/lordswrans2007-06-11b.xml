	<p pid="b.227.23/1">Health visitors and nurses working in the community have a key role in assessing local health needs and demonstrating to commissioners their contribution to better health outcomes, in particular for disadvantaged groups. Health visitors provide a progressive universal service to all families and identify health needs to enable them to work closely with the most vulnerable children and families.

These events engaged with practitioners, local leaders and commissioners in clarifying the role of health visitors for the future. This work is closely linked to the Modernising Nursing Careers career pathways and educational preparation of all nurses working in the community, ensuring the community workforce is fit for the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.227.32/2">In the consultation document entitled <I>Arrangements for the Remuneration of Services Relating to Appliances within Part IX of the Drug Tariff</I>, it was proposed that dispensing appliance contractors would receive a banded infrastructure payment, depending on the volume of prescription items dispensed in one particular month. The purpose of this payment is to cover elements of service that are less volume-related compared to dispensing, such as operating within a clinical governance framework, requirements relating to dispensing repeatable prescriptions and provision of clinical information.</p>

	<p pid="b.227.50/1">The women's service at Rampton Hospital, consisting of 50 beds, has a psychiatric establishment of 3.5 full-time consultant psychiatrists, three being consultant forensic psychiatrists and 0.5 being a consultant psychiatrist in learning disabilities; two full-time staff grade doctors; and a specialist psychiatric registrar. The standard set with commissioners for the service is a ratio of one consultant per 15 patients; the current establishment slightly exceeds this standard. Each consultant psychiatrist and associated psychiatric team do not allocate a specific number of hours to each patient per week.

	<p pid="b.227.53/1">The average length of stay for women at Rampton Hospital, including those on trial leave, was 4.5 years as of April 2007. It should be noted, however, that this average figure is based on a broad variation among individual patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.53/2">Patients are discharged from Rampton Hospital when their assessed level of risk is such that their treatment can be continued in conditions of lesser security. This typically involves patients transferring to medium secure units, but in the near future will also include the new women's enhanced medium secure services available in London, Leicestershire, and the north-west. There are regular care programme approach meetings, at least yearly but initially six months after admission, where the patient's care pathway is reviewed in the presence of commissioners and representatives from the regional secure units. The progress of individual patients is also subject to independent review by mental health review tribunals, which have the power to discharge patients, albeit with the need for agreement of the Ministry of Justice for those patients on restriction orders. A small number of patients who are not responding to treatment may be returned to prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.227.56/1">Recent research by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NfER), co-sponsored by the Department for Education and Skills, suggests that provision for learning outside the classroom has either stayed broadly the same or increased over the past five years. Within this, visits to field studies centres, nature reserves, and other natural environments remain a popular and significant element, particularly in primary and special schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.56/2">Through the <I>Learning Outside the Classroom Manifesto</I> launched last November, we have formed a partnership dedicated to increasing the quality and quantity of out-of-classroom learning opportunities for all children and young people.

	<p pid="b.227.56/3">The work now being taken forward as part of the manifesto promotes the use of out-of-classroom opportunities across the whole curriculum. To support this, the department is now commissioning a major &quot;out and about&quot; package of training and guidance to support schools and early-years settings to provide more and better opportunities for learning outside the classroom. We are also working closely with provider organisations to help them co-ordinate their efforts and meet schools' needs more effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.227.59/1">Ofgem, the regulator for the gas and electricity industries, recently reviewed competition in gas and electricity connections. The review showed that competition has developed well in the gas connections market, where more than half of all new domestic gas connections are done by independent providers. However, Ofgem found that the performance of some electricity network companies in connecting new premises is unacceptable. Ofgem has therefore proposed formal licence requirements on electricity distribution network operators (DNOs) regarding mandatory standards for the provision of information and services to independent connections providers. These will replace the existing voluntary standards and be consistent with the requirements which cover gas connections. If DNOs failed to meet the proposed new standards, Ofgem has powers to investigate and take enforcement action.</p>
