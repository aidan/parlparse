	<p pid="b.137.8/1">a) Analysis of the Family Resources Survey shows that, of those people currently caring for at least 20 hours a week, around 120,000 are not building entitlement to the basic state pension and around 240,000 are not accruing entitlement to state second pension. It is possible that some of these will be caring for individuals with lower rate disability living allowance or on incapacity benefit, but due to data limitations it is not possible to say precisely how many.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.8/2">b) We estimate that of those people caring for at least 20 hours a week in 2025 around 220,000 may not be building entitlement to the basic state pension and around 330,000 may not be accruing entitlement to state second pension. It is possible that some of these will be caring for individuals with lower rate disability living allowance or on incapacity benefit, but due to data limitations it is not possible to estimate how many. Others may be caring for individuals who are awarded the middle or highest rate care component disability living allowance, attendance allowance or constant attendance allowance and therefore could qualify for the basic state pension or state second pension through the (proposed) new carer's credit from 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.8/3">Notes: Figures are based on the Family Resources Survey of the number of people who currently report themselves to be caring for 20 hours or more a week and who are not otherwise qualifying for basic state pension and/or the state second pension. 2025 estimates also reflect demographic trends and the department's carer's allowance caseload projections.</p>

	<p pid="b.137.26/1">The DfID office in India regularly assesses progress on poverty reduction and other millennium development goals (MDGs) in India. These assessments are based on official Government of India (GoI) statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.26/2">The most recent assessment of progress at the national level was undertaken in September 2004. The estimate of Dalits (also known as scheduled castes) below the poverty line is 35 per cent in rural areas, as compared with 21 per cent among other groups, and in urban areas 39 per cent of Dalits are below the poverty line as compared to 21 per cent among other groups. This is based on the most recent large-scale national sample survey of the GoI carried out in 2000. The overall proportion of the population living in poverty was assessed as 35 per cent according to the international (dollar a day) poverty line, or 360 million people.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.26/3">DfID's programme in India operates in support of the GoI's efforts to combat caste and ethnic discrimination and social exclusion in all its forms, including by strengthening programme design and monitoring to ensure that the benefits of development reach Dalits and other minority populations. DfID does not support particular programmes aimed at minority communities but promotes social inclusion in all its programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.26/4">In education, DfID supports India's national programme for achieving universal primary education (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan&mdash;SSA). One of the objectives of this programme, which was launched in September 2004, is to narrow the gap that exists between the enrolment of scheduled caste and other children.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.26/5">Special efforts are needed to ensure that Dalits are able to exercise their rights to access mainstream services. In health, for example, where child mortality (under five years) among the Dalits is 83 per 1,000 live births as compared to 22 for the general population, DfID has committed &pound;252 million in support of the GoI's national programme to promote reproductive and child health (RCH2). The programme aims to reduce all disparities in maternal and infant mortality and has specific indicators for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, women and children. There are financial incentives in RCH2 for reaching the hard-to-reach groups. The programme will improve the data available (at the national level) to track progress and make informed decisions to achieve better health outcomes for Dalits and Adivasi (scheduled tribes) women and children.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-02-07b.137.32" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="137"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70207w0001.htm#07020749000103">
	<p pid="b.137.32/1">The department entered into a 20-year PFI contract with Land Securities Trillium (LST) in 1998 known as the PRIME contract, which was expanded in 2003 following the merger of the Department of Social Security and the Employment Service. The department pays an all-inclusive unitary charge to LST for this provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.32/2">This unitary charge includes 13 reference facility management services, one of which is the provision of security. An element of the overall security package is customer care officers. Therefore, DWP does not make direct payments to security firms for this provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.32/3">The original PRIME contract and the subsequent expansion were both subject to independent audits by the National Audit Office (NAO). They concluded that the original contract represented value for money, making specific comment in 1998 that the LST deal compared favourably with continued public sector ownership and that the costs of facility management services (including security) was low.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.32/4">The customer care officer role was introduced in 2001 to complement the change in service delivery by the then newly formed Jobcentre Plus to front-of-house public waiting areas and goes beyond that of a typical security specification. Therefore, it was not possible externally to benchmark the cost of this service.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.32/5">However, the NAO concluded in its report dated January 2005 that the expansion also represented value for money, in that although this was a non-competitive expansion, LST's final price provided greater savings than the &quot;should cost model&quot; developed by DWP and its professional advisers to assist in determining value for money from the expansion.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.32/6">To date, LST has been paid approximately &pound;27 million for the period 2002-05; 2005-06 expenditure on CCOs was &pound;15.2 million. The forecast for spend in 2006-07 is approximately &pound;26.4 million and is likely to increase as a further 20 sites go live.</p>

	<p pid="b.137.41/1">Progress in moving towards the achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs) in Peru has been unequal. Between 1991 and 2002, extreme poverty in Peru increased from 23 per cent to 23.9 per cent of the population and households experiencing hunger increased from 22.3 per cent to 35.8 per cent. Since 2002, extreme poverty has been decreasing in Peru. Since 1991, maternal and infant mortality indicators have constantly improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.41/2">Progress has been slower in poor rural areas and among indigenous people. Extreme poverty affects 50.3 per cent of the population in rural areas and 9.7 per cent of the population in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.41/3">According to data provided by the United Nations development programme, Peru will meet the MDGs on poverty, health and education only if economic growth is accompanied by redistributive and social policies to tackle inequality.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.41/4">DfID continues to assist Peru to reach the millennium development goals, primarily through our contributions to the European Commission, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank. In addition, DfID's Latin America regional programme works to enhance the effectiveness of World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. This is done by strengthening the focus of operations and analytical work on poverty, inequality and inclusion. For Peru, this work is led by the DfID Andes office in Bolivia, supported by the DfID liaison officer in Lima.</p>
