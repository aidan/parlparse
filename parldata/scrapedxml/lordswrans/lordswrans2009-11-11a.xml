	<p pid="a.160.0/1">The operational improvement plan (OIP) was a high-profile programme of activities designed to drive much needed improvement in services to clients, productivity and efficiency, and to contribute towards public service agreement targets. Progress was kept under constant review during the three years of the plan, with high levels of executive scrutiny, initially by the CSA chief executive, later commissioner, and his executive team and the non-executive directors who attended the OIP programme board.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/2">The Child Support Agency report on handover to the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, published in December 2008, noted that the operational improvement plan was acknowledged to have driven up performance and made the CSA a more businesslike organisation. The commission continues to act upon the findings of the handover report.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/3">The performance of the Child Support Agency was made public throughout the duration of the OIP through the agency's quarterly summary of statistics. Between March 2006 and March 2009 the numbers of children benefiting increased from 623,000 to 780,500 and the amount of maintenance collected increased from &pound;836 million in the year to March 2006 to &pound;1,132 million in the year to March 2009. There were also improvements to the speed with which telephone inquiries were answered and the quality of the service provided.</p>

Since the start of the downturn, the Government have invested around &pound;5 billion to provide real help to people suffering the effects of unemployment, including an extra &pound;3 billion to Jobcentre Plus to provide personal help and advice to everyone who needs it. The Government remain convinced that parental employment is the most sustainable route out of poverty for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/2">The Government are committed to the eradication of child poverty and have introduced the Child Poverty Bill into Parliament. By entrenching this ambitious goal in law the Government are ensuring that eradicating child poverty is a priority for every future Government and a shared mission for our society. The Bill will require the Government to publish a child poverty strategy, to be refreshed every three years, evaluating progress towards the 2020 vision and setting milestones for further action across a wide range of policy areas.

	<p pid="a.164.2/1">At present, under Section 91 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, at general elections any candidate is entitled to send, free of charge for delivery, either to each elector, or to each address in the constituency, one piece of election material. At present, this provision enables communications to be sent to electors in UK constituencies and therefore only applies to communications that are sent to addresses within the UK. Consequently, any change to these provisions to provide for election material to be sent to electors overseas would require amendment to primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/2">There will be many candidates contesting 650 constituencies at the next general election. Many of those candidates will send an electoral communication. The delivery of this material may not take place until the election is called and the candidates known. Conveying this volume of printed material in such a short timescale would place a significant burden on the transport systems from the UK to those personnel serving overseas. Therefore, extending the provisions under Section 91 of the RPA 1983 may therefore not necessarily be the most effective way for political parties to communicate with service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/3">However, the noble Lord raises an important issue. Service personnel must have the opportunity to participate fully in our democratic processes. My right honourable friend Michael Wills recently met armed forces families' representatives to discuss arrangements for service voters and has written to invite all MPs to meet him and give their views on improvements to service voting arrangements, and this important issue will be considered as part of that process.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.0/3">Claims to drawback in the UK are now assured by a central team, enabling better targeting of high-risk claims. A pilot exercise is under way to gain a better understanding of the reasons for the recent increase in the level of drawback claims and to determine a robust operational response. Previous examination of claims indicates, that a large proportion relates to UK-produced beer.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.3/1">The national fraud strategy provides a framework for the counterfraud community to strengthen the UK's fight against fraud and make the UK a more hostile environment for fraudsters. The National Fraud Authority (NFA) is dedicated to delivering on a number of initiatives across the fraud spectrum, co-ordinating the implementation of the strategy between government, law enforcement and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/2"><I>Insurance Fraud</I></p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/3">Whilst there has been a reported increase in insurance fraud, research also shows an increase in the detection and reporting of attempted frauds by the insurance industry. Research by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) highlights improved data sharing through the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB) and a more focused approach to detecting fraud has been adopted by the insurance industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/4"><I>Information Sharing</I></p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/5">As part of the NFA's initiative to improve information sharing between public and private sector organisations, it is engaging with the Insurance Fraud Bureau and the ABI (among others) regarding the occurrence of fraud. Improving information sharing channels will serve to improve intelligence gathering, the identification of gaps in our counterfraud measures and the detection of fraud to strengthen our response.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/6"><I>Motor Insurance Fraud (Staged Motor Vehicle Accidents)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/7">General insurance fraud costs the industry &pound;1.9 billion per annum, which adds &pound;44 to the average premium of innocent policyholders. Motor insurance fraud, a highly organised multimillion pound enterprise, is a specific area of insurance fraud which has been on the increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/8">Staged motor accidents, including induced accidents which occur when an accident has deliberately been caused with an innocent motorist with the intention of making a false or inflated insurance claim, are a particularly dangerous type of motor insurance fraud involving organised criminal gangs.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/9">In response to this problem a Staged Accident Strategy Working Group (SASWG) was formed under the chair of the Ministry of Justice and latterly the ABI. The group, of which the NFA is a member, has worked with the insurance industry to raise the profile of this type of fraud and has been instrumental in instigating and supporting police enforcement action. By way of example, the IFB worked closely with the Greater Manchester Police on the Crash for Cash operation that recently resulted in the sentencing of 19 defendants for their participation in organising at least 92 fake accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/10"><I>National Fraud Reporting Centre</I></p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/11">The recent launch of the National Fraud Reporting Centre (NFRC) on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-26">26 October 2009</phrase> now provides a single point of contact for individuals and small and medium-sized businesses to report incidents of fraud. The first facility of its kind, the NFRC's mandate is to advise victims of fraud of action they can take, including directing them to appropriate authorities for further assistance, and to relay information to the police via the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB). The NFIB will be able to better identify and detect cases of insurance fraud.</p>

Coroners are independent judicial office-holders and there is no authority to compel their involvement in this project. Nevertheless, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State wrote to the Coroners' Society in March 2009 asking coroners to reconsider their position and agree to a number of coroners taking part in a pilot study, but the society declined, citing the difficulties in obtaining consent from bereaved families.</p>

Most recently, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Office Affairs, Chris Bryant, raised property issues with the Spanish Minister of State for Territorial Policy during his visit to Madrid in September 2009 and will do so again when he visits this month.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.2/4">The work-focused services pilot in 30 children's centres in 10 English local authority areas is testing how children's centres can offer an effective vehicle to engage parents in labour-market-related activity, and so move them closer to employment and ultimately into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.2/5">The School Gates Employment Initiative launched in October 2009 will enable non-working partners in low-income couple families to access support and advice at their child's school, which prepares them for, and signposts them towards, employment and training provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.2/6">We are also taking powers in the Welfare Reform Bill to introduce new measures to help partners of unemployed people find employment.</p>
