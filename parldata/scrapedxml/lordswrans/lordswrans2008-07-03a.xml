Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and London City are among those airports that are currently using a 45-minutes (non-EEA) and 25-minutes (EEA) queuing time as such a benchmark. This is the maximum wait time in which we aim to process passengers and, in turn, it informs staff deployment as well as informing considerations on further investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.8/2">In developing its impact assessment of the provision of passenger, service and crew data by carriers to the UK border agencies, the Border and Immigration Agency (now the UKBA) considered the potential for delays at check-in that may be caused by the requirement to capture passenger data for transmission to the e-Borders system.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.1/2" qnum="HL4411">What measures are being implemented by the European Union to discourage economic migrants travelling through Mauritania to the Canary Islands; and how many economic migrants are estimated to be along the Mauritanian coast waiting for passage to the Canary Islands.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">In response to the growing number of economic migrants leaving Mauritania for the Canary Islands, the European Commission (EC) allocated &euro;2.4 million in 2006-07 to establish and implement a rapid reaction mechanism to tackle illegal migration. This programme assisted migrants stranded at sea and increased the number of coastal patrols made. It largely focused on Mauritania's second city, Nouadhibou, and the surrounding waters. Spain has also provided assistance to the Mauritanian authorities through the EU's border security agency, FRONTEX. Bilateral agreements between Spain and Mauritania include measures to assist repatriation and legal organised migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">The EC's activities in Mauritania have until now largely focused on development work. However, &euro;8 million has been allocated from the 10th European Development Fund, which covers the period 2008-13, specifically to tackle migration issues. In addition, the Commission has recently allocated &euro;1.2 million to the International Organisation for Migration to assist it in its valuable work to tackle illegal migration and protect economic migrants and refugees.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">Estimates for the number of economic migrants in Mauritania vary considerably from 150,000 up to 700,000. Several hundred people, at any one time, are thought to be along the coast waiting for passage to the Canary Islands.</p>

The figures may therefore represent only a few years of saving at the 4 per cent individual contribution level. For example (d), this means that the hypothetical individual will have saved at the full level only for eight years. Those with small pension savings, resulting from few years of saving, would be able to trivially commute their pension pot.</p>
