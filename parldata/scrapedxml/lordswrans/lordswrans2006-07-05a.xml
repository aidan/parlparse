	<p pid="a.44.3/1">Information is not collected centrally in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/2">The 2005 survey <I>Drug Use, Smoking and Drinking Among Young People in England in 2005</I> reported that 1 per cent of 11 to 15 year-olds had taken speed or amphetamines, the category of drug in which methamphetamine use would be reported, in the last year.<sup>1</sup> It is important to note that within this figure will be a number of other drugs within the amphetamine category.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/3">The national drug treatment monitoring system, which is used to measure numbers in, and being retained in, drug treatment, reported 11 individuals as being in treatment, with methamphetamine identified as the primary drug of use, in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-14">14 June</phrase> this year, the Home Office Minister (Mr Vernon Coaker), announced that methamphetamine, or &quot;crystal meth&quot;, would be reclassified from a class B drug to a class A drug. This decision was based on international experience and has been taken on the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, and the well documented dangers associated with production and use of this drug in all its forms, which will now be substantially easier to combat as a result of this reclassification.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/5">Over the past few years there has been a substantial increase in the illicit use of methamphetamine in the Far East, parts of Europe and north America, but so far there has been relatively little evidence of misuse in the United Kingdom. While some seizures have been made, there is no evidence of large-scale use or demand for treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/6">Methamphetamine is a powerfully addictive stimulant that has potent effects on the central nervous system. It can be smoked, snorted, orally ingested, or injected to achieve a &quot;high&quot;. Using methamphetamine by intravenous injecting or by smoking is particularly liable to lead to addiction. We do not hold information on the incidence of recovery from such addiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/7"><sup>1</sup> A survey carried out for the Health and Social Care Information Centre and the Home Office by the National Centre for Social Research and the National Foundation for Educational Research. More than 9,000 pupils took part in the survey throughout England.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/1">The Government have made good progress towards implementing statutory tenancy deposit schemes, which will apply to all assured shorthold tenancies, where a deposit is taken, in England and Wales:</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/2">There will be two types of scheme: a single custodial scheme, where deposits will be paid into and held in a separate account, and one or more insurance-based schemes, where the landlord or agent will hold the deposit and any failure on his/her part to repay it to the tenant will be covered by the scheme's insurance arrangements. Each scheme will offer an alternative dispute resolution service.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/3">The schemes were originally due to be commenced on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase>. However, in a press release published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-23">23 June 2006</phrase> to accompany the publication of a summary of responses to a consultation document published in November 2005, the Government said that, in order to consider stakeholder concerns raised by that consultation, they had decided to review the commencement date and would confirm that date before Parliament rose in the summer.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-05a.49.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="49"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60705w0200.htm#06070594000100">
	<p pid="a.49.0/1">The MoD recognises post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a serious and disabling condition, but one which can be treated. We attach a high priority to increasing awareness of stress-related disorders, and to their diagnosis and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/2">Teaching and training service personnel about operational stress and its management starts at the time of entry into the services and continues through their career.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/3">We have put in place measures to increase awareness at all levels and to militate against the development of PTSD and other stress-related disorders occurring among service personnel. These include pre- and post-deployment briefing and the availability of support, assessment and, if required, treatment, both during and after deployments. This is available to all personnel, whether regular or mobilised reservist.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/4">During their pre-deployment medical, while deployed or during the post-deployment normalisation period, all personnel including reservists can identify themselves to any medical officer or their chain of command if they believe they are suffering from any mental health condition. It is our policy that no stigma should be attached to this. Diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, including PTSD, is then performed by fully trained and accredited mental health staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/5">Mental health professionals (psychiatrists and/or mental health nurses) are part of the deployed medical team on all significant operational deployments. This team will continue the educational process during the operational tour and will also brief the chain of command about operational mental health issues that are detected. Individuals might be referred to the team for assessment and management&mdash;the therapeutic options will include psychological treatments, the use of medication, or aeromedical evacuation of the individual out of theatre back to further care at their home base.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/6">After deployment, it is policy to offer individuals a further briefing prior to returning to their home base, using a variety of media materials. Efforts are also made to arrange a &quot;decompression period&quot; during which service men can begin mentally and physically to unwind after their operational tour while having time to talk to colleagues and superiors about their experiences. Such a decompression phase appears to help the return to the non-operational environment. Returning personnel are also offered a presentation and issued with leaflets to alert them to the possible after-effects of the operational deployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/7">Once back at their home base, community-based mental healthcare is available to every military unit via our 15 departments of community mental health (DCMH) across the UK plus satellite centres overseas. DCMH teams comprise psychiatrists and mental health nurses, with access to clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. The aim is to see referred individuals at their unit medical centre and, with the patient's permission, to engage with GPs and the patient's chain of command to help manage any mental health problems identified. The full range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available, including medication, psychological therapies and environmental adjustment, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/8">Inpatient care, when necessary, is provided in psychiatric units belonging to the Priory Group. Close liaison is maintained between DCMHs and the Priory units to ensure that all service elements relating to an inpatient's care and management are addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/9">Should it be decided, after a patient has been assessed and managed as effectively as possible, that he/she will not be able to continue serving in the Armed Forces and will therefore need to be medically discharged, every effort is made to ensure a seamless transfer back to civilian life. The MoD liaises with the individual's future civilian GP and any NHS consultant that he or she might need to see. Individuals are referred to the defence mental health social workers, who offer the individual significant help in rehabilitating them back to civilian life, with advice on resettlement, medical issues, pensions, housing, employment etc. Service personnel are also made aware of the services offered by ex-service men's organisations such as the Royal British Legion and the specialist mental health charity Combat Stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/10">Upon leaving the Armed Forces, or on demobilisation for reservists, it is the long-established practice that responsibility for medical care passes to the NHS, and for the majority of veterans their health needs will be met by current NHS provisions. However, the MoD has work in hand to ensure that there is a coherent response to veterans' mental health issues, co-ordinating inputs from the NHS, health departments throughout the UK, the services and ex-service men's organisations, including the charity Combat Stress. Indeed, for treatments not available under the NHS, the Government fund courses of care at Combat Stress facilities, which last year cost &pound;2.8 million, for those whose condition is due to service and for whom this is an appropriate course.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/11">In support of these developments, the MoD is also working on further initiatives relating, for example, to the prevention and management of problems arising out of operational stress and to the need to address issues of stigma and discrimination. With respect to the department's responsibility for veterans in particular, we have work in hand to ensure that service leavers can recognise the signs of stress and know where to go for help, using suitable magazine-style material.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.0/12">The MoD recently announced a new mental healthcare initiative for recently demobilised reservists, which will include a dedicated mental health assessment by appropriately qualified members of the Defence Medical Services (DMS). If individuals are then assessed as having a mental health problem that is categorised primarily as PTSD or a related traumatic adjustment disorder that is linked to their mobilised service, they will be offered outpatient treatment by the DMS. In instances where the assessment identifies cases that fall outside these parameters, such as complex multi-disorder diagnoses or acute cases requiring inpatient care, the DMS will refer them to the appropriate NHS provider, as well as encouraging contact with the relevant welfare organisations to ensure follow-up. Details of the programme will be confirmed later this year, including the location(s) at which the assessments will be provided, and the date on which the service will commence.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">Following the recent inquests into the tragic deaths of James Miller and Thomas Hurndall in Gaza, the coroner wrote to me asking that I consider possible prosecutions in the United Kingdom. Since receiving that request, I met both the families on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May</phrase> to discuss the cases. I also took advantage of a long-standing arrangement to visit Israel in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-21">21 May</phrase> to have a meeting with the Attorney General and the Military Advocate General and the military prosecutors involved in these two cases. I also raised these cases in meetings with the Israeli Foreign Minister and the Minister of Justice and separately held meetings with Israeli lawyers, including the lawyers for the families. The principal purpose was to obtain further information about the cases and the investigations that were undertaken by the Israeli authorities to inform my decision, but I also raised the issue of holding an independent inquiry into the deaths and subsequent investigation and pressed for appropriate compensation to be paid, particularly to Mrs Miller, without delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">The Israeli authorities are now actively considering disciplinary action against a soldier for lying in the course of the field investigation that took place following the death of James Miller. I also understand that the Israeli authorities are keen to make contact with the Miller family to discuss compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">My office has passed information about my visit to the Crown Prosecution Service and the Metropolitan Police and has also updated the English solicitors acting for the Miller and Hurndall families.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/4">As a result of my visit I expect to obtain further information shortly that will assist me in carrying out my independent role in considering prosecutions in the United Kingdom. I will inform the House once I have reached a concluded view.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-05a.59.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60705w0202.htm#06070594000285">
	<p pid="a.59.0/1">The implications of the interpretation of &quot;placing on the market&quot; have been part of the consideration throughout negotiations on the proposal that became Directive 2004/42/EC and in relation to the regulations transposing that directive into UK national law.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/2">Industry has been aware of the provisions of the directive in respect of the timetable for meeting their obligations since it was adopted in April 2004. The directive includes provisions that allow for stock manufactured before <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase> to be sold until <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/3">My officials are discussing options with representatives from the paint industry but we do not accept that disposal as waste is the only option for compliance. The industry tells us that 85 per cent to 90 per cent of products expected to be in the supply chain after <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2007</phrase> will comply with the directive's requirements on solvent content. These products could be sold by adding a label with the information needed by the regulations. The industry already has experience of undertaking such an exercise when it introduced a voluntary solvent-content labelling scheme for its products. It would be a commercial decision for those holding these stocks to treat them as waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/4">My officials will continue to work with the industry to help them find the best environmental outcome to meet their obligations arising from the requirements.</p>
