	<p pid="a.5.2/1">The new tax credit will build on the foundation of universal Child Benefit. The Prime Minister has decided that responsibility for Child Benefit in Great Britain will transfer to Inland Revenue so that, when the new credit is introduced in 2003, Government support for children will be administered by one department. Until the transfer takes place, Child Benefit will remain the responsibility of the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.5/1">The Prime Minister has asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to undertake a review of the strategic issues surrounding energy policy for Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/2">The review will be set within the context of meeting the challenge of global warming, while ensuring secure, diverse and reliable energy supplies at a competitive price.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/3">The aim of the review will be to set out the objectives of energy policy and to develop a strategy that ensures that current policy commitments are consistent with longer-term goals. The findings will also inform the Government's response to last year's report from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Energy--the changing climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/4">The work the PIU has already started, on resource productivity and renewable energy, will be an important input into this project. This review will work closely with the resource productivity team and the main Whitehall departments, as well as business, international institutions, other governments and non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/5">The Minister for Industry and Energy will chair an Advisory Group for this project, which will report by the end of the year. Other Ministers on the Advisory Group include the Minister for the Environment and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.5/1">I am pleased to announce that the pilot project assessing the feasibility of sight-impaired people acting as magistrates has been completed. It has been a great success. Nine sight-impaired people were recruited as Justices of the Peace to the Commission areas of Leicestershire, Devon, North East London, Wiltshire, Humberside and Manchester. Each was appointed after having met the normal selection criteria and completed the training. The responses from those who have worked with the sight-impaired magistrates have shown that each one of them has made a positive and valuable contribution to the work of their Bench. I am therefore removing, forthwith, the bar to appointment of sight-impaired applicants as Justices of the Peace.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Commons), Mr Elliot Morley, represented the UK at the Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="">18 June</phrase> together with Ms Rhona Brankin, the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development in the Scottish Executive and Ms Brid Rogers, Northern Irish Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/2">The Council had a full discussion of the Commission's Green Paper on the 2002 Review of the Common Fisheries Policy. There was considerable support for the UK's major concerns: to work towards a policy which is economically and environmentally sustainable; to retain the system of total allowable catches and quotas distributed according to relative stability; to continue with existing restrictions on access, in particular the 6 and 12-mile limits which we argued should be established permanently; to provide for increased involvement of fishermen in developing fisheries policy, in particular through a regionalised approach; to address more effectively the environmental impacts of fishing, reducing discards, recognising the value of low impact fishing and angling, and minimising the adverse effects of fishing on non-target species such as small cetaceans; to ensure more consistent and effective enforcement across all member states; and to tackle more effectively the imbalance between fishing capacity and stocks, not least by ending the use of subsidies by grant-aiding more powerful and efficient vessels.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/3">The work on the Green Paper will continue under the Belgian Presidency and the Commission is expected to produce detailed legislative proposals later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/4">The Council agreed conclusions on the Commission's action plan on biodiversity. We welcomed these, and in particular the commitment to give priority for action for the most sensitive species listed in the Habitats Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/5">The Commission introduced a communication setting out its thinking on the longer-term multi-annual recovery plans for cod and hake stocks. There was also some discussion of the more immediate measures for North Sea cod which are currently being negotiated with Norway. The Commissioner emphasised the serious state of the stocks and the need to take substantial measures if the stocks are to be able to recover. We supported the development of action plans and the inevitable constraints on fishing which would be required if they were to be effective. But at the same time we stressed the importance of engaging the fishing industry in the development of plans and the need to take sufficient account of their impact on returns from fishing. The Commission is expecting to conclude negotiations on North Sea cod with Norway shortly and to introduce measures applicable in 2002; detailed proposals on longer term measures will be put to the Council for consideration in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/6">In view of the failure to establish a new fisheries agreement with Morocco, the Council agreed that the existing provision for structural funds to be made available to support the fishing fleets affected would be extended until the end of 2001. The Commission plans to make proposals shortly for a restructuring scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/7">Finally, the Commission presented a proposal to extend the multi-annual guidance programme (MAGP IV) for one year until the end of 2002. This will be considered in detail by the Council in the autumn.</p>
