As part of this training, a 10-day residential training course is held at the Centrex police training centre in Bramshill for 12 senior Sierra Leone police officers each year. Diversity training, fairness and equality are golden threads running throughout all the training elements of this course. While the apprehension of those responsible for the murder of Ms Fanny Ann Eddy is a matter for the Sierra Leone Police (SLP), British police are helping to rebuild and strengthen the Sierra Leone Police generally. Furthermore, 10 seconded British police officers are serving on secondment in the UN Mission in Sierra Leone and responsible for training the Sierra Leone Police in issues including the respect for human rights. The Government are also actively involved in the setting up of the Human Rights Commission in Sierra Leone and remain committed to the promotion of human rights in that country.</p>

It is a regional trade agreement and as such will have no direct impact on UK policies. But, if ratified, US-CAFTA should lead to greater harmonisation of trade policies and standards in the region and thus new opportunities for trade and investment.

Licensing authorities have also been advised that the only mandatory conditions that may be imposed are contained in the primary legislation itself, and that blanket conditions which cut across the individual consideration of applications must be avoided.

	<p pid="a.85.8/1">Clinical trials conducted with Pediacel have demonstrated that it showed appropriate safety and effectiveness for use in the United Kingdom's primary infant immunisation schedule. The prescribing information (Summary of Product Characteristics) for this vaccine is in the public domain, and contains some clinical trial details of the vaccine's effectiveness and tolerability.

Evidence for the safety and efficacy of Pediacel can also be derived from the experience of the use of a five component acellular pertussis vaccine (called Pentacel) in Canada as part of the routine schedule since 1997. This vaccine contains the same components as Pediacel. Since the introduction of this vaccine, over 10 million doses have been distributed. A number of papers showing the efficacy and safety of this vaccine in Canada have been published as follows.</p>
