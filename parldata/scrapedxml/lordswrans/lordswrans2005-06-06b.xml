	<p pid="b.32.2/1">We recognise post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a serious and disabling condition, but one which can be treated.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/2">A post-deployment briefing pack is given to all personnel as they leave theatre, which includes leaflets and a presentation covering PTSD reactions. Reservists are also given details of service charities such as Combat Stress, the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmens' Families Association (SSAFA) and the Royal British Legion.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/3">As part of routine demobilisation, reservists receive medical screening and are able to discuss any healthcare concerns, including mental health issues, with a medical officer.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/4">An individual's TA unit will organise a recuperation day about six to 10 weeks after demobilisation. This involves a presentation on &quot;Stress: Definitions, Signs, Symptoms and Treatments&quot; and appropriate points of contact for help. The recuperation day also assists the unit in identifying any individuals who may be in need of help.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/5">Veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict or of operations in the Gulf since 2003 can also be referred by their GP or Service Medical Officer to the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP). The GVMAP can refer patients, where appropriate, to a country-wide network of psychiatric assessment centres with staff with specialist knowledge of the psychological injury of conflict and PTSD.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/6">Once reservists are demobilised, with the exception of the recuperation day, the work of the GVMAP and any general welfare monitoring by their chain of command when the unit goes on exercise, responsibility for all aspects of their healthcare passes to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/7">Between January 2003 and December 2004, 824 personnel (regular and reservist) who had returned from Iraq&mdash;or around 1 per cent of total service personnel deployed over the period&mdash;were assessed as suffering from a psychiatric disorder. Of those, 93&mdash;or around 0.1 per cent of total service personnel deployed over the period&mdash;were assessed as fulfilling the diagnosis criteria for PTSD.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.3/1">It is the responsibility of the acting returning officer to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that votes are properly verified and counted, and that the result is correctly declared. There are a number of factors that might affect how long it takes for votes to be counted and the result declared, which will vary between individual constituencies. The main ones are: the time taken to transport ballot boxes from polling places to the count, voter turnout, the number of rejected ballot papers, the number of postal votes to be opened at the count, the staffing arrangements at the count, and the closeness of the result.</p>

The appeal process is essential in helping to ensure the agency's conclusive maps of open country are as accurate as possible when the new right comes into force.

The agency has already circulated a questionnaire to all coastal local authorities to gather information on current access, perceptions of problems and opportunities. It has also undertaken a number of case studies focusing on a number of different coastal situations. We have asked the agency to complete this work by the early summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.2/1">Yes. The definition of waste in force in the UK is that in Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC) which provides that &quot;waste&quot; is &quot;any substance or object . . . which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/2">All member states are required to transpose and implement this definition and it is not within the power of national governments to exclude any particular substance or object from it. Whether or not a substance or object is discarded as waste; and when waste ceases to be waste, are matters which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. It rests, in the first place, with the producer or holder of a substance to decide whether it is being discarded as waste and the &quot;competent authorities&quot; designated under Article 6 of the directive are responsible for its implementation (e.g. the Environment Agency in England and Wales).</p>
	<p pid="b.41.2/3">The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued a number of judgments on the definition's interpretation and the meaning of &quot;discard&quot;. ECJ judgments are binding on all member states and their competent authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.5/1">The manifesto commitment to consider local sourcing of fresh produce reinforces the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI), which has been under-way for nearly two years. Two key objectives of the PSFI are (i) to increase the opportunities for small local producers and suppliers to tender for contracts for the supply of food and (ii) to increase the capacity of local suppliers to meet demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.5/2">Public sector contracting authorities are encouraged to specify more fresh food as a way of increasing opportunities for local producers and promoting the consumption of more nutritious food. Advice is given on the PSFPI website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/sustain/procurement/regions.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/farm/sustain/procurement/regions.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.5/3">Defra is working with other public sector organisations, including the Department for Health and Department for Education and Skills, to implement and monitor the PSFPI. An updated communications strategy, planned for June 2005, will help to convey the key messages to those who influence the food procurement activities in schools, hospitals, government offices and other public bodies.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.5/1">The Gangmasters (Licensing Authority) Regulations 2005 give the board of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority the power to regulate its own procedures in most respects. Regulation 8(3) allows for a change in quorum of the board. A motion to change the quorum must be supported by at least five board members. Should five members support the proposed motion, those present would proceed to vote on the proposed motion according to the voting method in Regulation 8(4) and (5) (i.e. a simple majority of voting members present, including the chair or deputy chair, with the chair or deputy chair having the casting vote if votes are equally divided). Any new quorum must include the chairman or, in his absence, the deputy chairman. If a motion to change the quorum is approved by the board, this provision would remain in place until a further motion is tabled, supported by five board members and then voted upon and approved by the board. The regulations place no limit on the frequency or timing of such motions. However, the board may regulate its own procedure pursuant to Regulation 8(1)(a) and could decide administratively to require a minimum period of notice before any motion is considered or regulate the frequency of changes to the quorum.</p>
