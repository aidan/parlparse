	<p pid="a.15.5/1">Retention is generally satisfactory across the Armed Forces. Nevertheless in some important areas, exit rates are still too high and require us to work hard at retaining people in these areas. Retention measures such as commitment bonuses, re-engagement packages, financial retention initiatives and initiatives to improve work/life balance and working conditions at the front line, continue to be used with the aim of discouraging outflow.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/2">No specific retention incentives are aimed at service personnel at their mid-career point other than the attractive terms and conditions of service and remuneration package offered by the Armed Forces. Our general aim is to maintain stable levels of retention through policies that genuinely reflect the priorities of our people and their families whilst optimising their operational effectiveness. For example, the Service Personnel Command Paper was designed to end any disadvantage imposed by the unique demands of service life today, and provide for special treatment where appropriate.</p>

This scheme will work within the existing electoral timetable and legislative framework, due to the time saving made by using the regular military supply flights to Afghanistan. Operational priorities must prevail at all times; success cannot be guaranteed. We will offer proxy voting application forms for personnel for whom operational demands would make the completion and return of postal votes difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">In order to facilitate the inclusion on the electoral register of personnel in theatre, the Electoral Commission is producing registration forms and accompanying guidance which will be circulated to personnel in theatre and due to deploy. We plan to make forms available in Afghanistan and to those going there and use the MoD intranet to support this work, by also making them available electronically to personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/3">In terms of election literature, under Section 91 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, at general elections any candidate is entitled to send, free of charge for delivery, either to each elector, or to each address in the constituency, one piece of election material. At present, this provision only applies to communications that are sent to addresses within the UK. Any change to these provisions would require amendment to primary legislation. There will be many candidates contesting 650 constituencies at the next general election. The delivery of their electoral material may not take place until the election is called and the candidates known. Conveying this volume of printed material in such a short timescale would place a significant burden on the transport systems from the UK to those personnel serving overseas. A better way for political parties to communicate with service personnel stationed overseas might be via the internet. There is good internet access at bases in Afghanistan and in other overseas locations. Many candidates and parties have websites, and service personnel are able to access information in this way.</p>

Ten of the 16 respondents indicated that they are planning to check personal identifiers on all returned postal voting statements at next year's elections.

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">The National Offender Management Service has a target of 42 days from the date of receipt of the recommendation for considering a Parole Board recommendation for transfer to open conditions and issuing a final decision. In a sample of 100 recent cases, this target was met in 86 per cent of cases. Based on the same sample, the average period of time spent considering whether to accept a recommendation was 29.6 days. In some complex cases, it will take longer to deal with a recommendation, due to aspects of the case that require closer scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>, the shortest amount of time taken from receipt of the recommendation to issuing the response is the same day. The longest case recorded since <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> is, exceptionally, 438 days. However, since that recommendation was first received and considered, new streamlined processes have been put in place which have significantly improved the timeliness of consideration and have prevented such delays from recurring.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/3">The Secretary of State does not have a policy of giving higher priority to the handling of recommendations for transfer to open conditions in cases where the prisoner's Parole Board hearing has been delayed. The 42 day target is applied from the date of receipt, and recent sampling demonstrates that 86 per cent of cases are considered within that target.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/4">Consideration is being given to whether there is scope to reduce the target. Furthermore, we are working closely with the board to introduce a raft of measures to reduce the scope for parole delays and ensure that all cases are dealt with in a timely way.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/1">The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) continues to experience funding shortfalls for both its core programme, which provides education, health and social services to refugees in the region, and its emergency programme, which addresses immediate humanitarian needs. UNRWA's projected deficit for the current year for its core programme is $54 million, of which $18 million is attributable to Gaza. To date UNRWA has received only limited donations to its recently launched 2010 Gaza emergency appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.5/2">When our share of EU finding is included, the UK is UNRWA's second largest bilateral donor.

In 2010, we intend to provide &#163;22 million in core funding.</p>
