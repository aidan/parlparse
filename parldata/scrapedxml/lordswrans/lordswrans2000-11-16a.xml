	<p pid="a.41.2/2">Ministers of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), including my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, met the Pakistani Foreign Minister in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-15">15 September</phrase>. They reiterated their call, first made in the aftermath of the coup, for the restoration of democracy and for a clear and credible timetable for achieving this. Regrettably, the Pakistani Foreign Minister was unable to provide satisfactory assurances on these issues. In the continued absence of such a timetable, CMAG will need to consider at its next meeting all options, including the possibility of further measures to be taken against Pakistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the National Statistician, Len Cook, dated <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-15">15 November 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent questions on the Retail Price Index (RPI). Your first question asks what would be the RPI excluding mortgage payments (RPIX) in September 2000 if the depreciation of owner occupied houses, which has been a component of the index since 1995, had never been introduced; and how this compares with the RPIX for that month (HL4530). Your second question asks for an approximate calculation of the theoretical RPIX for September 2000 on the following basis: (a) that the depreciation component for owner occupied houses was introduced in 1950, (b) that the rate of inflation since 1950 has been 2000 per cent, and (c) that the increase in house prices since 1950 has been 4,750 per cent; and how this figure compares with the actual RPIX for September 2000 (HL4531).</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/4">In response to your first question, the Retail Price Index excluding both mortgage interest payments and depreciation stood at 167.4 in September 2000 compared to 168.9 for RPIX. The annual rate of change of the Retail Price Index excluding both mortgage interest payments and depreciation was 1.8 per cent compared to 2.2 per cent for RPIX in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/5">These figures are published each month in table 2 of the Consumer Price Indices First Release and on the National Statistics website <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">www.statistics.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/6">In response to your second question, I am unable to provide an estimate both for reasons of disproportionate cost and because it would not be accurate enough to be of publishable quality. The Retail Prices Index is chainlinked annually and to calculate even an approximate estimate of a hypothetical RPI for September 2000 would require weightings for the depreciation component for each year as well as reworking all the other RPI component weights for each year. In addition it would be necessary to remove the &quot;rental equivalent&quot; of owner occupied housing that was included in the RPI between 1956 and 1974 to avoid double counting of housing costs (the rental equivalent includes an element of depreciation).</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/7">You might like to note that had the depreciation component been included in the RPI since 1950 the latest annual inflation rate would be unaffected as this only depends on price changes in the last year. The annual rate of change of RPIX for September 2000, had depreciation been included from 1950, would therefore be identical to the current published figure, 2.2 per cent, apart from rounding differences.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.5/1">At the time of the Roads Review in July 1998 we decided to take forward consideration of the A63 Melton Grade Separated Junction in Yorkshire. We can now confirm that following further work, including a full appraisal, and consultation with the regional planning body, the scheme has been added to the targeted programme of improvements. By removing three existing junctions the scheme will improve safety and reduce delays. It will also facilitate access to enable regeneration of a large area of brownfield land to the south of the A63 on the banks of the Humber. Draft orders for the scheme were published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-17">17 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/2">Further additions to the programme will in general depend on the outcome of studies commissioned as a result of the Roads Review and priorities identified in the course of development of regional transport strategies within the context of regional planning guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/3">However, if the objectives of investment in trunk roads under the 10-year plan are to be delivered, it is important that we make some immediate progress. Therefore, we have initiated consultations with regional planning bodies to consider possible targeted improvements to tackle problems on those parts of the core trunk road network not being considered within a study. As part of this exercise we will also consider whether decisions can be taken on taking forward some targeted improvements within the areas covered by studies without prejudicing the strategic context of the study in question or the emerging regional transport strategy. Specific proposals for improvements will be evaluated using the new approach to appraisal to ensure they are consistent with our transport criteria of safety, economy, environmental impact, accessibility and integration. We will make an announcement about the outcome of this exercise in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.5/4">We can also confirm that work on the programme of 100 early action schemes to tackle localised safety and congestion problems on the trunk road network announced at the time of the 10-year plan has begun. Copies of a leaflet showing the locations of these schemes have been placed in the Library.</p>
