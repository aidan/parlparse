	<p pid="a.89.5/2">We share the view of the Afghan people that security remains a priority and are concerned that the Afghan Transitional Administration does not yet have adequate means to deal in an effective manner with ongoing threats to security beyond Kabul. Options are currently being discussed for addressing this problem in the short term. Ultimately, the solution to the question of security in Afghanistan must lie in building up indigenous security and law and order forces capable of addressing likely sources of instability.

	<p pid="a.90.5/1">In September, the Home Secretary asked Stephen Shaw, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, to look at the case of Malcolm Rourke. This was a disturbing and shocking crime and we extend every sympathy to the victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/2">Instances where an offender on licence supervision commits an offence of similar gravity to the original one are thankfully few in number. However, because of the devastating effect these crimes can have on the lives of their victims, there can never be any room for complacency among those whose task it is to supervise such offenders. That is why the Home Secretary asked Stephen Shaw to undertake this inquiry. This work has now been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/3">We are grateful to Stephen and his team for conducting such a thorough investigation and for producing a detailed analysis of how the arrangements for managing and recalling dangerous offenders can be further enhanced. Although the report concluded that there was no evidence of negligence or incompetence, it did make a number of constructive recommendations as to how these arrangements might be strengthened in the future. These have been accepted in full and will now be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/4">It is a sad reality that there are no guarantees with this type of work. It is not always possible to foresee and prevent crimes committed by people on licence any more than it is possible to do so for those without previous convictions. We can however learn lessons and make sure that every effort is made to protect the public. In particular, the most important change is that in future recall decisions will be taken by the local probation service which is supervising the offender.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/5">In addition, the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament includes provisions to enable the courts to pass an indeterminate sentence on those who continue to present a danger to society and ensure that they remain in custody until it is considered safe to release them.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/6">We will not be publishing the full report as it would place individuals who have been exonerated from any suggestion of wrongdoing in an unfair position. A summary of the case, terms of reference and key findings are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/7">Following the conviction of Malcolm Rourke in August 2002 for the offences of rape and robbery, committed while he was subject to licence supervision, the Home Secretary asked Stephen Shaw, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, to conduct an inquiry into the handling of the case. The terms of reference were:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/8" class="indent">&quot;To examine the way in which the Prison Service and the National Probation Service managed the case of Malcolm Rourke following his release from custody on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-14">14 June 2002</phrase>; to consider whether, in light of this case, any changes need to be made to the arrangements for managing the post-release supervision and recall of dangerous offenders; and to make recommendations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/9">The key findings of the inquiry are:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/10">There was no evidence of negligence or incompetence in the handling of the case by individual members of staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/11">There were information gaps and communication problems between the Probation Service, Prison Service and Parole Board concerning recall procedures for offenders released under licensed supervision and these must be rectified.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/12">The right to recall dangerous offenders should in future rest with assistant chief officers of probation (whose staff deal directly with the offenders under supervision), subject to Parole Board review and not with the Prison Service's Sentencing Enforcement Unit, as at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/13">The status of information gathered by multi-agency public protection panels should be clarified to ensure that the Parole Board is in possession of any information which has a bearing upon risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/14">Prison Service guidance to staff on recalls should be updated and improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/15">There needs to be further training for prison and probation staff on making and responding to requests for recall of high risk offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/16">Statistical information on recalls should be collated and disseminated to staff in probation areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/17">Communication between hostels and probation staff in the field should be reviewed and there should be single electronic probation case records which are accessible to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/18">In appropriate cases, the Probation Service should give consideration to transferring the case management role to the hostel manager or developing a co-working arrangement. Action Plan</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/19">All of the recommendations have been accepted and work is under way to implement them.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/20">The right to recall dangerous offenders will rest with the assistant chief probation officer in the area concerned, subject to Parole Board review, not with the SEU.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/21">The National Probation Service is planning to introduce the electronic version of the offender assessment system (OASys) by <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">31 December 2003</phrase>. This will provide a single case assessment which staff in each area will have access to.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/22">The introduction of OASys and the development of its application to include supervising officers' case notes will further enhance communication between hostels and probation staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/23">The National Probation Directorate will establish a recall forum with representatives from the Home Office's Sentence Enforcement Unit, the National Probation Directorate, the Parole Board and other agencies who might have an interest in this process. This forum will review the collation of recall management information across the agencies; identify gaps; and ensure more effective information sharing systems are put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/24">New guidance on recalls, in the form of a probation circular, will be issued to NPS staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/25">Representatives from NPD, SEU and the Parole Board have already met with legal advisers to address the status of MAPPP documentation and this will be clarified as part of further guidance to be issued on MAPPA early next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/26">Internal restructuring within SEU will include responsibility for overseeing and regularly updating guidance on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/27">Leicestershire and Rutland Probation Area will consider what further training requirements are needed in the light of this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/28">The review of the serious incident reporting system has led to the piloting of new arrangements in two probation areas. In evaluating these pilots consideration will be given to strengthening the service's investigatory arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.6/1">I and the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels on 28-<phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/2">The A points were approved as in document PTS A 62 (14754/02) (a copy of which has been placed in the Library) with the exception of item 16. Ministers signed the Protocol to the Europol Convention agreed at item 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/3">The Presidency advised on progress in implementing the Seville European Council conclusions, presenting a report on action taken to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking and on management of the external border. Member states urged the Commission to produce its overdue report on financial resources for repatriation, border management and migration projects. The Commission explained that the financial resources had to come from the current financial perspective, which required re-evaluation of existing commitments within the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Committee and External Relations budgets but that national expenditure would need to remain a significant source of funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/4">The Council adopted negotiating mandates for the Commission to pursue readmission agreements with Turkey, Albania, Algeria and China. The aim will be to agree arrangements with those countries for the return of their nationals who have entered the European Union illegally. Over lunch, Ministers also discussed the application of the re-admission provision in the Cotonou agreement. This would allow member states to approach African, Caribbean and Pacific countries bilaterally to ask them to take back their nationals.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/5">The Council discussed the time limits to be applied for determining responsibility for an asylum claim in the regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third-country national (Dublin II). The Presidency concluded that member states would have one week in which to accept or reject a compromise package comprising a time limit of one year for responsibililty on the basis of illegal entry across the external frontier and five months for tolerated illegal presence in a member state. The Council agreed that the latter criterion should apply only to asylum seekers illegally present after the entry into force of the regulation. The Council also agreed to a minutes statement addressing the possible future inclusion in the regulation's scope of applicants for subsidiary protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/6">The Council held a brief discussion of Articles 1-19 of the council directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection concerning the definition of a refugee and those entitled to subsidiary protection. However, two member states maintained reservations on the text.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/7">With the exception of one member state, Ministers agreed to amend Article 16 of the directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in member states in line with a United Kingdom proposal allowing for the refusal of support to asylum seekers making late applications. The one other remaining reserve on the text was lifted following a change to Article 11 concerning access to labour markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/8">The Council also agreed a Statement declaring the European free trade areas and accession states (from the date of signature of the accession treaties) to be safe third countries for the purposes of asylum.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/9">The Council adopted a Community programme on the return of third country nationals to source countries and a programme intended specifically to address returns to Afghanistan. The Council also took note of Council conclusions agreed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase> concerning the integration of immigration policy into the Union's relations with third countries. I welcomed the conclusions as a positive first step but called for the monitoring of returns projects to ensure that they were effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/10">The Council agreed a package of provisions on child abduction for inclusion in the regulation concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility. These were based on retention of existing Hague Convention arrangements with additional rules where a non-return order has been issued under the 1980 Hague Convention on Child Abduction. In order to encourage other member states to accept the compromise, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, proposed the creation of a strict timetable to initiate custody proceedings in the home court following a non-return order.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/11">Consequently, member states were also able to agree the Council decision authorising the member states, in the interest of the European Community, to sign the convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/12">The Council agreed to revise the negotiating mandate for the draft agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on judicial co-operation in criminal matters and on extradition.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/13">The Council discussed a Presidency compromise package intended to address member states' outstanding reservations on the proposed offences in the framework decision combating racism and xenophobia. I, with four other member states, agreed that that proposal struck the right balance between punishing racist and xenophobic acts and protecting freedom of expression. However, the remaining member states were divided in either expressing fundamental problems with the scope of the instrument or wanting to go substantially further, in particular in reducing the threshold for criminal liability.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/14">The Presidency sought agreement to its compromise proposal regarding the abolition of the dual criminality requirement in the framework decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. This would enable member states to maintain dual criminality for a transitional period of up to five years. Although this was acceptable to the majority of delegations, including the United Kingdom, five member states maintained reservations.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/15">Two member states maintained reservations on the proposed penalties for trafficking in small quantities of drugs in the framework decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/16">Two member states also maintained reservations on the scope of the offences of active and passive corruption in Article 2 of the framework decision on combating corruption in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/17">Under any other business, the Presidency emphasised the importance of securing an agreement between Europol and the United States of America on the exchange of personal data. The Commission also asked the Council to consider its proposal for a Council decision on financing certain activities carried out by Europol to fight terrorism. The latter point would be considered at the December JHA Council.</p>

The DTI is now extending its support to facilitate the provision of insurance services to Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc on a world-wide basis. Both these actions have been taken to secure Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc from the harm caused by the criminal intimidaton and assault being directed at its employees, including their families and friends, and also those of its suppliers, customers and other companies. Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc is a world-leading provider in the highly regulated area of essential research, development and toxicological testing services for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and chemical industries.

	<p pid="a.97.6/1">The Government have assisted small accommodation providers in a number of ways during 2002. For example, small hotel businesses will have benefited from over &pound;5 million provided by government for the regional tourist boards (including London) to help promote their regions and individual businesses. In addition, the British tourist authorities' activities in promoting Britain overseas as an attractive tourist destination bring an additional &pound;1 billion per year of expenditure by inbound visitors to this country, from which businesses of all sizes, including smaller ones, benefit. The Small Business Service (SBS), with an annual budget of over &pound;400 million, is dedicated to championing the interests of small businesses and building an enterprise society in which all small businesses thrive and achieve their potential. The SBS recently published a new guidance pack for small business entitled Access to EU funding which complements the Government's comprehensive support for business start-ups and established small firms. The money is primarily available to improve competitiveness, productivity and innovation. Finally, small accommodation providers also benefit from the existence of sensibly designed quality schemes, aimed at ensuring that consumers' expectations are met so that return visits and recommendations are made, and from quality scheme membership which gives free listing in the English Tourism Council's Where to Stay guide.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.2/3">The team is continuing with its programme of research and analysis. However the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly may have implications for the review's overall timetable. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has indicated that he will consult with the political parties early in the new year about the future of the review.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.5/1">MPs' pensions are paid out of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund (PCPF), which is a managed fund with income from investments and member contributions. The Exchequer makes the equivalent of an employer's contribution, which is set independently by the Government Actuary's Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/2">In cases of death in service, the pension payable to a legally married spouse is equal to the Member's salary for the first three months, and then at a rate of 5/8ths of the deceased Member's pension payable at age 65. The provisions are the same on death in retirement, but if the Member dies within five years of retirement, the spouse's pension is paid at the rate of the Member's pension for the remainder of those five years before reducing to 5/8ths. The regulations contain a provision to curtail the pension of a widow/widower of a deceased Member on remarriage or cohabitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/3">In July last year the House voted, among other things, to consider extending survivor pensions to unmarried adult dependants and continuing survivor pensions if a spouse remarries. However, these two measures were not covered by the statutory instrument introduced in July of this year on implementing the other decisions of the House on Members' pensions. It would require a further statutory instrument to give effect to these two provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/4">The Civil Service pension scheme traditionally provided pensions for surviving partners legally married to the scheme member at the time of the member's death. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-01">1 October 2002</phrase> a new Civil Service pension scheme was introduced, which, among other improvements, extended the arrangement to unmarried partners of either gender for life. The entire cost of this change is met by scheme members through higher contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.3/1">We have today received a letter from United States Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, requesting UK agreement to upgrade the early warning radar at RAF Fylingdales for missile defence purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/2">As set out in the discussion paper published on <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>, the Government believe that the developing ballistic missile threat is one that we must take very seriously. We assess that at present there is no immediate significant threat to the territory of the UK from ballistic missiles. However, intentions can change quickly, and the proliferation and development of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles are continuing. We could not wait until a specific threat became clear before determining how to defend against it.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/3">The US is looking to work closely with friends and allies in developing defences which enhance global security in the face of this potential threat. As well as improving US defence, an upgraded Fylingdales radar would be a key building block in the extension of missile defence to Europe should we and other European allies so desire. In this context, Mr Rumsfeld's letter contains the undertaking that, if Fylingdales were to be upgraded, and should we desire it, then the US would be prepared to extend missile defence coverage and make missile defence capabilities available to the UK as the evolution of the US system permits, subject to agreement on appropriate political and financial arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/4">RAF Fylingdales has operated since 1963 as one of several sites which provide early warning of ballistic missile launches against this country, Western Europe or the United States. The station is under UK operational command and the data it produces are shared between the UK and US military authorities. The upgrade requested would enable the system to track ballistic missiles more accurately so that they could be engaged by interceptors, in addition to the radar's existing role. We understand that a parallel request has been made to the Danish Government for upgrade of the radar at Thule, Greenland.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/5">The US propose no change to existing arrangements for data-sharing and operational command at Fylingdales, maintaining the long-established principle of joint decision-making relating to the use of US strategic assets based in the UK. It is expected that the work would involve installation of new computers and software and an additional communications link. No material environmental impact would be expected but this will need to be confirmed in further discussions with the US and local planning authorities. The US would hope to start work later next year and will accordingly make contingency provision in its defence budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/6">Mr Rumsfeld's letter also proposes the early conclusion of a new bilateral research, development, test and evaluation memorandum of understanding to ensure that the UK, both government and industry, has the fullest possible insight into, and opportunity for involvement in, the missile defence programme. We believe this represents an important industrial and technological opportunity for the UK regardless of our response to the US request.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/7">The decision on Fylingdales upgrade will be an important one, and the Government are keen for it to be informed by public and parliamentary discussion. We shall ensure that this House has appropriate opportunities to discuss the issues in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/8">The Government will now consider the US request very seriously, agreeing to it only if we are satisfied that it will ultimately enhance the security of the UK and the NATO alliance. We will make a further statement in due course.</p>
