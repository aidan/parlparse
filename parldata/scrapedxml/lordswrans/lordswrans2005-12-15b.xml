	<p pid="b.179.5/1">The &quot;light touch&quot; efficiency and effectiveness review of Food from Britain (FFB) launched in July 2003 concluded that FFB was respected for its knowledge of the food and drink sector and of overseas markets and for its skills and professionalism in mounting promotional activities and events. The review also highlighted a number of areas where FFB could make more progress and produce better value for money. The areas for improvement were: the development of new key targets, particularly in relation to new exporters; a review of the international network and FFB's fast track membership scheme; and consideration of more appropriate performance measures. These recommendations were accepted by FFB and were implemented through an action plan agreed between Defra and FFB. A copy of the action plan is available from the administration manager at Food From Britain, 4th Floor, Manning House, 22 Carlisle Place, London SW1P 1JA or from info@foodfrombritain.com.</p>

	<p pid="b.190.5/1">The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 states that it is an offence under Section 63 for the ombudsman or an officer of the ombudsman to disclose any information received in respect of the ombudsman's function of investigating complaints. Consequently, in regard to the specific case raised previously by the noble Lord, the ombudsman advises that it would be unlawful to disclose information into the public domain because it would directly or indirectly impact on the individuals involved in these matters. This would include the two police officers and others linked to the investigation, not least a member of staff of the ombudsman's office. Where such information appears in correspondence, Section 63 also applies. The ombudsman may provide a summary, which protects the identity of a person from whom the information was received and, where necessary, the identity of the persons to whom the information relates. I understand that the police ombudsman wrote to the noble Lord on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-18">18 April 2005</phrase> with a detailed explanation of the context and issues in relation to the matter as well as offering to meet with him to address any other concerns he may have.

	<p pid="b.194.5/1">Under the existing EU sugar regime, the growing of sugar beet is supported by a system of price guarantees passed on to the final consumer, without any direct production subsidies financed by the common agricultural policy budget. From July 2006, as agreed at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in November, growers will receive new decoupled direct CAP payments to compensate them for the cuts in guaranteed prices in the reformed regime. For a transitional period and in order to help the adjustment process the possibility exists in limited circumstances for an additional coupled aid to be paid to farmers who continue to grow sugar beet in member states where the overall reduction in sugar production is more than 50 per cent. This aid is open to all member states who meet the quota reduction thresholds, but is expected to be relevant only to countries with low sugar production efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="b.195.2/1">There is no timetable for ensuring that all timber procurement in government departments is (a) legal, and (b) sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.2/2">The Government's timber procurement policy has been operative since <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-28">28 July 2000</phrase> when the then Minister for the Environment, Michael Meacher, announced in a Parliamentary Answer to Colin Burgon MP that the then current voluntary guidance on environmental issues in timber procurement would become a binding commitment on all central government departments and agencies actively to seek to buy timber and timber products from sustainable and legal sources. In that Answer Mr Meacher also stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.195.2/3" class="indent">&quot;This programme does not involve banning the purchase of' timber or timber products which cannot be shown to be sustainably and legally produced. That would be both unfair and impractical. There is currently not enough timber that can be independently guaranteed to have come from sustainable and legal sources to meet all needs; albeit that different assurance schemes are growing quickly. We would also not want to penalise poorer countries and producers which have not been able to put in place such schemes. We will continue to work with such producers to ensure they have fair market-.access, and that any action is fully consistent with our international obligations. Our aim is to give confidence to those obeying their country's laws and managing their forests responsibly that they will find a welcome market in the UK, and will-not be undercut by unscrupulous and illegal competitors&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.2/4">The policy remains the same today and it is considered unrealistic to expect that one day all timber procured by government departments can be shown to be from legal and sustainable sources. Performance in attaining the policy objectives will vary from year to year depending on the nature of contracts awarded and the capacity of the market to meet demand. What is feasible though is to expect departments to invite all their suppliers to offer legal and sustainable timber and for the vast majority off timber supplied to meet those demands. The practical approach is to encourage the supply side of the market to increase capacity step by step. The Government have introduced a model contract condition requiring all suppliers to obtain timber from legal sources. Over time this should have the effect of significantly increasing the volume of legal timber supplied. Obtaining timber that can be independently verified as deriving from a sustainable source is more problematical. It is estimated that only 10 per cent. of the world's productive forests are certified and 90 per cent. of those are temperate and boreal forests. Consequently, certified timber from tropical regions is scarce and expensive. Available information indicates that the vast majority of timber imported into the UK is softwood from temperate and boreal forests and this would suggest that relatively little tropical timber is purchased by central government. The UK Government are currently unable to distinguish between the total volume of tropical timber purchased and timber purchased from other regions of the world but do reveal, in their annual sustainable development in government (SDIG) report, spend on certified timber and certified timber products.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.2/5">Currently the only target set by the Government for timber procurement is in the WSSD action plan. This target is: by November 2006, 50 per cent. of expenditure on timber by central government departments in England will be on products which can be independently verified as from sustainable and legal sources. The SDIG report suggests that this target may have been attained in the 2003-04 financial year. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will arrange for consultants to undertake a sample check of departments to indicate how accurate the SDIG reports are. When that check is complete the Government will consider whether it would be appropriate to set a new target or targets with a timetable for attainment.</p>
