	<p pid="a.237.2/1">We do not consider that. incentives are necessary to accelerate switchover at present. Almost 90 per cent of UK households' primary TV sets are already digital. The analogue switch-off programme is progressing according to a detailed engineering plan, the duration of which is determined by technical and engineering considerations. Additional multiplexes could be created as spectrum is released by digital switchover, but this would be a commercial matter for anyone wishing to operate multiplexes.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.5/2">It is disappointing that for the 14th year in succession the ECA was unable to give a positive opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions for the majority of EC Budget expenditure. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that the percentage of Budget expenditure that has been given a positive opinion has been increasing, currently 40 per cent, up from 35 per cent in 2005 and only 6 per cent in 2003.</p>
