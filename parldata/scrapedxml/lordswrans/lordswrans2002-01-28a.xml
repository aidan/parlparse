The whole purpose of speed limits, however, is to prevent injuries and deaths on our roads.

	<p pid="a.3.6/1">The Aggregates levy will be implemented in April 2002 on virgin aggregate. In Northern Ireland, as in the rest of the UK, it will encourage the use of recycled and alternative materials, reducing demand for quarrying. The levy will ensure that the environmental impacts of quarrying, such as damage to biodiversity, noise, dust, visual intrusion and loss of amenity, are fully reflected in prices, thus ensuring greater economic efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.6/2">The Government are minded to phase in the levy for aggregates used in processed products in Northern Ireland, subject to EU state aids approval.

	<p pid="a.6.3/1">The rules that apply to the removal from public highways of burned out and abandoned vehicles are set out in the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978, the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles Regulations 1986.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/2">Responsibility for removing abandoned vehicles rests primarily with the local authorities which may, under existing legislation, claim their costs of removal, storage and disposal back from the person abandoning the vehicle. In many cases local authorities are unable to trace the offender and their costs will then have to be met from the local authority's budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/3">Under the 1986 regulations, the police have powers to remove an abandoned vehicle where it is dangerous or a hazard to traffic. Such vehicles will be removed by contractors acting for the police as quickly as possible. Such vehicles are normally removed to a pound or to a location where they no longer pose a hazard. The vehicle's insurers pay the contractors the statutory removal charge of &pound;105 for insured burnouts. The contract with the contractors specifies that they should bear the cost of removing non-insured burnouts.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/4">We do not monitor local authorities' performance on the length of time taken to remove these vehicles. Individual local authorities may keep their own records. No monitoring is carried out by the police on contractors' performance because the vehicles have to be removed as a matter of urgency.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.0/2">Current plans for the last element of the rolling programme to replace part of the C130K fleet with C130Js are for two of the C130K aircraft to be retired by <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-30">30 April 2002</phrase> and one aircraft to be retired towards the end of 2002. There are currently no detailed plans for the decommissioning of the remaining 26 C130Ks which is predicted to occur by around the end of this decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">The current cost of maintaining the C130K fleet is some &pound;31 million per annum and it is reasonable to assume that the cost of supporting individual aircraft would increase as the fleet ages. Any decision to extend its operational life would therefore take into account the costs of maintaining the aircraft to meet operational demands.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.6/1">It is the responsibility of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to consider each application for a research licence to extract stem cells from fertilised embryos on its individual merits. The policy of the HFEA has always been to require informed consent. Potential donors should receive written details of the research project that highlight any possible consequences of the work prior to making any donation. So individuals who donated embryos before January 2001 would have given consent for how those embryos were to be used. Researchers would not be able to use them for a different purpose without breaching their research licence.</p>
