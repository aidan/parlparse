	<p pid="a.245.2/1">The UK has been briefed on difficulties discovered during development test associated with the F-35B structure and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) propulsion systems and also on the design changes which have been processed to fix these issues during the development phase. The UK remains confident in the US programme leadership and the prime contractor in its ability to deliver these whilst maintaining capability and affordability. As our contribution to the JSF development programme is fixed under the 2001 memorandum of understanding there will be no direct development cost implications from these changes to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.2/2">While we will continue to swatch closely the development of F-35B short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant and will seek to ensure that we gain the benefits of our early investment in F-35B STOVL aircraft for test and evaluation, our decision announced in the strategic defence and security review to change variant to the more capable F35C carrier variant (CV) for operational use has not been influenced by these development issues. Both the F35C CV and F35A conventional take-off and landing variants are performing as expected during test and have not experienced the same technical issues as the F35B STOVL. We have held no discussions with the US on the possibility of the entire programme being cancelled.</p>

While we are committed to procuring three F-35B aircraft, at a total of $632 million, to conduct joint test and evaluation with the US Armed Forces, we will gain substantial benefit from operating these aircraft as a part of the F-35C programme. In particular, the mission systems are common between all three JSF variants and our continued participation in joint test and evaluation is vital for the delivery of essential legal, safety and operational sovereignty requirements. The three F-35B aircraft are early phase aircraft. The final unit cost of our F-35C operational aircraft will be substantially lower.</p>

Indeed, Ministers believe unitary restructuring to be an expensive and unnecessary distraction. Stopping the unitary restructuring in Devon and Norfolk has saved taxpayers &#163;40 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.1/1" qnum="HL6189">To ask Her Majesty's Government, further to the Written Answer by Baroness Neville-Jones on 17 January (<I>WA 115-6</I>), why the number of grants of extension of leave to remain in the United Kingdom for students increased from 104,500 from Q3 2008 to Q2 2009 to 112,750 from Q3 2009 to Q2 2010; what are the main reasons for non-European Economic Area students applying for extensions of leave to remain; and for how long and how often such leave can be extended.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.2/1">The rising numbers of grants of extensions of leave to remain are due to the fact that more applicants applied who met the provisions of tier 4 of the points-based system. The main reason for non-European Economic Area students applying for extensions of leave to remain is to undertake a further course of study; other reasons include changes of sponsor or extensions for re-sitting exams.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/2">At present, a student can spend a maximum of three years studying courses below degree level under tier 4, but there is currently no limit on the amount of time a student can spend studying courses at or above degree level. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-07">7 December</phrase> the Government launched a public consultation on reform of the student immigration system; copies are available in the House Library.</p>
