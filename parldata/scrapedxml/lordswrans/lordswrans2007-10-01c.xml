	<p pid="c.127.2/1">The needs of bereaved people are at the forefront of the Government's plans to reform the coroners' system, and part of that is the need to respect the wishes and traditions of minority groups. It is intended to issue statutory national guidance, in the form of a charter, to set out the standards of service that bereaved people will be entitled to in a reformed system.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.2/2">A draft charter was published alongside the draft Coroners Bill in June 2006, and it includes a requirement that coroners should, where possible, comply with the wishes, feelings and expectations of the individual, family and community, including preferences, traditions and religious requirements relating to mourning and funerals. The draft Bill will provide bereaved people with a clear legal standing in the investigation, which will allow those who may have particular wishes based on religion to have a better understanding of how the system may affect them, to make their wishes known and, if they choose, to appeal against specified decisions made by coroners.</p>

	<p pid="c.127.5/1">Like several coroners throughout the country, the Coventry coroner has particular local arrangements in place to address the needs of religious groups wherever possible. Coroners are keen to accommodate the needs of bereaved people of any faith wherever their statutory duties to investigate violent or unnatural deaths allow. The draft Charter for Bereaved People, which will be implemented with the Coroners Bill, sets out the national standards of service which the bereaved should expect from a reformed coroners system, and includes the need to take account of a family's religious sensitivities following the death of a loved one. Compliance with the charter will be monitored by the new Chief Coroner, also enabled by the Coroners Bill.</p>

The Government do not provide incentives for householders to manage their own energy needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/2">The requirements of Part L of the building regulations, which sets requirements for energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions, apply to all homes regardless of whether they are connected to mains energy supplies. Nevertheless, developers are reasonably free to determine how to meet the requirements of Part L.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/3">The Code for Sustainable Homes and the draft planning policy statement on climate change are designed to cut carbon emissions from new homes and promote low- and zero-carbon homes in the period up until 2016, when the Government have proposed that all new homes will be zero-carbon.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/4">It is estimated that there are around 50,000 private water supplies serving about 0.6 per cent of the population in England and Wales. No estimate has been made about the water efficiency of these dwellings, and they are not subject to the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/5">The Government do not provide incentives to manage the use of non-mains-supplied water. They encourage all households to value water resources and to be aware of the need for water conservation. Where non-mains water supplies are used within households, it is vital that only wholesome drinking water is used for domestic purposes, in order to protect public health.</p>

	<p pid="c.141.0/1">The department accepts the National Audit Office's observations on what we might have done differently before and during the start-up of the schemes. However, the level of administration costs reflects the size and scale of the schemes. The department has developed processes to help reduce both administrative costs and the timescale for claims, such as the fast-track option for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which the department developed from its experiences administering the scheme. The department secured a reduction in the solicitors' tariffs for fast-track claims, reducing the overall bill by &pound;100 million, and is currently negotiating the tariff to be paid for vibration white finger services claims.</p>

	<p pid="c.143.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that actions should be legal or illegal according to their merits, rather than the medium used. As such, all legislation criminalises offences regardless of the means used to commit the offence. Where there is a need to revise legislation to take account of new criminal techniques we seek to do so. We liaise regularly with the prosecution and law enforcement authorities to ensure the criminal law remains fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.2/2">Although the law relating to e-crime is generally fit for purpose, we have recently legislated, in the Police and Justice Act 2006, to reform the criminal law to ensure that the Computer Misuse Act 1990 is strengthened. In addition, the Fraud Act 2006 has created a general offence of fraud that will deal with such crimes in a technology-neutral way. It will also ensure that the offence continues to be relevant as methods and technologies deployed by fraudsters change and develop. The Act also created other new offences including a new offence of possessing articles for use in fraud, and a new offence of making or supplying articles for use in fraud. These offences will also assist in tackling online fraudsters.</p>

The study is looking in some detail at the issues arising on tidal power and will provide a strategic, independent and evidence-based consideration of all the environmental, social and economic aspects of options for tidal power in the Severn estuary from a sustainable development perspective. The final report is expected to be published in September and further details of the study can be seen at <a href="http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/pages/tidal.html">www.sd-commission.org.uk/pages/tidal.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.8/3">The Severn barrage is a complex scheme and any assessment of its viability would not rest solely on its economics. Whether or not the position has altered since my noble friend made his comments is something that the SDC's report should help us better understand.</p>

	<p pid="c.146.0/1">The one proven side effect of water fluoridation is dental fluorosis and, while the risk is less at the 1 part per million concentration used here, we accept that some children in fluoridated areas will be affected. It appears that people with the flecking of the teeth characteristic of mild fluorosis are seldom concerned about the appearance of their teeth, but in order to test this assumption we have funded a research project involving the use of intra-oral cameras and automated software in order to obtain consistent readings in surveys of levels of dental fluorosis. If the project is successful, we intend that the photographs are used in a further study to assess the aesthetic impact of fluorosis. Unlike the United States, levels of fluoride concentration of 3 to 4 ppm are not found in drinking water in the United Kingdom so comparison with the National Research Council report is inappropriate.</p>

The documents released with the review included the report of an internal audit conducted in 2000 into the destruction of papers from the Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood covering May 1989 to February 1992. I very much regret the loss of these documents, but I am satisfied that the loss has been properly investigated and the results now published.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/2">Departmental officials have met with the inquiry team and offered to help by answering any questions they may have, where this is possible. However, I do not believe that more can be learned at this stage about the loss of documents that has not already been set out in the review and audit that have now been published.</p>

	<p pid="c.161.3/2">The most recent data (for 2005) show that 9 per cent of dwellings built were built in flood-risk areas. There were around 177,000 permanent dwellings started in 2005, which suggests that an estimated 16,000 dwellings were started on flood plains in 2005. It is worth noting that not all dwellings started end up as completed dwellings.</p>
	<p pid="c.161.3/3">Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development. Flood-risk areas account for about 12 per cent of land in England, including parts of major cities, and around 10 per cent of the population already live in flood-risk areas. The Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk. The Government published planning policy statement 25 (PPS25) in December 2006 to strengthen and clarify earlier policy on this issue. PPS25 directs development away from high-risk areas through a sequential, risk-based approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.161.3/4">Flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher-flood-risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable. In particular, more vulnerable development, such as housing, should not be permitted in high-risk areas unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the development will be safe, without increasing flood risk elsewhere, and provides wider sustainability benefits that outweigh the flood risk. Where new development is necessary in higher-risk areas because no viable alternative is available, steps must be taken at site level to make it safe if it is to be permitted.</p>

	<p pid="c.161.6/2">The Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk.

	<p pid="c.162.5/1">Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation, provides regular feedback to the Government on the use of the powers given under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000. In paragraph 141 of his most recent publication, the report on the operation in 2006 of the Terrorism Act 2000, Lord Carlile states: &quot;I am satisfied that in 2006 the port powers and the checks and balances on those powers worked well and remained necessary. Recording systems are sound and accountable. Each port examination (as opposed to short stop) is recorded in written form and superior officers examine written records routinely. Special Branch officers generally function to a very high professional standard ... Given that there are so many ports and so extensive a coastline, the effort against terrorism via freight and small vessels is remarkably proficient&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.5/2">In paragraph 129, Lord Carlile states that he has personally &quot;received no complaints about treatment of members of the public at ports in 2006&quot;. Complaints have been made to the police and the Home Office, generally relating to being stopped at all. In the Government's response to Lord Carlile's comments, we agreed that there is a need for more intelligence-led examinations at ports. It is likely that, with better selection processes in place, the number of stops at ports will decrease but the quality of intelligence retrieved from this smaller number of persons of interest will improve. We believe that it is still important that travellers expect to be stopped and challenged because, as Lord Carlile states in paragraph 126 of his report, it provides a &quot;significant inhibition&quot; and &quot;deterrent to terrorists&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.5/3">The single border force will deliver a unified, uniformed, visible border force with greater powers providing a single primary line for both passport control and customs. Coming in, the travelling public will see a highly visible and uniformed border where &quot;control&quot; functions on people are clearly exercised, the strong sense of a single HMG presence and all passports and individuals checked.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.5/4">The public will be presented with a unified border control. This will be achieved through customs officers working together with immigration officers with the ability to detain individuals for immigration and customs offences.</p>

	<p pid="c.170.5/1">The Dublin regulation establishes the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for considering an asylum claim. The central theme of the regulation is that one state only should be responsible for deciding an asylum claim so as to prevent secondary movements and asylum shopping. The regulation does, however, contain a sovereignty clause enabling the UK (or the member state concerned) to take responsibility for a case even when it is not the member state properly responsible. We might decide to do this, for example, where the removal of the claimant would breach his or her rights under the ECHR.</p>

The DOI does not concern the operation of the system provided by the Dublin regulation itself.

As a recommendation to governments of member states, there is no procedure for it to be signed by those member states. Because the Government were in the process of revising important aspects of legislation in England and Wales on mental health and mental capacity, it was at the time not in a position to identify definitively whether there were specific points in the recommendation on which it might wish to reserve its right not to comply. Accordingly, when adopting the recommendation, the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom indicated that, in accordance with Article 10.2c of the Rules of Procedure for the meetings of the Ministers' Deputies, he reserved the right of his Government to comply or not with the recommendation as a whole. Now that the Mental Health Act 2007 has received Royal Assent, there is an opportunity to review that reservation.</p>

	<p pid="c.178.2/1">The Government believe that targeting former miners and their families directly will be the most effective way to encourage affected claimants to seek redress, and where appropriate, reimbursement.

	<p pid="c.179.2/2">In recognition of the difficulties faced by miners and their families, the Law Society has recently announced that it will make ex gratia advances on awards that have been made in the complainants' favour in miners' compensation cases in order to relieve these vulnerable claimants of the burden of seeking enforcement of the awards through the courts.</p>

Of these, the latest figures show that 1,715 cases have been closed and in excess of &pound;600,000 has been recovered for former miners or their relatives. In addition, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) has authorised investigations into 60 firms of solicitors, which have, to date, resulted in 17 firms being referred to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. The SRA has won the first three cases to be heard by the tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.5/2">The combined efforts of the LCS and SRA have led to well over &pound;3 million being repaid to miners. This figure is expected to rise as investigations continue.</p>

	<p pid="c.184.5/1">DfID promotes social inclusion as a core objective in all our main programmes rather than funding free-standing projects. Estimates of the financial resources directed at social exclusion and at Dalits are therefore very difficult to disaggregate.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.5/2">In our &pound;210 million (2003-07) support for India's national elementary education programme, one of the main aims has been to reduce social group disparities in education outcomes. Recent data show that Dalit children now make up 21 per cent of enrolments of primary school children, compared with 19 per cent three years previously.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.5/3">DfID's &pound;252 million commitment (2006-11) to the second phase of the national reproductive and child health programme also aims to target the socially excluded. Strategies include intensive efforts to reach more remote tribal groups and a performance bonus for states that make the most progress in expanding services among socially excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.5/4">DfID has also committed &pound;75 million to UNICEF (2006-11) in India to reduce child mortality and tackle social exclusion in health and education services.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.2/2">In January, the UNHCR launched a $60 million appeal to address the influx of refugees into Iraq's neighbouring countries and the plight of displaced people inside Iraq. To date, we have contributed &pound;1.5 million to the UN High Commission for Refugees' (UNHCR) appeal to help refugees in neighbouring countries. This was part of a &pound;10 million package that we have provided so far this year to help vulnerable people inside Iraq and those displaced to other countries in the region. This contribution will help facilitate the registration of externally displaced Iraqis and provision of emergency assistance across the region. The appeal has now been doubled ($123 million) in view of continual needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.211.3/2">Paragraph five of the record states: &quot;5. (Official) asked the Nepalese Side for its understanding of the meaning of 'own free will' as set out in section 9(1). For instance, he questioned, was it possible for a young child to acquire another citizenship of his own will. The Nepalese Side said the most important thing to remember was that Nepalese citizenship law does not allow for dual nationality in any circumstances. In this context, the Nepalese Side cited the sections 6(1)(c), 6(3)(b) and 6B(1) of the Act which require the relinquishing of other nationalities by those becoming Nepalese. Whilst the Nepalese Side agreed that a young child is not generally considered exercising his 'own free will' in such matters, the reality was that age had no bearing on whether a person would remain a Nepalese citizen if he acquired another citizenship&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.211.3/3">In practice many individuals who, on the basis of the information provided at the meeting in November 2006, we would not expect to be Nepalese have been found to hold certificates of Nepalese citizenship. In these cases it is appropriate to ask the holder to provide confirmation from the issuing authority of the circumstances in which the certificate came to be issued and the effect, if any, that it is considered to have as a matter of Nepalese law.</p>

	<p pid="c.222.2/1">Information on the prevalence of motor neurone disease (MND) among Gulf veterans is not available as we do not have access to the medical records of those who have left the Armed Forces. We are also not aware of any national database that registers the prevalence of MND in the general UK population. The Ministry of Defence actively monitors deaths and their causes among all Gulf veterans, both serving personnel and those discharged from the services. We report the findings regularly to Parliament and place them in the public domain. Our records show there have been four deaths among Gulf veterans due to MND, compared with an estimated five in the age-adjusted comparison group (<I>Official Report</I>, 16/7/07, col. <I>WS</I><I></I><I>4</I>). The difference between these two figures is not statistically significant. By using the official mortality data for the general UK population, we estimate that there would have been four deaths in the UK population due to MND among a similar sized group to the number of Gulf veterans (53,462), with the same age and gender profile. On the basis of the mortality data that is available to us, we have no plans to carry out any further investigations ourselves into MND among Gulf veterans.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.2/2">We are aware of the US Institute of Medicine's review of the research literature on MND among US military personnel which concluded that there is only &quot;limited and suggestive evidence of an association&quot; between military service and later development of MND. We will monitor closely any further work carried out in the US but we have no current plans to treat MND as a Gulf-related service condition.</p>

	<p pid="c.224.0/1">The independent review of children's palliative care services conducted by Professor Sir Alan Craft and Sue Killen was set up in June 2006 after the Government announced an additional &pound;27 million of support for children's hospices over three years. The review report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-17">17 May</phrase> this year and included a number of recommendations aimed at strengthening services, as well as the systems in which they operate.</p>

	<p pid="c.224.0/4">There is no requirement that primary care trusts should ensure adult or children's hospices receive a fixed proportion of their income from public spending. We have no plans to introduce such a requirement. Similarly, we are not able, at present, to confirm what will happen when the &pound;27 million of hospice/hospice at home funding ends. It is right that the development of the national strategy considers this issue as we look at how best to deliver the conclusions from the independent review and the parallel work set out in Aiming High for Disabled Children. Some of this is about spending the current funding better, making sure we have the right services in place and involving children and parents in decisions.</p>

	<p pid="c.225.2/1">A natural consequence of devolution has been growing differences between the provision of health services in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The responsibilities of National Health Service organisations in each country are defined by statute and protocols are in place to clarify certain operational responsibilities between bodies across boundaries, particularly those along the border between England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.2/2">Certain aspects of health services are co-ordinated at a United Kingdom level. The General Medical Services contract is a UK-wide contract for services, agreed between NHS employers, on behalf of the department, and the British Medical Association's General Practitioners' Committee. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all party to discussions on any changes to this contract. The department's officials have regular meetings with colleagues in the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Administrations to ensure, as far as possible, consistency of approach in the delivery of primary medical care in the four countries. There will always be some differences to reflect the different circumstances in each country but these tend to be on the margins of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.2/3">For certain highly specialised services which are planned and paid for on a national basis, patients from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are treated in England, with the costs being met by the relevant devolved Administration.

Officials of the devolved Administrations are routinely invited to join English colleagues in various groups in which services which have cross-border implications are discussed and planned.</p>

	<p pid="c.226.3/1">The Government support the continued dialogue between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas, which we hope will include meaningful discussions on permanent status issues. Israel has committed to a number of confidence-building measures to the Palestinian Authority. In particular, we welcome the transfer of approximately US$278 million of Palestinian clearance revenues by Israel since July. We continue to call on Israel to release the full amount of arrears. We also welcome Israel's decision to release 255 Palestinian prisoners and their agreement to grant amnesties to 178 Palestinians, mainly from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. Continued dialogue between the parties is the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.3/2">The Government also support the League of Arab States' Arab peace initiative. We welcome all efforts towards the normalisation of relations between Israel and the Arab world. In particular, we welcome both the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-04">4 May</phrase> between the Quartet and members of the Arab League follow-up committee and the meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, Egyptian Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdelelah Al-Khatib in Sharm el-Sheikh on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May</phrase>. We also welcome the significant follow-up visit to Israel by the Egyptian and Jordanian Foreign Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July</phrase>. We continue, to encourage further progress on the Arab peace initiative between the Arab states and Israel. We value the work of the Arab League in promoting a negotiated two-state solution. The international community has a key role to play in moving forward the peace process.</p>

	<p pid="c.227.5/1">We have worked intensively at the UN, with our partners, to achieve a resolution that would allow for the Ahtisaari proposals to be taken forward. The co-sponsors circulated several drafts and spared no effort to accommodate the concerns and incorporate the proposals of other Security Council members. We regret, however, that, because of the repeated objections of Russia, it has been impossible so far to secure such a resolution in the council. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July</phrase>, the co-sponsors announced that negotiations in the Security Council would be put on hold and that time-limited discussions would be renewed with the parties under contact group auspices.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.5/2">The United Kingdom fully supports the Ahtisaari proposals and believes they should be the base for any further discussions. We hope that these talks will lead to agreement between the parties. If not, we continue to believe that the Ahtisaari plan is the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.5/3">The Ahtisaari plan will be challenging to implement. I warmly welcome the Kosovo Assembly's commitment to implement the plan in its entirety. It will require real commitment from Kosovo's leadership and support from the wider public to build a new Kosovo along the lines UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari envisages, and so to create a prosperous society in which all communities can live together in peace and security. It will require the Kosovo Serb leadership to recognise the opportunities the settlement presents for their communities and to begin to engage in Kosovo's political life. And it will require a sustained commitment from the international community.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.5/4">Planning for that sustained commitment is well advanced. The Ahtisaari settlement provides for a new international civilian and military presence in Kosovo. These will comprise: an international civilian office, responsible for ensuring settlement implementation and headed up by an international civilian representative, double-hatted as the EU special representative; a European Security and Defence Policy mission responsible for policing and rule of law; and an international military presence provided by NATO.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.5/5">Two planning teams are currently in Kosovo carrying out the necessary planning and preparation for the deployment of these presences.</p>

	<p pid="c.229.2/1">The ECPAT report is a significant study into the scope of the issue of child trafficking in the UK. The Government believe that it is important that local authorities, the police, and other agencies responsible for safeguarding children are alert to the issue of child trafficking and able to identify and help children in this situation, and to take action against traffickers. The Government plan to publish good practice guidance on safeguarding children who may have been trafficked. This guidance will help practitioners apply the statutory guidance <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I> (HMG 2006) to the particular needs of children abused in this way. We consulted on a draft of this guidance over the summer and plan to publish the final version later this year. Some child victims of trafficking may need to be looked after by local authorities as part of work to safeguard them and promote their welfare. Local authorities and their partners will consider the needs of any child victims of trafficking discovered in the course of Operation Pentameter.</p>

	<p pid="c.231.3/1">Atkins has not yet undertaken any in-depth consultations with environmental stakeholders about a trial site for dyke relocation. However, as part of their dyke relocation feasibility study, Atkins met the key environmental stakeholders earlier this year to present and discuss findings of a literature review and discuss local constraints. The Highways Agency is currently considering whether a trial would be practical. In-depth consultations would be carried out with all environmental stakeholders before any decision was made to proceed with a trial.</p>

	<p pid="c.237.0/1">The Government evaluated the Moorsbus Network as part of a study examining best practice in the development of integrated transport in the National Parks of England and Wales. This led to a detailed good practice guide. Annual surveys of passengers have shown that in 2003 those who had access to a car but chose to use Moorsbus have saved the environment over 1 million miles of car journeys to and from the national park. There are no known studies on the savings made in carbon dioxide emissions specific to the Moorsbus service.</p>
	<p pid="c.237.0/2">Financial support for transport access to national parks comes largely from the relevant local transport authorities who in most cases receive some support from the department such as the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG).</p>

In 2005-06, there were 600,000 fewer children in relative poverty than in 1997-98.

	<p pid="c.243.2/1">Peat bogs are a significant store of carbon which needs to be protected. We are looking at rehabilitating peat bogs as one possible way of protecting existing carbon stores and biodiversity. However, this is technically challenging due to the presence of naturally occurring underground water channels which develop in response to artificial drainage. These would continue to have a drying effect, even if surface drains were blocked to rehabilitate bogs.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.2/2">In terms of offsetting carbon emissions through increasing this store, the potential is somewhat limited due to the slow accumulation rates of active bogs. In addition, some healthy peat bogs can be a significant source of methane. It is important to see the potential contribution of peat bog restoration in proportion to many other ways we are seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
	<p pid="c.243.2/3">We are now developing a programme of work to co-ordinate peat protection activities across government. We are also undertaking research to improve our understanding of the main mechanisms by which carbon is lost from peats; the impacts of land use and land management; and to develop practical methods for mitigating losses. This will form a key part of the forthcoming soil strategy for England. In addition, the current review of environmental stewardship will examine how the scheme can further help to address climate change, including halting the decline of upland carbon stores.</p>

	<p pid="c.248.3/1">The Government welcome the Commission's proposals to reform the EU wine regime, which include a number of measures aimed at reducing the gap between supply and consumption in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector. The proposed grubbing-up scheme will provide for up to 200,000 hectares of vines to be grubbed-up, thereby reducing EU wine production by around 7.5 million hl over five years. The purpose of the scheme is to ease the transition to a more market-oriented sector by allowing producers to leave the industry following the immediate removal of market intervention measures, such as distillation, that are currently supporting uncompetitive production.</p>
