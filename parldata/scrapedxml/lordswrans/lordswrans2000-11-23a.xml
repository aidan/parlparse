	<p pid="a.85.2/1">I believe that not only this House, but also the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, will join me in looking forward to Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee as a joyous occasion and a very special milestone. It will be a time both for looking back at the central part which the Queen has played in the affairs of this country and the Commonwealth over the preceding 50 years; and for looking forward to the continuation of Her Majesty's unique contribution for many years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">Her Majesty the Queen has approved my recommendation that the fiftieth anniversary of Her Accession to the Throne should be celebrated during the summer of 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">A Ministerial Committee, under the chairmanship of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, was set up last year to help to co-ordinate arrangements with Buckingham Palace. I have made the following recommendations which Her Majesty has approved and which have the support of the Leaders of the Devolved Administrations and of Opposition Parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">The Queen will attend a National Service of Thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-04">Tuesday 4 June 2002</phrase>. That day will be a Bank Holiday in place of the Spring Bank Holiday, which would otherwise fall on <phrase class="date" code="">27 May</phrase> in 2002. The day before, <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 3 June</phrase>, will be an additional Bank Holiday for the Golden Jubilee.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5">The Queen hopes to travel within the United Kingdom as widely as possible during the summer months of May to July, and especially the weeks running up to and following the Bank Holiday weekend. She has agreed to visit the Armed Forces on <phrase class="date" code="">27 June</phrase> and to open the Commonwealth Games in Manchester on <phrase class="date" code="">25 July</phrase> and close them on <phrase class="date" code="">4 August</phrase>. She will undertake a Commonwealth visit in the autumn. The Queen has also agreed to a grant of certain civic honours--city status and Lord Mayoralty--to mark Her Jubilee. Other elements of the programme will be announced in due course. It is Her Majesty's express wish that there should be no undue expenditure from public funds on the programme of celebrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/6">The Queen has said that She sees Her Golden Jubilee as an opportunity to express Her thanks for the support and loyalty She has enjoyed during Her reign. She hopes that events surrounding the Jubilee will create numerous opportunities for voluntary and community service and that as many people as possible will have the opportunity to enjoy the celebrations to mark this happy occasion.</p>

In the case of the conjoined twins known as &quot;Jodie&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot;, decided on appeal in the Court of Appeal, the parents were given permission for a further appeal to the House of Lords but chose not to exercise it. The Official Solicitor representing Mary was also given permission to appeal. All the arguments on behalf of Mary were advanced in the Court of Appeal, including the moral, ethical and legal arguments submitted by the Archbishop of Westminster and the Pro-Life Group. In deciding not to appeal to the House of Lords, the Official Solicitor took into account the prospects of success, the uniqueness of the case, and the parents' decision.</p>

The package includes a proposal to increase the earnings limit for Invalid Care Allowance from its present level of &pound;50 per week, after allowable expenses, to a figure equal to the Lower Earnings Limit, which is currently &pound;67.

	<p pid="a.88.6/1">The main achievement was the adoption by the Council and the Commission of a Declaration on the European Community's Development Policy. This was a milestone for the EC. The Declaration provides the EC, for the first time, with a clear operational framework for all EC development assistance, with poverty reduction as the principal objective. This was an important UK objective in our published strategy for working with the EC. The Development Commissioner, Poul Nielson, also presented a comprehensive Action Programme for implementing the Declaration. He emphasised the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the need to work within countries' own poverty reduction strategies, the importance of focusing EC development assistance on fewer areas and the need for further progress in ensuring that other EC policies such as fisheries, trade and agriculture, do not undermine our development efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/2">We strongly welcomed the Declaration and the Commission's plans for implementing the new policy. It remains essential to turn the operational framework into reality on the ground. We will be reviewing how we can help to ensure that this is achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/3">The Council also adopted an important new framework for preparation of EC Country Strategy Papers. This clarifies the need to collaborate closely with other donors and to focus on poverty reduction strategies developed by the partner country.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/4">The Council briefly reviewed the actions that have been taken to follow up the overall evaluation of EC programmes which had been discussed in May 1999. These included the adoption of an overall statement of EC development policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/5">The Council adopted a Resolution on Communicable Diseases which welcomed a recent Commission Communication and called for an Action Programme to implement it. The Council agreed on the need for a coherent approach to tackling these diseases which threaten poor people and hinder efforts to reduce poverty. Conclusions on the 6th Conference of the Parties on Climate Change were also adopted.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.5/1">The Policy Action Team 9 (PAT9) report on community self-help was one of 18 reports commissioned by the Social Exclusion Unit to come up with recommendations to tackle the unacceptable problems in England's poorest neighbourhoods. Since the publication of the PAT9 Report in September 1999, we have made good progress in implementing many of the recommendations, some of which have been included as key ideas of the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal. We have set out the key achievements in an annual report which also includes a look forward to the main action points for future work. A copy of the annual report will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">The Government have consistently taken the view that equipment used in the manufacture of prohibited handguns does not fall within the scope of the compensation scheme made under Sections 16 and 17 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997; nor could it do so, given the terms of Section 17 of the Act, which relates to ancillary equipment. Indeed, the noble Baroness explicitly referred to this exclusion in a later part of the speech she has quoted (Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="1997-02-04">4 February 1997</phrase>, cols. 1593-94). There she said, &quot;In the case of a manufacturer of handguns . . . the terms of the compensation scheme will not cover equipment in the area of the manufacturing of firearms&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2">In administering the Firearms Compensation Scheme, the Home Office has conformed with the terms of the Firearms (Amendment) Act and any relevant case law. The words quoted by the noble Baroness at the end of her Question are taken from a letter from one of my officials to a claimant which sought to paraphrase the relevant legislation in the interests of brevity: as has been explained to the claimant in question, they were not and could not have been intended to alter the effect of the legislation itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/3">It is open to firearms compensation claimants to request the return from the police of those items which have been rejected from their claim as being ineligible to receive payment. (The police will comply with such requests unless they consider they are legally disbarred from doing so: the decision is for Chief Officers to make in the light of each individual case).</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/4">Controlled component parts of prohibited handguns are covered by the compensation scheme and, provided the general requirements of the scheme are met, payment may be made for such items. The same position applies to functioning prototypes of prohibited handguns, since such items would, in effect, be prohibited handguns themselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.5/1">I am unfortunately unable to give the guarantee sought by the noble Lord. The Immigration Service port or office dealing with the detainee often receives very little notice of a bail hearing, and summaries are frequently written a very short period of time before the hearing. It is therefore common practice for the Home Office presenting officer to give the detainee's representative copies of the summary at or shortly before the hearing.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/2">Usually within 24 hours of arrival in the centre or prison, detainees are offered a full medical screening. Where issues relating to mental health are explored as part of that initial assessment, any concerns about the mental well-being of a detainee are dealt with by the doctor, who will, if necessary, arrange a full psychiatric examination by a qualified psychiatrist. Detainees can also be referred for specialist treatment, including psychological counselling, in the same way as any other National Health Service patient.

	<p pid="a.95.5/1">The Government have today published a consultation paper setting out our proposals for statutory guidance to the Environment Agency. It brings together and publicises, for the first time, the factors that we require the Environment Agency to consider when setting discharge levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/2">The draft guidance reinforces the Government's commitment progressively to cut discharges and discharge limits. It will help to deliver the commitment the UK has given to its OSPAR partners to ensure that by 2020, discharges are reduced to levels where the additional concentrations in the marine environment above historic levels resulting from such discharges are close to zero.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/3">The guidance will help to ensure that discharge authorisations are consistent with the UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001-2020, which is now being finalised following public consultation earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/4">Central to the guidance is the need to ensure the protection of the public, not only within the UK but beyond our borders. For example, the guidance proposes that, in general, discharge levels are set so that Community Food Intervention Levels are not exceeded, even though there is no requirement to do so under law.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/5">Equally, none of the measures taken to protect the environment should compromise the safety of workers and this is also covered in the guidance, in terms both of routine exposures and risks of accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/6">Keeping radioactive waste to a minimum must be the key to reducing discharges. While the industry works to achieve this, we are asking the agency to evaluate alternative ways of making allowable discharges so that the Best Practicable Environmental Option can be chosen.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/7">Each case will be considered on its merits but the presumption now will be that discharges should be minimised by requiring radioactivity to be trapped and immobilised for subsequent storage or treatment, rather than discharged into the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/8">The guidance will encourage operators to keep their discharges to a minimum by setting strict limits on how much they can discharge. These limits will be subject to regular review. We also propose that there should be a &quot;cap&quot; on discharges from new plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/9">The guidance recognises that it is not necessary to apply a specific limit to every radionuclide which is discharged, but effective control over all discharges is essential. The agency is therefore given guidance on which radionuclides, as a minimum, they should control.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/10">New technology will play a vital role in reducing discharges. With this in mind, the draft guidance requires the agency to set timescales for research and development to be carried out into new technological developments.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">Under the Montreal Protocol, developed countries are required to phase out the production of CFCs by the end of 1995. The UK, in line with other European countries, phased out production by the end of 1994, one year ahead of the Protocol. We have recently agreed EC Regulation 2037/2000, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-01">1 October 2000</phrase>, under which it is prohibited to supply CFCs. From <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase> there will also be a ban on the use of CFCs in the maintenance of existing equipment. Other measures in the regulation to phase out ozone depleting substances such as HCFCs by 2010 go beyond the Montreal Protocol.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-11-23a.97.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="97"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001123/text/01123w03.htm#01123w03_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.97.0/1">The Government fully recognise the importance of informing people about climate change, what its causes and its effects could be, and the action they could take to help reduce emissions. We are working in partnership with a wide range of organisations on a number of different initiatives that are targeted at householders, the travelling public, businesses, local government and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">We believe that action by individuals is particularly important. We are therefore funding a major publicity campaign called &quot;Are you doing your bit?&quot; which informs people about the impact of their individual and collective actions. This &pound;25 million, multi-media campaign focuses on how small changes in people's everyday actions can have financial and environmental benefits, and can make a difference. Public reaction to the campaign has been very positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">The Energy Saving Trust's &quot;energy efficiency&quot; campaign, funded by the Government, aims to increase the take-up of energy efficient products and services by raising awareness of the financial benefits of being energy efficient, and by ensuring that products and services are of a high quality and are easily identifiable as being energy efficient. EU Energy Labels on a growing number of everyday appliances and lightbulbs, and shortly on cars, provide a constant reminder to consumers of the importance of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/4">We are improving awareness of the benefits of taking action among businesses and local government through policies such as promoting environmental reporting; the Making a Corporate Commitment scheme; disseminating independent authoritative information and advice on energy efficiency best practice; travel plans and greening company car fleets; and working with local government associations on a number of initiatives that should raise awareness at the highest levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/5">We are addressing the need to educate and inform children and young people about climate change, how it is caused, what its effects might be, and what they can do to help. We have a website aimed at children and young people under 16, and we have recently published an information and activity pack for children between 7-11. The revised National Curriculum also now includes a new subject of citizenship education which makes clear reference to environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/6">The work of the government-sponsored UK Climate Impacts Programme is helping to raise both institutional and public awareness of the effects that climate change might have on the UK. Studies are being funded by a range of groups to help them assess their vulnerability to climate change and plan appropriate responses. The Government are also funding an extensive amount of research on the science and impacts of climate change which we make freely available to the general public.</p>
