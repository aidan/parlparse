	<p pid="b.115.8/1">Unlike retirement age policies for staff below the senior Civil Service, retirement age for the members of the senior Civil Service (SCS) is not delegated to individual departments to decide but is managed centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.8/2">Careful consideration was given to the impact on SCS management policies in light of the age regulations before the decision to adopt the national default age of 65 was taken. Departments and agencies and the Council of Civil Service Unions were consulted.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.8/3">It is important for the Civil Service to have the flexibility to manage talent in the SCS through, for example, promotion, deployment and recruitment. The decision to adopt a retirement age of 65 for the SCS enables the Civil Service to manage the SCS so that it has the right skills, experience and behaviours to meet the challenges faced by the 21st century Civil Service in delivering the Government's agenda. Having a retirement age of 65 does not mean that members of the SCS cannot request to work beyond that age.</p>

This includes an extra &pound;508 million above existing spending plans following the joint work with local government.

	<p pid="b.115.95/4">As you may be aware, the regional development strategy (RDS) for Northern Ireland contains a policy to strengthen the role of Londonderry as the regional city and hub for the north-west. The regional transportation strategy proposed two transport plans, the Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan (RSTNTP) and the Sub-Regional Transport Plan (SRTP), as the mechanism for implementation of the RDS outside the Belfast Metropolitan Area with regard to all modes of transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.95/5">The RSTNTP deals with the main strategic routes into and through Londonderry and this plan was published in March 2005. An enhanced list of schemes for inclusion in the RSTNTP was published for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase> with a response date of <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-29">29 September 2006</phrase>.

The responses are currently being considered and it is hoped that an announcement of the final proposals will be made later this year. The schemes included in the current RSTNTP and draft proposals would upgrade sections of all the major routes approaching the city.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.95/6">The SRTP deals with the whole of Northern Ireland, excluding the Belfast Metropolitan Area and the routes included in RSTNTP. A section has been developed for Londonderry and includes a detailed study of all modes of transport (walking, cycling, public transport and traffic) within the city. The draft document was issued for public consultation in March 2006 with a reply date of <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-23">23 June 2006</phrase>. Full details of the draft plan can be viewed on our website at <a href="http://www.roadsni.gov.uk/consultation/docs/ExecSummary.pdf">www.roadsni.gov.uk/consultation/docs/ExecSummary.pdf</a> or copies are also available in both Libraries. It is planned to publish the SRTP at the end of March 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.116/1">Humanitarian agencies are struggling in exceptionally and increasingly difficult circumstances to deliver vital aid to those in need in Darfur. The Secretary of State for International Development issued a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-26">26 January 2007</phrase> condemning the abuse UN and NGO humanitarian staff were subjected to in Nyala, south Darfur by the Sudanese security forces and calling on the Government of Sudan to bring those responsible to account.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.116/2">We are working with all sides to the conflict to ensure the ability of humanitarian agencies to operate freely, securely and without constraint. We are calling on all sides to cease the violence immediately, renew the ceasefire and political process, and accept the AU/UN peacekeeping force for Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.116/3">Sporadic outbreaks of communicable diseases, such as meningitis and cholera, have taken place in Darfur in recent years. Due to the presence of so many international aid agencies, however, the response has been swifter and more effective than in many other parts of Sudan. A concern is outbreaks in areas now too insecure for aid agencies to operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.116/4">DfID channels most of its humanitarian funds through the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), which was key in tackling a cholera outbreak in 2006. In 2007, 10 per cent of the CHF (approximately &pound;70 million, of which DfID's contribution is &pound;40 million) will be set aside for emergency response.</p>
