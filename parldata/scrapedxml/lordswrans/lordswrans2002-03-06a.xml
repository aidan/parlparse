	<p pid="a.13.5/1">As set out in my reply to the noble Lord on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February</phrase>, the Government broadly agree with the overall findings of this independent study. One of its individual conclusions, that some 49,000 jobs would be lost as a result of a 50 per cent reduction in defence exports, represents the best estimate presently available but, as the report notes, the method of estimating the number of jobs supported by defence exports is under review. The figure of 67,000 for the number of offsetting jobs that might be created is heavily dependent on the assumptions adopted by the authors in this study. It should be noted that the authors estimate that it would take five years for these jobs to be created and these would be less skilled, paying on average only about 70 per cent of the pay of the defence jobs lost. There is a substantial cost associated with this transition. The losses to defence workers were estimated at between &pound;735 million and &pound;1,260 million, compared with gains to other workers from the offsetting jobs created of only between &pound;445 million and &pound;695 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The terrorist attacks in the United States on <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> led to a downturn in air traffic, which has had a serious impact on NATS' revenues. Since that time, NATS' financial position has been regularly discussed by NATS, the Airline Group, the Government as the other main shareholder, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as regulator and the banks. All these parties are making a contribution to ensuring that NATS has a robust financial structure for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/2">The banks and government are being asked to make a contribution through the provision of short-term financial support, likely to be in the form of commercial loans. The terms of Airline Group's contribution are being discussed. Final decisions have not yet been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/3">The loan would be intended to provide bridging finance until NATS' longer-term financial position becomes clearer. The longer-term position depends in part on the outcome of the CAA review of the price cap.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.5/1">The Government put a high priority on road safety and reducing casualties on our roads. The demanding targets they have set for casualty reduction by 2010 endorse this and are backed by the Road Safety Strategy published in March 2000. The strategy explained the Government's commitment to improve safety on all roads in Great Britain for all road users, and work has already started to deliver improvements in order to meet the 2010 casualty reduction targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.5/2">While the Government provide funds, local highway authorities and the Highways Agency in England, and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for carrying out road improvements. Authorities target individual locations or sections of routes that have been identified through an assessment procedure that includes analysis of accident data. Priority is usually given to treating those sites and routes that have higher than average accident trends.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.5/3">The AA EuroRap programme is a welcome contribution to the road safety debate; it highlights the need for highway authorities continually to strive for improvement. It should also encourage drivers and other road users to take greater care and to play their part in improving road safety.bern</p>

	<p pid="a.20.2/1">Estimates of the number of cases of food poisoning published by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) have been derived from different sources and are explained in the following paragraphs. It is not possible to provide a definitive figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">Estimates of the number of cases of food poisoning quoted in the advertising for the FSA's Food Hygiene Campaign (up to 4.5 million a year) are taken from a large scale government funded survey (1994&ndash;95) of infectious intestinal disease (IID), which reported 9.4 million cases. On the basis of organisms identified from laboratory testing, the proportion of the 9.4 million IID cases that may have been transmitted by food was estimated to be between 17 per cent and 50 per cent. The figure &quot;up to 4.5 million&quot; represents about 50 per cent of the 9.4 million IID cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/3">The 2001 FSA Consumer Attitudes to Food Survey of people over 16 years of age was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-11">11 February 2002</phrase>. This nationally representative survey revealed that 12 per cent of those interviewed claimed to have experienced diarrhoea and/or vomiting attributed to food eaten in the United Kingdom in 2001. The FSA estimated that in the 16 and over age group this would correspond to about 5.5 million cases of food poisoning in 2001. These are calculated by multiplying the percentage of respondents who said they had experienced food poisoning in the last year by the most recent figure provided by the Office of National Statistics for the UK population aged 16 years and over.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/4">The FSA has set a target to reduce the number of cases of food poisoning in the UK by 20 per cent by 2006. Because there is no definitive figure for the number of cases of food poisoning, the FSA has taken the collated laboratory reports in 2000 for five key food poisoning organisms (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli 0157 and Clostridium perfringens) as the baseline for its target. Although this figure (65,253) is small relative to the other estimates of food poisoning, it is considered to provide a consistent basis for monitoring progress towards the target. Janice</p>

	<p pid="a.22.5/1">There will continue to be two levels of access to over the counter medicines. General sale list medicines will continue to be available from a range of retail outlets. Pharmacy medicines will continue to be available from pharmacies. As part of National Health Service arrangements, medicines will continue to be administered or supplied by a range of professional staff or prescribed by doctors, dentists and some nurses. We are taking action to enable more nurses to prescribe a wider range of medicines from April of this year. In addition, the Department of Health and the Medicines Control Agency will consult shortly on proposals to introduce supplementary prescribing for nurses and pharmacists. Depending on the circumstances, prescribed medicines will continue to be dispensed by hospital or community pharmacies or by dispensing doctors. There will continue to be restrictions on the types of medicines which most professional staff may administer, supply or prescribe, some of which arise from legislation under the Medicines Act and some of which are specific to the NHS. Those which are specific to the NHS may vary across the United Kingdom as many aspects of NHS arrangements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are devolved.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.2/1">The NHS Plan committed the Government to making more medicines available over the counter as part of a wider strategy to increase access to treatments generally. The rationale for the initiative is to give people a greater choice in their treatment and empower patients to manage their care with the help of skilled healthcare staff. The policy is to improve access to a range of medicines without affecting their availability on the National Health Service unless there are existing restrictions on NHS availability. Before a medicine is made more widely available it is assessed against strict criteria relating to its safety in the circumstances in which it will be used.</p>

House of Lords Negative Instruments From the records that we have we know of only one incidence where the House rejected a negative instrument outright. It occurred on <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-22">22 February 2000</phrase>, when the House of Lords agreed a Prayer to annul the Greater London Authority Elections Rules 2000. Affirmative Instruments From the records that we have we have found two examples of the House rejecting an affirmative instrument. In 1968 the House declined to approve the Southern Rhodesia (United Nations Sanctions) Order 1968. In 2000 the House declined to approve the Greater London Authority (Election Expenses) Order 2000.

	<p pid="a.27.2/1">1,078 Regular officers and 137 Full-Time Reserve officers have left the Police Service of Northern Ireland so far under the terms of the Voluntary Severance Scheme. Current Regular strength is 7,091 officers (including 87 regular officers currently on secondment) which represents a temporary dip under the figure of 7,500 recommended by Patten. However, the Chief Constable retains the support of the Full-Time Reserve. In addition, over 200 trainees have been recruited, many of whom are in the final stages of initial training.</p>
