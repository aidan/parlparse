	<p pid="a.167.8/1">In June 1999 the Conclusions of the Cologne European Council called for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be drawn up to make those rights more visible. It was agreed that the charter would be drafted by a body called the Convention, consisting of 15 member states' representatives, 16 MEPs, 30 national parliamentarians and one Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.8/2">The Convention met regularly from December 1999 to October 2000. It circulated a final draft on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-02">2 October</phrase>. This was discussed by Heads of Government at the Biarritz Informal Council on 13-<phrase class="date" code="2000-10-14">14 October</phrase>. They agreed that the charter should be proclaimed as a political declaration at the Nice European Council in December. Copies of the charter text have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.8/3">The Government strongly support the charter. People need to know their rights and the EU institutions need to respect them. The charter will help on both counts. It sets out fundamental rights and principles that the EU institutions should respect when going about their daily business, and it promotes the visibility and accessibility of those rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.8/4">The charter is not legally binding. It is addressed to the EU institutions, and to member states only when they are implementing Union law (Article 51(1)). It does not establish any new power or task for the Community or the Union or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties (Article 51(2)). It does not create any new powers for the ECJ. In deciding how to interpret fundamental rights, the ECJ is now, and will remain, free to have regard to relevant material. That may include the charter.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.8/5">Individual charter articles should be read in the context of the declaration as a whole, including the horizontal provisions. The meaning and scope of articles derived from the European Convention on Human Rights shall be the same as that in the corresponding ECHR articles (Article 52(3)). Charter articles based on EC/EU Treaty rights shall be exercised under the conditions and within the limits defined by those Treaties (Article 52(2)). Other articles make clear that the rights they concern are given effect only to the extent that they have effect in national laws and practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.8/6">The Government believe the charter will be good for Britain and good for Europe. Its successful negotiation is a vindication of our policy of positive engagement with our European partners. The charter cannot become legally binding unless all member states agree. We have made our opposition clear.</p>

The increase is caused by take-up of End Year Flexibility entitlement of &pound;4,000,000 to meet publicity costs for the Community Legal Service; &pound;6,000,000 in respect of costs for the Public Trust Office Change Programme; &pound;5,300,000 in respect of start-up costs for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service; &pound;1,900,000 in respect of costs for the Libra project; &pound;1,586,000 relating to asylum costs; a transfer of &pound;6,400,000 from capital grants expenditure to meet costs in respect of the Libra project; a transfer from the Home Office of &pound;113,000 in respect of contribution towards costs of the Immigration Services Tribunal; a transfer from the Home Office of &pound;273,000 in respect of PHOENIX, a project funded by the Invest to Save Budget; &pound;1,355,000 in respect of an award from the Invest to Modernise Fund; &pound;300,000 in respect of a correction to the accounting treatment for sundry income and &pound;26,182,000 from the DEL Reserve to meet additional costs on asylum and immigration.</p>

Various meetings and discussions have taken place but there is still more work to do. We are expecting to reach a conclusion by the end of this year.

	<p pid="a.176.2/1">In 1994 Ministers agreed that the Prison Service would provide approximately 500 places for immigration detainees to be held in prisons. No formal contract or service level agreement was made at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">In 2000, in pursuit of the Government's long-term strategy to rationalise and reduce the use of prisons for Immigration Act detainees, the Prison Service and the Immigration and Nationality Department agreed a package to provide immigration detention places separate from convicted prisoners; closer to meeting geographical needs and, in a small number of locations, better to meet the needs of immigration detainees. This included the closure of HMP Aldington and the transfer of the site for development as an Immigration Detention Centre in Spring 2002, and the opening in July 2000 of Lindholme Detainee Centre run by the Prison Service under a four-year service level agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/3">The current number of places being provided by the Prison Service in England and Wales is 112 in Lindholme, 198 in Rochester and 150 in Haslar, and a small number of places in mainstream prisons which varies from day to day between 70 and 100. In Scotland, 60 places are available at HMP Greenock and in Northern Ireland a small number of places, rarely in excess of seven, at HMPs Magilligan and Maghaberry.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/4">The Prison Service will soon be making a further 500 places available to the Immigration Service for a period of about one year to support the programme of removals from the United Kingdom, until the new Immigration Service detention centres come on stream during 2001. The location of these further Prison Service places has yet to be determined.</p>
