	<p pid="a.1.8/1">Success in Afghanistan is the highest priority in defence and countering the improvised explosive device (IED) threat is critical to making military progress in the campaign. We are completely focused on taking action to defeat this threat. We have deployed a counter-IED (C-IED) task force with the capability to detect, disable and exploit these devices and prevent them being laid. All troops receive comprehensive C-IED-specific training before they deploy to Afghanistan. A range of technologically advanced equipment is in service to counter the threat, including protected vehicles, remote control vehicles, ground surveillance, detectors and body armour. Enhancements to other critical capabilities-including military working dog capability-are being introduced. In addition, unmanned aircraft system capability has been significantly enhanced, and will be enhanced further, providing real time intelligence to track and target those who manufacture and plant IEDs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.8/2">The range of C-IED skills, equipment, training and other capabilities employed by our Armed Forces in Afghanistan are widely recognised as being better than ever before; they are improving the safety of our forces-always our first concern-and improving their operational effectiveness. We will continue to invest in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.5/1">Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) is a novel haemorrhagic disease of young calves which has emerged in a number of European countries in recent years. This disease is also known as bleeding calf syndrome or blood sweating disease. The first British case of BNP was confirmed in a calf in Scotland in April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/2">Although it is possible to provide a very crude estimate of the prevalence of BNP in the British calf population, it is important to note that the true prevalence of this disease in British calves is unknown. There is no legal requirement for farmers to notify suspected cases of BNP to government veterinary authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/3">Since early 2009, farmers have been encouraged to submit suspected cases of BNP to their local Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) or Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary Services (SAC VS) laboratory for investigation and diagnosis. Up until the end of July 2010, in order to provide farmers with an incentive to submit suspected cases for diagnosis, AHVLA and SAC VS carried out these investigations free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.5/4">As at <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-17">17 May 2011</phrase>, AHVLA and SAC VS have confirmed 380 calf cases of BNP in Great Britain. In order to place this figure in context, the average number of calves in the at-risk age category (0 to 4-weeks-old) on British cattle farms during 2010 was 196,177 (Source: Rapid Analysis and Detection of Animal-related Risks Cattle Tracing System Database). These figures suggest that the prevalence of BNP in the British calf population is very low. However, it must be borne in mind that there may have been significant under-reporting of cases to AHVLA and SAC VS and its also possible that there are unrecognised subclinical cases (calves that are affected but do not show any obvious signs of disease) of BNP on British cattle farms.</p>

Brassica growers are based across the country and grow a variety of different brassica crops. Consequently, the cold weather effects varied based on location, crop and where they were in their cropping cycle.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/1">In August 2010, the Fruit and Vegetable Task Force published its report on increasing fruit and vegetable production and consumption and in October followed this with an action plan for industry, growers, retailers, wholesalers, NGOs and Government to take forward, working together to reduce barriers and find innovative solutions. We are continuing to take a close and positive interest in progress on the action plan. In May 2011, the Task Force on Farming Regulation reported on reducing the regulatory barriers facing farmers, including fruit and vegetable growers. The Government will respond later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/2">The Government also provided funding of up to &#163;7 million on research and development last year on horticultural crops.</p>

The programme has up to &#163;90 million over the next five years to encourage industry innovation, including up to &#163;30 million from Defra for joint funding with industry.

	<p pid="a.6.2/1">The UK, in its capacity as a state observer, attended the Arctic Council's biennial ministerial meeting that took place in Nuuk, Greenland on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-12">12 May 2011</phrase> with representation from all eight Arctic states.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">The key outcomes from the meeting included Arctic Ministers agreeing structural changes to the council, including a permanent secretariat (to be based in Tromso, Norway), an agreed budget, new communication/outreach arrangements and an intention to enhance the council's agenda. The Arctic Ministers also signed a search and rescue agreement which is intended to improve co-ordination between the Arctic states, and is the first legally-binding agreement negotiated by the council, and which provides the council with another approach to doing business in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">Arctic Ministers also agreed a set of criteria for future applications for observers at the Arctic Council. This does not currently affect the UK's confirmed status as a state observer to the council, but the criteria will now be applied to new states seeking such status, including the outstanding applications from China, European Community, Italy, Japan and Korea.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has been supporting and reviewing the progress of the World Bank's Gender Action Plan (GAP 2007-10), the aim of which is to mainstream gender into the bank's operations, with a particular focus on women's economic empowerment.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/2">Our assessments have found that progress has been made in mainstreaming work on women's empowerment at the World Bank with, for example, a rise of approximately 20 per cent in the proportion of gender-informed projects, and significant public commitment has been made by President Zoellick with respect to gender equality. However, the multilateral aid review carried out by the Department for International Development (DfID) also highlighted the challenge of translating policy into results, and the need for the bank's performance to improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/3">At the last replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA 16) gender was chosen as a cross-cutting theme. Specific gender targets were established to ensure that IDA delivers concrete benefits to girls and women. And the World Bank's next world development report will focus on gender.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/4">At the World Bank spring meetings the Secretary of State sent a clear message to the bank that the report must demonstrate to policy makers and donors how to do things differently and deliver results for girls and women. DfID will follow up with the bank- both through engagement on the MAR and through monitoring the implementation of IDA 16-to ensure the bank delivers these important improvements.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.8/1">We recognise chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis can be severely disabling. Where a disability or health condition makes it unreasonable for a person to work we commit to support them. The right benefit in such cases is employment and support allowance (ESA). Those with the most severe functional limitations will be placed in the support group, with no conditionality/work related activity requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.8/2">People with limited capability for work will be placed in the work-related activity group. These individuals may be required to undertake work-related activity, which an adviser will discuss with them and will be detailed in their action plan. Work-related activity (WRA) may include work focused interviews (WFI) and other activities-for example, undertaking a training course or preparing a CV. Any activity the claimant is required to undertake must be reasonable in their circumstances. Advisers have the discretion to not impose work-related activity as they see fit. The purpose of work-related activity is to be of help to a claimant. Through these flexibilities we empowered advisers to support a wide variety of people, many of whom may have fluctuating conditions. At no time can an ESA customer be directed to seek, apply for or do work, nor to undertake medical treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.8/3">Safeguards are important for all ESA claimants rather than being condition specific. ESA customers have the right to ask for an activity to be reconsidered if they feel it is unreasonable. The reconsideration is undertaken by a Jobcentre Plus decision-maker. Customers also have the right of appeal, which is dealt with by an appeals tribunal.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">There is no special status for legislation which applies to Cornwall or to Cornish localities. There were provisions in 19th century primary legislation relating to the stannaries, but these have largely been repealed. Stannary customary law was formerly enforced through the Stannaries Court, but that court was abolished and its jurisdiction transferred to the county courts of Cornwall in consequence of the Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896. That body of customary law has not been systematically repealed but it is likely that such law has been superseded by modern legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.5/1">The chief executive of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) explained the transfer of responsibility to the police, for charging in certain further offences, when he gave evidence to the House of Commons Justice Select Committee in January 2011. The issue of statutory charging has also been raised in a number of Parliamentary Questions during recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/2">Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the CPS was given the power to charge, although the police retained the responsibility to charge in the more minor cases, which made up around two-thirds of the overall casework. The detailed division of responsibility for charging is set out in the Director of Public Prosecutions' Guidance on Charging, which is regularly updated. Since implementation, the issue of statutory charging has been the subject of review, most recently in the reports on police bureaucracy from Sir Ronnie Flanagan and Jan Berry. The Association of Chief Police Officers and the CPS agreed a programme of work in response and this included piloting the return of certain further offences to the police in 2010. The pilots were subject to a careful evaluation process that concluded in agreement to a national rollout, which will be completed at the end of June this year. The Home Secretary recently announced that further cases are to be returned to the police to charge following agreement between the CPS and ACPO. This will be the subject of a further pilot and evaluation. It is important to note that the CPS will remain responsible for the charging decision in the most serious and complex cases, and all cases charged by the police will be reviewed by the CPS following charge in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.</p>

Women continue to face unacceptably high levels of sexual violence with limited access to justice and healthcare as reported by non-governmental organisations and UN agencies. The UK has published its National Action Plan to address women, peace and security issues in the DRC. We continue to urge the Government of the DRC to implement fully President Kabila's zero tolerance policy on perpetrators of sexual violence. The most recent quarterly update to <I>Human Rights and Democracy: The 2010 FCO Report</I> notes a welcome increase in convictions for perpetrators of human rights violations in the DRC, but it remains on our list of human rights countries of concern.</p>

Storage is one of a number of flexibility tools available to shippers to meet this balance; there are other supply side tools, such as imports from a diverse range of routes (LNG from global markets, pipeline from Norway and the Continent, domestic production) as well as demand-side measures-such as entering into interruptible contracts with their customers, or fuel-switching in the power sector. The extent to which shippers rely on any of these tools is a commercial matter, and a potential source of competitive advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/3">Government have brought forward proposals to sharpen these commercial incentives through Clause 79 of the current Energy Bill. Subject to parliamentary approval, the clause would confer on Ofgem the ability to make changes to the cash-out regime to reduce the duration, likelihood and severity of a gas supply emergency. In so doing, this should help underpin commercial demand for additional flexibility options, such as holding more gas in store.</p>

This section of the Act was commenced in February 2009 but, as the order which applied the provisions of the Act to the existing pre-1985 fluoridation schemes was not made until March 2010, the first reports are not due until March 2014. We have just undertaken a consultation with academic experts on the indicators which might be monitored. We shall be issuing guidance to SHAs after considering the comments received. Public Health Observatories already publish health profiles with overviews of health for each local authority.

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">Following publication of the York report, the department funded the Medical Research Council to identify areas of uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and risks of water fluoridation, and to make appropriate recommendations for research to address these uncertainties. The department has since funded the School of Dental Sciences at Newcastle University to compare the bioavailability of fluoride in naturally fluoridated water with artificially fluoridated water. Currently, the School of Dentistry at Manchester University is investigating the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis with funds from the NHS National Institute for Health Research. We are also considering an evaluation of a new fluoridation scheme to address further recommendations in the York report to strengthen the evidence base on fluoridation. The quotation from the report on Health and Human Subjects 41 ends at &quot;....a further wide safety margin above the more usual fluoride intakes in fluoridated areas&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">The Government already provide considerable support to protect children against the risk of forced marriage, which is a serious form of child abuse. The joint Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office Forced Marriage Unit (FMU), which was launched in January 2005, provides advice to teachers in schools. The FMU produced statutory guidance on Forced Marriage in 2008 (revised 2010); revised multi-agency practice guidelines on handling cases of forced marriage in 2009; and supplementary guidelines on handling cases of forced marriage involving persons with learning disabilities in 2010. The guidance documents are targeted at frontline practitioners and volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/2">In schools, the risks relating to forced marriage are principally, although not exclusively, explored within personal, social, health and economic education (PHSE). An internal review into PHSE will determine how we can support schools to improve the quality of all PHSE teaching. It is for individual schools to decide how to address forced marriage issues, according to the needs of their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/3">The Government are committed to refocusing school inspection around the core areas of pupil achievement, teaching, leadership and behaviour safety. The issue of forced marriage may be relevant to inspectors' evaluation of schools' arrangements for keeping pupils safe. If concerns are brought to the attention of inspectors they will be expected to satisfy themselves that the school is doing everything it can to support pupils. There are no plans to ask Ofsted to consider compliance with statutory guidance on forced marriage as part of every school inspection or for forced marriage to be covered specifically as a discrete aspect of an inspection.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.3/1">Catering and Retail Services (CRS) use a number of fair trade branded products which include the standard tea bags used in all outlets (excluding the fruit or speciality teas), drinking chocolate, sugar sachets, some chocolate confectionery products and bananas (when available from the market).</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/2">Furthermore, CRS also uses other methods of ethical sourcing. The range of finest teas served in the Peers' Dining Room is sourced from an ethically responsible supplier which gives an assurance that it uses fair trade principles. The filter, bulk brew and espresso coffee supplied to all outlets is UTZ certified, which provides an assurance of responsible coffee production. However, there are a number of coffee pod products used for speciality coffees which are not fair trade.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.5/1">The Government have only reported Official Development Assistance (ODA) from the Peacekeeping Budget since Financial Year 2006-07. Since then, the amount of ODA reported from the Peacekeeping Budget has increased, in line with changes to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Development Assistance Committee's (OECD DAC) guidelines on what can be reported as ODA and as a result of more systematic reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/2">The Conflict Pool as it is currently structured has only existed since Financial Year 2009-10. Until Financial Year 2007-08, the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP), which was part of the Department for International Development's baseline, and the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP), which was part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's baseline, were separate budgets. Official Development Assistance (ODA) for the ACPP and GCPP was aggregated with Departments' own ODA reporting; the ODA figures for Financial Years 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 in the table above are therefore estimated. At the start of Financial Year 2008-09, a new joint conflict resources settlement merged the ACPP and GCPP into a single Conflict Prevention Pool and created a new instrument, the Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF), which provided resources for stabilisation activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. The SAF was merged into the Conflict Prevention Pool the following financial year and a single Conflict Pool was established. ODA and non-ODA figures for Financial Year 2010-11 are provisional. Final ODA figures for the Conflict Pool and the Peacekeeping Budget for 2010 will be published in Statistics on International Development in October 2011. A copy will be provided to the Library of the House in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.6/1">We warmly welcome the recent announcement that the Government of India has ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its three protocols, including the protocol on human trafficking. We hope that this will provide additional momentum to the Government of India's efforts to fight human trafficking and to ensure that the provisions of the protocol are enforced effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.6/2">We support co-operation between UK and Indian enforcement agencies in a range of areas and will continue to engage the Indian authorities on measures to combat human trafficking and illegal immigration, including offering UK experience and expertise where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.6/3">The UK Government are committed to working with international partners to address the problem of human trafficking. The issue was raised with the Government of India at the last EU-India Human Rights dialogue, held on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-22">22 March 2011</phrase>. The EU is currently funding three major anti-trafficking projects in India (and neighbouring countries) with local partners through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Our High Commission in New Delhi is involved in a pilot project to improve the exchange of information between agencies dealing with the prevention of trafficking and the rehabilitation of victims of commercial sexual exploitation in India. And the Department for International Development is currently developing a new regional programme aiming to reduce human trafficking across the South Asia region, including in India.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.0/1">We have serious concerns about the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia and we have made our views well known, including through the Universal Periodic Review process and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Human Rights Report. We have four priority areas, one of which is women's rights. At the root of the problem of the treatment of women in Saudi Arabia is the guardianship system, which grants a male relative authority over every woman. The male family member can refuse permission for the woman to study, travel or work. There is also an extensive system of segregation which limits women's ability to play a full part in public life. Women, with some exceptions, may not work in a workplace with men. They may not drive.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-15">15 May 2011</phrase> King Abdullah opened the largest female university campus in the world. There has been progress on female education in recent years. In 2009 King Abdullah opened the Kingdoms first co-education university north of Jeddah. And the King Abdullah Scholarship Programme is educating tens of thousands of Saudi women at universities worldwide. While the number and quality of female universities continues to rise, many subjects are not deemed appropriate and are unavailable to women. Employment opportunities are still limited, and major challenges remain. Local elections will be held in September 2011, but despite promises made when the elections were held in 2005, women are again excluded from voting or standing as candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/3">The Saudi Government have so far failed to remove the main institutional barriers to women, most notably the guardianship system. We continue to take every opportunity to urge the Saudi Government to remove the guardianship system of women, as the UK recommended at Saudi Arabia's Universal Periodic Review in February 2009. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, my honourable friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> discussed human rights during his visit to Saudi Arabia on 26 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-27">27 April 2011</phrase>, when he met the chair of the Governmental Saudi Human Rights Commission, Bandar Al Aiban.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-06-06a.77.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100684" speakername="Baroness Wilcox" colon=":" colnum="77"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110606w0003.htm#1106064004800">
	<p pid="a.77.5/1">The Central Lancashire Business School survey on Union Learning Representatives' (ULR) activity in England demonstrates the increasingly important role that ULRs play in the promotion of training and skills development in many workplaces. The Government consequently remain committed to supporting the work of ULRs and the Union Learning Fund in helping to drive up workforce skill levels and the important contribution they make to improving management-union relations in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/2">The survey included responses from over 950 active ULRs, 78 per cent of whom reported that their activity increased the number of colleagues receiving training and 80 per cent of whom reported that their activity had helped workers with little prior experience of learning. Two thirds reported improved management-union dialogue and almost 60 per cent reported improved management-union relations. The survey also included responses from over 112 managers, 88 per cent of whom valued the contribution made by ULRs. Furthermore, almost 60 per cent believed that ULRs had helped raise basic skill levels as well as 54 per cent agreeing that ULR activity had helped to close skills gaps. A majority of managers also agreed that ULR activity had helped to improve management-union relationships. The survey's findings are all the more positive given the very challenging economic climate at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/3">The funding of &#163;177,000 for the National Union of Journalist's (NUJ) Union Learning Fund project in 2009-10 produced a wide range of positive outcomes, the vast majority of which were above the project's original outcome profile. Through increasing the skills of the union's network of learning representatives the project was able to provide opportunities for 848 learners to improve their own skills. This included 277 learners undertaking information, communication and technology courses to improve their computer skills, 137 learners accessing literacy and numeracy training to improve their basic skills and over 350 learners participating in continuing professional development to enhance their existing skill levels. The project also developed an on-line learning centre which provides a bespoke careers advice service for workers in the industry, offering quality information, advice and guidance on career development and opportunities. This enabled the project's ULRs to offer structured information, advice and guidance on learning and skills to over 2,300 learners over three times higher than the profiled target of 650.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/4">A key purpose of the funding awarded to the NUJ for this ULF project was to help develop the union's capacity to provide ongoing support on learning and skills development to workers in the sector by helping to pump prime initial activity. Since the end of this project the NUJ has continued the learning and skills work initiated by the project, including sustaining the on-line learning centre using its own resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">The Welfare Reform Bill makes several changes to the benefits available to people with health conditions such as cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">In relation to Employment and Support Allowance, the Welfare Reform Bill provides for a one year time limit for those claiming contributory employment and support allowance in the Work Related Activity Group. The time limit will come into effect in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">People with the most serious disabilities and health conditions, including many people with cancer, will not be subject to time limiting. People with the most severe disabilities or heath conditions are placed in the Support Group: this includes people who are terminally ill and people who are receiving certain types of chemotherapy. We have just amended legislation so that individuals awaiting or between courses of certain types of chemotherapy will also automatically be placed in the Support Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/4">Income-related ESA will still be available for an indefinite period to those who qualify, irrespective of which group they are in.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/5">We are required to commission five annual independent reviews of the work capability assessment, the process by which entitlement to employment and support allowance is determined. As part of his second independent review, Professor Harrington has asked Macmillan Cancer Support and other cancer charities to look into how the work capability assessment assesses people with cancer and to make recommendations for improvements. I look forward to receiving Macmillan and Professor Harrington's recommendations for improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/6">The Welfare Reform Bill also provides for the replacement of disability living allowance for people of working age with a new personal independence payment, a new, more transparent benefit and objective assessment of individual need. This change will be introduced in 2013. The personal independence payment will provide automatic and immediate entitlement to people who have a progressive disease such as cancer, are terminally ill, and are not expected to live for more than six months.</p>
