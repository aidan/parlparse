	<p pid="b.165.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">1 December 2008</phrase>, the tax-free allowance for travellers entering the EU by air and sea will rise to &euro;430. This equates to about &pound;290, which doubles the current allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.5/2">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have around 4,500 officers who cover UK ports and airports. The officers are employed on a multi-functional basis, working on a wide range of duties, and not solely to enforce the duty-free personal allowance. It is therefore not readily possible to assess the direct impact of raising the personal allowance to &pound;1,000, although any increase in the allowance would lead to an overall reduction in the administrative cost in collecting and accounting for duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.5/3">To enforce the current duty-free allowance, officers intercept and challenge passengers following risk-based profiles. They also accept payment from passengers at red points. As statistics are not currently collated in respect of activities in relation to personal allowances, figures relating to the number of travellers with up to &pound;1,000 of goods stopped in the green channel in the last 12 months cannot be obtained except at a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.5/4">The total amount of revenue collected from travellers entering the UK in 2007 was &pound;12.8 million. However it is not possible to differentiate between customs duty, excise duty and VAT except at a disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.167.3/1">The Government's Forced Marriage Unit provides advice and assistance to British nationals facing forced marriage both in the UK and overseas. The unit also offers support to non-British nationals in the UK. The unit undertakes an extensive outreach programme to raise awareness of forced marriage issues among potential victims and relevant professionals. The Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007, which is being implemented by the Ministry of Justice, will provide legislative safeguards to victims or potential victims within the UK. The Act is expected to be operational by autumn 2008. Under the Act, guidelines produced by the Forced Marriage Unit for police, health professionals, education professionals and social workers will be reissued on a statutory footing.</p>

	<p pid="b.168.0/1">The healthcare professionals who advised the department on the classification were asked to focus on whether or not products could meet similar medical need. They were not asked to consider price.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/2">The panel will be reconvened but it will be extended to include representatives from industry and patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/3">Over 5,000 items are listed in Part IX of the Drug Tariff. In relation to the proposed classification that was published in September 2007, 478 editorial changes have been requested; the majority could be considered errors, for example incorrect reference codes. In addition, 124 omissions have been identified mainly as a result of companies' change of ownership during the course of this consultation. These will be corrected when the classification is revisited.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/4">The role of National Health Service specialist nurses is outside the scope of this review and we do not anticipate that their workload will be affected. However, officials have met with representatives from the NHS, for example representatives from the Royal College of Nurses and the World Council of Enterostomal Therapists. They have also met with a nurse who specialises in childhood incontinence, as such patients have very special needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/5">Under their terms of service, dispensing appliance contractors are not required to do anything but dispense an appliance. However, many of them employ nurses of their own; these nurses make home visits to patients at the discretion of the contractor. While we recognise the contribution these individuals make to patient care, we believe that their role is to complement the work of NHS specialist nurses. As such, we need to ensure that they are suitably qualified to deal directly with patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/6">Given this, in the proposed amendments to dispensing appliance contractors' and pharmacists' terms of service it states:</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/7" class="indent">&quot;'Specialist nurse' means a person registered in the Nurses' Part or Specialist Community Public Health Nurses' Part of the professional register maintained by the Nursing and Midwifery Council under article 5 of the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/8">Compliance with this proposed amendment would be the responsibility of the employer, ie the dispensing appliance contractor or the pharmacist.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.0/9">As noted, the role of specialist nurses employed by the NHS is not in scope. There are no restrictions on their ability to provide follow-up visits to users of stoma and incontinence appliances. As such, we anticipate that levels of infection should not increase. However, given the role of specialist nurses employed directly by providers to complement the work of NHS specialists, we will discuss this with interested parties when we next meet.</p>

NHS trusts may provide single rooms, single-sex bays within a mixed ward, single-sex wards or combinations of these types. We have never collected information on the number of trusts who have mixed-sex wards per se. Primary care trusts will, under the requirements of the operating framework, set, publish and implement stretching local plans for improvement, but these will again be based on the provision of single-sex accommodation, not wards.</p>

	<p pid="b.170.2/1">The National Health Service has preparation, monitoring and intervention processes in place to successfully manage the extra pressures in the system winter always creates, including Norovirus. The NHS has systems in place to identify pressures locally as they arise and respond appropriately. However, these are local arrangements and there is no national data collection measuring Norovirus prevalence or its day-to-day impact on hospital capacity. The Health Protection Agency assessment is that while Norovirus levels rose earlier than usual in the season, overall the pattern of increase in infections is consistent with that of previous years. All strategic health authorities are continuing active local management of their organisations facing the most pressure.</p>

	<p pid="b.175.2/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-21">21 January 2008</phrase>, the National DNA Database (NDNAD) held 362,812 profiles from individuals between the ages of 10 and 18 (up to their 18th birthday), from all forces in the United Kingdom, (this includes England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands). The number of profiles held on the database is not indicative of the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.2/2">At present, the replication rate is 13.3 per cent, that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent fewer than the number of profiles. Therefore, the estimated number of individuals between the ages of 10 and 18 as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-21">21 January 2008</phrase> is 314,558.
