The support costs for the carrier variant are anticipated to be lower than those predicted for the short take off and vertical landing variant due to its less complex construction. Given the best value principles set out in the production sustainment and follow-on development memorandum of understanding and the economies of scale derived from a common support solution for the 3,000 plus aircraft JSF partners intend to purchase, we remain confident that through-life costs remain affordable, despite the significant leap in capability provided by JSF.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.2/1">The UK decision to procure the A400M was based on a value for money evaluation of the capability it delivers to help meet our future military airlift requirements. This decision was confirmed during the strategic defence and security review. It is for this reason that we do not have any plans to sell these aircraft once they are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.2/2">It should, however, be noted that once these aircraft are delivered and ownership has transferred from the manufacturer to Her Majesty's Government, save for matters of government policy, no restrictions on our ability to sell these aircraft would exist.</p>

	<p pid="a.336.8/1">The gross and net yields from the bank payroll tax (BPT) were quoted in the previous Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-08">8 November</phrase> (<I>WA 6</I>). The wider impacts of the measure cannot be directly established from observable data, so are dependent on the assumptions about the behavioural response to the tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.8/2">The incidence of the tax must be borne by either the banks' shareholders or employees (through lower bonuses). The original costing by the previous Government when the measure was announced assumed the burden would be shared equally between the shareholders and the employees. This implies that bonuses would be reduced by 14 per cent compared to the level that would have been awarded without the BPT.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.8/3">Since the announcement of the tax, reports have indicated varying responses by banks, ranging from keeping bonuses more or less unchanged to passing on most of the cost of the BPT to staff. On balance, while it is clear that not all banks have significantly responded to the BPT, we have taken the view that there is insufficient evidence to justify changing the original assumptions on tax pass-through.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.8/4">Separately from the pass-though assumption, the costing includes a general behavioural response to allow for avoidance and labour supply effects as with other tax changes. The result of this is that bonuses subject to the BPT and income tax and NICs are assumed to have been 8 per cent lower than they would have been without the tax. Again this uses the same assumption made for the original costing when the measure was announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.8/5">For each &#163;1 reduction in bonus income, there is a loss of 53.8p in income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) collected from higher rate taxpayers. The combined effect of the two behavioural effects described above is to reduce income tax and NICs revenue by approximately &#163;1.2 billion. This accounts for the difference between the gross and net estimates of yield from the BPT.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.8/6">Methodologies and general principles for calculating the cost or yield of Budget decisions are now set out in policy costing documentation. For Budget 2010, this is available here:</p>

	<p pid="a.340.3/1">The European Commission has published its proposals for those stocks that do not require agreement with the Norwegian Government. These include cuts of 50 per cent in the total allowable catches (TACs) for cod, in both the Irish Sea and West of Scotland, for 2011. We are certainly concerned about the scale of the proposed cuts, which is likely to result in an increase in discards, and have asked the Commission to justify them. We will consider our formal response in the light of that explanation. The TAC for North Sea cod will be agreed in due course on the basis of the existing long-term management plan, in the context of the EU/Norway negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.5/1">There are two main stages in the procurement of home oxygen services and both processes are competitive. In the first stage, bidders are competing to be appointed to a national framework. The National Health Service regions will then each run mini-competitions working from those organisations on the national framework. At that second stage, bidders to supply the regions will not have to submit a pre-qualification questionnaire, as they would already have been judged to meet the core requirements of the contract at national framework stage of the procurement.</p>
