The International Court of Justice also ruled on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-26">26 February</phrase> that Serbia had breached its obligation to punish the perpetrators by failing to transfer individuals accused of genocide, including Ratko Mladic, to the ICTY.</p>

This is seen as the first step along the road to EU membership and will cover political dialogue, support for political and economic reform, aid and trade relations. Conclusion of the SAA will require full co-operation with ICTY. The UK regularly raises ICTY co-operation with the Serb authorities.

The Government already seek to support saving and asset ownership for all across the lifecycle from childhood, through working life and into retirement. Since 1997 the Government have introduced the individual saving account (ISA) so that everyone has access to a tax-advantaged savings scheme and introduced the child trust fund (CTF) so that in the future all children will enter adulthood with a financial asset regardless of family background and piloted the saving gateway to explore ways in which matched funding can promote saving in lower income households. The Government have also introduced stakeholder pensions to offer simple, low cost pensions to those without access to an employer pension and radically simplified the pensions tax regime to offer greater individual choice and flexibility in when and how people save for their retirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.0/1">EU political directors discussed the EU-Africa summit at their informal meeting in Estoril, Portugal on 12 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-13">13 July</phrase>. No decisions were taken. The UK and a number of other member states underlined that the EU common position on Zimbabwe does not allow for the issue of visas to President Mugabe and other specified members of the Zimbabwean Government to visit EU member states except in certain narrowly defined circumstances. As the noble Viscount will understand, those discussions were held in confidence and I do not therefore propose to list the individual countries and the arguments they made.</p>
