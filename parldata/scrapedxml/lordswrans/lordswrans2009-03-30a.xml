The Government cannot, however, support the regulation because of the uncertainty regarding the impact of the hazard criterion for potential human endocrine disrupters. This provision is likely to have a detrimental agronomic impact, but in the absence of an impact assessment or of a definition of endocrine disruption for these purposes, it is impossible to judge whether there will be any positive benefit accruing from this element of the regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January</phrase>, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced further measures designed to reinforce the stability of the financial system, to increase confidence and capacity to lend, and in turn to support the recovery of the economy. This included plans for the asset protection scheme, the details of which were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-26">26 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">The purpose of the asset protection scheme is to restore confidence in the banks by protecting them against exposure to exceptional future credit losses on certain portfolios of assets. It is therefore aimed at tackling a similar problem to that which a good bank/bad bank scheme would tackle and requires much the same process in terms of identification of assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/3">Furthermore, the scheme provides for the Treasury to take over the management of the assets covered by the scheme or to appoint an appropriate third party to do so in certain circumstances. These include instances in which participants have been unable to meet the detailed asset management requirements the Treasury has set or where there would be significant implications for the public finances of not doing so. The Treasury may also agree with the institution at a later date to purchase assets protected by the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/4">The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and the Lloyds Banking Group (Lloyds) announced their intention to participate in the asset protection scheme (APS) on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-26">26 February</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-07">7 March</phrase> respectively. RBS and Lloyds intend to protect &pound;325 billion and &pound;260 billion of eligible assets respectively. The banks will pay to the Treasury, in capital, a participation fee of &pound;6.5 billion and &pound;15.6 billion respectively. The agreement will mean that, in the event of a loss, RBS will bear a first loss after existing impairments of up to &pound;19.5 billion, and Lloyds will bear a first loss after existing impairments of up to &pound;25 billion. Thereafter, losses will be borne 90 per cent by the Treasury and 10 per cent by banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/5">RBS has also agreed not to claim certain UK tax losses and allowances for a number of years, meaning that, when it returns to profitability, it will not be able to benefit from the losses accrued in the intervening period.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.5/1">The results of a joint scientific study into the desirability and feasibility of reintroducing the European beaver to England were published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-18">18 March 2009</phrase> by Natural England and the People's Trust for Endangered Species.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.5/2">The report considers the impacts that a beaver reintroduction might have and the conditions under which a reintroduction could be made. It concludes that the costs of mitigating damage caused by beavers are likely to be low relative to the economic benefits of the ecosystem services which they may provide, such as assisting with river and floodplain restoration. It identified the need for a full cost-benefit analysis as part of the planning stage of any beaver reintroduction programme. Reintroductions elsewhere in Europe may also provide valuable evidence on issues that need to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.5/3">The report also includes an assessment of the likely impact of a reintroduction of beavers on British plants and animals, concluding that for all the taxa studied, including plants, invertebrates, amphibians, fish, birds and mammals, there are likely to be biodiversity gains, mainly arising from the creation of more diverse and naturally functioning habitats.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.5/4">I will arrange for a copy of the report to be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.5/5">Natural England has not made any decisions yet about whether reintroductions of beavers should take place in England. In considering whether to license a reintroduction programme we would expect Natural England to take account of the applicable International Union for Conservation of Nature guidelines, and to consider the views of interested parties. Natural England would also need to be satisfied that the reintroduction would not have a significant adverse impact on natural or semi-natural habitats, native wildlife or socio-economic interests and that measures could be put in place to deal with any unforeseen problems, should they occur.</p>

We are unable to disaggregate the specific costs, and any attempt to do so would incur disproportionate cost. However, the National Audit Office (NAO) gives a breakdown of the cost of typical asylum cases in 2007-08 in part four of its report <I>The Home Office: </I><I>Management of Asylum Applications by the UK Border Agency</I>, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-23">23 January 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.6/2">The table on page 36 of the report sets out 12 typical profiles and the lower- to upper-end estimate of costs either excluding or including accommodation and support costs. For example, profile four estimates the cost of a case resulting in the enforced removal of a single, undetained adult after he or she has exhausted their appeal rights as being between &pound;7,900 and &pound;17,000 excluding accommodation and support or &pound;12,000 and &pound;25,600 including accommodation and support.

	<p pid="a.197.5/1">The National Health Service has substantially reduced the number of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/2">Latest data published by the Health Protection Agency for October to December 2008 show a reduction in MRSA bloodstream infections of 38 per cent from the corresponding quarter in 2007 and down 65 per cent from the 2003-04 quarterly average, (the baseline from which our target to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections is measured). The National Health Service delivered this target of halving MRSA bloodstream infections by the end of 2007-08. We are now committed to sustaining the reductions achieved so far and continuing to drive down infections still further.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/3">There has also been a significant reduction in the number of Clostridium difficile cases, with the latest data for July to September 2008 (England) showing a 33 per cent reduction in infections in patients aged two and over compared with the same quarter in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.5/4">The department's strategy for reducing healthcare-associated infections in the NHS is set out in <I>Clean, Safe C</I><I>are</I>, which has already been placed in the Library. This outlines the comprehensive range of measures being employed, backed by &pound;270 million additional investment per year by 2010-11 to tackle healthcare-associated infections.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.2/1">The Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 provides for a place of meeting for religious worship to be certified to the Registrar-General. The form for certification in Schedule A to the Act is to be signed as certifier by a minister, proprietor, trustee, occupier, attendant or such other words as will clearly show his or her connection with the place of meeting. On that form, the certifier inserts the religious denomination of, or religious appellation adopted by, the persons on whose behalf the building is certified. If those persons decline to describe themselves by any distinctive appellation, the certifier inserts &quot;who object to be designated by any distinctive religious appellation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/2">When considering the registration of a building which has been certified as a place of religious worship, the Registrar-General applies the judgment by the Court of Appeal in the Segerdal case. The main finding in the judgment is that the words &quot;place of meeting for religious worship&quot; in the Act connote a place of which the principal use is for people to come together as a congregation to worship God or do reverence to a deity. The 1855 Act does not apply to the Church of England and the Church in Wales but the building of any other faith or denomination which meets these criteria would be capable of registration, regardless of what the congregation call themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/3">In the Answer to <I>WA 91</I>, the Registrar-General categorised as &quot;other&quot; any denomination where there were less than 150 places of worship certified at that time which included the following:</p>

Compared to a decade ago, over 78,000 more children leave school with five good GCSEs, including English and maths.
