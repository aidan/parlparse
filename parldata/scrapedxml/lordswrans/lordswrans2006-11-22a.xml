	<p pid="a.10.11/1">The system is undergoing rigorous testing now. There are three phases to the testing: unit testing, which tests the individual programs; system testing, which tests how all the programs work together at a technical level; and user acceptance testing, which ensures that the system is usable in an efficient manner by operations staff.</p>

Allocations for later years have not yet been decided, but our supply modelling will take account of schools' needs and the national school sport strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.5/1">The Government announced their long-term ambition for PE and school sport in December 2004. The main aim is that by 2010 all children will be offered at least four hours of sport a week. This will comprise two hours of high-quality PE and sport at school, and the opportunity for at least a further two to three hours beyond the school day, delivered by a range of school, community and club providers. Additional funding of &pound;519 million has been committed to deliver on this ambition in 2006-07 and 2007-08. Funding for future years will be announced following the outcome of the next Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/2">No national curriculum subjects will be dropped from the curriculum in order to deliver the 2010 ambition.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.5/3">We have held no negotiations with the teachers' unions specifically about the 2010 ambition. Any demand for additional teachers to deliver the school elements of the 2010 ambition will be taken into account, as normal, by the teacher supply modelling exercise. The PE and school sport professional development programme will ensure that teachers have the skills and expertise they need to continue to deliver high-quality PE and school sport for young people.</p>
