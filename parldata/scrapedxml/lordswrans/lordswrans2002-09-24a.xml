	<p pid="a.182.5/1">Countries in Africa and Asia generally owe money to the UK via debts owing to the Department for International Development (DfID) or the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD). Debts owing from these countries amount to around &pound;57 million for the former and around &pound;6 billion for the latter. In addition, the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) has some public sector debt owing to it by these countries that amounts to around &pound;46 million. However, the Government have already written off all aid debts to the poorest countries and the majority of debts owing to DfID are written off as they fall due.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/2">In addition, the UK is at the forefront of the debate on international debt relief and participates fully in the enhanced heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative agreed at Cologne in 1999 that makes provision for the cancellation of around 100 billion US dollars of debt. Under the HIPC initiative a country receives interim debt relief on payments due when it reaches decision point (DP), and subsequently the debt is irrevocably cancelled at competition point (CP). Of the 42 countries classified as HIPCs, four are currently expected to have a sustainable burden of debt after traditional debt relief and one has, so far, not opted to apply for debt relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/3">Of the remaining 37 countries, 26 have now reached decision point with $62 billion in debt relief committed compared with the $100 billion total. Six of these countries, Bolivia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Burkina Faso and Mauritania, have reached completion point and will have the totality of their debts owed to the UK irrevocably cancelled. Out of 11 countries yet to reach decision point (pre-DP) eight are affected by conflict and this makes their progress in the HIPC initiative difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/4">Moreover, the UK goes beyond the terms agreed under the HIPC initiative and always provides 100 per cent debt relief on all qualifying debts owing to DfID, ECGD C which accounts for the bulk of the debt C and CDC. In addition, for those HIPCs yet to reach decision point the UK operates a unilateral hold-in-trust policy. For those countries yet to secure debt relief because of civil wars, external conflict or the absence of a poverty reduction programme any debt payments made are held in trust until they can be returned to fund poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/5">For non-HIPCs repayment schedules and any multilateral agreements on debt forgiveness are agreed through the Paris Club group of official creditors working closely with the IMF and World Bank. The amounts owing to DfID, ECGD and CDC from countries in Africa and Asia are set out in the attached table. The amounts in each case often refer to more than one loan, and for this reason the exact repayment arrangements for all loans cannot easily be provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.5/1">&quot;Dangerous severe personality disorder&quot;, or DSPD, does not exist as a clinical or legal diagnosis in its own right. There are no specific &quot;DSPD&quot; provisions in the draft Mental Health Bill. The term is a working definition. It is designed to cover individuals who show significant disorder of personality; present a significant risk of causing serious physical or psychological harm from which the victim would find it difficult or impossible to recover, (eg homicide, rape, arson; and in whom the risk presented appears to be functionally linked to the personality disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/2">A developmental process of assessment designed to operationalise the above criteria is currently being piloted at HMP Whitemoor. The assessment process is comprehensive and, within a 16-week period, a number of instruments for the assessment of serious re-offending and severe personality disorder are completed. Prisoners are also observed and clinical judgements are made about the functional relationship between their disorder of personality and their serious offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/3">Due to the developmental nature of the assessment pilot and the fact that DSPD, as currently conceptualised, does not exist as a clinical disorder, no previous research has been conducted specifically into the reliability and consistency of its &quot;diagnosis&quot;. However, the assessment pilot is currently being independently evaluated. The aims of the research, among others, are to evaluate the reliability of the process and to consider whether it is objective and does not discriminate against any particular group of individuals in respect of social, cultural or ethnic background. The evaluation does not consider the issue of gender because all prisoners eligible for the HMP Whitemoor pilot are male.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/4">The assessment process for DSPD does, however, build upon an existing evidence base about the assessment of severe personality disorder and the risk assessment of dangerous offending behaviour. Research shows that the instruments that are being used as part of this process are consistent, in that different clinicians are highly likely to arrive at the same diagnosis, and the measures are also shown to be stable across time.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/5">There is no known evidence to suggest that the tools used in the DSPD assessment process have a gender or social class bias. However, the evidence base on the assessment of dangerousness and severe personality disorder is evolving. Research is currently ongoing to consider these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/6">There is also no known research to suggest that the &quot;likeability&quot; of the patient, as perceived by the person making the diagnosis, influences the assessment. However, the need to guard against the possibility is well recognised. The assessment for DSPD therefore makes use of objective assessment tools in order to help eliminate, as much as possible, any subjectivity in the assessment process.</p>

However, the distribution of resources and deployment of officers within Merseyside is a matter for the chief constable of the force (Norman Bettison Esq QPM). I understand from the Chief Constable that the actual number of officers on duty in each neighbourhood varies hour by hour, as officers' shifts are planned to match resources as closely as possible to demand.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">Generally, intercalating students are eligible for either HE student or social security support. The student loans system is the prime means of support for full-time higher education students. Support is provided to students who are absent from their courses because of illness for the first 60 days of absence. Local education authorities (LEAs) have the discretion to decide whether they should continue to receive support after the first 60 days' absence and also when students suspend their studies for reasons other than illness, such as caring responsibilities, financial problems, bereavement, or premature termination of a work placement. We strongly encourage LEAs to exercise this discretion. Additional assistance for students who are absent from their courses may also be available through the hardship funds, which allow universities and colleges to provide discretionary support for students in particular need.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/2">So far as social security benefits are concerned students in the &quot;vulnerable groups&quot; as defined in social security legislation (such as lone parent or disabled students) continue to be eligible for income related benefits during periods of intercalation and students who have been ill for 196 days become eligible to claim income support during their period of illness. Students who, with the permission of their higher education institution, have interrupted their course because of caring responsibilities or illness but those caring responsibilities have ceased or they have recovered form that illness may claim jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit from the date their caring responsibilities ceased until they are permitted to return to the course, but, to ensure they return as soon as practicable, the claim period is limited to one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/3">Some intercalating students who are not ill, lone parents or disabled may not receive LEA discretionary student support, as well as being ineligible for social security benefits. One example is students intercalating for academic reasons, such as those who have failed their exams and only return to their HE institution to retake them a year later.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.5/1">Support for full-time higher education students comes from the student support system, which is designed for their needs, and not from the social security system. The vast majority of students, once they begin a full-time course of study, are not eligible to claim the income-related benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.5/2">However some students in the &quot;vulnerable groups&quot; as defined in social security legislation, principally lone parents and disabled students, may have additional costs unassociated with their studies and these students retain their eligibility for the income-related benefits subject to satisfying eligibility and income criteria. They may be eligible for both higher education student support and social security benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.5/3">Full-time students in these vulnerable groups continue to be eligible for income related benefits during periods of intercalation. This now includes students who, with the permission of their HE institution, have interrupted their course because of caring responsibilities or illness but those caring responsibilities have ceased or they have recovered from that illness but cannot return to their course until an agreed time in the academic year. These students may claim jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit from the date their caring responsibilities or illness ceased until return to the course; but, to ensure they return as soon as practicable, the claim period is limited to one year. A student who intercalates and has been ill for 196 days also becomes eligible to claim income support during their period of illness thereafter.</p>

They may be eligible for an instalment of support during the quarter in which they withdraw, but this is subject to the discretion of the local education authority concerned, taking into account the circumstances leading to the student's withdrawal.

We have no cost figures on the extension of student support to all such students because information on overall numbers of particular categories of intercalating students is not collected by LEAs or centrally.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-09-24a.199.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100298" speakername="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" colon=":" colnum="199"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020924/text/20924w05.htm#20924w05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.199.2/1">A student becomes eligible to claim an income-related benefit immediately they have abandoned, completed or been dismissed from a full-time course of study. Students studying part-time are not excluded from claiming income-related benefits whilst studying. All students may claim other social security benefits subject to their satisfying the normal conditions of entitlement for the benefit concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/2">In March 1998 the Social Security Amendment (Students) Regulations 2000 were formally referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee. The regulations amended social security legislation to make clear the policy intention that full-time students are not eligible for income-related benefits (income support, jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit) until they complete, abandon or are dismissed from their course. This is because support for students should come instead from the educational maintenance system, which is designed for their needs. However, in recognition that some students have costs unassociated with their study, certain students, such as disabled students or lone parents, can claim income-related benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/3">In reporting their views on the proposed 1998 regulations to the Secretary of State, following the referral, the committee made three recommendations. We were unable to accept the recommendations in full and it is not possible to estimate the likely cost of adopting those recommendations we did not accept. However, we did make the following concessions.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/4">We recognise that there are a number of reasons why a student might interrupt their course of study, but we believe that students have a responsibility to progress as quickly as possible with their studies and for this reason students who interrupt, but do not abandon, a course of full-time study remain ineligible for the income-related benefits and may not have access to student support. In cases of illness however, although there is no mandatory requirement to determine that support is payable where a higher education student is absent after 60 days, the Department for Education and Skills is committed to ensuring that such students continue to receive their support whenever appropriate. Guidance has therefore been issued to educational institutions requesting them to be sympathetic to students in this position and to local education authorities asking them to consider exercising their discretion to extend student support payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/5">In addition, students who have, with the permission of their educational establishment, interrupted their course because of illness or caring responsibilities, and who have recovered from that illness or whose caring responsibilities have ended can claim jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, or council tax benefit as appropriate. They may claim from the date of recovery from illness or the date their caring duties ceased until such time as they have permission to return to their course. However to ensure that the student returns as soon as practicable the period of such a claim is limited to one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/6">We also agreed not to amend the definition of &quot;last day of the course&quot; as we had proposed in view of the adverse effect it would have had on some post-graduate students. (Command Paper 4739, government response, paragraphs 21-23). Guidance was issued to decision makers to make clear that post-graduate students who have completed their course of study should not be treated as full-time students. These students will therefore be eligible for council tax benefit unless, in the opinion of the decision maker, they are engaged full-time in writing a thesis or doing associated work such as research.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/7">Students who change from a full-time course to a part-time course and who have had to abandon one to begin the second are able to claim the relevant income-related benefits, as they are no longer full-time students.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/8">In recognition of the additional costs unassociated with their studies that lone parents who are full-time students may have, they continue to be eligible for income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit. However this eligibility ceases when the youngest child reaches age 16 for income support purposes or when the child reaches age 19 or is no longer in full-time relevant education for housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/9">At age 16 for income support purposes, the child is no longer treated as dependant to the extent that the parent is required to register for employment and is therefore no longer considered to be a vulnerable group student. It would be unfair on other single students, who also have no dependants, if these students remained eligible for income support.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.2/1">Schemes operate tracker funds in a variety of ways. The exact current value of money invested in a stakeholder pension will depend on a number of factors, such as the date of the investment and the specific nature of the stakeholder's charging structure. Also, for a given index tracked, fund performance may vary. For these reasons no specific answer can be given.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/2">Data are available from Trustnet (<a href="http://www.trustnet.com">www.trustnet.com</a>) on the performance of all &quot;tracker funds&quot;. In the year to July 2002 performance across UK &quot;tracker funds&quot; ranged from a 10 per cent growth to a 77 per cent fall. Reference can be made to this source for details of individual funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/3">These figures relate specifically to the growth in value of a unit holding over a specified period assuming that distributions (dividends net of the standard rate of tax) are re-invested to purchase additional units of a fund at the closing bid price applicable on the ex-distribution date.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/4">In general, pension saving is a long-term investment, and it is not therefore helpful to consider fund performance over just one year.</p>

Only the national museums and galleries that are free, funded directly by Government, and to which that commitment to free access applied, are eligible for the refund scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.5/1">The committee that advises English Heritage on ancient monuments is the Historic Sites and Landscapes Committee, formerly the Ancient Monuments Advisory Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/2">English Heritage has advised that there is evidence that ploughing in parts of the Verulamium scheduled monument is causing ongoing damage to the archaeology. It is, however, difficult to delineate the areas in which damage is being caused because of the topography of the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/3">Before a final decision can be made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on the correct way forward she must satisfy herself that all available options have been explored, that the necessary legal procedures have been followed and that any action is underpinned by appropriate evidence. DCMS is identifying those parties with a legal interest in the site so that consultation can take place. We all want to bring matters to as speedy a conclusion as possible&mdash;within the relevant legal and procedural constraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/4">The term &quot;deep ploughing&quot; is not one that has an agreed definition and used in the context of this site, it conveys a misleading impression. Ploughing at scheduled monuments is only permitted within the terms of the Ancient Monuments Class Consents Order 1994 which gives consent to the following works (among others):</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/5">&quot;Agricultural, horticultural and forestry works of the same kind as those previously carried out lawfully in the same location and on the same spot within that location within the period of six years immediately preceding the date on which the works commence; but excluding works falling into one or more of the following categories&mdash;(a) in the case of ploughed land, any works likely to disturb the soil of any part of that land below the depth at which ploughing of that part has previously been carried out lawfully.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.5/6">Of course, ploughing and other means of cultivating the soil are potentially damaging to any ancient monument or archaeological site. The cultivation of previously undisturbed sites may disrupt and make archaeological areas indecipherable and the repeated disturbance of the soil can fragment and abrade artefacts that are contained within it. The deeper the ploughing the more likely it is to destroy previously undisturbed levels even in land that has previously been cultivated. The impact on any one ancient monument is, however, dependent on the land use history and the nature of the site itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">Regulation 6 of the Asylum Support Regulations 2000 sets out the assets which the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) must take into account when determining whether an asylum seeker is destitute. Those assets are cash, savings, investments, land, cars or other vehicles, and goods held for the purpose of trade or other business. The assets may be held in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. NASS does not consider the value of personal jewellery, nor does it take account of personal clothing, bedding and optical or medical items when calculating asylum support.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/2">Asylum seekers applying for support from NASS are required to declare any assets when they apply for asylum support. They are asked to say if their assets are not reasonably available to them and explain why. NASS caseworkers must then exercise their judgment in determining whether assets are reasonably available to the applicant. Where possible, caseworkers are advised to confirm factual matters (such as the existence of currency restrictions) with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) Country Information and Policy Unit (CIPU) or with the relevant embassy or High Commission. In assessing the value of property overseas, caseworkers are advised to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt concerning the location, current market value and description of property unless it is inherently improbable or inconsistent with other information. NASS guidance states that land or property should be disregarded indefinitely if it is impractical and unreasonable to sell it or if it is occupied by relatives who are 60 years of age or older or are disabled.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">The requested information on the proportion of asylum seekers that are detained and subsequently granted bail who attempt to evade the asylum system is not available. However, detention is used sparingly and only a small proportion of all those liable to detention under the Immigration Act 1971 are actually detained.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">We welcome the contribution the research conducted by South Bank University makes to the on-going debate about the use of immigration detention powers. We are aware of its conclusions but have not yet had an opportunity to study the whole report.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/3">We are making improvements in the area of contact management as detailed in the current Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill. The Bill will provide for the creation of accommodation centres for asylum seekers who will be required to report within the centre. Those asylum seekers who are dispersed or who are not in National Asylum Support Service (NASS) accommodation will be required to report to reporting centres or to police stations attended by staff from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. During the induction process all asylum seekers will be advised of their obligations to notify the Home Office of any change of address and of the need to report as required. Provision of support to asylum seekers will be conditional on their reporting as required.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">The induction process includes the booking of the applicant's substantive asylum interview. This interview is booked for no less than 10 working days from the applicant's departure from the induction centre. This timing is in line with current practice for asylum seekers who do not yet go through the induction process. In addition, the induction process provides briefing for asylum applicants detailing the asylum process, their rights and responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">The briefing makes it clear that an asylum seeker may seek legal representation but that this is not deemed necessary prior to attendance at a substantive interview, and an interview will not be delayed because of a lack of representation. This is consistent with the Government's view that it is not necessary for an asylum seeker to obtain legal representation prior to a substantive asylum interview.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">Regarding documentation it is incumbent on an asylum seeker to provide additional documentation to support his claim at the earliest opportunity. If documents are not available at the time of interview they could be produced to support any appeal the asylum seeker may lodge.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.6/1">Section 8(a) and (b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 which covers the production or attempted production, supply and attempted supply of controlled drugs to another on premises applies to all controlled drugs including crack cocaine. Last year, the Government introduced an amendment to Section 8(d) of the 1971 Act through Section 38 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. The amendment extended the scope of Section 8(d), which covered the use of cannabis and opium, to cover the use of all controlled drugs including crack cocaine on premises in order to strengthen police powers to deal with the proliferation of crack houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.6/2">It was also recognised that the strengthening of Section 8(d) could impinge on the legitimate harm reduction activities of those working in the care sector. The Government therefore undertook that, before the amendment was implemented, Notes of Guidance outlining how it should be enforced must be published. Work is currently being undertaken to publish the Notes of Guidance and implement Section 8(d).</p>

	<p pid="a.218.2/1">The problem of mislabelling, under-declaring added water, and not disclosing hydrolysed chicken and pork proteins in frozen chicken breast was first reported by the Food Standards Agency in December 2001. The agency informed local authorities, the European Commission, the Dutch and Belgian authorities, as well as the Irish Food Safety Authority, who carried out a similar study. The Irish study published in May 2002 revealed similar results, but in addition found some samples containing undisclosed beef protein in chicken imported from the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.2/2">The agency obtained a commitment from the Dutch authorities to put inspection of the poultry plants involved on their priority list. This action has been further reinforced by the European Commission, who in June threatened infraction proceedings against the Dutch government if the problem of mislabelling is not resolved. The United Kingdom study was carried out in close co-operation with local authority enforcement staff, and one UK wholesaler has been prosecuted as a result.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.5/1">A small number of school nurses have been trained to issue emergency contraception to pupils as one part of the wider support they provide within school based drop in clinics. The governing bodies of the individual schools concerned have taken this decision, after consultation with parents. All parents have received information about the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/2">A pilot project is currently being developed to train pharmacists to provide emergency contraception under National Health Service arrangements. This is part of a wider scheme to improve access to emergency contraception by older women. The project is due to start in late autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/3">Emergency contraception is only provided to young people under 16 under medical supervision. This includes the supply by other health professionals, such as school nurses and community pharmacists, working to Patient Group Directions. A Patient Group Direction is a written instruction for the supply or administration of medicines to groups of patients without an individualised doctor's prescription.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/4">Health professionals can provide contraception to young people under 16 provided they are satisfied that the young person is competent to understand fully the implications of any treatment and to make a choice of the treatment involved. Health professionals work within an established legal framework which involves assessing the young person's competence to understand the choices they are making and encouraging them to talk to their parents. All professionals are bound by their professional code of confidentiality. A young person's request for confidentiality is respected unless there are serious child protection issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/5">These services aimed at improving early access to emergency contraception should be seen in the context of a much wider programme of work in the Exeter teenage pregnancy strategy.

	<p pid="a.220.5/1">We have put in place a range of measures to encourage the National Health Service and local authorities to work together more effectively so that patients and people in need of care get the high quality and co-ordination of service they need. These include using existing Health Act flexibilities covering over 100 schemes and involving over &pound;1 billion of resource. Primary care trusts are also providing a unique opportunity to foster closer working between the NHS and local government, particularly social services.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.5/2">As the next stage in this evolution, the NHS Plan announced a new kind of organisation, called care trusts. The first four care trust became operational in April 2002. They will enable the even closer integration of health and social care services and will build on existing joint working.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.2/1">The National Health Service is first and foremost for people who are ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. The services provided are free except in specified circumstances. Where a person is not ordinarily resident in the UK the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended, require NHS trusts to establish if the person is liable to be charged under those regulations for any NHS treatment they receive and if so to recover such charges. Visitors to the UK are allowed to remain for a maximum of six months and are unlikely to be regarded as ordinarily resident for the purposes of these regulations but may fall under one of the exemptions from charges specified in the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.2/2">The regulations provide that certain services are without charge in any circumstances. This includes an initial diagnostic test and any associated counselling for HIV/AIDS. If a person is liable for charges under the regulations then any treatment needed for HIV/AIDS other than the test and counselling will be subject to charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.2/3">Entitlement to free treatment under the National Health Service is primarily based on residence not nationality and the type of passport held is therefore only relevant in relation to certain specified exemptions relating to member states and countries with which there are reciprocal healthcare agreements.

	<p pid="a.229.0/1">The safety of blood and blood components used in the National Health Service is of paramount importance. Every reasonable step has therefore been taken to minimise any risk associated with fresh frozen plasma. However, it is not possible to guarantee that blood and blood components are 100 per cent safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/2">We do not believe that the continued use of non-virally inactivated fresh frozen plasma is contrary to Council of Europe guidelines. Indeed, a number of other countries in Europe continue to provide this product to their patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/3">There are no plans to submit blood and blood components to the Medicines Control Agency for licensing. We do not believe that doing so would confer any additional public health benefit. The Medicines Control Agency already ensures that the UK Blood Services meet European Good Manufacturing Practice standards. In addition, the new European Blood Directive will, when adopted, require the accreditation of all blood establishments to ensure common standards of safety and quality in blood and blood components across all Member States.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/4">Serious adverse reactions and events associated with fresh frozen plasma, and all other blood components, are already monitored by the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) enquiry. SHOT is a voluntary scheme. However, 92 per cent of hospitals in the United Kingdom already participate in SHOT and recent guidance to the National Health Service on the appropriate use of blood asks all hospitals to do so. SHOT publishes an annual report, and a copy of the most recent (for 2000&ndash;01) has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.230.5/1">The main agency through which the Government support medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its grant-in-aid from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology. The MRC's funding decisions are set largely by scientific considerations, that is the quality of the scientific opportunity and the likelihood of significant development. But health needs are also important in terms of, for example, the burden of disease and the potential for health gain.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.5/2">The MRC does not, as a rule, earmark funds for particular topics. Research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available.

	<p pid="a.231.5/1">Government policy with regard to the provision of high security psychiatric services is to secure the safety of the public, staff and patients, and to ensure that the best possible services are offered to patients who need to receive their care and treatment in a high security setting. The three high security hospitals must achieve an appropriate balance between therapy and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/2">The safety and security directions were originally introduced as a result of the findings of the committee of inquiry into the Personality Disorder Unit, Ashworth Special Hospital (Fallon inquiry) that reported in 1999. They were amended in the light of recommendations arising from the review of security at the high security hospitals that was published in 2000. The directions were designed to address significant security shortcomings and inconsistencies identified across the three high security hospitals and to assist in providing a safer environment for patients and staff that should enhance, rather than provide a barrier to, the therapeutic activities of the hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/3">Following the Fallon inquiry, an additional &pound;6.3 million was made available to increase staffing in the three hospitals. At Broadmoor Hospital this has allowed an additional 100 full-time equivalent nurses to be recruited and sufficient occupational therapists to achieve input to each clinical team. This has enhanced the range of therapeutic interventions available for patients.</p>

If the targets set out in those plans are met, this will mean that, by the end of 2005 and for the majority of departments, women should hold 45&ndash;50 per cent of the appointments to the bodies they sponsor.

The Cabinet Office will be doing all it can within its resources to help departments meet their targets while upholding the principles of selection on merit.

	<p pid="a.236.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the Operations Director of the Highways Agency, David York, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-01">1 August 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.5/3">Tim Matthews has been asked by Lord Macdonald to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the removal of ragwort growing along the verges of the A14 and A11 trunk roads and whether it is a suitable job for those who have been sentenced to Community Service. I am replying since Tim is currently away on leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.5/4">The Highways Agency takes the issue of ragwort on highway land very seriously and undertakes major annual programmes of eradication by spraying and hand weeding.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.5/5">The Agency makes considerable efforts to identify affected sites and to then treat them on a priority basis. All known ragwort sites on the A14 and A11 will be treated in due course and the next such works will take place on the A11 in the Newmarket area within the next two weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.5/6">The removal of ragwort is a labour intensive task. However, working close to fast moving traffic has significant safety implications and the Agency would only wish to use suitably qualified staff in these situations.</p>

	<p pid="a.247.0/1">Both the UK and its European partners are conscious of the importance to industry of encouraging the Russian Federation to bring its patent and other intellectual property rights (IPR) legislation into compliance with international standards and have been working actively towards that end.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/2">The UK has participated in IPR seminars in Russia, offering advice and training material produced by the UK Patent Office and encouraging ratification of international IPR treaties. Representatives of ROSPATENT, the Russian Patent Office, have also made study visits to the UK Patent Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/3">The European Patent Organisation, of which the UK is a founder member, has provided ROSPATENT with access to its world-class patent search and technical literature database. Expert tuition in the set-up and use of the database has also been provided. This is of significant benefit to both Russia and European industry to assist in the determination of the validity of patent rights granted in the Russian Federation. Technical cooperation and assistance with ROSPATENT has also facilitated the electronic scanning of patent documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/4">Within the framework of the EU-Russia Sub-Committee on Justice and Home Affairs, both parties have signed the partnership and co-operative agreement. Detailed negotiations highlighted the areas where Russian patent and other intellectual property rights are inadequate and have led to a common action plan on IPR. Assistance is provided on the preparation of new legislation which will be compliant with international norms, such as the WTO TRIPS Agreement. Technical assistance funds have also been provided. As a result of negotiations, enforcement procedures will be within the new intellectual property legislation. This will lead to more effective enforcement procedures. Russia has already introduced amendments to strengthen sanctions imposed in respect of trademark violations. Improved enforcement provisions for other areas of intellectual property rights, including patents, will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/5">Spain has provided technical assistance in the form of documentation relating to trademarks and brands, industrial design and patents. Germany has hosted a study visit from the Russian Federation to gain an insight into the structure and practices of the German Patent Office. Advice and information were supplied on e-commerce, patent fees and training of staff. A separate visit by judges from the Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian Federation visited the Federal Patent Court in Munich, the German Patent and Trademark Office and the Patent Lawyer's Association to exchange experiences within the field of protection of industrial property. Germany also has an agreement with the Russian Federation regarding the exchange of literature and patent search and examination results.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.0/1">The Government maintain a close interest in the safety of Soviet-designed nuclear power plants, both as a signatory to the IAEA Nuclear Safety Convention and through their membership of the G7 Nuclear Safety Working Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/2">The Chernobyl nuclear power plant incident occurred as a result of the operation of the plant in an unauthorised and hazardous manner. Since that time all Soviet-designed, first generation reactors have been subject to substantial safety upgrades for which the UK has provided funding either bilaterally or through multilateral programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/3">In general most later generation Soviet-designed nuclear power plants now approach or meet western standards of safety.

	<p pid="a.248.0/4">Although the chance of a repeat of a Chernobyl type incident is considered remote, the Government, with G7 partners and the EU, continue to press Russia for the earliest possible closure and decommissioning of their first generation reactors. Closure of such plants is also being made a condition for the EU accession of Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia. The EU is leading negotiations with Armenia, with a view to the closure of their one nuclear power plant. All nuclear power plants of concern within the Ukraine are now closed, with the final reactor on the Chernobyl site being taken out of service in December 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.3/1">The European Union does not have rules regarding the degree of dependence, whether in percentage or any other terms, of any EU member state on energy resources from a single country source. From this it follows that candidate countries for EU membership will not be restricted in the extent to which they import their energy supplies from Russia or from any other producer country. However, under a policy administered by the Euratom Supply Agency, the EU's nuclear utilities are expected to contract with Russia for no more than some 20 per cent of their natural uranium and enrichment requirements. The aim is to ensure a diversification of sources of supply so that the EU does not become over-dependent on any single source of supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.3/2">Nevertheless, under Euratom treaty provisions, agreements or contracts for the supply of nuclear fuel to candidate countries in existence at the time of accession will not be prevented from being implemented provided that they are communicated to the European Commission. The European Commission has made known its intention to submit a Communication to the Council incorporating a mandate for negotiating an agreement with Russia on trade in nuclear materials. We understand that one of the factors under consideration will be the position of the candidate countries as a number of them are believed to be fixed to uranium supply contracts with Russia that exceed the EU's existing limits.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.2/1">Issues regarding water are for my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who will provide a separate answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/2">Regulations on the resale of gas and electricity are matters for the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). In January this year Ofgem introduced revised maximum resale price rules for the resale of gas and electricity, to take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase>. The changes were implemented after extensive consultation. The new arrangements provide important protection to those being resold gas and electricity, in that the resale has to be made at the same price as that paid to the supplier. These rules provide protection for users in a variety of different types of accommodation, including domestic tenants and those using holiday apartments, caravans and chalets. If the occupants of boats, including houseboats, are using electricity and gas for similar purposes in these other forms of accommodation, they will enjoy the same protection. In order to demonstrate compliance with the rules, resellers including marina operators will be required, on request, to explain to their customers how their charges have been calculated. The new arrangements do not contain specific requirements on the metering arrangements which resellers can use. Ofgem has no powers to inspect compliance with the maximum resale price rules nor to enforce them. If a customer believes that they have been overcharged, and the issue cannot be resolved by negotiation, recovery of the overcharge may be pursued through the civil courts. The courts may require the resellers to provide information regarding the calculation of their charges.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.5/2">The department's quality assurance procedures are being revised to prevent similar errors in future. Meanwhile, work is in hand to re-issue corrected tables. This is a significant task involving the re-loading of central data bases which are subject to a number of timetable constraints. The intention is to provide revised figures by the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.0/1">The Government condemn the recent threats to hospital staff and attacks on members of the emergency services, who provide a vital service to all the people of Northern Ireland. Those who engage in these sectarian attacks need to be reminded that some day they or their families may be in a situation where they require the help of the emergency services. The police are doing all they can to prevent these types of attacks and to apprehend those responsible.</p>
