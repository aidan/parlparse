	<p pid="a.409.5/1">The increase in the BBC licence fee between 2007-08 and 2012-13 allowed for a total of &pound;603 million to be ring-fenced to fund the digital switchover help scheme. It looks increasingly likely that the full amount will not be required, but it is too early to make an accurate assessment of the amount of any underspend. So far less than 0.5 per cent of the population has had its analogue signal switched off and we do not expect to have a reliable estimate of any underspend until the end of this year, by which time around 20 per cent of the UK population will have been switched.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.5/2">Even then many factors could affect the final outturn figure, such as changes in take-up rate, the cost of the equipment offered under the help scheme, or the level of the eligible person's financial contribution. The DCMS would want to discuss the position with the BBC Trust before reaching a decision on how any underspend is dealt with.</p>

	<p pid="a.411.2/3">These figures do not distinguish between spend for projects, infrastructure and maintenance.

	<p pid="a.412.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has entered into three long-term information-technology service contracts valued at &pound;50 million or more. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.412.2/2">The FCO Telecommunications Network (FTN) is a 10-year contract, provided by Global Crossing. At the time of signature in 2000 the estimated value of the services to be provided over 10 years was &pound;180 million. This contract covers the various services required to run the network, including flexibility to meet changing needs over the length of the contract. The FCO's demand for connectivity has increased greatly during the contract period to take advantage of efficiencies from new technology. The current estimate of the value of the services that will have been delivered by 2010 is &pound;252 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.2/3">Prism. This contract with Capgemini was signed in January 2002 to deliver and operate the FCO's resource planning system used mainly for finance, human resource and procurement activities. The implementation phase was completed in May 2006, two months later than planned. The contract originally expired in 2009 but an option to extend until January 2010 was exercised, to maximise the return on the investment. The original value of the contract was &pound;53.8 million. The current estimate of the cost is &pound;63.2 million. Reasons for the increase include retail price index increases included in the terms of the contract and the extension in duration. In addition, the FCO has used flexibility within the contract to deliver solutions to new requirements at a current cost of &pound;25.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.2/4">A contract with Hewlett Packard (HP) to deliver and operate a replacement to the FCO's desktop infrastructure was signed in February 2005 and expires in 2012. The current value is &pound;216.8 million, an increase from &pound;189.5 million when the contract was signed. The increase is associated with the need to meet new central government security requirements as described in the Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June 2008</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-06-19.1101"><I>Official Report</I>, cols. 1101-02W</phrase>). The contract with HP is managed within a wider FCO IT programme, Future Firecrest. The increase in costs of the HP contract has been met by savings elsewhere in the programme, which has an overall estimated cost of &pound;401 million and is due to finish at the same time as the Hewlett Packard contract.</p>
