	<p pid="a.151.1/2" qnum="HL2420">When the results of the Secondary Schools Curriculum and Staffing Survey will be published.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-04-04a.151.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="151"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030404/text/30404w01.htm#30404w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.151.2/1">In November 2002, my department conducted a Secondary Schools Curriculum and Staffing Survey. The last was held in November 1996. This survey is a periodic voluntary sample survey of maintained secondary schools in England intended to provide data on the breadth of curriculum offered by schools to different year groups, and the post-A level qualifications held by teachers at these schools and how these relate to the subjects that they teach. I informed noble Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-07">7 February 2002</phrase> (col. 733) that it was our intention to publish the results of the survey during the first half of 2003. Accordingly, provisional results from this survey have been scheduled for publication as national statistics on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-16">16 April 2003</phrase>, with final results due to be published in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/2">Over 800 schools were invited to take part in the survey and, to date, 174 positive responses have been received. Professional advice from officials of the Government Statistical Service is that, while this response provides sufficient data to allow representative results on curriculum coverage to be obtained, there are insufficient data to allow representative results on teachers' qualifications to be obtained at this point. This advice has been given to me in accordance with the national statistics code of practice, which also means that no results from any part of the survey have yet been disclosed to Ministers or policy officials of my department.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/3">Despite the survey form being designed to impose minimum burdens on participating schools, the response rate has been lower than anticipated. This is due to the voluntary nature of the survey. Government statisticians have made intensive efforts to support and encourage respondents and these efforts are meeting with some success. The department will continue to make these efforts and to take all possible action to increase positive responses from schools in order to yield sufficient data on teachers' qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/4">In view of these facts, I am advised that provisional results on curriculum coverage only will be included in the publication scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-16">16 April 2003</phrase>. It is now my department's intention to include results on teachers' qualifications in the release of final data scheduled for September 2003, when sufficient data have been secured.</p>

These figures include increases of 25 per cent in the number of applicants to train in mathematics; 12 per cent to train in science; 3 per cent to train in modern languages; 10 per cent to train in English; and 40 per cent to train in technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/2">Recruitment to courses of initial teacher training fell for eight successive years from 1992&ndash;93.

Applications for training in 2003&ndash;04 will continue to be processed until the autumn, and final recruitment figures are expected to be published in November.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.5/1">As part of the spending review 2002, the Government announced that they would be making available an additional &pound;975 million for the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 as part of their strategy to revitalise England's poorest neighbourhoods and create places where people want to live, not leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.5/2">We have already provided &pound;900 million of NRF to the 88 most deprived local authority areas for the period 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04. Already, good progress has been made by local authorities in collaboration with local strategic partnerships in using NRF to help address some of the most serious problems in our most deprived neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.5/3">However, more needs to be done, particularly to support better tailoring and targeting of mainstream services to make sure that they are reaching the people and places which need them most. To achieve this, we are committed to ensuring that these areas continue to receive both the resources and other forms of support needed to tackle postcode poverty and create thriving, sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.5/4">That is why we are announcing today that we intend to use most of these additional NRF resources to continue funding the current 88 eligible local authority areas in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 at the 2003&ndash;04 level. This will mean an additional &pound;800 million over the two-year period. We will confirm detailed figures of the allocations to individual local authorities shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.5/5">Engaging the community in the process of neighbourhood renewal is central to the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal. We are therefore also announcing today that we intend to provide an additional &pound;86 million over the same period to support community participation programmes in the current 88 eligible areas for NRF.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.5/6">There remains &pound;175 million of additional NRF resources still to be allocated. I will inform the House shortly on how we intend to distribute these.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.2/1">The human diploid cell line (called MRC-5) used in the production of some vaccines (rubella, rabies, hepatitis A and some polio vaccines) was derived from one sample of foetal lung tissue obtained following a termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons in 1966. No further foetal tissue has been obtained. There is no commercial arrangement between the National Health Service and pharmaceutical companies to facilitate the availability of this cell line. The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control maintains a limited stock of the MRC-5 cell line and over the past 20 years has distributed small samples of this stock free of charge to pharmaceutical companies for the production of vaccines. The companies have then used these as &quot;seeds&quot; to develop their own stocks of MRC-5 cells for full-scale vaccine production.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.5/1">The United Kingdom (UKPS) Passport Service records information on passports reported lost, stolen or unavailable. In collating these figures no distinction is made between these categories. The information UKPS has recorded for the past five years is shown below:</p>
	<p pid="a.155.5/2">1998 31,497</p>
	<p pid="a.155.5/3">1999 62,364</p>

	<p pid="a.155.5/6">2002 166,358</p>
	<p pid="a.155.5/7">UKPS is introducing a comprehensive system for recording and disseminating information on lost, stolen and recovered passports. This system is due to go live in December of this year. It will enable the timely and accurate collection and dissemination of information on lost, stolen and recovered passports in the United Kingdom and in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) posts abroad. This information will improve our fraud prevention and detection capability and improve aspects of our customer service. The information held on this system will also be made available to the United Kingdom Immigration Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.2/1">The United Kingdom Passport Service does not routinely receive notification of deaths from the Registrar General. The United Kingdom Passport Service has been seeking to establish arrangements to receive routine notification of deaths from government departments which hold such data. Discussions on this matter are on-going.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/2">It is estimated that there are 47 million valid British passports, equivalent to 80 per cent of the population. Every passport contains a reminder that it should be returned for cancellation on the death of the holder. The United Kingdom Passport Service has not routinely collated figures relating to the number of passports returned for cancellation on the death of the holder. Figures for passports cancelled in such circumstances are not therefore available for each of the past five years. However, figures are available for the period October 2000 to November 2001 and for the 2002 calendar year. These figures are shown below:</p>

	<p pid="a.156.5/1">The requested information is not available centrally. For the year ending March 2002, for Humberside, and England and Wales, the percentage ratios between the number of crimes for which there were cautions and convictions, and the number of recorded crimes, were 14.3 per cent and 16.9 per cent respectively. Cautions and convictions represent only part of the overall number of recorded crimes brought to justice, which include offences taken into consideration by the court. Cautions and convictions in one year may be for offences recorded in earlier years.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/2">In Scotland in the calendar year 2001, there were 421,093 recorded crimes, and 41,665 offenders against whom charges were proved. As the former figure relates to offences, and the latter to offenders, they cannot be directly compared to each other. Owing to the different legal systems, they also cannot be compared to figures for England and Wales; for example, there are no figures directly equivalent to cautions in Scotland.</p>

Police forces have also been asked to provide the Home Office with detailed information about what is handed in. This will be shared with the FSS and the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). Weapons of most interest to the FSS and NCIS will also be transferred to a single, central location in each police force area.</p>
