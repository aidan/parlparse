	<p pid="a.149.5/1">Planning Circular 11/95 provides guidance on the use of conditions in planning permission. The circular advises that conditions attached to planning permissions should be necessary, relevant to planning, relevant to the development permitted, enforceable, precise and reasonable in all other respects. A condition requiring that an agreement under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 must be entered into is unlikely to meet the tests set out in the circular because the terms of the agreement will not be known at the time permission is granted. The policy relating to planning conditions reflects current case law and helps to ensure fairness and transparency for those involved in the planning process. We have no proposals to change this policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">The number of infantry recruits who have been given a training commencement date longer than two months from their date of attestation in 2004 is 467. Of these, some would have requested a delay before starting training due to personal commitments such as jobs, education and holidays. It should be noted that there is a two-month gap between intakes to Parachute Regiment courses due to their popularity, which results in recruits to the Parachute Regiment automatically having a two-month delay before entering training. If Parachute Regiment figures are excluded, the number of infantry recruits who have a training commencement date in excess of two months is reduced to 352.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/2">Until all current candidates have successfully completed their selection process at recruit selection centres (RSC), it is impossible to say how many will not begin their basic training for over two months. Once a potential recruit has successfully passed RSC, they will be allocated on to the first available phase 1 course that is being run for their chosen career employment group and the time involved may of course vary considerably.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.5/1">London did not score badly for government support. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded London a range of 8&ndash;9 out of 10 for the technical criterion &quot;Government Support&quot;, the same as all other applicant cities. In addition to this assessment of the level of support, the overall score for the category included a multiplier for feasibility. London and New York had a lower multiplier for feasibility than Paris and Madrid, of 0.8 compared to 0.9. In the terms of the IOC evaluation report 0.8 is rated as &quot;high probability&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/2">The report of the IOC does not offer any explicit explanation why London and New York were given slightly lower feasibility ratings. However, as part of the information used to score this category, candidate cities were asked to provide information about the frequency of elections before 2005. London was alone in possibly facing two sets of elections that could affect government support for the bid&mdash;both mayoral and a potential general election. New York has presidential, congressional and state legislative elections in the bidding period. Paris will have no elections that would significantly affect government or city support, and Madrid had a general election (in March) and will not hold a city or regional ballot before July 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/3">As part of their response to the Working Group Report the bid company is in discussions with the IOC to establish the underlying reasons for both this marking and the other areas of the file where London scored lower than other cities.</p>
