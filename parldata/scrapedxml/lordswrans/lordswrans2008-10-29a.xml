	<p pid="a.165.5/1">The normal operating cycle of every warship includes periods of lower readiness, typically for maintenance or refit. It is not our practice to comment on matters relating to specific readiness levels of individual ships, as to do so could enable deductions to be made that could be prejudicial to national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/2">The only relevant instance of withdrawing ships from service without one-for-one replacements has arisen from the decision not to purchase further Type 45 destroyers beyond the six already on order. Hence eight Type 42 destroyers will be replaced by six Type 45s. However, the decision not to purchase the seventh and eighth Type 45s will not achieve any savings in production costs in 2008-09 or 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.2/1">There are many different ways of securing communications between government departments and citizens. The appropriate method is adopted to suit the needs of the particular business. Such security and authentication regimes include measures such as: traditional cryptography, transport layer security, and X.509 server certificates as well as digital certificates. Many of the secure links between government departments use traditional cryptography which does not use certificates.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">Where personal or sensitive information is exchanged electronically with a member of the public, this is usually secured through the use of the industry standard transport layer security (TSL) and an X.509 server certificate rather than using a HMG root certificate.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3">Central government departments with internet websites using personal or other sensitive information are required to implement appropriate protective measures. Normally, this would include the use of the industry standard transport layer security (TSL) one component of which would be an X.509 server certificate. In exceptional cases client certificates are also used.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/4">Some public key certificates issued by the Government can be expected to be held overseas. For example, certificates relating to verifications of passports need to be held overseas in order to check the authenticity of UK passports.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/5">Certificates issued to departments or their agencies contain no reference to individuals or their personal information. There is no requirement for these certificates to be treated confidentially.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/6">Some certificates are issued to individuals and could contain personal information. In such instances, the handling of these certificates would need to comply with the relevant data protection principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/7">Data stored in the UK and overseas must adhere to data protection legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.8/1">The issue of surface access to Stansted Airport was addressed in some detail in the planning inquiry which informed the Government's decision to grant permission for an increase in the number of flights and passengers there. The planning inspector considered matters such as the ability of the road network to accommodate the increased traffic that would arise from the expansion of the airport, and the adequacy and capacity of rail and coach access to the airport. In the light of his recommendations, the Government have attached a number of surface access-related obligations and conditions to the planning permission, the details of which are set out in the decision letter of <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October</phrase>. Copies of the decision letter and the planning inspector's report are available in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/2">As Lord Bassam of Brighton informed the House in a Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-03">3 March 2008</phrase> (col. <I>WS 92</I>), the department is currently undertaking further work on the long-term road and rail capacity improvements that might be needed to take account of forecast population and employment growth in the East of England region as well as the potential expansion of Stansted Airport. We aim to report progress on this matter shortly.</p>

High percentage increases, such as 14.3 per cent and 33.3 per cent, are the result of raising low fees by full pounds. Individual fees which have had such high percentage rises in one fee round are less likely to rise in the next review.</p>

From the available vehicle registration statistics the Department for Transport estimates that around 100,000 vehicles will not be required to comply because they were registered prior to January 2000. None the less, we understand that some of these vehicles are already equipped with mirrors that will comply with the new requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.8/1">Regulation 683/2008 on the further implementation of the European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo) entered into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-24">24 July 2008</phrase>. It provides a financial and legal basis for Galileo, which will offer better availability and accuracy than the current generation of GPS. The regulation also provides for the operation of EGNOS, which is designed to enhance and assure the accuracy of GPS signals. It is expected that all users of satellite navigation devices, including drivers of heavy goods vehicles, will see significant benefit from the programmes once complete. However, the availability of specialist software for HGV routing is key and will be a matter for the commercial market to deliver.</p>
