General guidance on the purchasing of treatment and the use of medical teams from overseas is available to all NHS trusts and to potential providers via the Department of Health's website. PCTs and lead commissioners are encouraged to consider proposals from all interested providers explaining to them what is required to meet their specifications.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/1">In this financial year (2002&ndash;03), to ensure both increased availability and also higher quality drug treatment services, the Government made available &pound;195.7 million for the pooled drug treatment budget. This meant that all health authorities received an increase of at least 30 per cent on the previous year's drug treatment allocation. In 2003&ndash;04 primary care trusts, who will be acting as bankers for the pooled drug treatment budget will receive a further average increase of 23 per cent. The Government in April 2001 established the National Treatment Agency (NTA), with the remit of increasing the effectiveness and availability of drug treatment. The NTA recognises the importance of both increasing the numbers and the skills of those working within the drug treatment sector and that is why it has identified workforce issues as one of their priority work areas. Latest reports from drug action team (DAT) treatment plans suggest that the workforce is currently growing ahead of target. The treatment plan envisages growth of 350 posts between 2002&ndash;03 and 450 between 2003&ndash;04. DATs are currently reporting growth of 1,088 posts 2002&ndash;03 and are projecting a further 680 between 2003&ndash;04. The majority of the funding for alcohol treatment is spent via the general budgets of primary care trusts and local social services departments, which is consistent with provision being determined following a local consideration of need. This method of funding means that it is not possible to give details of current or planned future spending on alcohol treatment, but latest estimates indicate that around &pound;95 million is spent each year on treatment in England, and that most of this funding is provided by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.2/1">The Government will continue to take positive action to encourage pregnant women to stop smoking. A health education campaign specifically designed to reach pregnant women and their partners is supported by the NHS Pregnancy Smoking Helpline. Operated on behalf of the Department of Health by the charity QUIT, the helpline not only offers confidential advice but offers callbacks to women to support them through their pregnancy. In 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 a total of &pound;6 million was allocated to fund the appointment of champions of services for pregnant smokers. An additional strand of this campaign involves publicity aimed at the partners of pregnant women to encourage their support. The Priorities and Planning Framework published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-02">2 October 2002</phrase> includes a key inequalities target for the reduction by one percentage point a year through the period 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 in the proportion of women continuing to smoke throughout pregnancy.</p>

The Department of Health funded the publication Assessing health needs of people from minority ethnic groups (Royal College of Physicians and Faculty of Public Health Medicine, 1998) which has a chapter on sexual and reproductive health. This highlights that cultural and religious traditions have a bearing on the decisions women make regarding contraception and abortion. The Department of Health also recently published a sexual health and HIV commissioning toolkit which states that all sexual health services and support should be offered in non-judgmental, respectful and sensitive ways.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.6/1">We had hoped to deliver the results of the risk assessment on illegal meat imports in the autumn. However, it is an innovative piece of work. The project is a complex task that has required the gathering and modelling of a vast quantity of information, which has taken longer than anticipated to complete. The report is therefore currently undergoing final quality assurance and peer review, prior to publication in the next few weeks. The European Community rules on the personal importation of meat and meat products do extend to the diplomatic community. As the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Optional Protocols of <phrase class="date" code="1961-04-18">18 April 1961</phrase> states: &quot;Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state.&quot; We are working towards the preparation of a revised and updated action plan for 2003&ndash;04. It will take account of progress to date, lessons learned, improved intelligence, the results of our risk assessment, and the changes in responsibilities for detection and deterrence.

	<p pid="a.42.3/1">Where there is reason to suspect that a driver's defective eyesight may have been a contributory factor to a road collision resulting in injuries, the police would normally request the driver to undergo an eyetest. While the police in England and Wales are required to record extensive incident data relating to road collisions resulting in injuries, the requirements do not cover eyesight tests conducted at such incidents. The information requested is therefore not available centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.0/1">I am aware of no such current proposals. However, I believe that the European Commission is considering a third directive on driver licensing with a view to publishing proposals this summer. Although neither I nor my officials have seen these proposals, I understand that they are unlikely to include provisions on eyesight standards as such, or to include proposals likely to affect the majority of drivers. As soon as any such proposals are published by the Commission, I shall ensure that full consultation is undertaken to elicit views in the UK. It is also within the competence of the European Commission to adapt the eyesight standards for driver licensing to scientific and technical progress without recourse to a Council directive. The Commission is setting up a working group to review the eyesight standards. The UK will be strongly represented on that group, with a view to encouraging a helpful consensus on good practice taking account of opinion in the UK, including the results of current research sponsored by my department.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">The current eyesight standards are based on the requirements of the EC Directive on Driving Licences (91/439/EEC). These standards are applied on the recommendation of the expert opinion of the Honorary Medical Advisory Panel on Driving and Visual Disorders (which is made up of highly qualified eye specialists nominated by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists). There are no official statistics available on road traffic accidents that include the numbers of accidents which are attributable to specific health conditions.

	<p pid="a.43.6/1">It is the Government's policy generally to use quieter surfacing when resurfacing trunk roads in England. The type of quieter surfacing used is an operational matter and I have asked the chief executive of the Highways Agency, Mr Tim Matthews, to write to the noble Lord. Letter to Lord Lloyd-Webber from David York, operations director Highways Agency. Tim Matthews has been asked by Lord Macdonald to reply to your recent question asking whether there are plans to extend the use of the road surface employed on the Newbury bypass when resurfacing major roads in the future. I am replying since Tim is currently away on leave. The surfacing on Newbury bypass is porous asphalt, which was developed to be quieter and cause less spray than conventional surfacings. Proprietary quieter surfacings have now been developed, often referred to as thin surfacings, which have advantages over porous asphalt and it is these we now use as a matter of course for all our maintenance and new schemes. They reduce noise to a similar extent as porous asphalt, but cost less and have a longer life. They are also easier to maintain, use less premium surfacing aggregate and are therefore more sustainable. Their ability to reduce spray is more limited and does depend on the particular product in use but in studies comparing porous asphalt and conventional surfacings, accident rates have been found to be similar. This is because whilst spray does cause drivers concern it also encourages them to drive more cautiously in wet weather, when the skid resistance is reduced. If it would be helpful, John Williams, in our pavement engineering team, would be pleased to discuss the quieter surfacings in current use on the trunk road network with you. His telephone number is 01234 796116.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.3/1">A review of the Blue Badge Scheme has recently been concluded in which all aspects of the scheme were considered. Following initial discussions with the main stakeholders, a discussion paper was drawn up and comments were invited through a major public consultation exercise. Formal representations were made by a variety of disability groups, local authorities and individuals and their views were given due consideration during the review process. The Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC, the department's statutory advisers on the transport needs of disabled people) was asked to look at the responses received and to submit its recommendations to Ministers. David Jamieson announced in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-18">18 December 2002</phrase> that the Government would be taking forward the majority of these recommendations as soon as possible. The recommendations address a number of issues, including the eligibility criteria and the enforcement of the scheme. The main emphasis is to ensure that the scheme is available to those with the greatest mobility needs and that measures are introduced to prevent the scheme from being abused. A summary of the recommendations was placed in the House Libraries and accompanied the announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-18">18 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
