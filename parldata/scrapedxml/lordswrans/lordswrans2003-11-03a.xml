	<p pid="a.69.2/1">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime released its survey results for the 2003 opium poppy crop in Afghanistan on <phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase>. The survey showed that opium poppy cultivation increased by 8 per cent from 74,000 hectares in 2002 to 80,000 hectares in 2003 while production rose by 6 per cent from 3,400 tonnes in 2002 to 3,600 tonnes in 2003. The UN survey also revealed that cultivation in traditional areas&mdash;where the Afghan Government have been able to exert control&mdash;decreased and moved into more marginal areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">The UK use the UN survey, which is produced in partnership with the Afghan Government, as a reference point for its work as the lead nation on counter-narcotics support in Afghanistan. While the increase in opium cultivation and production is unwelcome, it is not unexpected. Experience of counter-narcotic policies in other countries, such as Pakistan and Thailand, shows that cultivation tends to increase before declining. Production also tends to move from traditional areas to more marginal and inaccessible areas to protect crops against law enforcement activity. Reductions in the traditional areas demonstrates that drug control policy has been effective where the Afghan Government have been able to exert control. Increasing security and stability in Afghanistan remains key to progress in reducing opium production.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">Afghanistan's national drug control strategy, agreed earlier this year, has set the target of eliminating opium poppy by 2013. The UK is investing &pound;70 million on sustainable measures over the next three years to support implementation of that strategy; additional staff are being deployed to Kabul to assist in the implementation. Other nations are also contributing, either directly or indirectly, to counter-narcotics work in Afghanistan, complementing the UK's efforts. I will be co-hosting, with President Karzai and the United Nations, an international conference in Kabul in February next year to boost further the international counter-narcotics effort in Afghanistan.</p>

	Zimbabwe: Removal of Failed Asylum Seekers

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/2" qnum="HL4798">What was the change in the circumstances in Zimbabwe, from the period to mid-April 2003 when the phrase used in letters to asylum seekers and their representatives was that the Secretary of State was &quot;not satisfied, on the information currently available, that unsuccessful asylum seekers can safely be returned to Zimbabwe&quot;, to the period since then when, in the case of Dowu before the Court of Appeal on 16 April 2003, Home Office representative Miss Susan Rogers said that &quot;the suspension [of returns of failed asylum seekers] is based on political rather than legal grounds. It is not in place because it is considered unsafe for failed asylum seekers to return to Zimbabwe&quot;; and what these political grounds are</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-03a.71.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="71"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031103/text/31103w02.htm#31103w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.71.0/1">The suspension of removals of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe announced in January 2002 was in response to concerns about the serious deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe in the build up to the presidential election held in March that year. We did not regard it as unsafe to return failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, but in view of the rapidly changing conditions we considered that it would be appropriate not to enforce returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">The Government's position is, as it has been since January 2002, that each asylum (and human rights) claim made by a Zimbabwean national will be considered on its individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information including that obtained from and through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/3">I accept that the letters you refer to were poorly worded and that the phrase quoted was not an accurate reflection of the situation from January 2002 onwards. We took steps to rectify the wording in June 2002. The <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-16">16 April 2003</phrase> statement was an accurate statement of the situation existing not only at the time it was made but also for the period since January 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/4">We do of course recognise that conditions in Zimbabwe are such that there are individuals who are able to demonstrate a need for international protection. Where they meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 Convention, asylum is granted. There may also be individuals whose circumstances make them particularly vulnerable and who would engage our obligations under the ECHR. Where this is the case these individuals will be granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/5">In the first six months of this year, we have granted asylum to 615 Zimbabweans and granted other forms of protection to over 20 others. These statistics show that we are giving protection to the significant number of people who are found to be in need of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/6">If an applicaion is refused, there will be a right of appeal to the independent appellate authorities against that decision. Should a claim be refused and any appeal be unsuccessful that means that, for that individual, return to Zimbabwe would be safe. That is why we consider it reasonable to expect an individual in that position to leave voluntarily.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/7">Although it would be safe to return failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, our view at present is that in the wider context of the Government's position on Zimbabwe, it would be inappropriate forcibly to return them at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/8">The policy remains under continuous review.</p>

The Government's Gulf veterans' illnesses research programme is guided by expert advice from the independent Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC has conducted a review of all UK Gulf veterans' illnesses research, and published a report in May 2003 which is available on the Internet at: <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index/publications/publications-researchreviews/public-gulfveteransresearch.htm">http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index/publications/publications-researchreviews/public-gulfveterans research.htm</a>.

	<p pid="a.76.5/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment Relations, Competition and Consumers (Gerry Sutcliffe, Member for Bradford South) represented the UK at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-20">20 October 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/2">The Council held a public debate on the Commission Communication on Immigration, Integration and Employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/3">The UK stated that immigration alone would not solve Europe's demographic problem and that the employment strategy provided the appropriate framework for improving the participation of immigrants in the labour market. Several delegations argued that member states should meet their demand for additional labour from national and European sources before seeking immigrants from outside the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/4">On integrating immigrants, the UK stressed the need to provide language, skills and citizenship training for recent and next generation immigrants to prevent social exclusion and burdens on the public purse and argued that a job was the best means of social integration.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/5">The Council adopted conclusions on the open method of co-ordination of adequate and sustainable pensions. There will be a progress report to the Council on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> about pensions indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/6">The Council reached political agreement on a directive protecting workers from the risks of exposure to electromagnetic fields and waves, as well as on the decision to renew the spending programme to prevent and combat violence against women, young people and children (Daphne II). The UK supported both decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/7">The Council agreed an orientation towards political agreement on Chapters 7 and 8 of Regulation 1408/71 on social security co-ordination. The chapters cover pre-retirement benefits and family benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/10">The Council adopted without discussion a resolution on transforming undeclared work into regular employment in the context of the European employment strategy, and a resolution encouraging member states to consider the provisions of various services for victims of trafficking.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.3/1">The figures quoted are from the Bath report (Vol 1, table 3.6 page 30) published by the Inland Revenue in November 1998. They reflect the cost to the employer of complying with the PAYE and national insurance responsibilities as they stood in 1995&ndash;96 when the research was undertaken. A more up-to-date numerical measure is not available, although the 2001 Review of Payroll Services by Patrick Carter gives a more recent qualitative view.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.3/2">The Inland Revenue has pursued a number of initiatives to address the fact that the costs of tax compliance for small firms are disproportionately higher than those for large firms. Many of the specific recommendations in the two reports cited have been implemented or are under development. In addition the Inland Revenue now has a target to reduce the compliance costs of small businesses. Work is currently in hand on a range of measures including implementation of the electronic approach recommended by the Carter review. From 2004&ndash;05 businesses with fewer than 50 employees will receive financial incentives to help them to switch to new technology and realise benefits for their business. For the past two years small employers have benefited from a twice-yearly CD-ROM issued by the Inland Revenue. This gives ready access to the key information which the employer previously had to access in sizeable paper information packs. Small employers have commented that this cuts the cost both of accessing the information and of correcting unnecessary errors.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.2/1">The most effective way to address the issue of smoking in close proximity to children is through public health education. Government media advertising will continue to draw attention to the dangers of second-hand smoke, particularly around children. In addition, cigarette packs now carry a range of new warnings, including &quot;Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke&quot;. Health visitors and other health professionals will address the dangers of smoking around children in their work with families. The Government will continue to keep this issue under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.2/1">The increase in the amount of student loan in the first three years after the introduction of variable fees will depend on the following factors: the numbers of students entering higher education institutions (HEIs) in those three years; the level of fees charged by each HEI; and the proportion of students who choose to take out loans to cover the cost of their fees, and the value of such loans.</p>
