	<p pid="b.1.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/2" qnum="HL499">Whether, in light of the bovine tuberculosis and bluetongue outbreaks, there is any research data which relate to the possibility (a) that in-breeding has lowered the resistance of farm stock, particularly dairy cattle; (b) that particular breeds of either cattle or sheep have a greater resistance than others to either of these diseases; or (c) that less intensive farming, for example organic, reduces incidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.2/1">With regards to bovine tuberculosis, there is anecdotal evidence that some breeds of cattle, for example Zebu in Africa, are more resistant to infection by mycobacterium bovis than other breeds. Research is under way in Great Britain (funded by the Welsh Assembly Government) and the Republic of Ireland to determine whether there is any evidence of inherited traits for increased resistance or susceptibility to the disease in cattle. In addition, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council is funding research into the &quot;interplay between host and pathogen genetic factors in the increasing incidence of bovine TB&quot;, which should provide fundamental information on host genetic factors that influence TB susceptibility in cattle.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/2">As far as farming practices are concerned, data collected as part of the epidemiological survey overseen by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) did not indicate that organic status was associated either with an increased or decreased risk of a TB breakdown. The findings of the survey into farm-level risk factors have been published in the ISG's final report which is available on the Defra website and in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/3">With regard to the recent bluetongue outbreak, given the limited number of premises and animals infected, it is not possible to evaluate the factors which may influence resistance or incidence of infection at this stage. Surveillance and epidemiological investigation are ongoing.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.5/1">The highest possible level of accuracy in published apprenticeship completion rates is ensured by a combination of quality-assurance arrangements. Completion rates are based on individual learner data submitted in a standard format by Learning and Skills Council (LSC)-funded apprenticeship providers. Providers' internal quality processes alongside qualification-awarding bodies' verification processes ensure that learner assessments are robust and accurate. In addition, LSC audits monitor the public funding claimed by each learning provider that delivers apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="b.2.5/3">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent Question asking whether the European Union has the powers to carry out a compulsory census of all people residing in the European Union; what would be the purpose of such a census; whether any consideration has been given to the questions that might be included in any such census; and whether such a proposal would have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament. (HL621).</p>
	<p pid="b.2.5/4">No, the European Union has no powers to carry out a compulsory census of all residents in the European Union. The European Parliament is currently considering a Council regulation relating to the provision to the Commission of harmonised statistics by member states. Such statistics are to be derived from nationally conducted censuses of population and housing, or from alternative sources of data such as sample surveys or registers of administrative records. All such data will be subject to appropriate statistical disclosure control measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.5/5">The Commission needs to be in possession of sufficiently reliable and comparable data on population and housing in order to fulfil the tasks assigned to it, notably by Articles 2 and 3 of the treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.5/6">Such statistics as are provided for by the Council regulation will relate only to those topics designated as &quot;core&quot; in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's <I>Recommendations for the 2010 Censuses of Population and Housing</I>, and which have been endorsed by the Conference of European Statisticians. The Office for National Statistics played a prominent role in the preparation of these recommendations. The content of, and mode of access to, the statistics will be prescribed by a subsequent European Commission regulation in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.5/7">Neither the EU Council regulation nor the Commission regulation will require the approval of either House, but are subject to examination by Parliament through the European Scrutiny Committee. However, the content of the relevant 2011 census for England and Wales will be subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.6/1">Private and voluntary sector providers will be paid by results. They will receive a payment when a person starts work and a further payment if that work is sustained. They will therefore be encouraged to work equally with ex-prisoners, as with all other people on incapacity benefits. Pathways support is tailored to the needs of the individual and the specialist adviser would consider all aspects of the customer's recent history.</p>

	<p pid="b.6.0/1">In the UK and internationally, there has been a significant number of commercial and government-funded independent assessments of the field-to-tank carbon impacts of biofuels. The results are published and freely available.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/2">Recent studies have indicated typical savings in carbon emissions of 20 to 80 per cent for biofuels derived from both UK-produced and imported feed stocks. The range is very wide as the carbon savings achieved depend on many assumptions and on the particular supply and production chains studied. The treatment of co-products has a major impact, as do assumptions on how the land would otherwise have been used.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/3">With the introduction of the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation in April 2008, the Government will require companies supplying transport fuels to report on the carbon intensity of the biofuels they are sourcing. A detailed methodology for assessing this has been developed, and the Government were consulted on this approach in June 2007. Copies of the consultation paper were placed in the House Libraries and are available on the Department for Transport website.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/4">The Government are working with other member states and the Commission towards a harmonised EU-approach to this issue.

A cod TAC increase of 11 was secured. This is a significant step in helping fisheries managers to reduce discarding of the stock. It is also consistent with the EU cod recovery plan and International Council for the Exploration of the Sea scientific advice which indicates that the status of the stock is improving, through the recruitment of the 2005 year class. The UK, and other member states, are also committed to reducing discards in fisheries which catch cod.

Russia is also subject to the scrutiny of the Committee of Ministers in which the UK plays an active role. Furthermore, judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in certain cases brought by Russian citizens against the Russian Federation, have highlighted areas where the level of protection of human rights in Russia is inconsistent with Russia's Council of Europe obligations. The Committee of Ministers supervises the execution of these judgments.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.5/3">In the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the EU and UK have repeatedly called on Russia to adhere to its OSCE commitments, and expressed concern in areas such as media freedom, freedom of association and electoral conduct, where failings have been apparent. Most recently, my honourable friend the Minister for Europe, Jim Murphy, attending the OSCE Ministerial Council in Madrid on 29 and <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>, said, &quot;We regret that the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights has recently faced a number of unprecedented restrictions and bureaucratic obstacles to observing the Russian Duma elections&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.2/11">Young people who are NEET have a very mixed range of characteristics. Not all are unemployed&mdash;they may be taking a gap year, caring for family, or simply be between jobs or courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.2/12">The department's strategy for assisting young people to re-engage is based on four key elements: careful tracking to identify young people's needs; a flexible mix of learning provision designed to meet the needs of every young person in every area; good advice and support to enable young people to access suitable provision; and a set of clear rights and responsibilities for young people to re-engage should they become NEET. Together with the education and training and Youth Matters reforms, these will make a significant reduction in the proportion of young people NEET and put us on the pathway to ensuring that all young people participate in education or training up to the age of 18.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.2/13">A strategy, setting these out in detail, was published in November 2007, and is available on the DCSF website at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/1419/index.cfm?sid=42&amp;">www.dfes.gov.uk/1419/index.cfm?sid=42&amp;</a> pid=343&amp;lid=336&amp;ctype=Text&amp;ptype=Single).</p>

	<p pid="b.20.5/1">I welcome the independent review of the greyhound racing industry, chaired by Lord Donoughue. We will consider fully the appropriate recommendations of the report when we draft any regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.5/2">Ministers will also consider the greyhound racing industry's response to the review, which I hope will be positive and swift. The Government have made it clear to the industry that a lot needs to be done to get its house in order to help improve welfare standards for the dogs used in racing.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.5/3">There will be a public consultation on our proposals for greyhound racing before approval by Parliament. We intend to give this matter our priority, although the timing of the consultation will be dependent on the response of the industry to the recommendations made by the Donoughue inquiry.</p>

However, the Government will continue to seek ways of working together to ensure that the efforts of the board and the Mayor to improve waste infrastructure in London are mutually reinforcing.</p>
