	<p pid="a.169.0/1">It is difficult to gauge how much money is directly spent on the monitoring of CITES-listed species in their country of origin, as much of the Government's financial assistance that might meet this description is part of a range of broader projects that focus on building capacity in developing countries to conduct this work. However, the Government with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), the statutory adviser on international nature conservation, provided &pound;42,000 in 2005-06 and &pound;7,957 in 2006-07 toward research conducted in Guinea to survey the occurrence and relative abundance of diurnal raptors subject to international trade. In addition, in 2006 the Government provided &pound;20,000 of funding toward the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement to help to develop an international partnership that will support work associated with population assessments of waterbirds, including species listed on CITES, such as the Egyptian goose, red-breasted goose, Cape teal, Eurasian widgeon, giant heron, great egret, slender-billed curlew, greater flamingo and the demoiselle crane.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.0/2">In addition, through the Darwin Initiative, the Government have provided funding for a range of projects that aim to assist monitoring generally through capacity building, monitoring and population assessment focused generally at wild birds, not just CITES-listed species. The Darwin Initiative seeks to assist countries that are rich in biodiversity but have scarce financial and other resources to fulfil their obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).</p>
	<p pid="a.169.0/3">As part of the Government's support for biodiversity in the overseas territories, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, jointly with the Department for International Development, provides funding to a broad range of programmes under the Overseas Territories Environment Programme, which assists in environmental management and the implementation of environmental charters in the overseas territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.0/4">The Government recognise the need to assist developing countries in conserving biodiversity and therefore support the Global Environment Facility (GEF), established in 1991, to help developing countries to fund projects and programmes related to biodiversity, among other things.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.2/14">Estimating the number of deer in a particular area has always been problematic and the quality of records varies greatly. The Deer Commission for Scotland no longer publishes populations estimates and concentrates only on impacts of deer. There are no specific population figures for wild deer numbers in Northern Ireland, although the perception is that overall numbers are increasing. The general trend for all species throughout the UK in recent years is that they are increasing.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.5/1">The MoD takes seriously its duty to assist coroners in their preparations for inquests into the deaths of service personnel. Internal service inquiry reports are provided to coroners to assist them with their preparations for their own independent inquiry.

Exhibits and unused material are included, or an explanation provided as to their exclusion. However, third-party information and UK-sensitive material is provided on an in-confidence basis, with a clear explanation of how such material should be handled and protected. The MoD seeks to co-operate, subject to any operational, security and third-party considerations, with additional requests from a coroner for disclosure of material held by the MoD. Where it is necessary to explain the operational context or to cover security-sensitive material, briefings from subject-matter experts are arranged.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">There are already explicit laws in place to protect children from maltreatment and these laws can be used against anyone who aids or abets abuse. Under Section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, it is an offence for any adult with responsibility for a child to wilfully assault, ill-treat, neglect or abandon the child in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health, or to counsel or procure such suffering or injury. The maximum penalty on conviction of either offence is 10 years. It is also an offence for anyone to aid or abet someone who causes a child suffering or injury. A belief in &quot;spirit possession&quot; is relatively widespread, although abuse linked to such beliefs is rare. The Government published guidance for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February</phrase> which aims to help local agencies to apply their general child protection procedures to such cases so as to most effectively safeguard and promote the welfare of the children involved.</p>

Following publication of that report, the then Scottish Executive Minister for Justice announced that the priority was to produce legislative proposals to improve the protection of victims in sex offence cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.2/1">The European Gendarmerie Force (EGF) is an initiative of five EU member states (France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain). The UK is not a member of the EGF and therefore does not have detailed information about the force.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">I understand that the purpose of the EGF is to make available rapidly deployable paramilitary police units able to perform a variety of policing roles, primarily in support of EU crisis management operations. It has a permanent headquarters (HQ) of 30 staff based at the Centre of Excellence for Stability Police Units, in Vicenza, Italy. The HQ consists of a multinational core that can be reinforced as needed by agreement of the contributing states.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/3">Apart from the HQ, the EGF is not a standing force, but will be generated and deployed on an ad hoc basis as needed. It is designed to be capable of deploying a police task force of up to 800 police officers, including a rapidly deployed HQ in the field, within 30 days. The police units that will form the EGF are drawn from existing national police resources from the five participating states; current commitments suggest that the EGF could reach a total nominal strength of 2,300.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/4">I do not have details of how the EGF will be financed. Costs would presumably depend on the nature of any EGF deployment. To date, the force has not deployed in a live operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.0/1">The Badr Brigade originated as an armed wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). In 2003, the Badr Brigade declared itself to be a political party and renamed itself the Badr Organisation. We welcomed the promise by SCIRI's leader, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, that it would disarm. However, we believe that some Badr members have either failed to lay down their arms or have infiltrated the Iraqi security forces and are engaging in sectarian violence. SCIRI and Badr remain closely linked and we believe that SCIRI leaders could do more to reduce violence by Badr elements. We continue to impress on all Iraq's political leaders that armed militias have no place in a democratic Iraq.</p>

At the same time, our approach also means highlighting our common values across groups: respect for the rule of law; freedom of speech; equality of opportunity; respect for others and responsibility towards others.

In addition, for 2006-07, SHAs have had the power to create local reserves held at SHA level to help them to balance the overall financial position across their health economy. Primary care trusts (PCTs), which make a contribution to their SHA reserve, will be repaid, normally within the three-year allocation cycle, when organisations currently in deficit start producing surpluses.

	<p pid="a.190.9/1">The Identity and Passport Service can and does cancel passports in appropriate cases. Cancellations are recorded on the database and shared with other agencies such as Interpol and border control. To use the cancellation facility to suspend passports temporarily would be impractical. Agencies such as border control authorities in other countries require clarity in the status of a particular passport and once they are notified of a cancellation there is no guaranteed way of reactivating it.</p>

Each situation is dealt with on an individual basis, with the victim's welfare and the assessed risk of re-trafficking always the paramount concerns. In accordance with its international obligations, the UK would not knowingly put a victim's life in danger, nor put victims in a position where they would be liable to be trafficked again. The Albanian Government have taken steps to address the trafficking and re-trafficking of persons, especially women, and introduced increasingly stringent laws and safeguards for those who may face trafficking. The Moldovan Government have also made significant efforts to combat trafficking and mistreatment of women, and are a signatory to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">Parliament has entrusted local planning authorities with responsibility for day-to-day planning control in their areas, including the consideration of applications for development. The Government will intervene to decide planning applications only in very rare cases where issues of more than local importance are involved and those issues need to be decided at national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">I understand that the planning application to which the noble Lord refers is a revision of an earlier planning application for the extraction of sand and gravel from an extension to the existing Nosterfield quarry to the north of the scheduled ancient monument of Thornborough henges. North Yorkshire County Council, as the mineral planning authority, refused that application in February 2006. I further understand that the county council is satisfied that the revised application, for reduced mineral extraction on a smaller site, addresses its concerns about the original application and in particular avoids the area in that application assessed as containing nationally important archaeological remains. In January 2007, the county council therefore resolved to approve the revised application, subject to ratification of a Section 106 planning agreement on several matters, including protection of archaeological interests and appropriate restoration and aftercare. Any permission that may be granted will also be subject to a number of planning conditions to mitigate the environmental, including landscape, impact of the sand and gravel extraction.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">I understand that, in reaching its decisions on the applications, the county council took account of all material planning considerations, including representations about the impact of the workings and proposed restoration on archaeology and the landscape, the Government's policies on the handling of archaeological remains within the planning system (Planning Policy Guidance Note 16: Archaeology and Planning) and the views of English Heritage, the Government's statutory adviser on heritage and archaeology.</p>

There are a number of options we can consider, including giving the individual the option of moving to other duties within the company, and offering the facility of taking unpaid leave.

However, the small number of open all-age schools in England presents a generally positive picture. Each proposal for an all-age academy is looked at on its individual merits. We look at a large number of factors, which, as a minimum, would need to show that the inclusion of primary provision in an academy would be likely to have a positive educational and social impact on both primary and secondary pupils, without adverse impact on the wider school community.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.8/1">Schools are required to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State on sex and relationship education. Sex and relationship education guidance issued in 2000 advises that pupils should learn about the importance of marriage for family life and for bringing up children, and the significance of marriage and stable relationships as the key building blocks of community and society. The guidance makes it clear that care must be taken to ensure that there is no stigmatisation of children based on their home circumstances. The guidance does not attribute a relative value to marriage as opposed to lasting relationships. It is for schools to decide on the detailed content and delivery of their sex and relationship education programme, taking account of the views of parents and the needs of pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.2/1">Within the school curriculum there are increasing opportunities for pupils to understand and manage risk and take part in competitive activities. Outdoor and adventurous activities are one of six activity areas within the national curriculum for physical education. These activities enable pupils to experience a degree of challenge and risk which can develop the confidence to travel and manage the body in potentially hazardous environments. The <I>Learning Outside the Classroom Manifesto</I>, which the Government launched last November, aims to provide young people with opportunities to engage in similar activities beyond the classroom.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.2/1">The UK's shipping experts consider that ice strengthening, rather than double-hulling, is a more important issue for ships operating in ice-covered waters. The UK is very concerned about the increasing number and size of non-ice-strengthened vessels visiting Antarctica and has been pressing the issue within the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) over recent years. In 2004, the treaty parties agreed guidelines for ships operating in Arctic and Antarctic ice-covered waters and transmitted them for consideration by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). These guidelines are intended to ensure that ships operating in ice-covered waters meet appropriate standards of maritime safety and pollution prevention. They include the recommendation that operations in Antarctic waters take due account of ship class, among other factors. It is hoped that the IMO will endorse the guidelines by this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.2/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is working closely with the Department for Transport and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to consider further measures for ensuring ship safety within Antarctic waters, including the issue of ship suitability (ice strengthening and hull type). The UK will continue to raise the issue of ship safety in Antarctic waters within the ATCM and the IMO as appropriate</p>

	<p pid="a.202.5/2">The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) is a member organisation providing a self-regulatory framework for tourism in Antarctica. The vast majority of Antarctica tour operators are members of the organisation and pay membership fees based on passenger numbers. The level of such fees is a matter for IAATO. IAATO sets stringent environmental standards for Antarctic tourism operators and manages the annual tourism traffic to Antarctica. The UK supports this self-regulatory framework, for example by restricting access to UK historic sites and bases to IAATO operators, and works with IAATO to further enhance the management of Antarctic tourism.</p>

Relevant provisions for prevention, monitoring and investigation of misconduct cases are included in the establishment of new mission mandates and the renewal of existing mission mandates. It is the responsibility of the UN Secretary-General and member states to take necessary steps to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure that the UN standards of conduct are adhered to. There are signs that the major troop-contributing countries are now taking this issue seriously and withdrawing contingents accused of misconduct. The UK and EU member states continue to work together on this issue in the UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping to ensure that work based on the report's recommendations continues and is completed successfully.
