	<p pid="a.171.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that all people with learning difficulties or disabilities have full access to apprenticeship learning opportunities and we provide extra funds for appropriate specialist support and equipment. The proportion of young people starting apprenticeships in England who have a learning difficulty or disability was 12 per cent in 2007-08, up slightly from 11 per cent in the previous two years. We have no plans to introduce specific targets for the proportion of disabled people starting or completing apprenticeships. However, we are in discussion with Jonathan Shaw, the Minister for Disability, on ways of increasing employment opportunities for disabled people which will include apprenticeships. We are implementing world-class apprenticeships plans to increase the take-up and completion rates of apprenticeships by learners who are currently underrepresented in the programme. Pilots starting later this year will aim to increase the critical mass of learners in non-traditional occupations to encourage more such applications; and mentoring trials will support atypical apprentices through their experience. The National Apprenticeships Vacancy Matching Service which went live in January this year will help match employers to prospective apprentices and provides the opportunity for learners with disabilities and difficulties to raise any needs they will require for an interview so that they have the opportunity of being fully supported. There will be support available for learners who are not being successful in their applications. In addition, more disabled people are being helped as a result of extending apprenticeships to older learners.</p>

Investigation as to who at RBS was involved in this decision are continuing.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.3/1">The European Union (EU) and member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) have jointly funded the design and development of Galileo. Approximately &euro;1.6 billion (&pound;1.1 billion)is committed spend on the design and development of the system. The deployment and operational phase, which follows, will see the Galileo programme achieve full operational capability (FOC). It is currently being procured by the ESA on behalf of the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.3/2">The total UK commitment to the ESA element of the programme amounts to &euro;168.05 million (&pound;116 million). By the end of 2008 the UK had paid &euro;98.45 million (&pound;68 million) of this. No further contributions are to be made to the project via ESA.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.3/3">The next phase of the Galileo programme&mdash;the deployment and operation of the system (2010-13)&mdash;and all future funding for Galileo will be the responsibility of the EU. The EU funding of Galileo between 2007 and 2013 has been capped at &euro;3.4 billion (&pound;2.3 billion). The European Commission estimates a further &pound;6 billion will be needed for operation and maintenance costs from 2013-30.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.3/4">Discussions on how funding after 2013 might be sourced and what elements might come from private and public sources will not take place until the programme has advanced to a later stage. We expect the Commission to bring forward proposals for financing future phases of the programme in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.3/5">Regarding the EU funding for Galileo: the position is that EU member states contribute to the Community budget as a whole and not to individual programmes within it. The UK contributes around 17 per cent of the Community budget or 12.6 per cent after abatement. There is therefore no specific UK contribution to the EU element of the funding for the Galileo programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.3/6">The above figures are weighted to 2008 economic conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">As required by regulation 21(5) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, the Home Secretary took into account the personal conduct of Mr Wilders, illustrated by his statements about Muslims and their beliefs. The Home Secretary considered that his statements were intended to incite racial and religious hatred and that his presence in the UK would, therefore, threaten community harmony and public security in the United Kingdom. As a result she took the view that Mr Wilders' presence in the United Kingdom would constitute a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to fundamental interests of public policy and public security.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/2">She decided it was proportionate that Mr Wilders be denied admission, despite his position as an elected Member of the Dutch Parliament and the freedom of movement he would normally have as a national of a member state of the EU. The Home Secretary's views were conveyed to the immigration officer who decided to refuse Mr Wilders admission to the UK.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-03-05a.181.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100960" speakername="Lord Darzi of Denham" colon=":" colnum="181"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90305w0002.htm#09030549000047">
	<p pid="a.181.3/1">We do not consider it appropriate to award specific appeal rights to specific parties in respect of the pharmaceutical needs assessments (PNAs) carried out by primary care trusts (PCTs). Instead, the Health Bill proposes that regulations will set out specific matters to which a PCT must adhere when formulating its assessment. Such matters must include the information to be contained in these assessments and may, in particular, make provision requiring consultation with specified persons about specified matters, the manner in which an assessment is to be made and matters to which a PCT must have regard when making an assessment. Consequently, we do not consider that PCTs will usually fail to identify service needs in their assessments since the Bill already contains powers to enable the regulations to make particular provision as to the pharmaceutical services to which their assessment must relate and to consult as required.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/2">If a PCT subsequently failed to identify a service need, did not adequately address how such needs were already being met locally or otherwise did not comply with the requirements of the relevant regulations then we would expect the PCT or strategic health authority to identify this and for the PCT to take appropriate action to correct the failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/3">The Health Bill contains provisions to enable the Secretary of State for Health to set out in regulations the circumstances in which a PCT must make a new assessment. It would also be open to an aggrieved person to challenge the adequacy of a PCT's assessment of pharmaceutical needs through the courts by means of a judicial review application.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/4">We would expect the regulations to set out the rights for parties to appeal decisions of PCTs not to grant pharmaceutical applications using the existing powers in the National Health Service Act 2006 and to follow the procedures currently used in such cases. The NHS litigation authority is constituted to hear appeals of such decisions and its procedures are well established so we anticipate that it will continue to hear appeals when the new test is brought into effect. Where the NHS litigation authority considers that the PCT's assessment of local pharmaceutical needs did not comply with prescribed requirements and that, as a result of this, the PCT would have been unable to undertake a proper assessment of whether or not to grant the application, then it would be open to it to make such a finding. In such a circumstance, the PCT would need to review its PNA and reconsider the application accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/5">Further information about the likely content of regulations relating to PNAs is given in the Explanatory Notes and supplementary information on secondary legislation accompanying the Health Bill. In summary, the regulations must set out the minimum information requirements which each assessment must contain and the procedures for publication and undertaking a new assessment. For example, the regulations might stipulate that a PNA must contain information on the demography of the people in its area and any seasonal trends or variations, as well as longer-term population projections and age profiles. They might also stipulate, for example, that PCTs must undertake a new assessment where important new health data, trends in disease or evidence of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of certain types of service emerge.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/6">The regulations might also include the kinds of pharmaceutical services which the PNA must relate to, for example, the provision of certain services such as reviews of patient medication and clinical support for patients starting medication to treat a long-term condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.0/1">The figure of 220 refers to all additional PPS staff, both legally qualified and non-legally qualified, recruited over the period.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/2">I am informed by the Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) that the establishment figure for prosecuting inspectors was 22 inspectors and two chief inspectors. These were supported in the central process offices by a range of staff whose complement as set out during the criminal justice review was seven sergeants and 80 to 90 support staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/3">Out of a current total of 572 staff in the PPS (and excluding the director and the deputy director), there are currently 171 legally qualified members of staff in the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) of whom 102 hold the grade of public prosecutor. It is this grade, currently B1 grade, of public prosecutor which is responsible, broadly stated, for carrying out the work previously carried out by the prosecuting police inspectors from the PSNI.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/4">It is not, however, possible to make a direct comparison between the figures. The aim of the criminal justice review's recommendations on bringing all prosecutions under the aegis of an independent body, brought into effect in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, was to ensure that decisions on cases at all levels of seriousness were made against consistently-applied criteria by legally-qualified staff. In addition to the responsibility for deciding on and progressing prosecutions, the Public Prosecution Service took on responsibility for tracking the progress of cases after charge or receipt of a report from the investigator, including requesting further information and investigations; and for providing advice to investigators at pre-charge stages of the process, for example on evidence needed and appropriate offences to be charged.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/5">The criminal justice review also noted the increasing complexity of even less serious cases and the increasing significance of human rights issues, both of which have impacted on the resourcing of the PPS.</p>

Information on the maximum and average case-loads is not available and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost by means of a manual survey.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.2/1">A consultation was undertaken in 2008 by BRB (Residuary) Ltd under the guidance issued to the company by Ministers on the disposal of its surplus property. The results of that consultation identified a number of local aspirations for the site, including the possible restoration of rail services or for use as a footpath or cycleway. These are local proposals and for that reason BRBR's Property Review Group concluded that the land should be offered to Lancashire County Council for it to decide the best use of the land.</p>
