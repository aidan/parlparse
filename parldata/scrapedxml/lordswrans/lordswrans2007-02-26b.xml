These are all readily available and in the public domain and can be used to inform discussions on the Government's Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.283.5/1">The published peer-reviewed evidence is of sufficient quality and quantity to recognise a statistical association between exposure to Agent Orange and chronic lymphatic leukaemia, soft tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chloracne. There is limited evidence of an association with respiratory cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma and porphyria cutanea tarda. Limited evidence means that the studies are not consistent in outcome and that the possibility that the findings might be due to chance or bias cannot be ruled out. These associations have only been recognised in heavily exposed populations. Currently, the scientific evidence does not support the conclusion that associations between exposures and adverse health effects are causal.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.5/2">Since 2005, MoD officials have been in regular contact with the Canadian authorities on the facts surrounding the spraying of Agent Orange at Gagetown in 1966 and 1967. We have followed closely the Canadian Government's initiative announced in August 2005. This had three main tasks: first, to establish those present, including foreign military units, at Gagetown since 1952, including in 1966, and 1967; secondly, to review the history and science of herbicide spraying; and thirdly, to assess the health risks from the herbicides based on the products used and likely exposure dose. Much of this work has been reported or final reports are awaited.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.5/3">Scrutiny of the published peer-reviewed evidence on Agent Orange and its adverse health effects has been carried out by MoD officials. The Canadian authorities have provided information on UK units present at Gagetown in 1966 and 1967 and details of locations and areas sprayed and of weather conditions. Findings of the Canadian study so far are that the exposure to Agent Orange resulting from normal activities during 1966 and 1967 was very low and unlikely to increase risk of adverse health. We will continue to monitor results emerging from the Canadian project.</p>

	<p pid="b.283.17/1">We welcome Ofcom's announcement on tightening the rules on broadcast advertising of food and drink to protect children from encouragement to eat foods high in fat, salt and sugar. This is a complex area and Ofcom has sought to strike a balance which protects the health of our children but also considers the impact on our broadcasting industries.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.17/2">Parliament has placed clear duties on Ofcom to ensure that any regulatory interventions they propose must be proportionate, appropriately targeted and soundly based on evidence of impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.17/3">Under this package of measures, in households where children's viewing includes a large number of programmes targeted at adults as well as programmes for children and young people, children under 16 would see 41 per cent fewer high fat, salt and sugar foods and drinks advertisements. For under-9s, the reduction would be 51 per cent. This represents a significant reduction, which Ofcom has deemed proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.17/4">Ofcom's new rules will be fully implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase> at the same time as new Committee on Advertising Practice restrictions for non-broadcast media.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.17/5">We are monitoring closely the impact of television restrictions and other measures across all media in order to see whether there is going to be a real change in the nature and balance of food promotion. The department will conduct an interim review in 2007, and we will undertake a more detailed review in 2008. On that basis, the Government will decide whether future action, through new (for non-broadcast) or existing legislation, is required.</p>

The question of release is a matter for the independent Parole Board. The Parole Board makes a release decision based on whether or not it is necessary for the protection of the public for that prisoner to be confined. The main criterion governing the board's consideration is the risk of serious harm that the prisoner may pose to others.</p>
