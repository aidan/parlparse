The sentencing framework and its application have changed considerably since 1974 and may change further in the light of current reviews. We believe that the time is right for a fundamental review of the Act as a whole, rather than looking at just a part of it. We are working on preparations for such a review and will give further details in due course.</p>

The measures in place to control the spread of foot and mouth disease impose significant additional costs on the meat processing supply chain and some of these costs will inevitably be passed back to producers. Even when more normal marketing conditions return, the closure of export markets is likely to result in significant over-supply and weak demand. In that situation, the Government will consider pressing the European Commission to introduce private storage aid for sheepmeat and (possibly) for beef and pigmeat as well. Under current market conditions, however, we and the Commission judge that such aid would not prove effective.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.11/1">Of the 10 directors of operations currently posted to the areas of England most affected by foot and mouth disease, seven are Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food personnel. All the regional operations directors in England are responsible to senior managers in the ministry. The directors of operations appointed in Wales and Scotland are members of the National Assembly of Wales Agriculture Department and the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department respectively and responsible to senior managers in those departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.11/2">All regional operations directors work in close co-operation with the veterinarians and the Army and contact with slaughterers as necessary. They liaise with farmers and their representatives to seek to ensure the effective operation of the policy.</p>
