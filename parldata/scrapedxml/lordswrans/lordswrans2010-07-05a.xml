	<p pid="a.7.2/1">The Child Poverty Act places a duty on Government to ensure that, in 2020, targets are met on four measures of child poverty:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/2">a relative low-income target that less than 10 per cent of children will live in households where income is less than 60 per cent of median household income for the financial year;a combined low-income and material deprivation target that less than 5 per cent of children will experience material deprivation and live in households where income is less than 70 per cent of median household income for the financial year and also experience material deprivation;an absolute low-income target that less than 5 per cent of children will live in households where income is less than 60 per cent of median household income in 2010-11 adjusted for prices; and a persistent poverty target based on the percentage of children living in households where income is less than 60 per cent of median household income for the financial year for three of the previous four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/3">However, income measures do not necessarily capture all aspects of poverty or inequality facing children and their families, and the Government are committed to tackling the causes of poverty and not just treating the symptoms. It is only by tackling the root causes of how people get trapped in poverty that we can break the cycle of disadvantage and dependency culture to stimulate social mobility.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/4">The Prime Minister has therefore asked Frank Field to lead an independent review of poverty and life chances that includes examining the case for reforms to poverty measures, in particular for the inclusion of non-financial elements. The review will explore whether there are measures that can improve the way poverty is tackled, ensuring that we focus on the root causes of and the paths into poverty as well as on the non-financial side.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">Guidance was issued by the senior presiding judge for England and Wales in 2008 outlining the arrangements for liaison between probation areas/trusts and judges and magistrates. This guidance establishes the framework for liaison to ensure courts are best equipped to do their work, and are aware of prevalent or particular local issues and trends in the provision of probation services.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">The guidance also outlines the categories of information that judges and magistrates would find most helpful at the local level, including completion rates of community penalties, programmes available locally as part of a community order, use of custodial sentences in the magistrates' courts, and the availability of local provision for those on bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/3">Probation trusts liaise regularly with judges and magistrates and provide information about the availability and effectiveness of different non-custodial sentencing options. They also provide newsletters for judges and magistrates, participate in magistrates' training events, and hold regular forums to disseminate information. Close liaison has taken place at the local level with the design and implementation of the Intensive Alternatives to Custody project and with similar national and local initiatives. Third-sector organisations may be represented in both regional and local liaison.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/4">Third-sector organisations have also developed their own channels of communication with sentencers. These include arranging meetings with judges or magistrates within the specific area where there is third sector provision available.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/5">Regional directors of offender management hold regular forums with judges and magistrates to outline the range of non custodial options available and consider how they are being used.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/6">National liaison between judges, magistrates and providers of non-custodial sentences also takes place at the NOMS (National Offender Management Service) Sentencer Forum, attended by representatives of all levels of the judiciary, and by senior staff from NOMS and the Ministry of Justice.</p>

These measures will be taken forward separately from other changes to the planning system. The Department for Education and Partnerships for Schools are looking at how the school premises regulations and other legislation and guidance which affects all schools buildings can be simplified.

	<p pid="a.27.2/4">The latest period for which published figures about maintained school section 5 inspection outcomes are available is the spring term of 2009-10. This answer, therefore, takes into account those schools which were open on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> and had received an inspection up to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>. This period spans two school inspection frameworks, the first covering September 2005 to August 2009 and the second from September 2009 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/5">Information about the number of pupils on roll and the number of pupils with a statement of special educational needs in each school has been taken from the Department for Education's <phrase class="date" code="">2009 January</phrase> School Census.

	<p pid="a.27.2/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> there were 22,249 schools open and eligible for a section 5 inspection in England. Two hundred and fifty-eight open schools which have not yet been inspected by Ofsted are excluded from this analysis. In addition, 421 pupil referral units and 13 hospital schools which have been inspected by Ofsted are excluded from the analysis because they are not required to provide the pupil level data in the School Census which is used in this answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/7">Of those schools judged outstanding during their most recent inspection, 3.5 per cent of pupils had a statement of special educational needs. Of those schools that were judged good, satisfactory or inadequate during their latest inspection, 2.7 per cent of the pupils had a statement of special educational needs. A breakdown of this by phase of education can be found in Table A and Table B enclosed below.</p>
