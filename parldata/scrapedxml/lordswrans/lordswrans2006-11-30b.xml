	<p pid="b.72.2/10">The use of inorganic nitrogen as a fertiliser is a major source of nitrous oxide emissions, which can also arise from manures during storage. A number of effective practical actions and technologies can be taken up by farmers to reduce the level of emissions. For example, these can help to: optimise the efficient use of fertilisers, reduce inorganic nitrogen use, and maximise the benefit of organic nitrogen. More efficient usage could also help to reduce farmers' costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.0/1">The Government are fully committed to tackling all offences committed by individuals and all forms of business organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/2">The UK maintains an effective framework for business which balances the need to encourage enterprise and deter corruption, fraud and other types of misconduct. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 gives UK courts jurisdiction over corruption offences committed wholly overseas by UK nationals and by bodies incorporated under UK law. The Government recently provided resources for a new unit in the City of London Police Service to investigate allegations of foreign bribery. This will complement the work of the Serious Fraud Office, deter corruption and help bring prosecutions against corrupt individuals and companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/3">In addition, the Government will shortly be introducing a range of new measures, among which are:</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/4">the third EU money laundering directive; implementation in the UK will require that all sectors under money laundering regulations must identify the beneficial owners of their customer if the customer is a legal entity or legal person. It will also require that all trust and company service providers are fit and proper persons and that these businesses are not run for criminal purposes. Further, it explicitly prevents banks and financial institutions doing transactions with banks with no physical presence and which are unaffiliated with a regulated financial group;the creation by DfID of a new &pound;100 million Governance and Transparency Fund, designed to help citizens hold their governments to account;the provision of specialist resources to developing countries to investigate and prosecute corruption cases; andthe provision of technical assistance to establish effective anti-corruption practices under the UN Convention against Corruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/5">Company law and its related enforcementregime tackles financial crime in a number ofways, particularly through requirements to publish accounts and powers to wind up companies and disqualify directors. The new Companies Act 2006 imposes important obligations on UK companies and their directors to behave responsibly. All directors are under a duty to act with appropriate care, skill and diligence. This applies to directors of a UK parent company who act as shareholder of an overseas subsidiary. In addition, the Act requires that atleast one director of a company must be a natural person.</p>

	<p pid="b.76.2/1">If an offence of rape is &quot;no crimed&quot; then that is reported monthly on the recorded crime return made to the Home Office. However, offences which have been &quot;no crimed&quot; do not feature in the recorded crime statistics published by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.2/2">Once any offence has been recorded, it should be classified as a &quot;no crime&quot; only if one of the following criteria is satisfied: the crime was committed outside the jurisdiction of the police force in which it was recorded; where following the report of an incident which has subsequently been recorded as a crime, additional verifiable information is available which determines that no notifiable crime has been committed; if the crime, as alleged, constitutes part of a crime already recorded; if the reported incident was recorded as a crime in error.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.9/2" class="indent">&quot;In 2003, the MRC, through our Military Health Research Advisory Group (MHRAG), conducted a comprehensive review of relevant research into Gulf Veterans' illness. As Lord Sainsbury outlined in a written answer to the Countess of Mar on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October 2006</phrase>, the review involved a one-day closed scientific meeting between the MHRAG and a number of scientists from the UK and overseas. This was followed on the next day by a separate private meeting of the MHRAG to appraise the MRC of scientific progress, of the potential for gaining further knowledge and of research needs, and of what the likely medical issues might be. As reported by Lord Sainsbury, in a written answer to a question from Lord Morris of Manchester, we estimated the cost of the review to be between &pound;20,000 and &pound;25,000. This estimate related to the closed scientific meeting, the MHRAG meeting the following day, and the publication of the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.9/3" class="indent">We of course publish the memberships of our Council and standing advisory Boards/Committees; and the membership of the MHRAG is recorded in the published review. However, it is not the MRC's practice to release into the public domain the names of individuals who either attended, or who may, or may not, have been considered as participants, in closed ad-hoc scientific meetings. If we felt there was a particular reason to make names public, we would make that clear in the letters of invitation. In the case of this scientific meeting, we did not do that. For what I hope are obvious reasons, we would never make public the names of individuals whom we had considered inviting to join a particular committee or meeting, but whom we subsequently decided not to invite. I am therefore not in a position to respond to the Countess of Mar's second question&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.0/1">We have no proposals to cease using closed evidence in tribunals against suspected terrorists. It is essential that we are able to use sensitive material&mdash;primarily intelligence&mdash;to inform decisions to take action against individuals and organisations involved in terrorism, in particular for some decisions involving control orders, deportation, exclusion, proscription of a terrorist organisationand deprivation of British citizenship. The special advocate procedure represents a fair and effective way for an individual to challenge such decisions.</p>
