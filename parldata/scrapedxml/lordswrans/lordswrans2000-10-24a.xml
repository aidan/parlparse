	<p pid="a.18.5/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has been chairing a Fuel Task Force which comprises Ministers and representatives of the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, the oil industry, the police, the trade unions and others. Members of the task force signed a memorandum of understanding on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-29">29 September</phrase>. This establishes more robust systems to avoid disruption of fuel supplies. It commits signatories to establishing practical arrangements aimed at maintaining continuity of oil supply. In particular, it commits relevant signatories to establishing joint early warning systems and co-ordinated contingency plans; to joint emergency management systems; and to reducing the potential for intimidation of tanker drivers. Copies of the memorandum of understanding have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/2">The task force is continuing to oversee work in support of the memorandum. As this concerns planning to respond to any future disruption, it would not be appropriate to give further details of this work.</p>

If called upon, this would be provided under the normal arrangements for providing military assistance to ensure that essential supplies and services are maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/4">The events of last month demonstrated the importance of oil supplies to our economy and to our society. The economy relies on just-in-time supply chains. It benefits from their efficiency, but is vulnerable to disruption. It is not possible to eliminate all risk to oil supplies. Our aim has been the practical one of reducing the risk to the minimum.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">The Office of National Statistics publishes data on cancer mortality and incidence. These data cannot however be broken down by ethnic group. Centrally collected Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data only provide information about treatment, and the data on ethnic groupings are unreliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">At the Government's request, the Cancer Research Funders Forum (CRFF) made prostate cancer one of its first priorities. The CRFF commissioned a review of prostate cancer, which was published in October 2000. The review refers to research on variations in incidence and mortality from prostate cancer among ethnic groups. Work on United Kingdom ethnic minority groups shows that mortality is raised in Caribbean and West African migrants. In North America the mortality rate in African Americans is twice as high as in white Americans. Asian immigrants to the United States of America have a low incidence of prostate cancer, whilst Asians raised to adulthood in the USA are closer to that country's higher risk, thereby suggesting that environmental factors may influence incidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.9/1">Such studies have been undertaken for over 25 years. BAA Heathrow publishes details of air quality at Heathrow annually. A number of local authorities in the vicinity of Heathrow have also studied emission in and around Heathrow Airport as part of their reviews and assessments of local air quality under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.9/2">The most recently published study that identified pollution from aircraft and cars separately was in BAA's evidence to the Heathrow Terminal Five planning inquiry in 1996. This showed that aircraft were the main source of oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide within the airport boundary; but that outside the airport, the main source of both was road traffic. Present and projected levels of air quality around Heathrow will also be examined as part of the South East and East Regional Air Service Study.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.8/1">A flaw has been found in pipework that forms part of the cooling system in some Trafalgar and Swiftsure class hunter/killer submarines. Initial indications are that this may have arisen from the original construction of this component. The repair of this flaw, if needed, is straightforward but, because of the stringent safety procedures that we employ for any work involving repairs to our nuclear submarines, the repair process will take some months. As responsible nuclear operators, we take even the slightest flaw to our submarines very seriously. It is for this reason that our deployed hunter/killer submarines are being brought alongside to be inspected. Until all inspections have been completed it is not possible to determine fully the requirement for repair work and operational implications, but they will be significant. The submarines remain safe, and at no time has there been any risk to their crew or the general public. Vanguard Class Trident submarines, which are of a very different design, are not affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.11/38">For 1970-71 to 1972-73 the highest rate of income tax is the highest rate of surtax.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.11/39">For 1973-74 to 1983-84, the highest rate charged includes investment income surcharge at 15 per cent but this total rate would apply only if the taxpayer's income included investment income greater than the threshold for the highest rate of surcharge, which varied between &pound;2,000 in 1973-74 and &pound;7,100 in 1983-84.</p>
