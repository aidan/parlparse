Foreign Minister Zhang replied that Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche had had a fair and public trial and had been sentenced in accordance with Chinese law. Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's case was also included on a list of cases handed over during the visit of Premier Wen to the UK in May this year. The case was raised most recently during the UK-China human rights dialogue in May. FCO officials asked for confirmation that the authorities would not carry out the death sentence in this case, expressed concern at the judicial process and requested a retrial. The Chinese side said that according to Chinese law, if Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche did not commit further crimes within the two-year suspension period, he would not be executed. Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's suspension period will end in December 2004. We will continue to raise this case when appropriate opportunities arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.2/1">The EU and the UK have had a political dialogue with the Cuban Government for many years. Respect for human rights remains the key issue in the EU's relationship of constructive engagement and dialogue with the Cuban Government, as set out in the common position. Following a crackdown on the peaceful opposition in March 2003, the EU&mdash;in line with the common position and alongside other international organisations like UNESCO, the UNCHR in Geneva and the Caribbean Community&mdash;condemned Cuba's actions and adopted a series of measures that reflected our human rights concerns. These included the inviting to national day receptions, alongside Cuban government representatives, of members of the peaceful opposition and civil society; as is the practice of the EU elsewhere in the world and is the practice of Cuban embassies in EU capitals. Since then the EU has also condemned the Cuban Government for sentencing, in April and May 2004, more human rights activists and journalists for trying to exercise freedom of speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">The Cuban response to the EU condemnation has been to reject all EU development aid, and to &quot;freeze&quot; contact with EU embassies in Havana. The EU has never cut any communication to Cuban missions in capitals and repeated in its ministerial declaration of <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-15">15 June 2004</phrase> its readiness to resume the dialogue the Cuban Government terminated. The UK has not cut any bilateral co-operation and indeed has secured new funding for its links with Cuba, for example in scholarships. The UK continues to maintain active programmes of co-operation in areas as diverse as child protection, migration and law enforcement, and encourages trade, tourism, education, sport, science and cultural links between the two countries. We remain committed to dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.5/1">The Government support Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) aspiration to join NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP). We welcome the significant progress made in implementing the military reforms required for PfP membership&mdash;in particular the appointment of a state-level defence Minister. However, BiH must also meet the political requirements of membership, including full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The ICTY's current assessment is that the BiH authorities&mdash;in particular in the Republika Srpska&mdash;are not co-operating fully with the tribunal, in particular, securing the transfer of Radovan Karadzic to the Hague. In the absence of such co-operation in the coming days, it is difficult to conceive of an invitation at the Istanbul summit to join PfP.</p>

In general support is provided to eligible asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute until a final decision is made on the claim for asylum.

	<p pid="a.104.3/1">The helpful statement by Dr Humphries highlights voluntary action taken by the Co-op to restrict promotion to children of foods high in fat, salt or sugar and welcomes the recommendations in the Food Standards Agency action plan on food promotions and children's diets. This plan, which is currently being consulted on, calls upon a variety of stakeholders to work with the agency to address the ways in which foods are promoted to children, and in doing so to encourage children to eat a more healthy diet.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.0/1">The Department of Health has allocated &pound;26.6 million to the new NHS Professionals Special Health Authority for 2004&ndash;05. This, taking into account moneys from the previous year, brings the total investment to &pound;32.8 million for 2004&ndash;05. It is anticipated that NHS Professionals will be self-financing by 2006&ndash;07. A copy of the NHS Professionals business plan, which outlines its strategy for the next three years, will be placed in the Library shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/2">Approximately 93 per cent of the costs paid by National Health Service trusts to NHS Professionals relates to direct salary costs, with approximately 7 per cent charged in relation to on-costs such as national insurance and superannuation. In addition, NHS Professionals normally levies an average management fee of 7.5 per cent to NHS trusts for each shift they fill, although this can vary according to arrangements agreed locally. This fee also covers an element for training and development. NHS Professionals is a non-profit making organisation and the management fee is set at a level sufficient to recoup the cost to NHS Professionals of delivering the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.3/1">In line with the National Institute for Mental Health in England policy guidance on <i>Personality Disorder: No Longer a Diagnosis of Exclusion </i>(2003), a number of initiatives aimed at developing new approaches to the treatment and care of people with a severe personality disorder have been developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.3/2">Through this programme the Department of Health has recently allocated funding of &pound;10.9 million to 11 new community-focused personality disorder services based in each region of England over the next two years. These services will be established as part of the wider development of personality disorder services funded by a recurrent baseline allocation of &pound;8 million to primary care trusts from 2004&ndash;05 rising to &pound;10 million in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.3/3">In addition, the agreed development plans for Webb House will see the establishment of eight new day services across the north-west in place of the inpatient service at Crewe. The aim is to improve access and effectiveness and foster the expansion of personality disorder services to a population of 79.4 million people.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.3/4">The development plans for Main House and the Henderson Hospital being drawn up by local commissioners and providers in preparation for the expected return of funding to the National Health Service in 2006 are at an earlier stage but will also be consistent with the NIMHE guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.2/1">The Government's objectives in relation to proposals for European Union legislation on sports nutrition are to press the case for proportinate legislation which both protects public health and delivers informed consumer choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/2">In April 2004, the European Commission issued a &quot;working document for a draft Commission Directive on foods intended to meet the expenditure of intense muscular effort, especially for sports people&quot;. Follwing an expert working group meeting in Brussels last month, the Commission has indicated that it is likely to issue an amended proposal in the autumn of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/3">The range of sports nutrition products on the market has increased since the former Scientific Committee on Food issued its two relevant reports in 2000. It would be in the interests of consumers and industry if all relevant products on the market were covered by the directive. Therefore the Food Standards Agency will press the Commission to take the relevant steps to ensure that it takes account of recent developments, including any recently published scientific research.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/4">The FSA has consulted on the Commission's initial working document and met with stakeholders to discuss their concerns. It will continue to consult stakeholders as the legislation develops. The agency's negotiating objective is to secure legislation which both protects consumer health and maintains a wide range of consumer choice.</p>

These proposals were taken into account when the majority of European Union Sports Ministers agreed a series of amendments to the draft article at their meeting in October 2003. FIFA, UEFA and the IOC endorsed these amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">The Government believe that sport is primarily a matter for member states. We are content, however, with the inclusion of sport as a supporting competence in the draft European Union Constitutional Treaty as it is clear that the Union may only act to support, co-ordinate or complement member states' action. It also expressly precludes any harmonisation of member states' laws in the area of sport. The Government are satisfied with the current draft of Article III&ndash;182 which reflects efforts to include the principles of the Nice Declaration on Sport in the draft treaty by recognising the specific nature of sport and its social and educational function. These changes resulted from discussions at a meeting of EU Sports Ministers in October 2003 during which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/774" name="Richard Caborn">my right honourable friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Richard Caborn)</phrase> played a major role in establishing a broad consensus in favour of amendments to Article III&ndash;182.</p>
