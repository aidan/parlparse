	<p pid="a.197.8/1">There is no single legal definition of a war crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.8/2">In the domestic law of England and Wales, the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals attached to the still extant Royal Warrant of <phrase class="date" code="1945-06-14">14 June 1945</phrase> define a war crime as &quot;a violation of the laws and usages of war committed during any war in which His Majesty has been or may be engaged at any time since the 2nd September 1939&quot;. War crimes include grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and their First Additional Protocol, which are punishable as criminal offences in the United Kingdom under the Geneva Conventions Act 1957. The War Crimes Act 1991 provides for the prosecution of offences of murder, manslaughter or culpable homicide in Germany or under German occupation during the Second World War, where the offences &quot;constituted a violation of the laws and customs of war&quot; (Section 1).</p>
	<p pid="a.197.8/3">The position under international law is complex, but the International Criminal Court, the statute for which was agreed at a United Nations conference in July 1998, will have jurisdiction to try war crimes. Such crimes are now defined for the purposes of the Court's jurisdiction in article 8 of the statute. The Government will during the current session of Parliament publish for public consultation a draft Bill implementing the United Kingdom's obligations under the statute.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.5/1">Under the request/ complaint procedures, prisoners have a right of appeal against local decisions to the Prison Service area manager and these are dealt with at Prison Service headquarters. Prisoners at Blakenhurst may also appeal to the chief executive of UKDS, the contractor that manages the prison. These are not answered by the same person who dealt with the original complaint, although I am aware of an isolated instance in which this did happen in the absence of the chief executive and the director of the prison. UKDS assures me it has taken steps to ensure this will not happen again.</p>

We are consulting about these proposals at present.</p>

However, it supports a number of museums north of Watford through its pastoral care role to regimental and corps museums and has actively assisted 11 museums through the loan of its collections. It has also helped 12 museums north of Watford with major re-display projects, with National Lottery funded work and with staff training.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.6/1">There are numerous reasons why people with potential entitlement to disability benefits do not claim them. Contributory factors include a lack of knowledge about the benefit, an anxiety not to be seen as &quot;disabled&quot;, or a reluctance, particularly among older people, to claim assistance for what they may see as less severe disabilities, which would attract lower rates of benefit, or simply as the normal results of ageing. At the same time around 26 per cent of claims for attendance allowance and 40 per cent of claims for disability living allowance are unsuccessful because the claimant does not satisfy the qualifying conditions. And many people who do make claims are dissatisfied with the decision and ask for it to be reconsidered.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.6/2">Against this background, our priorities are to look at ways of improving the information we provide about these benefits and to make it easier for people to supply us with the details we need to decide entitlement. We are also trying to develop clearer and more secure gateways so that it is easier for people to know whether they may be entitled. These initiatives have involved extensive and continuing discussions with disabled people and their representatives and with disability experts.</p>
