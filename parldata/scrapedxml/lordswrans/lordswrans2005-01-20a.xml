	<p pid="a.123.8/1">The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is currently utilising radio frequency identification (RFiD) technology to track containers and aircraft loads in support of military deployments. The system used is an American system known as total asset visibility or TAV; a system also used by the United States military. TAV was procured during Op TELIC and led to real improvements in the MoD's ability to track consignments. The system currently consists of a network of over 120 fixed readers located at key nodes within the defence supply chain. Coverage includes the United Kingdom, Germany, Iraq, Afghanistan, Cyprus and Canada. The system is fully interoperable with the United States military's consignment tracking system and this effectively gives the UK access to the US system of readers around the world. Additionally, the MoD also procured mobile readers known as early entry deployable support kits which are used to provide temporary coverage before fixed readers can be installed. The MoD continues to keep abreast of developments and intends to evaluate RFiD's further potential use within defence.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.5/1">The number of additional local authority inspectors needed to process applications for and inspect electrical installation work undertaken by private householders is dependent on the number of notifications made to the local authorities. All local authorities in England and Wales will need adequate resources to undertake this work. Local authorities are required to set their own charges for carrying out their main building control functions, which should be based on full cost recovery. Thus, they should be able to employ additional resources to meet demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/2">Local authority building control charges are generally set in bands based on the value of the notifiable work in their schemes which each authority must make publicly available. Much notifiable electrical installation work undertaken by private householders should fall into the lowest band.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.5/1">Defra is not aware of any of its official records having been shredded at national, regional or local level in respect of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001. Defra has already made considerable efforts to bring together and consolidate centrally the foot and mouth record from all regional disease centres that were involved in the outbreak. Once this considerable task has been completed the record will be preserved in its entirety until it enters the formal Defra record review process in 2008. The National Archives have been kept up to date with progress on this issue and will decide in time whether to retain this record as part of its permanent collection.</p>

In doing so, the Government will seek to select control strategies which balance minimising the number of animals which need to be slaughtered, either to control the disease or on welfare grounds, and which keeps animal welfare problems to a minimum; causing the least possible disruption to the food, farming and tourism industries, to visitors to the countryside, and to rural communities and the wider economy; minimising damage to the environment and protecting public health; and minimising the burden on taxpayers and the public at large.</p>
