Clause 9 of the Bill clearly states that, if the acquired gender is male, the person's sex becomes that of a man and if the acquired gender is female, the perons's sex becomes that of a woman. Therefore, the sex of persons who are litigants in civil actions or the accused in criminal actions will be taken to be the gender in which he or she is recognised by law.</p>
