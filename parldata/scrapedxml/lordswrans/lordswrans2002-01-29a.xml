It is likely that changes will be made to enable an improvement in the current focus on 18 to 20 year-olds in the first instance, with a view to expanding this focus to other groups. Women offenders, for example, would be a group that could benefit from such a restructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.5/1">No. The imposition in legislation of reasonable procedural requirements on those embarking on litigation does not constitute a barrier to access to justice, nor does it interfere with the independence and impartiality of the tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/2">Under existing powers (Section 7(2) of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996), the employment tribunal procedure regulations may already prescribe forms for entering originating applications and notices of appearance, and in fact some of the content of the current forms is laid down there. Clause 25 of the Employment Bill, when implemented, will enable the Secretary of State to impose the requirements outside of the regulations. This will provide greater flexibility to make changes to the requirements where necessary. In particular it will be quicker: the procedure regulations have to lie for 21 days before taking effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/3">The content of any new forms will be discussed with the judiciary and interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/4">As now, the judiciary will decide whether applications and notices of appearance are validly made, and will thus be able to ensure that those who have difficulty completing forms will not be denied access to tribunals.</p>

The legislation governing underwater archaeology will be reviewed as part of the forthcoming review of statutory controls applicable to the historic environment. In the meantime, a number of initiatives by the sport diving associations to promote a responsible attitude to historic remains and archaeological best practice and to encourage the adoption and stewardship of historic wreck sites are being endorsed by various government departments and agencies with interests in this field.</p>
