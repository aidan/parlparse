	<p pid="a.203.2/1">The responsibility for enforcing health and safety legislation at amusement and theme parks falls generally to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

	<p pid="a.203.2/2">HSE and local authorities work together to ensure that, where there is shared enforcement responsibility within premises, there is effective co-operation. HSE has run several seminars on fairground safety to develop understanding and co-ordination of activity between HSE and local authority inspectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.6/1">We have serious concerns regarding the Iranian authorities' use of the death penalty. Worryingly, the number of executions reported in 2006 has risen compared to this time last year. We receive numerous reports of executions carried out in public. Growing numbers of juvenile offenders have been sentenced to death and in some cases executed.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/2">We have repeatedly made representations to the Iranian authorities over the use of the death penalty. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May 2006</phrase>, the EU issued a statement in which it expressed its,</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/3" class="indent">&quot;serious concern about the general increase in executions in Iran&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/4">The full text of the statement can be found on the following website: www.eu2006.at/en/News/CFSP&ndash;Statements/May/0505Iran1.html.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/5">During our presidency of the EU in 2005, we pressed the Iranian authorities on seven occasions on death penalty-related concerns. In July 2005, the EU issued a public statement recalling the EU's,</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/6" class="indent">&quot;long-held position that capital punishment may not, in any circumstances, be imposed on persons below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of their crime&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/7">The full text of the statement can be found on the following website: <a href="http://www.eu2005.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page">www.eu2005.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page</a>&amp;:cid=1115146994806&amp;&amp;=KArticle&amp;aid=1119530173570.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/8">Such punishments are in contravention of Iran's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The EU expressed its hope that Iran would adopt a law abolishing all lashings and executions for crimes committed by those under the age of 18. It called on Iran to implement a moratorium until that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/9">We have also raised death penalty concerns in other fora. In December 2005, all EU member states co-sponsored a resolution on human rights in Iran at the United Nations General Assembly. The resolution expressed serious concern at,</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/10" class="indent">&quot;public executions including multiple public executions and, on a large scale, other executions in the absence of respect for internationally recognised safeguards&quot;,</p>

	<p pid="a.206.6/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-13">13 May</phrase>, Iran carried out the first execution of a juvenile in 2006. Two males aged 17 and 20 were hanged barely a month after the crime they are alleged to have carried out was committed. We expressed our concern to the Iranian <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> in London prior to the execution. The EU presidency raised this case locally with the Iranian authorities and will make further representations later this week.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.6/1">Under the custodial sentencing provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, implemented last year, convicted sex offenders will either receive a determinate sentence, with automatic release at the halfway point, or, if assessed as presenting a risk of harm through reoffending, an extended or indeterminate sentence. In the latter case, when the minimum custodial period has been served, offenders may apply for release on licence to the Parole Board, which must then consider their application. Offenders who have received an indeterminate sentence may remain in custody for life if necessary for reasons of public protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.6/2">For those sentenced under the previous arrangements, a prisoner sentenced to four years or more may apply to the Parole Board for release on licence at the halfway point, while for shorter sentences automatic halfway release applies.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.6/3">In determining whether to direct release, the Parole Board is required to conduct a thorough assessment of risk. In making its assessment, it is required to consider reports prepared by the probation service and Prison Service and, where available, other experts such as psychologists or psychiatrists. Its overriding duty is to protect the public and to prevent further reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.6/4">Prisoners who apply for early release on the home detention curfew scheme (HDC) are also subject to a careful risk assessment, undertaken by the prison governor. However, prisoners are ineligible to apply if they are subject to the notification requirements of Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Where such prisoners are not so subject but are nevertheless serving a sentence of imprisonment for sexual offences, they are presumed unsuitable for early release on HDC.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.6/5">There are no plans to change these arrangements.</p>
