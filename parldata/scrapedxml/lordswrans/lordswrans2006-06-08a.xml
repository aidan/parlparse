	<p pid="a.206.6/1">We have serious concerns regarding the Iranian authorities' use of the death penalty. Worryingly, the number of executions reported in 2006 has risen compared to this time last year. We receive numerous reports of executions carried out in public. Growing numbers of juvenile offenders have been sentenced to death and in some cases executed.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/2">We have repeatedly made representations to the Iranian authorities over the use of the death penalty. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May 2006</phrase>, the EU issued a statement in which it expressed its,</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/3" class="indent">&quot;serious concern about the general increase in executions in Iran&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/4">The full text of the statement can be found on the following website: www.eu2006.at/en/News/CFSP&ndash;Statements/May/0505Iran1.html.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/5">During our presidency of the EU in 2005, we pressed the Iranian authorities on seven occasions on death penalty-related concerns. In July 2005, the EU issued a public statement recalling the EU's,</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/6" class="indent">&quot;long-held position that capital punishment may not, in any circumstances, be imposed on persons below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of their crime&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/7">The full text of the statement can be found on the following website: <a href="http://www.eu2005.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page">www.eu2005.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page</a>&amp;:cid=1115146994806&amp;&amp;=KArticle&amp;aid=1119530173570.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/8">Such punishments are in contravention of Iran's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The EU expressed its hope that Iran would adopt a law abolishing all lashings and executions for crimes committed by those under the age of 18. It called on Iran to implement a moratorium until that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/9">We have also raised death penalty concerns in other fora. In December 2005, all EU member states co-sponsored a resolution on human rights in Iran at the United Nations General Assembly. The resolution expressed serious concern at,</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/10" class="indent">&quot;public executions including multiple public executions and, on a large scale, other executions in the absence of respect for internationally recognised safeguards&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/11">and deplored,</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/12" class="indent">&quot;the execution of persons who were below 18 years of age at the time their offence was committed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.6/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-13">13 May</phrase>, Iran carried out the first execution of a juvenile in 2006. Two males aged 17 and 20 were hanged barely a month after the crime they are alleged to have carried out was committed. We expressed our concern to the Iranian <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> in London prior to the execution. The EU presidency raised this case locally with the Iranian authorities and will make further representations later this week.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.2/1">Certain Iranian newspapers have run a series of articles in recent months aimed at defaming the Baha'i faith.

	<p pid="a.207.2/6">We expect Iran to uphold freedom of religion and belief in accordance with its international obligations under Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
