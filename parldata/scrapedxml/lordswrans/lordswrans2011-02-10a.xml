Using the fees waived field, we can say for the 2009-10 academic year that 71,000 learners studying ESOL claimed fee remission as they were in receipt of an income-related benefit, and 14,000 learners claimed fee remission as they were in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance.

	<p pid="a.88.6/1">All trade unions are eligible to apply for support under the Union Learning Fund (ULF) to work with employers, employees and learning providers to encourage greater take up of learning and raise skill levels in the workplace in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/2">Proposals for funding are invited each year which meet the aims and objectives of the fund and the priorities for that year which are agreed with the department. This is a competitive process and proposals are considered by the Union Learning Fund assessment panel, comprising of representatives from the department, the TUC and the Skills Funding Agency. All ULF projects are bound by contracts with defined learning targets and outcomes and are subject to independent audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/3">The National Union of Journalists, the Royal College of Midwives and the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists all made successful applications for ULF funding in 2009-10:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/4">funding for the National Union of Journalists was provided to develop the skills of its Union Learning representatives to work with employers to encourage workers to participate in continuing professional development in a rapidly changing industry that demands new and updated skills;the Royal College of Midwives project supported work in partnership with Heads of Midwifery and NHS Trusts to promote and develop the role of Union Learning representatives in helping develop the skills of midwives and midwife support workers, with a particular focus on supporting those hard to reach workers who have difficulty in accessing learning through traditional methods; andfunding for the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists helped to develop a continuing professional development model in partnership with employers. The project is also increasing the number of Union Learning representatives in both professions and establishing learning centres in local colleges to help provide members with the skills required to deliver the health and social care reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/5">Evaluation and analysis of Union Learning Fund activity between 2001 and 2005 was undertaken by York Consulting in 2006. The evaluation confirmed substantial benefits for workers' skills from investment through the Union Learning Fund. A more recent evaluation of the fund from 2006 to 2009 has been undertaken by Leeds University Business School and will be published on the unionlearn website at the end of February 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.6/6">The latest evaluation found that 87 per cent of employers would continue to be involved in union learning activities, with 63 per cent stating there was a benefit to the organisation and 81 per cent that there was a benefit to individuals taking part. Just over two-thirds of employers (68 per cent) reported that union-led projects resulted in employees with little history of learning taking up courses; and 71 per cent said it increased the demand for learning among those with poor basic skills. We plan to continue to evaluate and assess the performance of both unionlearn and the Union Learning Fund.</p>
