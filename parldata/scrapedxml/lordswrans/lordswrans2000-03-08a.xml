	<p pid="a.137.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/2" qnum="HL1170">What discussions they have held with the Polish and Czech Governments about the possible diversion to Sudan of arms sold to Yemen; and whether they consider that the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of November 1993 need to be amended to strengthen monitoring of the end use of arms exports to prevent diversions to third countries and to ensure that exported equipment is used only on the conditions under which the export licence has been granted.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.2/1">The Foreign Secretary raised this with his Czech counterpart. Our Embassy in Prague has also discussed this with the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Czech Government plan to proceed with the sale of former Czech army tanks to Yemen but have assured us that they are taking great care to ensure that Yemen is the end user and that there is no diversion to a third country. We have not held discussions with the Poles as we are not aware that any further sales are planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/2">The OSCE Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers commit OSCE members to avoid transfers which would be likely to be diverted within the recipient country or re-exported for purposes contrary to the aims of the principles. It is up to individual OSCE members to decide how they can best achieve this. Post-export monitoring may be less effective in preventing diversion than a refusal to allow an export if a risk of diversion is determined to exist. The UK has taken steps to promote the exchange of information on end-users of concern in fora such as the Wassenaar Arrangement in order to assist the process of risk assessment by national authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.5/2">The report contained a total of 33 recommendations, a large number of which could have been adopted by individual forces immediately, while others which required progressing at a national level could not. Examples of these include the development of driving simulator technology appropriate to police application (recommendation 21), and the police service is currently working alongside the Police Scientific Development Branch to achieve this goal. Another is where core training courses were to be established (recommendations 11, 12 and 13) and work in this regard is due to be completed by August this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.3/2">The FV430 handbrake is not separate from the vehicle's service braking and steering system. The handbrake function is achieved by securing the tiller-actuated service braking and steering system in the ON position by means of a ratchet mechanism. This arrangement complies with regulation 16, schedule 3, number 16 in that the parking brake (hand brake) &quot;is so designed and constructed that . . . It can set so, as in the case of track laying vehicle, to lock the tracks&quot;. However, schedule 3, number 7 requires that &quot;the application of any means of operation of a braking system shall not affect or operate the pedal or hand lever of any other means of operation&quot;. In this respect FV430 is not compliant and is operated under the terms of an exemption (the Motor Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) General Order 1979 (SI 1979 No 1198), Part II, Article 6) which authorises the Secretary of State for Defence to use specified vehicles notwithstanding that such vehicles do not comply in all respects with the requirements of the construction and use regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.6/1">IMPACT was the Industry and MoD Programme to Accelerate CALS (Continuous Acquisition and Life-Cycle Support) implementation Today. The purpose was to manage the introduction of electronic information exchange and sharing to support the acquisition process for defence equipment programmes. The IMPACT team comprised part-time members from both MoD and industry who were managed jointly by MoD and the UK CALS Industry Council (UKCIC).</p>
	<p pid="a.147.6/2">The programme originated in January 1996 from a MoD and UKCIC combined top-level seminar to discuss the way forward for defence procurement in the information age. The seminar led to agreement between MoD and UKCIC on six issues which needed to be taken forward. These were the procurement process and value for money; CALS in legacy projects; utilising information technology; standards; data protection; and data management.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.6/3">A joint working group of three industry and three MoD personnel was established to progress the work. Each of the six issues above was examined in detail and the working group identified a number of common themes which ran through them. From these common themes a work plan was developed based upon seven individual projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.6/4">With the introduction of Smart procurement, the IMPACT work took on a much broader perspective. Consequently, a full-time joint MoD and industry team, now called the Joint Enterprise Integration Task Force, has been established to manage the introduction of a secure shared data environment for the defence sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.6/5">The programme of work is directed by a Joint CALS Steering Group comprising the Chief of Defence Procurement, Chief of Defence Logistics, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Equipment Capability) and three senior managers from the UK defence industry.</p>

The Government have also agreed to pay certain costs relating to client care for all claims, including those that are unsuccessful.

It is entirely a matter for the individual solicitors whether they choose to charge on this basis and we understand that some firms are doing so, while others have chosen not to. However, we would hope that they would take account of the Govenment's agreement to meet certain costs for unsuccessful claims. We have always made it clear that our primary concern is to see that miners are properly compensated for the injuries that they have suffered and we would hope that solicitors who represent them would share the same aim.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.5/1">Estimates based on the 1996-97 Family Resources Survey suggested that take up of disability living allowance (DLA) at that time ranged from 30 to 50 per cent for the care component and from 50 to 70 per cent for the mobility component. While it is reasonable to assume that it is normally less severely disabled people, likely to receive smaller awards, who do not claim, it is not possible to estimate reliably the total additional expenditure which would occur if everyone with a potential entitlement to DLA were to make a successful claim. It follows that, although actual expenditure on DLA in 1998-99 was about 7 per cent below the 1998 Budget forecast, this shortfall cannot be related to the amount of potentially unclaimed benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.0/1">The figure of &pound;754 million in the National Audit Office's report is the difference between forecast and actual expenditure on attendance allowance, disability living allowance, invalid care allowance and severe disablement allowance in 1998-99. This was because, although the number of people receiving disability benefits and total expenditure on these benefits had continued to increase, these increases were at a slower rate than expected. An important reason for this change has been improvements to the management of the benefits, for example the safeguarding project where supplementary evidence is sought for all claims involving DLA higher rate mobility component.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/2">Although the &pound;754 million is not therefore an estimate of unclaimed benefit, it is important to ensure those who are entitled to benefits are able to claim them with a degree of confidence. At the time the National Audit Office's report was published we had already initiated measures to improve the take-up of attendance allowance and disability living allowance through increased public confidence in decisions on entitlement, and these measures continue. This will also open the way for more people to receive invalid care allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/3">Severe disablement allowance fails to help those it was intended to help and the changes we are introducing from April 2001 will concentrate resources on young people who have never had an opportunity to work and build up a contribution record.</p>
