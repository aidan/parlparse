	<p pid="b.272.0/1">The tax-free resettlement grant is part of the wider remuneration and pension scheme arrangements for the Armed Forces. In part it is designed to have a &quot;pull through&quot; effect by encouraging individuals to complete longer service within their open engagement period. There is clear statistical evidence detailed in the DASA service manpower outflow charts that a significant proportion of personnel stay until they qualify for the grant. The relevant service points are nine years for officers and 12 years for other ranks under the Armed Forces pension scheme 2005 arrangements. While it is too early for evidence to emerge of the effectiveness of the grant under the new Armed Forces pension scheme 2005 arrangements, the opportunity was taken on the introduction of the new scheme to harmonise the qualification period for the grant to 12 years for officers and other ranks. We expect a similar &quot;pull through&quot; effect to be evident as statistics emerge for the new scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.0/2">The resettlement grant should be viewed within the context of an overall resettlement package which includes access to individually tailored resettlement training, careers advice, workshops and general job finding assistance. This overall package is designed to ensure that all service leavers make a successful transition to civilian life on completion of their time in the Armed Forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.273.3/1">Winter fuel payments are worth &pound;200 to households with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to households with someone aged 80 or over. Estimates suggest that taxing winter fuel payments for higher rate taxpayers would raise revenue of around &pound;80 million. This would represent an increase of around &pound;9.40 for each of the 8.5 million households that receive winter fuel payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.3/2">The estimation of revenue raised excludes those in residential care and relies on a number of simplifying assumptions such as 100 per cent take-up of winter fuel payments and no behavioural change. Taxing winter fuel payments for higher rate taxpayers would be administratively complicated, and this administrative cost is also not taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.8/1">Northern Ireland civil servants below the senior Civil Service who are awarded a Box 1 or Box 2 annual performance assessment may be eligible to receive an additional non-consolidated, non-pensionable performance bonus in the form of a lump sum payment. The values of the bonuses in 2005 were &pound;400 for a Box 1 performer and &pound;200 for a Box 2 performer.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.8/2">A non-consolidated bonus is also payable to a proportion of senior Civil Service (SCS) staff. Non-consolidated bonus payments emphasise the importance of ongoing high performance as measured by in-year delivery relative to objectives. In 2006 the non-consolidated bonus payments for members of the SCS (including permanent secretaries) ranged from &pound;3,000 to &pound;12,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.8/3">Non-pensionable bonuses are also paid under the Northern Ireland Civil Service special bonus scheme to reward exceptional performance in particularly demanding tasks or situations at any time. The scheme is applicable to both non-industrial and industrial staff and bonuses normally fall within the range of &pound;250 to &pound;500, but where higher should not exceed &pound;1,000. The total cost of this scheme is restricted to 0.2 per cent of pay bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.279.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibilities of the independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which has been asked to reply. The chief executive officer has responded:</p>
	<p pid="b.279.2/2">I assume that the noble Lord refers to the press release published by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase>, and the associated formal response to Ofcom on its proposals to extend charge controls in respect of mobile voice call termination. In its formal response, the Commission was broadly supportive of Ofcom's proposal to extend existing charge controls to 3G voice call termination (and to impose a new four-year control to apply irrespective of whether the call is delivered using a 2G or a 3G network). The Commission expressed some concern, however, about Ofcom's assessment of the cost of spectrum used to deliver such calls and invited Ofcom to reconsider its proposed conclusion. Ofcom is currently considering the views of the Commission and UK stakeholders, and plans to publish a concluding statement in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.2/3">The Government are not aware that the Commission has expressed any views on the broader question of whether it is appropriate for mobile phone companies to recoup some or all of the 3G licence costs through charges for telecoms services.</p>

	<p pid="b.280.8/1">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) proposes to run a competition to select a parent body organisation for the Sellafield site licence company. This parent body will own the site licence company for the period of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.8/2">The competition process will be in accordance with Office of Government Commerce (OGC) guidelines (and will be subject to review by the OGC at key stages); the Public Contracts Regulations 2006; and relevant EU procurement directives. In this context, an <I>Official Journal of the European Union</I> prior information notice has been issued and a contract notice is due to be published in the <I>Official Journal of the European Union</I> at the beginning of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.8/3">The NDA's evaluation of proposals from bidders will be against robust and objective criteria relating to the role of a parent body. The development of specific criteria and their evaluation, which the NDA will also undertake, are commercially sensitive. The competition process will conclude when the NDA has selected the proposal offering best value for money (the most economically advantageous tender) in terms of meeting both Energy Act 2004 requirements, and the NDA strategy commitments to safety, security, environmental performance, socio-economic impact, and the delivery of nuclear decommissioning and operations. The NDA has consulted widely on the development of its competition strategy and award principles. Consultation has included workforce and the local community representatives as well as regulators (eg, the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate).</p>
	<p pid="b.280.8/4">The NDA will in due course seek my department's endorsement that the competition process has been carried out correctly and fairly, and that the process of awarding the contract and the transition to the successful bidder for the Sellafield site licence company ownership can commence.</p>

	<p pid="b.289.5/1">The task of developing and providing prison establishments with appropriate clinical information technology hardware and software has always been recognised as an integral corollary of the transfer of healthcare responsibility from the Home Office to this department from April 2006. Within the department, the provision of strategic IT systems is undertaken by the National Health Service Connecting for Health (NHS CfH) agency as a part of the wider national programme for information technology in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.289.5/2">There is no single national start or completion date for individual national programme systems and services. The aim is to achieve substantial integration of health and social care information systems in England under the national programme by 2010. In line with best practice, this involves implementing new services incrementally, avoiding a big bang approach, and providing increasingly richer functionality over time.</p>
	<p pid="b.289.5/3">However, planning is under way to extend compliant primary care systems to support prison healthcare. Mental health and limited secondary care functionality will be added at a later date as applications become available. The first practical step to achieving this goal is in the form of providing the necessary connectivity to the N3 network in the prison estate. This has two aspects: providing broadband connections to prison establishments, and developing a network infrastructure in establishments. This month, &pound;3 million will be specifically allocated through strategic health authorities to enhance prison healthcare IT infrastructure, with work due to complete by March 2007. NHS CfH is liaising with the Prison Service and primary care trusts to oversee implementation of this phase of the programme, based on local costed plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.291.3/1">The<I> Lancet </I>article refers to the third known case of vCJD transmission via blood transfusion from a vCJD-infected donor. This case was originally notified to the department in January 2006 and announced by the Health Protection Agency in a press release on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February 2006</phrase>, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.3/2">There are 24 living patients in a group of people who had received blood components from donors subsequently known to have developed vCJD. They were all notified in 2005 or earlier, through their GPs, of their risk status and have been provided with information and support. The Health Protection Agency contacted the GPs earlier in the year to notify them of this third case and the agency has ensured that the GPs are fully informed and briefed about the subsequent <I>Lancet</I> publication.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.3/3">The department has implemented a series of measures to reduce the risk of vCJD being transmitted through the blood supply. Shortly after vCJD was first identified in 1996, the possibility of human-to-human transmission through blood was considered, and the department implemented precautionary measures to reduce what was, at that time, a theoretical risk. These measures have been strengthened since evidence of transmission via blood began to emerge from animal studies, and following the first case of transfusion-associated transmission in humans, reported in December 2003. An important additional step, introduced in March 2004, was to exclude from blood donation those people who had themselves received a blood transfusion since January 1980. Other precautionary measures include:</p>
	<p pid="b.291.3/4">from December 1997, blood components, plasma products or tissues obtained from any individual who later develops vCJD, were withdrawn/recalled; in July 1998, it was announced that plasma for the manufacture of blood products, such as clotting factors, would be obtained from non-UK sources;from November 1999, white blood cells, which may carry a significant risk of transmitting vCJD, were removed from all blood used for transfusion;in August 2002, it was announced that fresh frozen plasma for treating babies and young children born on or after <phrase class="date" code="1996-01-01">1 January 1996</phrase> would be obtained from the USA; in July 2004, the exclusion criteria for blood donation were extended to include previously transfused platelet donors, and donors who were unsure if they had previously had a blood transfusion;in September 2004, the department announced further precautionary measures for patients who had received certain batches of plasma products;in July 2005, the use of USA-sourced fresh frozen plasma was extended to all children up to the age of 16;in July 2005, the department announced further precautionary measures for those patients who donated blood to three people who later developed vCJD.</p>

At the London conference in January 2006, DfID committed to providing &pound;330 million in development assistance over the next three years. This forms part of the UK's overall pledge of &pound;500 million over the next three years to reduce poverty, improve security and governance and tackle the opium industry. The UK aid budget for Afghanistan is &pound;102 million this year, rising to &pound;113 million in 2007-08, and &pound;115 million in 2008-09. In addition, DfID contributes 18 per cent&mdash;around &pound;125 million&mdash;of the European Commission's pledge of &euro;1 billion over 2002-2007, and 10.4 per cent of the World Bank's spending in Afghanistan of $250-300 million a year.

Summary. A review of command relationships training conducted during individual training courses was undertaken in 2004. As a result of this review, it was recommended that a further review of training objectives was to be conducted in conjunction with arm and service directors to ensure that training objectives are included in appropriate phase 2 and 3 courses for both TA and regular officers and soldiers, where training is not already delivered.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/9"> <td>2.</td> <td>The board recommends that any operations room operating in this sort of environment adopts a uniform booking out system. It further recommends that the system be checked on a regular basis to ensure that all attached units are complying and that an all informed patrol matrix is being maintained.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. A review of operations room procedures training conducted during individual training courses was undertaken in 2004. As a result of this review, it was recommended that a further review of training objectives was to be conducted in conjunction with arm and service directors to ensure that training objectives are included in appropriate phase 2 and 3 courses for both TA and regular officers and soldiers, where training is not already delivered.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/10"> <td>3.</td> <td>The board recommends that watchkeepers are trained in maintaining a log and that it is made clear to them that logs could potentially become an exhibit in legal proceedings.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. A review of watchkeeping skills training conducted during individual training courses was undertaken in 2004. As a result of this review, it was recommended that a further review of training objectives was to be conducted in conjunction with arm and service directors to ensure that training objectives are included in appropriate phase 2 and 3 courses for both TA and regular officers and soldiers, where training is not already delivered.   The specific requirements for maintenance, accuracy and retention of the log are to appear as a reminder on the cover of the log sheet (Army form B58).</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/11"> <td>4.</td> <td>The board recommends that a review be conducted of Royal Military Police (RMP) officer training to ensure that its young officers are better trained to command small isolated detachments. Additionally, the board recommends that thought is given to the RMP carrying out more infantry training, specifically focusing on infantry skills.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. Provost Marshal (Army) review of operational performance standards for Military Police Officers Course (MPOC) and RMP Company Commander's Course (CCC) has taken place. Adjutant-General Corps Training and Development Team has amended training objectives for both courses to include the management of command and control relationships at the appropriate level, when operating both integral to and detached from RMP units. Training has been delivered to MPOC from April 2005 and RMP CCC from September 2005. The recommendation for RMP to carry out additional infantry training was not agreed as there is no indication that any shortfall in infantry training had any bearing on the outcome of this incident. Training of the RMP must reflect the functional requirement and be based upon policing and associated skills within an all arms environment.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/12"> <td>5.</td> <td>The board strongly recommends that a detailed communications estimate is carried out on entering theatre, which is then regularly updated. Additionally, urgent operational requirement (UOR) funds should be made available to purchase additional, off-the-shelf communications assets as required.</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. Theatre communications estimates are carried out in all cases and reviewed at regular intervals. The type and number of communications systems available in theatre has increased significantly, heavily utilising the UOR process. Additions include: 210 Thuraya Sat phones, improved and extended coalition secure tactical network and improved coverage of Iraqi mobile phone network.   In addition the Army is currently in the process of totally overhauling its communications equipment as part of the Bowman project (providing an increase in reliability and availability of communications assets).   Theatre standard operating procedures have been revised to ensure that all patrols deploy with a minimum of two separate forms of communications, in two separate vehicles, to allow for redundancy (this policy also applies to Afghanistan)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/13"> <td>6.</td> <td>The board recommends an assessment be carried out as to the suitability for the RMP to train and operate the general purpose machine gun (GPMG).</td> <td>Closed.   Summary. GPMGs have been added to the equipment table of RMP units for the purposes of self-protection at a scaling of five per regiment and three per independent company, to provide for local area protection.   Note: There was no evidence to suggest that a lack of firepower had any bearing on the outcome of this incident, and the chain of command expressed concerns that the issue of heavy weapons would detract from the ability of the RMP to conduct its primary function. No further staff action was taken regarding the recommendation for training.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/14"> <td>7.</td> <td>All personnel issued with grenades must be trained in their operating procedures before issue.</td> <td>Closed.   It is mandatory that soldiers complete all basic lessons and weapon-handling tests (WHT) before any live firing/throwing of weapons takes place. Appropriate reminders are to be periodically issued to the chain of command.   Note: The board had raised concerns that grenades were issued to the RMP without appropriate training, but it should be noted that within the context of this operation, grenades had been withdrawn from the whole battlegroup on the basis that they were no longer appropriate. There was therefore no suggestion that the lack of grenades had any direct bearing on the outcome of this incident.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/15"> <td>8.</td> <td>The scaling of ammunition should be set at battlegroup (BG) level and individual detachment commanders should not be able to dictate ammunition holdings.</td> <td>Closed   The PJHQ has reviewed current policy for the scaling of ammunition for operational theatres and has confirmed that extant procedures for calculating overall scales using A606 procedures should remain. Minimum scales for individual weapons are to be set at BG level to ensure consistency throughout the area of responsibility and individual detachment commanders are not to be allowed to reduce holdings below this level.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/16"> <td>9.</td> <td>The board recommends that morphine is made available to soldiers operating in potentially hostile environments.</td> <td>Closed.   Morphine is available to all personnel operating in all potentially hostile environments, as long as there are no contraindications to its use. The actual decision as to whether to issue it in any given situation is a tactical one, based on an adequate risk assessment and is an executive rather than a medical one.   Note: The board had concluded that morphine was available if it had been asked for. Concerns over misuse, which is not supported by any evidence provided to the board, or the risk of disciplinary action if lost was not considered germane to the board's proceedings. The policy for accounting for controlled drugs already existed when this recommendation was made.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/17"> <td>10.</td> <td>The board recommends that, where practical, consideration be given to providing an officer from Army Legal Services as a BOI member.</td> <td>Closed.   The advantage of having an Army Legal Services officer as either the president or a member of a board of inquiry had already been recognised and was reflected in standing orders at the time the recommendation was made.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/18"> <td>11.</td> <td>HQ LAND gives direction on the outstanding disciplinary issues which should be resolved before the findings are exposed to the families.</td> <td>Closed.   Disciplinary action had been ruled out prior to the release of the board of inquiry report to the families of the six RMP.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.296.2/19"> <td>12.</td> <td>Any meeting between the families and MoD representatives are carefully orchestrated, with terms of reference agreed in advance.</td> <td>Closed   Procedures already exist to handle all such meetings with sensitivity.</td> </tr>

There was a surge in applications in divisional planning offices covering rural areas just before the draft policy was published. However, the underlying trend is down. It is also important to note more generally in this context that processing times for applications are influenced by a variety of factors, including the statutory requirement to advertise proposals, neighbour notification arrangements, the need to consult statutory and non-statutory bodies, consideration of all responses and representations received, the complexity of the planning issues raised, and the level of demand in the system as a whole at any one time.</p>

	<p pid="b.306.9/4">Traffic congestion in Enniskillen is typical of many similar provincial towns in Northern Ireland. However, it is recognised by Roads Service that Enniskillen is an island town and that this in itself contributes to problems for traffic progression. We are, therefore, progressing two significant schemes to address traffic congestion in the town. Gaol Square is to be signalised (to facilitate a major redevelopment with the developer bearing the costs). Also, notices of statutory orders were published in December 2006, for a scheme to provide an additional lane on the western (Henry Street) approach to the town.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.9/5">I am also pleased to advise that another major works scheme, Cherrymount Link, (which will link the A32 Irvinestown Road with the B80 Tempo Road) is being progressed. It is hoped to publish statutory orders for this scheme in mid-2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.306.12/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question about when the process of putting new street lights on the Earlswood Road, East Belfast commenced; when it is planned that the works will be completed; and why no work has been carried out during the past two months.

	<p pid="b.306.12/4">Work on the replacement of the old existing street lighting on Earlswood Road commenced in July 2006. At that time, it was anticipated that it would be completed by September 2006. Unfortunately, during the execution of the work, it was found that the proposed location of the Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) supply control point was unsuitable due to the presence of other underground services.</p>
	<p pid="b.306.12/5">I am pleased to report that following discussions with NIE, a new location for the supply control point has been found and that it is now planned to have the new lighting operational by <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.307.2/1">The recent Leitch review on skills supports the stance that estimating the exact number of skilled or otherwise qualified personnel to fulfil the needs of science-related industries is difficult and not advisable in a dynamic and rapidly changing economy. It does not believe that the Government should aim to predict the impact of future technological advances and attempt centrally to provide the skills they believe will be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.307.2/2">The Government can and do analyse data on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects, employment rates of science graduates, international comparisons of stocks and flows of science skills, and consider national employer skills surveys. Such analyses (for example, the DTI's economic paper No. 16 <I>Science, Engineering and Technology Skills in the UK </I>March 2006, and DfES research report 775: <I>The Supply and Demand for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Skills in the UK Economy</I>) suggest that, at the broadest level, the supply of STEM skills is likely to meet demand over the next decade. However, we accept that there is the need for further action regarding the situation for specific science subjects, such as engineering and physical sciences. The falls in participation in mathematics and science A-levels are equally a cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.307.2/3">The Government have, therefore, made science education a high priority. The <I>Science and Innovation Investment Framework 2004-14: Next Steps</I> and STEM programme reports set out our commitment to improving STEM skills by increasing attainment of science and mathematics at GCSE level, increasing participation in science subjects post-16 and improving the quality and number of science teachers.</p>

	<p pid="b.311.6/1">The chief executive of Water Service (Mrs Katharine Bryan) has been asked to write to the noble Lord in response to this Question.</p>
	<p pid="b.311.6/2"><I>Letter from Mrs Katharine Bryan to Lord Laird dated December 2006.</I></p>
	<p pid="b.311.6/3">You recently asked a Parliamentary Question to ask Her Majesty's Government what proposals they have to invest in sewerage facilities in the Coleraine, Portrush and Portstewart areas (HL955). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.311.6/4">Water Service is investing significant resources to upgrade the sewerage facilities in this area in order to cater for the existing and future needs of the residents and to meet increasingly stringent environmental standards. An extensive study of the north coast area, in terms of existing and required wastewater treatment facilities up to the year 2032, was completed by Water Service in 2002. The study, which took account of technical, economic and environmental considerations, concluded that the construction of a new wastewater treatment works to serve Coleraine, Portrush, Portstewart, Castlerock and Articlave represented the optimum solution for the provision of the wastewater treatment facilities required in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.311.6/5">The North Coast Wastewater Treatment Works scheme is a substantial project, costing in the region of &pound;45 million. Construction commenced in January 2005 and the works are now nearing completion. Wastewater flows are scheduled to be diverted from Portstewart in April 2007, Portrush and Coleraine in May 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.311.6/6">Work associated with the construction of new pumping stations at Coleraine, Portrush, Portstewart Castlerock and Articlave, which will allow transfer flows to the new north coast works, will permit the removal of effluent discharges to the Articlave and Bann Rivers and to the sea at Castlerock, Blackrock and Ramore Head. A considerable amount of work has already been completed on the upgrading of the sewerage network in the Portrush and Portstewart areas and a number of recommendations identified by a study of the Coleraine area have been included in Water Service's capital investment programme.</p>
