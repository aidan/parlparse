	<p pid="b.11.8/1">Exports of all controlled (military or dual use) items and all transfers of controlled technology from the UK require an export licence. When submitting a licence application, exporters are required to say whether the proposed export is for the purposes of overseas production, and the Government's licence assessment will then take account of the specific risks associated with this. The current controls therefore apply to many elements of the supply chain on which overseas production depends.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.8/2">The Government launched a review of the current export control legislation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June 2007</phrase>. This included a public consultation, which examined a wide range of issues, including the controls on licensed production overseas, and specifically sought the views of respondents on a range of change options.

	<p pid="b.17.3/1">Four thousand eight hundred and seventy children under the age of 18 were removed from the UK in 2005 and 5,795 in 2006. These figures include enforced removals, persons refused entry at port and subsequently removed, persons departing voluntarily after enforcement action had been initiated against them, persons leaving under assisted voluntary return programmes run by the International Organization for Migration and those whom it is established have left the UK without informing the immigration authorities. They include both asylum and non-asylum cases. These figures are rounded to the nearest five; the figure for 2006 is provisional.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.3/2">An unaccompanied child under the age of 18 would not be considered for removal from the UK unless it has been established with the country to which the child is to be removed that adequate reception arrangements are in place.

Until this work is complete, we will not be able to determine the UK's position towards ratification, including whether we would need to make any reservations. At the adoption of the convention at both the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, the UK made an interpretative statement clarifying our understanding of certain provisions, including what constitutes an enforced disappearance, the application of obligations under international humanitarian law and the procedures applicable to the adoption and placement of children found to have resulted from an enforced disappearance.

	<p pid="b.26.3/1">The Government responded to the request from the European Court of Human Rights on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase> stating that we do not consider that the current situation in Sri Lanka warrants the suspension of removal directions to all Sri Lankan Tamils but we will continue to suspend removal in individual cases where the European Court has issued a Rule 39 indication.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.3/2">We continue to carefully assess each case on its individual circumstances taking into account relevant case law and the current situation in Sri Lanka before a decision is made to remove from the United Kingdom.</p>
