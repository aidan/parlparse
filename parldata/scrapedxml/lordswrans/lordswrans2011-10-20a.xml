If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more, including creating the balance sheet capacity necessary to do so. &#163;76 billion of this lending capacity will be available to small and medium-sized enterprises.

As this is small scale and will not involve spraying anything into the atmosphere other than a small amount of water, this is not considered to be geo-engineering according to the definition laid out by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. A stage-gate advisory panel has been set up to ensure the project progresses safely and responsibly. Thus we believe SPICE will not contravene any international agreements.</p>

This notes that &quot;studies that better identify transaction cost effects seem to find more often a positive relationship between transactions costs and volatility&quot;.

This concluded that there is no convincing evidence that securities transaction taxes lower short-term price volatility, and indeed that several studies find a positive relationship between transaction costs and volatility. A full copy of the working paper is available at: <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp1154.pdf">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp1154.pdf</a>.</p>
