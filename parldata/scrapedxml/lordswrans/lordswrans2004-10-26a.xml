Owing to the tragic events in Beslan, Russia, earlier that month, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary reconsidered the timing of the launch. He believed that it was the time to focus on the grief and sense of loss of the Russian people as a whole and on the total culpability of the terrorists responsible for this atrocity. The Foreign Secretary also wanted to consider how best to reflect the tragedy in Beslan in the text of the annual report.

	<p pid="a.117.1/2" qnum="HL4521">How they will share the costs between the Mayor of London, the National Lottery and the Exchequer of any public subsidy required by the London 2012 Olympics in excess of the &pound;2.375 billion already confirmed within the June 2003 Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the Mayor of London on Olympic funding; and</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/3" qnum="HL4546">In line with their funding formula for the hosting of the London Olympic Games in 2012, what would be the anticipated precept levels for Londoners assuming an overspend of (a) &pound;1 billion; (b) &pound;2 billion; and (c) &pound;3 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/1">The robust and business-like approach to planning and financial controls on the part of the Olympic stakeholders are designed to prevent such overspend. As the Memorandum of Understanding, laid before the Parliament as Command Paper 5867, states in paragraph 17, in the event of any overspend the Government will be the ultimate guarantor. We further reported this to Parliament in a Departmental Minute dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-02">2 December 2003</phrase>. As the memorandum goes on to say, the Government expect to discharge that responsibility (should it arise) in a sharing agreement to be agreed as appropriate with the Mayor of London and through seeking additional National Lottery funding in amounts to be agreed at the time. At this stage however, no such specific sharing arrangements exist. Whatever the arrangements which might apply, levels of any London council tax precept would be a matter for the Mayor of London.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.5/1">The proposals in the Gambling Bill which relate to casinos should have no adverse impact in terms of crime. There is no reason why, for example, making it possible for casinos to advertise or removing the requirement that they must operate as members' clubs should have such an impact. On the contrary, the Bill will provide the Gambling Commission with monitoring and investigative powers which the Gaming Board now lacks, and the ability to exchange information about casino operators and applicants for casino licences with bodies with whom the Board has no information gateway. The commission will also have more resources than the board; and the prevention of gambling from being a source of crime, being associated with crime or being used to support crime will be one of its statutory functions. It is also relevant that casinos are already subject to the European Union's second money-laundering directive, and will be subject to the provisions of the further directive which now under discussion. We have received no representations from the police about the impact of the Bill in relation to serious or organised crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/1">The Government have worked very closely with the BVA in developing the Animal Health and Welfare Strategy. There are some areas where the BVA argues that Government should adopt a more interventionist approach, in particular, the licensing of livestock farms, the introduction of compulsory farm health plans and annual veterinary visits. The BVA has also called for greater level of government spending in this area, particularly in respect of veterinary surveillance.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.0/1">No decision has yet been taken on whether the Government should introduce any form of renewable transport fuels obligation. It is one of a number of policy options which the Government are currently considering as a way of supporting the development and use of biofuels in the UK. Before introducing any obligation, the Government would consult extensively on how it might operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/2">The Government are considering greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors, including transport, in the context of the climate change review announced by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in September. The review will include an update of greenhouse gas emissions projections and an assessment of the costs and benefits to the UK of further measures to reduce emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.6/1">The decision on whether to carry scooters on trains is a matter for individual train operating companies (TOCs). There is no legislation that either prohibits them from carrying scooters or requires them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.6/2">There is a wide and growing range of scooter models available, each with its own capabilities and characteristics. However, scooters are generally not considered to be suitable for carriage on public transport, including trains because of concerns over size, weight, manoeuvrability and stability. Both the Department for Transport and the Department of Health have published guides explaining this. These are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.6/3">We believe that operators are best placed to decide whether to carry scooters, according to the rolling stock they use and the local operating environment. The majority of TOCs will not carry them. Both the Government and TOCs are aware, however, that smaller, lighter, more manoeuvrable models are now available. In light of this, some train companies have been re-examining their current policies, with some relaxing their complete bans and permitting the carriage of smaller models.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.6/4">Officials recently observed a trial by South West Trains, during which a range of scooter models attempted to board and park safely on the different types of train that SWT uses. The results showed the difficulty of having a single policy, and confirmed that TOCs are best placed to decide their own procedures, according to their own particular operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.6/5">Individual companies' policy should be available as part of their disabled persons' protection policies, which they are required to produce by the Strategic Rail Authority. Copies of these policies are available from stations or from the TOCs' websites.</p>
