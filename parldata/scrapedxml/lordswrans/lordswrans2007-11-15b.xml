	<p pid="b.27.5/1">We believe that we have a good balance. DfID's Afghanistan programme channels more than 80 per cent of its funding through Afghan government systems, as this is the best way of extending the legitimacy and authority of the Government, strengthening government capacity and co-ordinating donor funding. It is also an effective way of spending aid money. A study by the Peace Dividend Trust conducted in 2006-07 estimated the local economic impact of aid spent through government systems to be more than four times greater than aid spent through international contractors or non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
	<p pid="b.27.5/2">However, DfID works indirectly with NGOs across Afghanistan since NGOs are the major implementing partners for the Afghan government programmes that DfID funds with other donors. For example, the National Solidarity Programme disburses funding through 23 NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.5/3">UK funds are also available for NGO work in Afghanistan through the joint DfID, MoD, and FCO Global Conflict Prevention Pool and through various DfID-wide funding pools for civil society and humanitarian work.</p>

The IDLG is seeking both political and financial support from donors, and officials have met with the director, Gilani Popal, and other government Ministers on a number of occasions to discuss plans for the IDLG's activities. President Karzai has mandated the IDLG with securing insecure provinces to the south and south-east of Kabul in the short to medium-term and with improving governance at provincial, district and community level to improve the delivery of basic services. It is too early to judge how successful this will be, as the IDLG was established only eight weeks ago and is still discussing its mandate and work plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.3/1">We were keen to establish the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority as quickly as possible. The Pensions Act 2007 provides for a minimum of three members of the authority at any time and, in line with accepted principles of good corporate governance, that at least half the board, excluding the chair, should be non-executives. The chair, chief executive and one non-executive director have been appointed as part of the first phase of board recruitment. Further appointments, including further non-executive directors, are planned for the first quarter of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.6/1">We are working with police forces and authorities to create additional capability and capacity across the country for the delivery of protective services, including the police response to level 2 crime, by encouraging them to explore opportunities for collaboration. We have also asked police forces and authorities to assess their demand for protective services and put in place plans to improve their delivery. We will be measuring forces' performance in these areas from 2008-09 and new national standards have been introduced by the Association of Chief Police Officers, which set the benchmark for inspections that are currently under way by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.6/2">We have also invested in the development of an intelligence unit to tackle level 2 crime in each police region and we have contributed to the growth of a serious crime investigatory unit in the east Midlands.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.2/1">Unlike in the United Kingdom, the police service in Sweden is a national force, reporting to a national police board and to parliament and ministers. The educational programmes of the Swedish National Police Academy are formed in accordance with the directives issued by the Government and parliament. It is thus a more centralised system than that which exists than in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.2/2">The tripartite arrangement for policing in the UK means that the Swedish model is not one that would be suitable for direct import here, although the National Policing Improvement Agency has been working with the Swedish National Policing Agency and police from other EU countries in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.2/3">Putting aside the predetermined career path that the rank structure imposes, there currently is no mandated development path for police officers. However, at the national level a number of mechanisms exist to assist senior police officers in their career development. Importantly, these also assure the quality of senior police leadership.</p>
