They also gave commitments that the tribunal would comply with best practice as laid down by the Council on Tribunals. The council's Model Rules favour, for tribunal proceedings, a presumption of publicity with provision for private hearings. This approach is followed in the procedure rules for the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal. These were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-10">10 July 2001</phrase> after limited consultation which followed the terms of the Code of Practice on Written Consultation. A number of ministerial statements were made on publication by the Financial Services Authority of its decision notice. These statements did not specifically address procedures at the tribunal stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">Yes. The Government of Bermuda's proposals to amend the constitution were presented to the Bermuda Legislature on <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-18">18 August 2000</phrase>. The proposals were discussed in the local media and a series of public meetings were held in the autumn. Following this public debate the proposals were debated in the Bermuda House of Assembly and Senate. A resolution was passed by the House of Assembly requesting that an Order in Council be made to implement the proposals. An FCO team visited Bermuda at the beginning of April to hold consultations with the political parties and interested members of the public about the various proposals for constitutional reform. The proposal for single member constituencies reflects a pre-election manifesto commitment of the Government of Bermuda and has been endorsed by resolution of the House of Assembly. However, there will be a further opportunity to discuss proposed changes to the electoral system when the Constituency Boundaries Commission has made its report. It is premature to say that the House of Assembly will be reduced in size. Given the prescribed parameters of 20 to 40 constituencies, the commission's recommendations would not necessarily be to the effect that the number of Members of the House should be reduced from the current 40.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.3/1">Her Majesty's Government responded to the request by the democratically elected Government of Bermuda to take forward their proposals to amend the Bermuda constitution. Ministers have approved a draft Order in Council which, inter alia, will enable the Constituency Boundaries Commission to recommend the number and boundaries of constituencies in a report to the Governor. The commission would act in accordance with prescribed terms of reference and invite views from the public. The commission's report would be debated in the House of Assembly and the Governor would be required to transmit it, with the views of the House, to the Secretary of State. The report would then be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/2">Before making any decision on the commission's recommendations, further consultation with Bermuda would be required, and the Secretary of State would wish to take into account the report and local reactions to it. It would be premature now to decide that in any event a constitutional conference should be held or a referendum organised. But neither option has been ruled out. Her Majesty's Government will consider all possible options at the time. The Government do not believe that the present draft Order in Council will make major changes to the Bermuda constitution.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.0/1">The status of the European Council is governed by Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union: it was recognised as a separate Community body in 1986 by Article 2 of the Single European Act, although it had been meeting on a regular basis since 1975. It brings together the heads of state or government and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the member states and the President and one member of the Commission. It meets at least twice a year, under the chairmanship of the head of state or government of the member state holding the Presidency of the Council. Meetings are held either in the country holding the Presidency or in Brussels. Declaration 22 annexed to the Treaty of Nice provides that from 2002, one European Council meeting per Presidency will be held in Brussels. When the number of member states reaches 18, all European Council meetings will be held in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/2">The role of the European Council is to provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and to define the general political guidelines thereof. The Council of Ministers is the principal decision-making body within the Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/3">The Council Secretariat finances the travel and accommodation costs of a certain number of delegates for each member state. All other costs are met by the member state hosting the European Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.2/1">The number of businesses receiving the new farm diversification relief will depend on how many such businesses are established. There are no precise figures available on the number of businesses that will or will not benefit from the new farm diversification relief, because it is not known how many new enterprises will in future be established and how many of those will be below the qualifying rateable threshold of &pound;6,000. We have estimated that between 5 per cent and 30 per cent of farms in England may establish businesses that are eligible for the new relief, but the eventual figure will depend on demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.2/2">It is also difficult to give precise figures on the number of businesses benefiting from the extension of village shop rate relief to food shops, as they are not currently separately identified in the rating system. However, it is estimated that there are about 3,000 food shops in small rural parishes. We would expect most of these to have rateable values of less than &pound;6,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.5/1">the Green Paper Modernising Local Government Finance last year proposed a tapered scheme of rate relief, which was targeted on small businesses with rateable values up to &pound;6,000. It proposed that relief would be 50 per cent for properties with rateable values up to &pound;3,000, reducing at higher rateable values to 20 per cent at &pound;6,000 rateable value. This covers a very large number of properties. To avoid any unfairness to businesses just above the &pound;6,000 threshold, it is proposed to provide a small amount of relief to slightly larger properties, continuing to taper from 20 per cent relief at &pound;6,000 rateable value to 0 per cent relief at &pound;8,000 rateable value. The &pound;8,000 threshold is therefore the point at which businesses cease to receive any relief and above which they instead contribute to the costs of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/2">The two new rate reliefs under the 2001 Act are completely different. All qualifying businesses will receive 50 per cent rate relief, up to &pound;6,000 rateable value, with the possibility of the local authority increasing this to 100 per cent if they feel there is a need. It is therefore more generous than the one outlined in the Green Paper for all small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.5/3">Farm diversification relief is specifically designed for small non-agricultural business on farms. Information obtained from the Valuation Office Agency indicates that the vast majority of small enterprises that are typically established on farms have rateable values of less than &pound;6,000 in all parts of England. Information also suggests that most village food shops fall below this threshold.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.2/1">The Exchequer will meet 75 per cent of the cost of any discretionary relief granted under the provisions of the 2001 Act. This is the same as any other discretionary rate relief available to ratepayers. The requirement on local authorities to meet 25 per cent of the cost of granting discretionary relief does not appear to affect their granting if they feel there is a need to. Indeed experience with the existing village shop rate relief scheme would suggest that a substantial number of businesses receiving 50 per cent mandatory relief have had this topped up with discretionary relief by local authorities.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-07-24a.229.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="229"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo010724/text/10724w09.htm#10724w09_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.229.8/1">Estimates were prepared in 1998 to illustrate possible costs for notional average farms of reducing diffuse pollution. These assumed an average compliance cost of approximately &pound;175 per hectare per annum for arable land and &pound;117 per hectare per annum for grassland. These costs would be incurred annually from 2012 at the latest, when all measures required by the directive have to be operational.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.8/2">These figures did not relate to actual costs to farmers necessary to meet the directive's objectives in relation to specific measures to control agricultural pollution. This is because the need for, and use of such additional measures, has yet to be decided. The figures were based on data from a range of area-based schemes to compensate farmers for income lost as a result of changes to agricultural practice. The amount of compensation awarded provided an indication of the costs to farmers of implementing best agricultural management schemes in order to reduce pollution.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.8/3">The estimated average compliance costs do not apply to all farms and should not be assumed to apply to the whole area of any farm where a reduction in diffuse pollution was judged to be necessary. This is because action should not be required on all farms to meet the directive's objectives, nor the whole area of every farm where some action is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.8/4">The above costings therefore remain fairly speculative in nature and the Government recognise the need to update them where possible. A more accurate assessment of costs to different farm types will be possible once the Government have assessed what are the full range of additional measures necessary to address diffuse pollution from agriculture, and to what extent they would need to be used to meet the directive's objectives by 2015. The Government plan to consult on the need for additional measures in England to control diffuse agricultural pollution and other implementation issues later this year or early in 2002. Revised costings can then be provided alongside the publication of the draft implementing regulations for the directive in 2002 or early 2003. In the meantime, the Government are considering what more can be done to update and improve the 1998 estimates.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.8/1">The Government recognise that there needs to be a balance between the need to achieve the waste strategy and recycling targets through increased composting, and the need to protect animal health. Existing controls on the disposal of catering waste containing meat have been extended as a result of foot and mouth disease and have in effect prohibited the spreading on land of compost derived from catering waste from premises which handle meat. The Government are commissioning urgently an independent risk assessment to see if these controls can be lifted and what composting standards and conditions would be required to allow them to be lifted. Other areas of recycling are unaffected.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.5/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport sponsors the Imperial War Museum which, together with its major permanent exhibition about the holocaust opened in June 2000, is a powerful statement for peace and an objective historical resource about war and its impact on society. The Imperial War Museum and the Holocaust Exhibition are a major educational facility visited by children and adults from this country and from abroad and are an important resource for the national curriculum. In November 2000 a Holocaust Memorial Day education pack, which is a teaching resource for schools, was launched at the then Department for Education and Employment. The Government's policy is to increase access to existing museums rather than to create new ones.</p>

Overall, this showed that opinion generally did not differ significantly as a result of sexuality across the broad range of issues covered by the survey, but there were concerns among gay, lesbian and bisexual staff about specific questions of unfair treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.240.2/1">The average time to answer a telephone call to the PCD Helpdesk during working hours is recorded at eight seconds. However, the call handling software in use, and the way this data is currently recorded, may mean that eight seconds understates the average wait experienced by callers. PCD is therefore making changes to the call handling software to address this problem and allow more accurate recording of average waits. As all calls are treated equally, there is no difference in the average wait between calls from the parliamentary estate and calls from a remote location.</p>
