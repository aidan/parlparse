	<p pid="a.52.2/1">Following the end of the last competition in February, the Government are taking comprehensive advice on all aspects of a future Dome sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/2">Like many others, including the London Borough of Greenwich, the Government are keen to preserve the benefits of this magnificent structure for Londoners and for the United Kingdom in general, in the context of the regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula and more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/3">Advice is being provided by an independent professional team led and managed by English Partnerships on the Government's behalf. This advisory team includes Jones Lang LaSalle, Berwin Leighton and Economic Research Associates.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/4">During and since the Legacy negotiations, English Partnerships have received more than 100 informal expressions of interest for the Dome and for the development of other parts of the Greenwich Peninsula.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/5">The Government are looking at these, and, in parallel, testing the market for other interest in using the Dome. Discussions with a number of key organisations are focused at this stage on a small number of potential uses and will take several weeks to complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/6">The process being followed is consistent with professional advice, and with the aim of securing an appropriate use for the Dome which contributes towards the long-term regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula. We expect a buyer to emerge during the course of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/7">It would not be appropriate for me to disclose more details at this stage. Once the market testing has been completed and properly considered, we will announce details of the future process.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/8">In the meantime, the business of NMEC is being wound up in an orderly fashion. The cost of maintaining the Dome is around &pound;0.6 million per month and expected to reduce further.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.0/2">The lawyers' fees represent payments to Sir John Thomas, the lawyer inspector, and to other Counsel identified in the published report who provided advice and assistance during the course of the inspection. Since taking up his judicial appointment in 1996 Sir John Thomas has not sought payment in respect of his work on the inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/3">The accountants' fees represent payments to Raymond Turner, the accountant inspector, and for professional and administrative support provided to both inspectors by his firm, Mazars Neville Russell.</p>

However, direct subsidisation may not be the most effective or sustainable solution. We are working on a range of policy measures which will increase the affordability of and access to drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/2">The Government are working with developing country governments to strengthen basic health systems, without which the poorest will be unable to access the necessary drugs regardless of cost.

We are also considering a range of policy options with industry, including tiered pricing agreements (selling drugs more cheaply in poor countries) and tax measures including tax credits. In addition we are discussing with other donors, UN agencies and developing countries a Global Health Fund for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and diseases of childhood.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/4">We are also currently supporting a number of innovative public private partnerships aimed at tackling the diseases of poverty.

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">The quinquennial review (QQR) of the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) will begin in April 2001. The review will examine the role, operations and organisation of the MDP with a view to establishing the requirement for its services in the future, and how these can best be delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/2">Work to prepare for the QQR has already begun. This has principally involved canvassing the views of the MDP's customers about its effectiveness, and gathering other information with which to assess the MDP's performance since it became an agency in April 1996. Stage one of the QQR will address three fundamental questions: to what extent is there a continuing requirement for the services currently provided by the MDP; how far could organisations other than the MDP contribute to meeting those future requirements; and, if a continuing requirement for MDP services is confirmed, what organisational configuration should it have. If continued agency status is confirmed, the second stage of the QQR will develop more detailed proposals for continuing improvements in performance and quality of service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/3">The MDP is by no means the only organisation involved in providing policing and security services to the MoD. The review will therefore examine its interface with other practitioners (including Service police forces) to ensure that the MDP operates in a &quot;joined up&quot; way with them, focusing in particular on the scope for partnership working and the spread of best practice. It will also examine the way the relationship between the MDP and other UK police forces is evolving.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/4">I expect to see advice arising from stage one of the review in the summer, and from stage two, if pursued, in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/5">The review team will consult widely with all stakeholders, including customer organisations, the MDP management team, Agency staff, the Defence Police Federation, Civil Service Trades Unions, other police forces, and relevant policy staffs in MoD, the Home Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office. The MoD is also keen to hear the views of other organisations or individuals with an interest. These can be sent to the MDP QQR Team, Room 4113, MoD Main Building, London SW1A 2HB.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">Woodland makes an important contribution to the rural economy and is essential to the character of the English countryside. However, many of our woods are undermanaged and are not delivering the potential range of benefits to their owners or to society as a whole. The Forestry Commission plays a key role in ensuring the sustainable management of our woodland.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">The commission has been asked to review its support for the sustainable management of existing woodland in accordance with the priorities of the Government's Forestry Strategy for England and in the light of the UK Forestry Standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/3">The review will help to focus the Commission's work on finding ways to engage woodland owners effectively in implementing the England Forestry Strategy. This will help owners to sustain their own plans while supporting the rural economy and improving the environment for the benefit of all. While the review will consider the effectiveness of existing Forestry Commission grant schemes, we are keen to see ideas emerging on the whole range of support measures through partnerships, advice, training and market development.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/4">The review will be managed by a steering group including woodland owners and managers and representatives from appropriate government departments and agencies, as well as from Wildlife and Countryside Link. Anthony Bosanquet, president of the CLA and a non-executive Forestry Commissioner, will chair the steering group. There will be widespread public consultation, including a series of regional seminars later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/5">The Commission has been asked to submit its recommendations to Her Majesty's Government within 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.5/1">Restrictions on the movement of people or animals to or from infected premises were withdrawn 28 days after the completion of cleansing and disinfection of the premises, or 42 days after the slaughter of animals (whichever was earlier). If there had been a number of outbreaks in close proximity, these periods related to the last local case. Restocking was generally allowed after the original restriction notice was withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/2">Infected areas were reduced to a radius of five miles around the infected premises 14 days after confirmation of the outbreak. If no further outbreaks were confirmed in the following week, all restrictions were removed. If there were a number of outbreaks in one area, restrictions were kept in force for the respective number of days after the last case in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/3">Controlled area restrictions were usually removed as soon as all in-contact animals had been located and slaughtered or placed under restrictions and observed.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/4">There were special arrangements for restocking in areas where there had been heavy and persistent infection. Farmers could restock with up to 50 animals, but restocking with sheep was not permitted because of the difficulty of recognising early signs of the disease in sheep. Movement controls were maintained for a further six weeks, at which point restocking with sheep was allowed.</p>
