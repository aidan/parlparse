	<p pid="b.248.0/1">Regulation 5 of the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations 1998 requires local authorities to set their own charging schemes such that they are able fully to recover the cost of carrying out their prescribed building control functions. No additional funding has therefore been made available to local authorities in connection with enforcement of part L of the building regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/2">Post-completion checks on the whole of part L are not required in law although the Government did introduce mandatory pressure testing of new homes in 2006. This is an important part of local authorities' role and they are expected to ensure that such a test is undertaken before a completion certificate is issued. Building control is, however, a devolved service and no central targets are currently set for local authority building control departments on this or any other element of compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.248.0/3">Part L was last revised in April 2006 and was accompanied by a major dissemination and training exercise with the aim of improving compliance. As new houses are only now being built and completed to the revised standards, a post-implementation review of levels of compliance before now would have been premature. An independent assessment of compliance with part L (2006) is, however, due to begin shortly, and will form part of our preparations for the further revision of part L planned for 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.250.0/1">The regulatory impact assessments carried out as part of the consultation process for the UK Phase II National Allocation Plan estimated that UK industrial electricity prices would increase by 1 per cent and domestic prices by 0.5 per cent, compared to Phase I, as a result of the UK cap.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.0/2">The uncertainty involving the carbon price and electricity prices means that these impacts are indicative only. It is estimated that for every &euro;1 increase in the carbon price, the wholesale price of electricity increases by up to 0.45 per megawatt hour. The increases seen in electricity prices are only partly due to the impact of the carbon price. Around 75 per cent of the increase is due to rising fuel prices.</p>

Fiscal incentives have also been used; for example, renewable generating stations are exempt from the climate change levy. There have also been interest-free loans, for example, to SMEs from the Carbon Trust for renewable technologies where the carbon saving and financial characteristics meet the requirements of the energy efficiency loans scheme. In addition, the Carbon Trust funds Salix, an independent, publicly funded company, to provide interest-free invest-to-save schemes to the public sector to invest in energy efficiency measures and technologies.</p>

	<p pid="b.256.5/3">We are not aware of any legal basis for such automatic substitution. Section 58 (2)(a) of the Medicines Act 1968 provides for prescription-only medicines to be sold or supplied only in accordance with a prescription given by an appropriate practitioner. If a branded medicinal product is prescribed, then it must be dispensed. A pharmacist who substitutes another product for a branded drug without first agreeing this with the prescriber would be in breach of medicines legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.5/4">Patient information leaflets include all the relevant information on usage, side effects etc and reflect the information contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). The Government have no plans to call for the introduction of a requirement for patient information leaflets to specify the possible risks associated with the use of biosimilar medicines. If a particular risk is identified in relation to a particular product, the SPC for that product will detail that risk and the patient information leaflet will reflect the SPC.</p>

The Legal Aid Board would have taken a view on reasonableness based on the material put forward by the solicitors. Public confidence would not have been a relevant consideration. The Legal Aid Act 1988 has been superseded by the Access to Justice Act 1999 which created the Legal Services Commission (which replaced the Legal Aid Board) and tightened up the criteria for granting legal aid.</p>

	<p pid="b.259.6/2">Via EuP the European Commission is currently working to establish mandatory minimum standards for lighting products which, if agreed by member states, will establish minimum energy efficiency standards for light bulbs. Any standard agreed via this route is unlikely to specify what technology must be used to achieve or better that standard.

	<p pid="b.269.2/2">The Uzbek authorities tightly control religious practice. A degree of tolerance is permitted to traditional churches which are seen as non-proselytising Christian groups; for example, Russian Orthodox Christians and Catholics. However, proselytising groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses are not able to register and even those which are registered, such as Baptists, can experience regular harassment and are vulnerable to criminal charges for unregistered religious activity or civil charges for possession of books or religious materials which the authorities regard as &quot;missionary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.269.2/3">Freedom of religion is a key part of the human rights dialogue that we and the EU have with the Uzbek authorities.

We raise these issues with the Uzbek authorities bilaterally and with our EU colleagues through the EU-Uzbekistan Human Rights Dialogue.

	<p pid="b.271.0/1">The Environment Agency has a policy of preventing deterioration in the environmental quality of rivers, which is being carried forward into its duty under the European water framework directive to prevent deterioration in the ecological and chemical status of all water bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/2">In accordance with this policy, the Environment Agency determines applications for consent to discharge effluent to controlled waters with the aim of preventing deterioration in water quality. The Environment Agency may refuse an application for a discharge where the receiving water does not have adequate capacity to receive the effluent or there are better environmental options available that are economically viable.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.0/3">In the five-yearly periodic review of water company price limits, the Environment Agency and water companies identify sewerage infrastructure schemes; for example, increases to the treatment capacity of sewage treatment works to take account of planned housing developments.</p>
