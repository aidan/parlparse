	<p pid="a.378.2/1">The Department for Transport commissioned an air traffic review and airport capacity assessment study in late 2009. This estimated that between <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-17">17 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2012-08-16">16 August 2012</phrase>, the Games could be expected to generate approximately 240,000 additional commercial passengers over and above baseline traffic levels at the five core London airports. This would equate to approximately 200 additional commercial aircraft movements on peak days, an increase of approximately 6 per cent above baseline levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.2/2">In addition, the study forecast over 10,000 business and corporate aircraft movements and approximately 240 heads of state flights during the Games period. On top of this, an as yet unquantified number of general aviation leisure flights might seek to operate in the airspace over the south-east of England during this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.2/3">The study concluded that the forecast commercial, business and heads of state traffic could broadly be accommodated, but only by making efficient use of all existing airport infrastructure across the wider south-east. In order to maximise available capacity, of both airports and controlled airspace, the department is currently consulting on proposals temporarily to extend full airport slot co-ordination, currently only applicable at Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and London City airports, to some 40 airports across the region expected to attract Games related traffic.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.2/4">Separately, NATS, the air navigation service provider, is consulting on proposals temporarily to extend controlled airspace in certain parts of the region to provide increased airspace capacity for commercial air traffic in order to help manage the anticipated additional demand during the peak Games period.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.2/5">As part of the commitment to deliver a safe and secure Games, the Government also announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-07">7 March</phrase>, plans to impose certain temporary restrictions on the use of airspace over London and the south-east of England during the Games period. Most aircraft seeking to operate in the planned restricted and prohibited zones will be required to file a flight plan, establish and maintain two-way radio communication with the relevant control authority, transmit a discrete transponder code and follow air traffic control instructions. The aim of these security-driven measures is to enable all air traffic in this area to be monitored during this period. NATS and others are currently working to establish a flight plan reception process to deal with the anticipated additional demand. Significant enhancements to existing lower airspace radar service capacity are also planned to facilitate flying within the restricted zone in accordance with the announced requirements for operation in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.2/6">Initial work to assess the effect of the planned airspace restrictions on the aviation community as a whole has been undertaken and, through the CAA and others, we are now engaging with them further to ensure the impacts are fully understood. We are encouraging members of the aviation community to help us in this, and we will consider whether certain adaptations to the planned restrictions might be feasible, consistent with the overarching security considerations, before the measures are finalised in a Statutory Instrument to be made later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.2/7">There are no plans to provide compensation to those affected by the temporary airspace restrictions. However, as already mentioned, the Government, together with the Civil Aviation Authority and NATS, will work with the aviation community to see if local arrangements might be possible, in some cases, to limit the impact of the restrictions.</p>

	<p pid="a.384.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.3/2"><I>Letter from Stephen Penneck, Director General for ONS, to Lord Laird, dated April 2011.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.384.3/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking: (i) further to the Written Answer by Lord Taylor of Holbeach on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase> (<I>WA 173-4</I>), what are the &quot;sensitivities&quot; in Scotland relating to the wording of the category &quot;Gypsy/Irish Traveller&quot;; why those sensitivities do not occur or apply in England; and, (ii) what are the numbers and percentages of Polish nationals in each part of the United Kingdom. (HL8121)</p>
	<p pid="a.384.3/4">(i) In England and Wales there was strong evidence of need for information on Gypsies and Irish Travellers to be collected in the 2011 Census. &quot;Irish Travellers&quot; are recognised as a distinct group by that name under Race Relations Act case law and the term is now widely recognised and more commonly used by members of those communities themselves. However, the term &quot;Irish Traveller&quot; which is intended to specifically exclude &quot;New Age travellers&quot; in England and Wales is not generally used in Scotland. The census in Scotland is a devolved matter, and the responsibility for the wording of the questions there rests with the Scottish Government. The Registrar General for Scotland has advised that the term &quot;Gypsy/Traveller&quot; is used in the census in Scotland instead because that is the specific term that was used by the Scottish Parliament when it was agreed that such people should be treated as a separate ethnic group for race relations purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.3/5">(ii) The Office for National Statistics collects data on nationality from the Annual Population Survey (APS) which is a household survey of residents of the UK. The latest available estimates of Polish nationals relate to the 12-month period of July 2009 to June 2010 and are provided for each constituent country of the UK in the table below. Percentages have been created using the total estimated resident population for each constituent country of the UK, derived from the APS as a denominator. It should be noted that the survey does not include people living in most types of communal establishment.</p>

	<p pid="a.387.2/2">Our expectation is that double certification for waste-derived biofuel under the RTFO will provide a level of support broadly equivalent to the duty differential currently in place. The most recent publicly quoted renewable transport fuel certificate price is 24 pence. At this price level, issuing an additional certificate for used cooking oil biodiesel is slightly more generous than the 20 pence duty differential.

	<p pid="a.388.5/1">The 1988 report of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), <I>The Chernobyl Accident and its Consequences</I>, set out the cause of the accident and three main lessons for the United Kingdom, which are listed below with an explanation of the position today in each case:</p>
	<p pid="a.388.5/2"><I>&quot;There needs to be a strong nuclear safety regulator, independent from the organisations responsible for operating and promoting nuclear power&quot;</I></p>
	<p pid="a.388.5/3">The UK's nuclear regulatory system and its delivery are regularly examined by the IAEA's International Regulatory Review Service which has noted, in particular, the maturity and transparency of the regulatory system and advanced review process, and that it is backed up by highly trained, expert and experienced nuclear inspectors. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) took over the role of nuclear regulator from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive from <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April</phrase> and is intended further to enhance the regulator's independence, flexibility and accountability so that it maintains a world leading reputation as a strong regulator in the face of the current and future challenges of the nuclear sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.5/4"><I>&quot;The nuclear safety regulator needs the technical capability to assess and challenge</I><I>operators' safety analyses&quot;</I></p>
	<p pid="a.388.5/5">The Chernobyl reactor design was reviewed by the UKAEA against the then current safety assessment principles issued by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) and found to have a number of major shortcomings that would have precluded its licensing in the UK. NII (now part of the ONR) has revised these principles twice in the intervening period to ensure that they continue to reflect modern practice, and international standards and guidance. The ONR has been established such that it will have the flexibilities it needs to develop and capitalise on its technical capability to promote high standards of nuclear safety and security for UK citizens and society.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.5/6"><I>&quot;Operators must ensure that a proper safety culture permeates all activities on their nuclear site&quot;</I></p>
	<p pid="a.388.5/7">For many years, the UK nuclear regulator has worked with the nuclear operators at the most senior levels to ensure that excellence in leadership and management for safety is given the appropriate high priority. The creation of the ONR provides a platform to give renewed impetus to this.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.5/8">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has asked UK Chief Nuclear Inspector Dr Mike Weightman to provide a report to the Government on the implications of the unprecedented events in Japan and the lessons to be learned for the UK nuclear industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.389.2/1">The EU's direct acting regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), prohibits the import, supply and use, including second hand, of asbestos and articles containing asbestos. The regulations are enforced by the co-ordinated action of regulators including the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Environment Agency, local authority trading standards, HMRC Customs officials and UK Border Agency. These all work to detect and prevent the use or importation of new asbestos materials and the exchange or re-sale of articles containing asbestos which may remain in position if installed in service before 1999 when the UK banned all asbestos use. When taken out of service such materials must be disposed of to approved sites under European Hazardous Waste requirements regulated by the Environment Agency and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.2/2">The EU directive on asbestos worker protection was transposed by the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 in Great Britain (Northern Ireland has equivalent regulations). These regulations are enforced by the HSE and local authorities and require contractors to be licensed by HSE for work on higher risk materials. The purpose of licensing is to facilitate performance monitoring against the detailed requirements of the directive to detect where improvement is needed so appropriate action can be taken. The current regulatory approach is based on evidence of risk and allows a proportionate risk based approach to controls to protect health. Work on lower risk materials must also be carried out by suitably trained workers, with no need for a licence, but who either exactly follow HSE's task guides or carry out the required risk assessment to identify their own measures to control exposure. Comprehensive guidance is published by HSE. HSE takes enforcement action where it finds workers (or the public) have been, or are likely to be, put at significant risk. HSE's awareness raising media activities which targeted building maintenance workers, now those considered most at risk, are currently in a phase of assessment and evaluation.</p>

The Commission also set 12 key reform priorities for Albania to meet before the Commission can give an opinion on candidate status and opening of accession negotiations.

	<p pid="a.395.0/1">The department has reviewed the lessons learnt from last winter's seasonal flu immunisation programme and is taking steps to achieve higher vaccination coverage rates in 2011-12. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-14">14 March</phrase>, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) wrote to the National Health Service setting out next winter's planning assumptions, and seeking assurances that preparations are in hand at local level to run a successful immunisation programme. In particular, the CMO has asked for assurances that sufficient vaccine has been ordered and that robust arrangements are in place for general practitioners to contact those who are most at risk from the effects of flu. The CMO stated that the NHS should plan locally to:</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/2">reach or exceed 75 per cent uptake for people aged 65 years and over as recommended by the World Health Organisation; andreach or exceed 75 per cent uptake for people under age 65 with clinical conditions which put them more at risk from the effects of flu, and pregnant women, as recommended by the European Union. A reasonable trajectory for increases in uptake in clinical risk groups and pregnant women might be 60 per cent in 2011-12, and 70 per cent in 2012-13, so that an uptake of 75 per cent can be reached or exceeded in 2013-14.</p>

	<p pid="a.395.3/1">The Organ Donation Taskforce Programme Delivery Board was established in July 2008 to oversee the implementation of the Organ Donation Taskforce recommendations published in January 2008. The board noted at its final meeting in January 2011 that organ donor rates had increased by some 25 per cent since the implementation process began and agreed that the taskforce recommendations had been largely implemented. The board therefore agreed that its work was complete. The board also agreed that the focus in the future should be on ensuring that the new infrastructure and support mechanisms, developed under the board's leadership, become embedded as a usual part of healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.3/2">This is being achieved by a variety of means, including through the clinical leads for organ donation, donation committees and donation chairs in acute trusts driving improvement locally, and ongoing work to raise the profile and benefits of organ donation and transplantation with the National Health Service, professional groups and the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.396.11/1">We are aware that in Indian administered Kashmir, the Public Safety Act (PSA) and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) provide for detention (which can include house arrest) without trial for up to two years. According to state government figures, 4,064 people were arrested from March 2010 to January 2011 and 3,900 of those arrested have been released. During a recent visit to Indian administered Kashmir, officials from our high commission in New Delhi discussed this issue with the Jammu and Kashmir state police and human rights groups. The issue of security legislation operating in certain regions of India, including the AFSPA, was raised with the Indian Government during the recent EU-India Human Rights dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.11/2">We also note the findings of a recent report by Amnesty International. This estimates that between 8,000 and 20,000 people have been detained under the PSA or AFSPA over the past 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.11/3">We welcome and are closely following the initiative of the Indian Government to appoint three interlocutors to take forward a dialogue between Delhi and Srinagar to help resolve the situation in Indian administered Kashmir. Prime Minister Singh issued a statement last summer that violations of human rights abuses by security forces in Kashmir would not be tolerated. The UK continues to call for an improvement in the human rights situation on both sides of the line of control and for an end to external support for violence in Kashmir. UK funding supports human rights, conflict prevention and peace building efforts on both sides of the line of control.</p>

	<p pid="a.398.11/1">Our dialogue with the Interim National Council (INC) and other elements of the opposition both within Libya and outside the country continues to develop. My right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary met Mahmoud Jabril, the envoy of the INC, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-29">29 March 2011</phrase>. A British diplomatic mission also visited Benghazi on 28 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-29">29 March 2011</phrase>, headed by a senior British diplomat, Christopher Prentice. The purpose of the mission was to meet key Libyan opposition groups in eastern Libya, including the INC and its military council; to gain a greater insight into the political and security situation; to explain government policies towards Libya; and to discuss future governance arrangements in Libya, including identifying what Britain can do to help. The team met the president of the INC, Mustafa al-Jalil, among others. We support the efforts of the council to prepare for a more democratic and accountable Government in Libya.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.11/2">We have made clear the importance of the Libyan opposition ensuring that they are not infiltrated by al-Qaeda or other extremist elements. They are very conscious of this. It is clear from our engagement with the INC that it is sincere in its wish for an inclusive, democratic Libya which rejects extremism, as shown by its manifesto and public statements rejecting extremist ideas and committing to combating them in all circumstances and to implementing UN Security Council Resolutions on counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.11/3">The conference on Libya held in London on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-29">29 March 2011</phrase> agreed the need for a political process, led by the Libyan people, that helps to create the conditions in which the people of Libya can choose their own future, supported by the international community. The announcement of a political programme by the INC was an important first step in that process. The participants in the conference were agreed that the Gaddafi regime had lost all legitimacy, and that the Libyan people have clearly indicated their desire for change.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-04-06a.410.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100028" speakername="Earl Attlee" colon=":" colnum="410"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110406w0001.htm#11040687000246">
	<p pid="a.410.0/1">Work was undertaken during spending review 2010 to update the value for money information held on major capital schemes. It is not correct to say that there has been a reduced carbon adjustment in appraisals under the New Approach to Appraisal of major road schemes between 2002 and 2010. The adjustments made are undertaken for three main reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/2">First, when assessing value for money during transport appraisal, it is standard practice to consider a broader range of factors than are captured within the central New Approach to Appraisal net present value (NPV). DfT appraisal guidance on wider impacts, reliability and landscape is still evolving, but these factors are considered when assessing value for money. They were therefore incorporated into information provided to the Treasury during the spending review to ensure it reflected recent developments in appraisal methods and provided the fullest possible representation of the value for money of transport schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/3">Secondly, there was a need to ensure consistency across schemes. This was particularly important given that data for schemes in the spending review were produced over a period of many years. It would have been disproportionately costly to reassess all spending review schemes using the detailed calculations and models held by scheme promoters, so high-level adjustments were made to individual business cases. These adjustments were evidence based and typically informed by tests on a sample of schemes. While these adjustments do not necessarily replicate the results that would be obtained from applying the relevant appraisal guidance in full, they provide an indication of the scale of additional impacts and the effect their inclusion may have on the relative value for money of different schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/4">Thirdly, the Treasury requested information to inform an analysis of value for money across government departments. To facilitate the comparison of DfT information with that of other government departments, NPVs were uprated to a 2010 price and discount base year. In addition, carbon impacts were uplifted to reflect values published by DECC in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/5">Full details of the adjustments made are set out below. These adjustments were made purely for the purposes of the 2010 spending review and should not be considered changes to the department's Transport Appraisal Guidance (WebTAG). Stakeholders have had, and continue to have, the opportunity to comment on WebTAG units before they become definitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/6">Because the adjusted NPV methodology was used only in the 2010 spending review, no comparable adjusted NPV figures are available from 2002. It is not therefore possible to assess the number of road schemes for which the adjusted NPV has reduced between 2002 and 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/7"><I>Detailed description of adjustments made to NPV information used in the 2010 spending review</I></p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/8"><I>Wider impacts</I></p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/9">Unless directly estimated by the promoter, wider impacts were proxied as 10 per cent of consumer and business benefits for those schemes falling predominantly within a functional urban region (as defined in WebTAG unit 2.8C). Previous analysis of wider impacts suggests this is likely to represent a conservative assumption for most schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/10"><I>Reliability</I></p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/11">Where available, reliability estimates provided by scheme promoters were used to adjust net present value information for local authority major schemes. For other local authority schemes, reliability impacts were monetised based on the qualitative assessment of schemes at programme entry. Additional benefits of 5/10/20 per cent of time savings were added to those schemes with slight/moderate/significant beneficial impacts respectively. These uplifts are based on the judgment of DfT analysts and the top of the range is broadly consistent with the findings of the Eddington review which identified that reliability benefits could be worth 20 to 30 per cent of time savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/12">For Highways Agency (HA) schemes, reliability impacts were included where they had been modelled as part of an original scheme appraisal. For other HA schemes, uplifts were applied to business and consumer user benefits as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/13">no uplift for junction improvement schemes;20 per cent uplift for regional road schemes; and50 per cent uplift for motorway schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/14">These uplift factors were based on analysis undertaken during development of the specialist software (incident cost-benefit assessment, or INCA) used to estimate reliability impacts in road scheme appraisal.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/15"><I>Landscape</I></p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/16">The value of landscape impacts was added to benefits if they were estimated by DfT at the time of programme entry award (local authority schemes) or as part of the scheme appraisal process (Highways Agency schemes). The appraisal methodology for landscape impacts takes values from the ODPM report <I>Valuing the External Benefits of Undeveloped Land</I> and has been adapted to take account of factors such as existing man made features or mitigating improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/17"><I>Adjustment to the price of carbon</I></p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/18">We have not reduced the valuation of road vehicle carbon emissions in the New Approach To Appraisal between 2002 and 2010. Adjustments were made in the spending review analysis to ensure consistency with the latest DECC carbon values. These new values for road transport emissions are not only significantly larger than those used before, but also represent a year on year increase for each and every year of the appraisal period.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/19">The definitive WebTAG guidance (and the unadjusted NPVs that informed the spending review) includes the <I>Shadow Price of Carbon</I> published by Defra in 2007. For the spending review, the carbon impact component of the NPV was uplifted to ensure consistency with newer values released by DECC in 2009. Where modelled estimates of carbon impacts based on both old and updated values were available, the difference between these two values was used as the carbon uplift adjustment.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/20">Where modelled values were not available, pre-existing estimates of the value of carbon impacts were increased by 150 per cent to proxy the impact of the new values. This was informed by an analysis of the carbon impacts of schemes which had been appraised using both the new and old values, and separate analysis which examined the value of one tonne of carbon abated over a 60 year period. No adjustment was made to schemes that did not estimate carbon impacts as part of their original business case submission (eg because they used a fixed demand modelling method).</p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/21"><I>Upscaling to 2010 price and discount base year</I></p>
	<p pid="a.410.0/22">DfT's WebTAG appraisal guidance requires values to be expressed in 2002 prices and discounted to a 2002 base year. To facilitate comparison across government departments during the spending review, DfT values were uplifted to a 2010 price and discount base year by multiplying the adjusted NPV by 1.61.</p>
