<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-02-13a.26.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="26"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010213/text/10213w01.htm#10213w01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.26.0/1">I am today launching the Quinquennial Review of the grant-awarding research councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/2">Reviews of Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) are a key part of our programme to modernise government. The Government are committed to achieving better public services that are of higher quality and are more responsive to the needs of the people who use them. Regular NDPB reviews are an important element in ensuring that we have in place the right structures to deliver the Government's agenda effectively and to provide a strong focus on improving future performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/3">The purpose of the six grant-awarding councils is to deliver government policy for publicly funded research and postgraduate training. It would be impossible to conduct a fundamental review independently from that policy. For this reason, although quinquennial review of the six councils was due in 1999, it has been appropriate to postpone their quinquennial review until the outcome of the relevant policy reviews had been completed, so that the role of the councils could be considered in that context. Together the White Papers on Science and Innovation (Excellence and Opportunity; Cmd 4814) and the Knowledge Economy (Opportunity for All in a World of Change; Cm 2250) now provide the context for the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/4">The terms of reference for the review of the research councils are:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/5" class="indent">The review will consider the six grant awarding research councils individually and collectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/6" class="indent">The review of the councils will be undertaken in two stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/7" class="indent">The first stage will examine the role and organisation of the councils, by reference to their charters and missions, evidence of work already undertaken to review and improve performance, current best practice for NDPBs and the councils' contribution to the delivery of government policy for publicly funded scientific research and training in the context of the new White Paper. It will set the detailed terms of reference for the second stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/8" class="indent">The second stage will examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the councils' operations. It will look for further opportunities for improving performance by reference to such issues as boundaries between the councils, management structures, aims and objectives, role of funded institutes, performance targets and service standards, use of processes and new technology, delegated authority and accountability and changes to the operating environment since the councils were awarded their Royal Charters in 1994, including the Modernising Government agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/9" class="indent">The review will consider, in particular, how the councils can best fulfil their strategic role in identifying the key areas for future investment in research that will offer the best opportunities for science, social development, industrial application and economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/10" class="indent">The review will be conducted in accordance with the current Cabinet Office guidance (published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-31">31 January 2000</phrase>) and will include consultation, either in person or in writing, with members of council, staff of the executive and the councils' customers and key stakeholders. It is expected that a number of working groups will be established to address key issues in detail in the second stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/11" class="indent">The review team will be directed by a review board which is chaired by the Director General of the Research Councils, Dr John Taylor, and with a membership which will include key representatives of both industry and academia drawn from the stakeholder communities. The review board will ensure that Ministers, the Treasury, the Cabinet Office, and the staff and customers of the councils are kept informed of the progress of the review and will facilitate the gathering of information for the review team and their communication with staff and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/12">The review team will be supported by officials in the Office of Science and Technology, with specialist advice as appropriate. The aim will be to complete the review within approximately six months, as recommended in the Cabinet Office guidance.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-02-13a.31.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="31"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010213/text/10213w02.htm#10213w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.31.2/1">I am responding on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to the supplementary report of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB). I understand that a similar announcement has been made by the First Minister and the Minister for Health and Community Care in Scotland. Copies of the reports are available in the Printed Paper Office and the Library. We are grateful to the chairman and members of the DDRB for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/2">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-18">18 December</phrase> that the pay recommendations of the DDRB were being accepted in full and without staging. The DDRB recommended an overall pay increase of 3.9 per cent for salaried doctors and dentists and general medical and dental practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/3">To encourage the retention of general medical practitioners, the DDRB has also recommended a 7 per cent increase in seniority allowances, worth in the region of &pound;500 for a general medical practitioner with 25 years' service. This is in addition to the 3.9 per cent increase in intended average net remuneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/4">The supplementary report from the DDRB covers areas of GPs income aimed at meeting the expense of running their practices and any balancing recovery from debts owed by the profession. In its considerations of what provision to make for indirectly reimbursed practice expenses and the operation of the balancing correction, the review body has recommended:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/5" class="indent">provision for indirect expenses of &pound;23,790 for each GP;</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/6" class="indent">a recovery of &pound;248 per GP in accordance with normal rules; and</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/7" class="indent">a joint review by the BMA and Health Departments of the operation of the pay system.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/8" class="indent">This should look at handling the cumulative overpayment that has occurred in the system (&pound;2,684 per GP), the operation of the balancing mechanism and forecasting of expenses in time for next year's round.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/9">The Government have accepted DDRB's recommendation on the level of practice expenses.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/10">The Government share DDRB's concerns about the operation of the balancing mechanism, the setting of practice expenses and the management of the cumulative debt. We have decided that the BMA and the Health Departments should put work in hand immediately to develop a review of these issues. That being the case, the Government have decided to suspend the balancing mechanism pending the outcome of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/11">The average GP will benefit by a further &pound;248 above what the DDRB have recommended. In addition, we will consider constructively how to manage the cumulative debt of the profession (around &pound;80 million) for the benefit of patients and the development of practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/12">DDRB also recommended that urgent agreement was needed on flu vaccination payments. Higher payments to GPs were introduced in last autumn's campaign to increase vaccination coverage of people aged 65 and over. We now propose that the whole cost of these payments, not just the proportion relating to the extra coverage achieved, should remain available for investment in general practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/13">The gross income of GPs will therefore increase to &pound;80,300 pa, as shown in the following table, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/3">The twin principles of accountability of the Executive to Parliament and independent scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General are enormously important to good government.
