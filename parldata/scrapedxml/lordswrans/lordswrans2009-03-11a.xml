Part of this package is the credit guarantee scheme (CGS). The CGS provides a Government guarantee on eligible new debt to support the stability of the banking system, and to protect savers and depositors.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.2/2">As part of further measures to increase confidence for banking institutions to lend, the asset protection scheme (APS) was announced in January this year, to encourage banks to lend by offering capital and asset protection to banks on assets most affected by the current economic conditions. Under the scheme, the Treasury will provide participating institutions protection against credit losses. The scheme is aimed at targeting assets with the greatest amount of uncertainty about their future performance. Participating banks also agree a lending commitment addressing lending to businesses and homeowners. As the Chancellor announced details of the scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-26">26 February</phrase> it is too early to measure its effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.6/1">A road side survey (Operation V79) was carried out by the Department for Transport in March 2008. 6689 vehicles were stopped at random by police and checked for compliance with driver and vehicle licensing regulations. The recorded level of uninsured drivers from this survey was 1.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.6/2">However, comparison of the DVLA vehicle register and motor insurance database suggests the total figure of uninsured driving is likely to be higher. In 2005, a comparison of the two databases estimated that about 2.1 million licensed vehicles were being driven by uninsured drivers. The comparison looks at all vehicle keepers and motor insurance policies and does not rely on vehicles being spotted in use on the road. Further work continues on a more recent comparison of the two databases and is undergoing validity checks by departmental statisticians.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.5/3">Regarding uninsured driving, measures introduced in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 have given the police improved access to the motor insurance database, enabling them better to identify uninsured vehicles using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) equipment. The police were also given powers to seize, and in appropriate cases destroy, vehicles being driven uninsured. In 2008, around 185,000 vehicles were seized.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.5/5">Rather than relying on the police to spot vehicles in use, continuous insurance enforcement would identify uninsured drivers by regularly comparing DVLA's vehicle register with the insurance industry's database.

	<p pid="a.251.8/1">The Government believe there are significant levels of protection for these workers already in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.8/2">All workers are protected by the Working Time Regulations which cover working hours and statutory holiday pay. The regulations ensure that all workers can only work a maximum of 48 hours per week on average unless they sign a voluntary opt-out agreement. The regulations also provide all workers with 4.8 weeks of statutory paid annual leave per year rising to 5.6 weeks in April 2009. Rates for overtime and working unsocial hours are a contractual matter between the individual parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.8/3">All workers are also entitled to the national minimum wage (NMW). The Government promote and enforce payment of the NMW through simple and effective means which support workers and businesses by deterring employers from underpaying their workers and removing the unfair competitive advantage that underpayment can bring. New automatic penalties of up to &pound;5,000 for employers found not to be complying with the NMW were brought in under the Employment Act 2008. HM Revenue and Customs are responsible for enforcing the national minimum wage. In 2007-08, they helped to restore &pound;3.9 million in arrears to over 19,000 workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.8/4">Entitlement to the state pension scheme is based on the national insurance contributions that an individual pays, is treated as paid or is credited with. Migrant and agency workers can build up entitlement to the state pension in the same way as other workers. Migrant workers also have the same rights as other workers when it comes to access to private pension schemes arranged by the employer. This includes stakeholder pensions where the employer has a statutory duty to designate at least one scheme for which membership is on offer to all employees (including migrant workers) who have been employed for a continuous period of three months. Whether or not these rights apply to agency workers would depend upon whether they are treated as employees for the purpose of the stakeholder pension scheme regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.8/5">Following the work of the Vulnerable Workers Enforcement Forum, which reported in August 2008, the Government are also redoubling their efforts to ensure that potentially vulnerable workers are fully aware of their existing rights. We have recently launched a &pound;l million campaign on this, with the initial focus on agency workers specifically.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.8/6">We will also be launching a consultation in the near future on the implementation of the EU agency worker's directive, which will, consistent with the CBI-TUC agreement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase>, introduce equal treatment for agency workers in respect of basic working and employment conditions, after 12 weeks in a given job.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.5/1">There are no precise indicators of the cost of insuring government debt against default.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/2">Credit default swap (CDS) spreads are commonly used as a proxy for measuring this cost. However, the strength of this proxy is highly questionable, as default is only one of a number of credit events enshrined in sovereign CDS contracts. Other credit events include missing coupon payments and restructuring of debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/3">There are also a number of other factors besides market expectations of sovereign default risk that can affect CDS spreads. The market for developed country sovereign CDS is relatively small and illiquid, as it is unlikely that a developed country will default on its sovereign debt. The illiquid nature of the market can lead to large movements in CDS spreads, simply for technical reasons. In addition, there is evidence that developed sovereign CDS contracts are used to hedge a number of other risks, aside from the risk of sovereign default.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/4">The five-year UK sovereign credit default swap spread was quoted at 147 basis points as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-27">Friday 27 February 2009</phrase>, according to data provided by Bloomberg. This compares to 89 and 86 basis points for France and Germany respectively. This implies that it would cost $14,700 to buy protection for $1,000,000-worth of gilts. It should be noted that we have no evidence that any trades have taken place at these indicative prices.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.2/1">There is evidence from research commissioned by the department and the South West Public Health Observatory of the problems and perceived prejudice that Gypsies and Travellers, including Irish Travellers, face in accessing primary care and other health services in England. Poor continuity of care and follow-up are compounded by the reluctance of general practitioners to register them, and by a lack of medical records. Gypsies and Travellers have a higher incidence of long-term conditions, including mental health and respiratory problems, than the general population.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.2/2">The 2001 census carried out by the Office for National Statistics did not enumerate Gypsies or Travellers as there was no such category on the ethnicity question.

Every six months, Communities and Local Government commission a count of Gypsies' and Travellers' caravans on sites throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.257.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights last December. We are determined to continue to ensure that this landmark document is as powerful in practice as it is in aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/2">The promotion of democracy and human rights is integral to what the FCO does. They are essential to the delivery of our strategic goals whether in combating the global scourge of terrorism and its causes; preventing conflict and fostering its resolution; promoting a high-growth, low-carbon global economy; or strengthening institutions such as the UN, EU and the Commonwealth, through which the international community can most effectively come together to make a difference in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/3">Integrating human rights in our overall foreign policy goals sends a powerful message that human rights and democracy are fundamental to progress in tackling today's global challenges.</p>
