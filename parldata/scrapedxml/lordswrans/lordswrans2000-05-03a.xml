	<p pid="a.175.5/2">&quot;The records of the Secret Intelligence Service are not released: they are retained under section 3 (4) of the Public Records Act 1958. Having reviewed the arguments, I recognise that there is an overwelmingly strong reason for this policy. When individuals or organisations co-operate with the service, they do so because an unshakeable commitment is given never to reveal their identities. This essential trust would be undermined by a perception that undertakings of confidentiality were honoured for only a limited duration. In many cases, the risks of retribution against individuals can extend beyond a single generation.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.177.2/1">Legislation on the fitting of adult seat belts, which are used to secure child restraints, applies to most vehicles. The design and testing approvals of such seat belts and child restraints, and their fixings, are to approved standards. Therefore the methods to secure infants and children in ambulances match those used in cars. The legislation on the wearing of seat belts and child restraints applies where seat belts are fitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/2">Seat belts are required to be fitted in the front seats of ambulances, but not in the rear. If an ambulance has 9 to 16 passenger seats, however, it is classed as a minibus. In that case, when three or more children aged between 3 and 15 years inclusive are travelling on an organised trip, a forward facing seat with a seat belt must be provided for each child. Consultation is currently under way on proposals to require the fitment of seat belts in all rear seats (whether forward of rearward facing) of new minibuses that do not carry standing passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/3">In minibuses, if the unladen weight is 2,540 kgs or less, seat belts in the rear must be worn. If an appropriate child restraint is available, it must be used where relevant. However, the law does not require seat belts or child restraints to be worn in minibuses over 2,540 kgs, but we strongly recommend that where they are fitted they should be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/4">Figures for those journeys in amublances where appropriate child restraints were not used are not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.0/1">The answer to your question depends on a number of variables, in particular, the number of asylum applicants and the length of time taken to complete the process to removal. Based on forecast asylum intakes and detention of between two and six months, the cost of procurement of the number of places required could be as much as &pound;1.68 billion start-up costs and annual running costs of up to &pound;420 million. These costs take no account of the likely impact of this scale of detention on intake or savings that would inevitably occur on asylum support costs.</p>

This means that, in the circumstances of a grave breakdown or failure in the administration of justice or civil order, the residual prerogative power of the Crown could be used to intervene in the internal affairs of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

	<p pid="a.184.3/1">Inland Revenue officials will use the ordinary dictionary definition of 'family' when coming to a judgment regarding the appropriate application of the exemption, as is the normal practice when a word is not specifically defined in legislation. This has not caused any problems for enforcers. If problems do arise in establishing whether certain individuals count as family members, each case will be judged on individual merits. Any dispute would be resolved by an employment tribunal or court in the normal way.</p>
