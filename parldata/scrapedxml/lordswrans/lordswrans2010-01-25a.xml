	<p pid="a.283.1/2" qnum="HL1064">To ask Her Majesty's Government what common causes have been identified in &quot;friendly fire&quot; incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-01-25a.283.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="283"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100125w0001.htm#10012523000003">
	<p pid="a.283.2/1">The Ministry of Defence (MoD) deeply regrets each death or injury caused by &quot;friendly fire&quot; or fratricide. After every such incident we carry out a thorough investigation as we would for any other death in service, initially led by the local commander and subsequently by the military chain of command. We also take careful note of the recommendations of service inquiries and coroners' inquests, and track their implementation through a single service or joint lessons register.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/2">Additionally, the MoD maintains a Combat Identification Steering Group which meets every six months to ensure that all three services have coherent procedures and equipment to reduce fratricide.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/3">The common causes identified in friendly fire incidents are:</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/4">Mistakenly identifying friendly forces for enemy-in the confusion of battle, the ground commander can sometimes mistake friendly forces for enemy forces and call for fire support (fast jets, helicopters, heavy weapons and artillery) against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/5">Procedures not followed correctly-our Armed Forces have very effective procedures for minimising fratricide when calling for fire support. When these are not followed fully then errors can be made e.g. when the map reference of the location to be fired on is not confirmed with the ground forces before firing. Research is currently under way into the human factors which cause such errors.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/6">Loss of situational awareness-in the confusion of a battle, fire support elements can lose track of where enemy and friendly forces are positioned (in military parlance, their situational awareness). To counteract this, fire support will be &quot;talked on&quot; to their target by friendly forces involved in the battle with a verbal description of the target. Some incidents of fratricide result from a misunderstanding of the verbal description provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/7">The key lessons learnt are in three major categories:</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/8">Collective training and multinational interoperability -many fratricides occur when unfamiliar units are suddenly forced to work together. This usually arises from necessity, as when troops come under fire and call for close air support. In this situation the nearest available air asset will be directed to assist and thus the pilot may not immediately recognise the friendly force.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/9">To minimise the risk of fratricide from such incidents our Armed Forces place considerable emphasis on joint training at every level before deployment, and on familiarisation with the equipment and procedures of coalition allies both prior to deployment and in theatre.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/10">For the occasions when unfamiliar forces must work together, the UK is actively engaged with our NATO partners on developing equipment and procedures for combat identification. To test candidate technical solutions, the UK participated in a multinational combat identification exercise in October and November last year involving ground troops and fast air support from 12 nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/11">Time lag of data in tactical communications and information systems-due to technological limitations, real time flow of information can never be achieved: there is always some delay (known as latency) in the transmission or refreshing of the information available to our forces, which could contribute to &quot;friendly fire&quot; incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/12">Shared situational awareness-the three services (and our coalition partners) have different requirements for information about the tactical situation which lead to different amounts of delay between an entity being reported at a particular location and the report of that position being received. UK ground and air forces therefore use different systems to display information about the current tactical situation. Some fratricide incidents have occurred which may have been caused by differences in the information available to the various parties. The MoD is putting significant effort into supplying near-real time force tracking information to tactical operations rooms and has made considerable progress in the last three months. The upgrade of Bowman in Afghanistan next year will also help to ensure that ground forces have a common and up-to-date understanding of the tactical situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.5/1">C-130Js and C-17s are both able to perform in-theatre tactical airlift and strategic deployment into theatre, although for UK purposes C-130J is more ideally suited to tactical tasking and C-17 for strategic deployment. Nevertheless, the load capacity of C-130J significantly limits its ability to carry a wide range of vehicles. While C-17 could be used to carry these loads tactically, we assess that this would lead to significant growth in support costs. A400M is ideally suited for such tactical taskings and would also contribute significant strategic airlift capability, effectively providing a swing-role capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.5/1">The Government are concerned about the practice of allocating payments to the cheapest debt first and the extent to which consumers understand this, and its implications for their personal finances. We are therefore considering what action may be required as part of the current review of the regulation of credit and store cards which is being undertaken by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Among other things, our consultation examines whether we should reverse the allocation of payments to ensure that expensive debts are paid off more quickly, as a very small number of lenders already do. We published a consultation document seeking views on potential reforms in October 2009. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-19">19 January 2010</phrase>. The Government will issue final recommendations in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.3/1">The Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs has played an important part in promoting economic reform across Europe by providing: political impetus for EU and national policies; a toolkit for reform based on learning from the best performers in Europe; and co-ordination in areas where action or inaction in one member state would impact on citizens in another. As such, it was a factor in rising employment rates and productivity across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/2">But the EU and its member states did not make enough progress quickly enough, and the progress that they did make has been set back by the economic crisis.

	<p pid="a.294.2/2">The paper argues that Europe should agree a compact that brings together EU institutions and member states in a common cause of generating strong, sustainable and balanced growth. The starting point for delivering this ambitious agenda should be a set of clear and measurable objectives around:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/3">strengthening Europe's long-run growth potential;ensuring growth within Europe and its Member States is balanced;increasing employment and labour market participation;raising labour and capital productivity; andfacilitating investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/4">Member states should define and establish measurable national targets that contribute to meeting these EU objectives, and be held publicly accountable for progress towards these targets through intergovernmental peer review.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/5">Within this framework the paper proposes specific targets for action at the member state and EU-level:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/6">national targets to reduce child poverty supported by greater cohesion between employment policy and social protection;promoting greater participation and equality of women in the workplace by ensuring a new EU gender road map which includes agreement of targets to close the gender pay gap and increase the participation of women in public and private sectors; anda target for all homes and businesses to have access to broadband at 2 Mb per second by the end of 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/7">The paper also suggests that an annual economic summit of EU leaders should be established to review progress against the objectives on the basis of reports from the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).</p>

	<p pid="a.298.2/1">The Government have included in their public consultation on ECGD's business principles a proposal that ECGD should adopt a policy of following OECD agreements related to the environment, sustainable lending and bribery, and not, in future, separately operate and additionally create policies which go beyond those agreements. The consultation document stated that the effect of this proposal would be that certain exports, being those involving credit terms of less than two years or an UK export value of less than SDR 10 million (circa &#163;10 million) would no longer be subject to environmental and social impact due diligence, including human rights impacts. This would be consistent with the system of protection on such matters that members of the OECD consider appropriate as set out in the relevant international agreement (the OECD recommendation on common approaches on the environment and officially supported export credits).</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/2">No assessment has been made of the potential impact of such a proposal on the protection of social and human rights, including protection against the exploitative use of child workers and the use of forced labour overseas, because ECGD does not know, and cannot estimate, the level of future demand for support for exports falling into the above category. Without such prior knowledge, ECGD cannot estimate the proportion of those within that category that might have possible environmental and social impacts, including on human rights, or determine the classification between A, B or C impacts and whether such impacts would satisfy international standards as specified in the OECD recommendation on common approaches and, therefore, be eligible in principle for ECGD support.</p>

The HAIRS group is a mufti-disciplinary group chaired by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) with members from the HPA, Department of Health, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), Defra (including representatives of the key Defra agencies: the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and Animal Health) and participants from each devolved Administration. The meeting considered the one published paper suggesting the possibility that the organism responsible for the Dutch Q-fever outbreak may be of a different strain, but considered this to be speculative not conclusive.</p>

This group has concluded there are currently no reasons for the UK to stop the importation of goats or sheep from the Netherlands. In fact there are very few consignments of sheep and goats imported from the Netherlands annually (14 in 2008). Furthermore the heightened Dutch controls restricting movements of animals from farms found to be infected with Q-fever will also serve to restrict imports from the Netherlands.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.2/1">The Government have published an action plan <I>Better Communication</I>, backed by &#163;12 million investment, which included appointing a communications champion. Jean Gross has been appointed as the communications champion and is playing a key role in promoting the importance of communication skills to children and in helping us to make a success of the commitments set out in the action plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/2">The pupil guarantee, on which we are consulting, includes a commitment that all learners should get the chance to develop functional skills, including English. Functional English specifically covers oral communication and its applicability in the world of work. The changes to the secondary English curriculum which are already under way will secure this. Functional Skills is a key component of foundation learning, being developed as part of the 14-19 reforms to focus on the needs of learners at entry level and level 1.</p>
