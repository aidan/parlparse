	<p pid="a.185.0/1">Where landowners identify there is a possible predation problem, with protected birds or mammals having a significant impact of farmland bird populations, they are advised to seek the advice of the relevant statutory nature conservation advisers before taking any action. For mammals and birds protected under the Habitats Regulations 2010 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, there exist established systems of licensing that in some circumstances allow action to be taken in relation to the control of protected species for the purposes of protecting farmland birds or other species. The statutory nature conservation advisers will be able to advise what action can be taken and under what circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/2">Many specialists, however, consider that providing habitat of a suitable quality and quantity for declining bird species will have a greater influence in assisting increases in farmland bird populations than tackling predation from mammals and other birds. Indeed adverse predator impacts can often be linked with habitat degradation. For example, prey populations may be particularly threatened by the additional pressure of predation, if their favoured habitats have been poorly managed.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.6/1">The European Union may only act to the extent that the member states have decided to confer competence on it to do so. The extent of the EU's competences are set out in Articles 3-6 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In respect of these competences, the ordinary legislative procedure, which involves qualified majority voting and co-decision with the European Parliament, is the standard procedure for decision-making unless a special legislative procedure is otherwise specified. Different arrangements apply to the common foreign and security policy where the adoption of legislative acts is excluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.6/2">A list of the articles that outline the areas of competence detailed within the treaties as being subject to unanimity, common accord and consensus is provided at the end of this response.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.6/3">With the exception of areas where the EU has exclusive competence, even where competence has been conferred on the EU, this does not preclude action by the member states. For example, although the EU has competence to act in the areas of research, technological development and space, the exercise of that competence shall not result in member states being prevented from acting. Furthermore, where under Article 6 TFEU the treaty has conferred competence on the EU to carry out actions to support, co-ordinate or supplement the actions of the member states in certain areas such as education, tourism and civil protection, it does so without superseding member states' competence in these areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.3/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Commission for Human Medicines (CHM) run a spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting scheme (the Yellow Card scheme) which collates suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports from health professionals, patients and indirectly via the pharmaceutical industry. Since 2000 a total of 245,386 ADR reports have been received via the Yellow Card scheme; of these, 837 ADR reports have been received in association with herbal medicines. Since 2000 10,446 (4 per cent) ADR reports have reported a fatal outcome; of these fatal ADR reports, eight have been reported in association with herbal medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/2">These data refer to ADR reports for all medicines and do not specifically relate to medicines obtained with a prescription. The MHRA's ADR database does not distinguish between how the medicine was obtained i.e. via prescription or over the counter.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/3">The number of reports received via the Yellow Card scheme does not directly equate to the number of people who suffer adverse reactions in the general population to medicines as this scheme is associated with an unknown level of underreporting. A specific factor with underreporting of herbal medicines is that healthcare professionals often may not be aware where their patients have been taking herbal medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/4">It should be noted that healthcare professionals are asked to report suspected adverse reactions on a voluntary basis and the submission of a report does not mean that the reaction cited was definitely caused by the medicine or herbal.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/5">Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease being treated.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">University income is made up of a number of funding streams from public, private and charitable sources. In terms of public funding, our reforms to higher education will shift the balance of resources for teaching from direct grant to institutions to funding that follows the choices made by individual students. This will provide strong incentives for institutions to focus on providing high quality teaching as efficiently as possible. Over time, popular and successful institutions will be able to grow and we expect new providers to enter the sector provided they can offer teaching to the high standards students will expect. We do not expect the overall income of the sector to reduce and we expect improved teaching quality and better informed students to have a positive impact on the economy. In recognition that the UK's research base is a vital national asset and critical to long term economic growth, funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms in a ring-fenced budget for the spending review period. Around half of this funding currently goes directly into universities. The remainder goes to institutes, many of which are sited in universities, and to large facilities, many of which are used by university researchers.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.6/1">The major cities of South Wales are not supplied with water from aquifers. The public water supply is provided by above-ground reservoirs outside the catchment.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.6/2">Studies continue to be undertaken on the aquifer affected directly by the waste in Brofiscin quarry, which is not exploited for public water supply. The evidence to date shows that the waste is unlikely to impact on the good status under the water framework directive of the south east valleys carboniferous limestone block.</p>
