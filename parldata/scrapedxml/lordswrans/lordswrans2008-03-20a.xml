The <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper and the Children and Young Persons Bill include a range of measures which will help to improve placement stability, including revised arrangements for care planning, strengthening the role of independent reviewing officers to ensure placement moves are given greater scrutiny, and ensuring children are placed closer to their homes and schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.2/1">The value of ETS allowances is set by the EU carbon market, and varies from day to day. At the current price for EU Emissions Trading Scheme allowances, and at the current pound to euro exchange rate, the free allocation to UK electricity generators is potentially worth around &pound;1.6 billion per year. The exact benefit depends on many factors including the extent to which companies have included the value of the allowances in the price of electricity to end users.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.5/3">Access to the courts is enshrined in Section 92(3) of the Courts Act 2003, by which the Lord Chancellor must have regard to the principle that access to the courts must not be denied in prescribing court fees and the remission system. Unlike the Republic of Poland, in England and Wales the determination of fee remissions is undertaken not by the courts, but by court officers as part of their administrative function.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.0/1">Cohabiting couples do have fewer legal rights than their married counterparts, but that is not to say that they have none. In relation to domestic violence, cohabiting couples have the same rights to protection as married couples.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/2">Financial disputes over maintenance payments for children are governed by the Child Support Agency and by legislation specifically designed to cater for their needs. Neither differentiates between cohabitants and married parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/3">The question of whether further legislation dealing specifically with cohabitants is required is a finely balanced one. It was precisely because of the Government's concern that cohabitants might be inadequately protected that the question of whether they should have specific rights was referred to the Law Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/4">Following the Law Commission's report, the Government have decided to consider research on the impact of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 which contains provisions that are similar in many respects to those which the Law Commission recommends before deciding whether to implement the Law Commission's proposals. In particular, the Government wish to consider the likely cost and benefit to this jurisdiction of bringing into effect the scheme proposed by the Law Commission, and to see how well the scheme meets the needs of vulnerable individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/5">The Government have funded the &quot;Living Together&quot; campaign to raise public awareness about the legal status of cohabitation. It aims to make people more aware of the differences in the rights and responsibilities applying to married and unmarried relationships, and to provide cohabitants with practical advice on how they can protect themselves and their families, should they wish to do so. Pending the outcome of research, the Government will continue to support this campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">The Ministry of Defence will examine any significant new research of which it becomes aware to assess its relevance to UK veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf Conflict. There are many research studies in the UK and elsewhere into the illnesses affecting Gulf veterans; most of these have been peer reviewed and published in scientific or medical journals and are usually available on the world wide web. The Government have particular arrangements to monitor the research undertaken in the United States; we have a British liaison officer based permanently in Washington DC who is tasked both with ensuring that the UK has full visibility of US research into Gulf veterans' illnesses and with providing a channel for communicating our own work to interested US parties. We are aware of a paper recently published by the Department of Medicine, University of California, entitled <I>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and Gulf War illnesses</I> and are giving it consideration; however, we note that the paper is not based on a systematic review of the literature.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.6/1">The carbon footprint of the House of Lords has been reduced drastically by a decision in autumn 2006 to purchase 100 per cent of electricity consumed on the Parliamentary Estate from renewable sources. Prior to this, only 10 per cent of our electricity was purchased from renewable sources. Since all electricity now comes from renewable sources, proposals to reduce the carbon footprint in the near future concentrate on reducing gas consumption as it is only gas consumption on the Parliamentary Estate which now results in carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.6/2">An offer of green gas, ie gas from renewable sources, has been made to the Parliamentary Estate and is currently under consideration. A report is also being prepared on how to improve the control of the boilers in the Palace of Westminster main boiler house. It is expected that implementation of the recommendations in the report would result in a reduction in natural gas consumption and hence carbon emissions. The planned refurbishment of 1 Millbank includes many energy efficiency measures which would also reduce carbon emissions; for example, a solar water heating system is being proposed to generate domestic hot water for taps. The draught proofing of some buildings is also being proposed for completion during the 2008 Summer Recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.6/3">A proposal to run an Environment Champions programme for a year in each building over a total period of three years for the whole Parliamentary Estate is under discussion. This programme would raise staff awareness of measures to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.</p>

We urge all parties to bring about a complete end to violence in Gaza and to work urgently to reopen the border crossings.

After this point a long-term earnings growth assumption of 4.93 per cent has been applied. 2. Estimates have been calibrated to published medium-term forecasts of expenditure on income-related benefits. 3. Estimates refer to the United Kingdom and are in 2007-08 prices. They have been rounded to the nearest &pound;0.1 billion. 4. Estimates account for the state pension reforms in the Pensions Act 2007, but they do not take into account private pension reforms as detailed in the current Pensions Bill. 5. Care should be taken when interpreting these estimates. Projections of the expenditure on income-related benefits are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.8/1">If the Department for Transport (DfT) were to propose a change to extend West Coast Trains services to and from Wrexham then it is likely to generate an increase in subsidy to the train operator. There are currently no plans for DfT to initiate such a change. However, from December 2008, West Coast Trains is planning to operate an additional 0705 Wrexham General to Chester and 2020 Chester to Wrexham General service as a commercial proposition.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.5/2">Two key findings of the study were that the proportion of the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) expenditure falling in the Republic was 85 per cent, rather than the 70 per cent assumed in the 1985 agreement and that the General Lighthouse Fund may be contributing in total &pound;8.5 million a year to the funding of lights in the Republic. This figure also includes CIL's portion of the costs borne directly by the General Lighthouse Fund on behalf of the three General Lighthouse Authorities which are currently excluded from the 1985 agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.5/3">The Answer by Baroness Crawley, which gave an estimate of &pound;6.4 million for the annual contribution in 2005-06 to the provision of aids to navigation in the Republic of Ireland was based on the outcome assumed in the existing 1985 agreement, that is to say that the North/South expenditure split was 30/70. Redundancy costs in that year were also excluded from that figure and CIL's sundry income was netted off in arriving at that figure.</p>
