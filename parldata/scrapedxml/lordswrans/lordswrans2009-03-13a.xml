	<p pid="a.284.6/1">The guaranteed unit of funding (GUF) would not be paid to young persons who are being home educated. Section 7 of the Education Act 1996 requires parents to secure education of children of compulsory school age either by regular attendance at school or otherwise. Home tuition would be a decision by a parent and no GUF would be paid in respect of such children. No other funding would be payable either by the department to the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.6/2">The GUF would not be paid to local authorities for pupils under Section 19(4) of the 1996 Education Act as this section refers to young persons (not of compulsory school age), However Section 19(1) is a similar section for children of compulsory school age and GUF could be paid to a local authority where the authority has financial responsibility for such pupils. If the LA has financial responsibility and makes exceptional provision for the pupil to be home educated then the LA could claim the GUF. This is, however, likely to be a very exceptional circumstance as Section 19(2B) makes it clear that LAs can set up pupil referral units which are schools specially organised to provide education for children referred to in Section 19(1).</p>

	<p pid="a.285.5/1">The UK sees diversity of sources of supply as vital for its own and the EU's energy security. The Russia-Ukraine gas dispute in January 2009 underlined the importance of the EU being supplied with gas from a wide range of countries. The development of a southern corridor, with the aim of bringing gas from the Caspian Region via Turkey to the EU, is crucial to that end.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.5/2">The UK fully supports Nabucco as a key element in the development of a southern corridor for gas and continues to engage actively with EU partners and countries in the region to help make the concept a reality. The UK will continue to emphasise its importance at this month's European Council as well as work closely with supply countries in the region on a bilateral basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.5/3">The European Commission's second strategic energy review of November 2008 affirmed the importance of a southern corridor as one of the EU's highest energy priorities and accordingly the importance of increasing high level political engagement with potential gas supplier countries, such as Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. The European Commission and current Czech presidency have already signalled their intention to make this a priority for 2009 and the UK will also be working closely with them.</p>

Business planning also helps us deliver our overall foreign policy objectives. In assessing a country's progress in complying with and implementing international human rights standards, we draw on a wide range of sources. We work with other governments and stakeholders including civil society, to promote human rights overseas. Ministers, officials and embassies around the world are involved in developing and implementing foreign policy including work on international human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.2/1">Research has shown that there is a training need within the primary workforce that should be met to enable the workforce to deliver compulsory language learning from 2011. We have therefore put in place a range of measures to boost the primary school teaching workforce to prepare for this. In total nearly 5,000 trainees will have undergone the primary initial teacher training (ITT) course in a languages specialism by the end of the 2008-09 academic year. More trainees will be funded for this course, including a projected 900 in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.2/2">The Training and Development Agency for Schools has also been piloting this year, in partnership with 10 ITT providers, additional routes to boost the primary workforce teaching languages. Over the next few years, some 2,500 trainees will go through these courses. About one-third of these will be postgraduate trainees and two-thirds undergraduate trainees.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.2/3">Teachers can also be supported through the increased funding we have given through local authorities to support the delivery of primary languages&mdash;&pound;32.5 million in 2008-09 and the same amount in 2009-10. Schools can use this for a variety of purposes, including to pay for in-service training for teachers and teaching assistants. CILT, the National Centre for Languages, also runs training courses for local authority staff and schools.</p>
