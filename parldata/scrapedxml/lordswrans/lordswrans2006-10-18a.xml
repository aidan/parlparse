	<p pid="a.188.5/1">Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 did not begin to take place in departments until after equality schemes approved by the Equality Commission were in place, around mid 2001. Between 2001 and 2006 in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland there were eight equality-related consultations undertaken. Further details can be found in the department's statutory five-year review of its equality scheme which is publicly available on its website at <a href="http://www.dardni.gov.uk/index/publications/pubs-dard-strategies-reports-and-accounts/five-year-review-of-equality-scheme.htm">www.dardni.gov.uk/index/publications/pubs-dard-strategies-reports-and-accounts/five-year-review-of-equality-scheme.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.5/2">For each consultation DARD consults with groups and individuals who have requested that they be included on its Section 75 consultation list (a copy is attached at Annexe B), which was established as part of its equality scheme for these purposes. This list is updated on request during the year. Backdated lists are not kept.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.5/3">The noble Lord may wish to be aware that in addition to equality-related consultations, the department consults with key stakeholders as part of good policy-making practices generally, and because one must consult on legislation, even where no adverse equality impacts have been identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.5/4">With regard to the noble Lord's second Question, the information requested is not readily available in the form requested and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, for every equality-related consultation issued, policy makers record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. At least a summary of consultation responses received is published (usually on the department's website). All of this information is or has been publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.5/5">It is difficult to identify specific changes that have occurred to a policy as a result of consultation alone. This is because, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development cycle&mdash;through, for example, having advisory fora, pre-consultation or informal consultation&mdash;there will be no negative equality impacts evident.</p>

The 2003 report, following the September 11 attack, found that the need for resilience made a powerful case for a national network of regional controls, which was also optimum in terms of efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.5/1">Although exact figures are not available, we do know that China and South Korea are North Korea's first and second largest trading partners respectively, providing over half of North Korea's imports, including virtually all of its fuel and around one-sixth of its food. North Korea imports all of its oil, mostly from China. In recent years, South Korea has provided 500,000 tonnes of rice and up to 350,000 tonnes of fertiliser, but suspended its regular humanitarian assistance in response to the July missile tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.5/2">As a further measure in response to the <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October</phrase> nuclear test, Seoul has halted flood-related assistance, which so far has included a further 90,000 tonnes of rice. The only significant external providers of food assistance now are the World Food Programme and China, which has in the past provided about the same amount as South Korea, although China also supplies grains to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on commercial terms. So far this year, Chinese food deliveries appear to be down to about 30 per cent of 2005 levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.11/1">Early indications from the investigation into the disturbance suggest that the increase in population has resulted in the wider dispersal of juveniles from their home area which may have contributed to an increased level of instability. The final report has now been received and will inform a wider review of factors impacting on stability in the juvenile population. Any measures which can be taken to improve stability will be closely examined.</p>
