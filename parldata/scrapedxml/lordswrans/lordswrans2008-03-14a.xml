	<p pid="a.259.2/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) last employed a dedicated member of staff providing advice on civilian-military issues at headquarters level in November 2007. DfID currently has two identified liaison points for civilian-military issues at headquarters level in the conflict, humanitarian and security department. Many other DfID staff work closely with Ministry of Defence personnel either at country level or through mechanisms such as the conflict prevention pools, the stabilisation unit and the security sector development advisory team (SSDAT). We believe that this arrangement will provide a better and more appropriate range of engagement with both the Ministry of Defence and the military.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.5/1">Financial support for students attending full-time higher education courses is provided through the Student Loans Company (SLC) in conjunction with relevant local authorities which assess entitlement under the student support regulations. The total package of student support available comprises six elements:</p>
	<p pid="a.259.5/2">tuition fee loans to cover the cost of tuition charged by the higher education institution (HEI);maintenance loans and/or grants to help cover general living costs, such as accommodation, food, travel and study;adult dependants grant to help students with an adult who depends on them financially;childcare grant for students with dependent children in registered or approved childcare;parents' learning allowance for students with dependent children to meet course related costs such as books, materials and travel; and disabled students' allowances (DSAs) to help students in higher education with the extra costs they may incur on their course as a direct result of a disability, mental health condition or specific learning difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.5/3">Ministers take the view that prisoners have no need of maintenance support for higher education, since they are accommodated at public expense. The Education (Student Support) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 therefore provide that a student who is a prisoner is not eligible for any part of the full-time student support package, with the exception of tuition fee loans and disabled students' allowance. The amended regulations came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.5/4">A detailed breakdown of the number of serving prisoners affected by the Education (Student Support) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 is not yet available. In his Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-07">7 February</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills stated that he would endeavour to make further relevant information available to the House prior to any debate on the revised regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.5/1">The World Bank follows a country-led approach to development whereby projects and programmes implemented by the International Development Association (IDA) are identified as priorities for Bank funding by the governments in the countries themselves. The UK and the Bank continue to support efforts to strengthen dialogue between civil society and governments in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.5/2">In our discussions with civil society groups last year, they made clear to us that they saw a need for the bank to improve its practice on conditionality further and extend its use of poverty and social impact assessments. The bank has made significant improvements in its practice in these areas. This is reflected in, for example, the reduction in the average number of conditions from around 35 in 1999 to around 10 in 2007. Nevertheless, we used last year's IDA replenishment negotiations successfully to press the bank to make further improvements, including applying the good practice principles on conditionality effectively. These commit the bank to ensuring that conditions are not imposed. We will continue to work to ensure more progress on both issues.</p>
