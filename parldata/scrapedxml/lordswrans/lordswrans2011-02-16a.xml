	<p pid="a.163.5/1">The Government believe that there is a strong link between the cultivation of coca for traditional purposes and the cultivation of coca for the cocaine trade. For example, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime Coca Survey 2009, only 39 per cent (12,000 hectares) of total Bolivian coca production is permitted by Bolivian authorities, and this is against the background of the permitting of any coca production being at variance with its obligations under the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.5/2">The 12,000 hectares are said to be for the production of coca for traditional uses, including chewing, medicines and tea. It was stated by the Bolivian Government in January 2011 that at least 20 per cent of coca produced from within this 12,000 hectares had been diverted from officially controlled coca markets to the drugs trade. Much of the remaining 61 per cent of the total production also services the cocaine trade.</p>

We are closely monitoring the former. We raised, through the EU, our concerns with military orders and have received assurances that they will not be used in this way.</p>

This includes reaching pre-2007 levels of exports by the middle of this year, allowing the import of dual-use raw materials for manufacture, and ensuring Gaza has access to its traditional markets of Israel and the West Bank. Reviving Gaza's economy is in Israel's interests; it will create jobs, counter radicalisation, provide an alternative to the Hamas-controlled tunnel smuggling economy and bolster Gaza's pragmatic business community.</p>

The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) reports that 600 refugees enter Liberia each day. Refugees are being hosted in communities in approximately 25 communities in Nimba County. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees is working to construct three refugee camps in Liberia. Delivery of assistance to refugees in Liberia is being hampered by recent heavy rains and the poor state of roads.</p>

This is essential for Israelis, for Palestinians and for the international community, including the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/2">We welcome and support the World Bank's assessment that, &quot;if the Palestinian Authority maintains its current performance in institution building and delivery of public services, it is well positioned for the establishment of a State at any point in the near future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/3">We are strong supporters of this work including through UK funding of &#163;113.45 million from 2008 to 2010. Mr Burt announced a further &#163;17 million funding during his recent visit.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.0/1">The Government believe the Sale of Goods Act 1979 provides consumers with a high level of protection but is more complicated than it needs to be. This complexity of the law can reduce consumers' awareness and understanding of their rights. For example, many consumers are not aware that the rights granted under the 1979 Act are attached (added into) the contract the consumer has with the seller. Also, where goods are supplied in the course of a service it can be difficult for consumers to know whether this is a contract for the sale of goods covered by the 1979 Act, or the supply of services to which the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 would apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.0/2">The previous Government commissioned academic research on how the law on the sale and supply of goods and services to consumers might be modernised and simplified to make it clearer and more accessible to consumers and businesses. Their report has been published on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills website. The Government are currently considering this report with a view to publishing a consultation paper in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.5/2">The June 2010 Budget announced a &#163;1,000 cash increase in the income tax personal allowance for those aged under 65 to &#163;7,475 in 2011-12, with real terms gains focused on basic rate taxpayers through a &#163;1,400 cash reduction in the higher rate threshold in income tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.5/3">As a result of this announcement, an estimated 380,000 individuals are likely to move into higher rate of tax in 2011-12. However, an estimated 280,000 of those moving into higher rate tax are better off as a result of the measure because they experience the full benefit of the allowance increase without experiencing the full loss from the reduction in the basic rate limit. The increase in numbers paying higher rate tax as a result of this measure is estimated to be 400,000 in 2012-13 and 420,000 in 2013-14.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.5/4">These impacts are described in the tax impact and information note <I>Income Tax Rates, Rate Limits and Personal Allowances for 2011-12, </I>available on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs website: <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget-updates/autumn-tax/tiin2525.pdf">www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget-updates/autumn-tax/tiin2525.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.6/21">The routes of both the points-based system tier 1 post study and the international graduates scheme have never led directly to settlement in their own right.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.6/22">However, migrants on these routes are allowed to apply for indefinite leave under Long Residence where such leave would count towards the requirement or they are able to switch into routes which do lead to indefinite leave such as tier 1 general of the points-based system.</p>
