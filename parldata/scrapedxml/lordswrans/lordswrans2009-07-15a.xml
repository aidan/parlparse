	<p pid="a.221.2/1">The draft Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Special Exemption) Regulations 2009 will replace the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Special Exemption) Regulations 1991. The regulations have been updated to take account of the changes made by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 (the 2008 Act), specifically to the definition of embryo and the introduction of human admixed embryos. The regulations themselves do not introduce any new offences or new policy. The regulations are simply being remade in consequence of amendments made by the 2008 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/2">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 Act prohibits storage of gametes and creating, keeping or using embryos without a licence. This key principle has been retained by changes made by the 2008 Act. There are two exceptions to this that were set out in the 1991 regulations. The same two exceptions have been retained in the updated regulations. The regulations do not remove the requirement for a licence to create or use and embryo.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/3">The first exception relates to the keeping of gametes or embryos in connection with an investigation or proceedings relating to an offence under the 1990 Act. This power to provide for such an exception is set out on the face of the 1990 Act. It refers only to gametes and embryos, not human admixed embryos, so there is no scope for the regulations to provide for this. If such circumstances arose, the human admixed embryos could be kept as evidence at a centre that had a storage licence. It does not alter the principle that no person may create, keep or use a human admixed embryo without a licence or mean that the HFEA would not investigate thoroughly any suspected offence under the 1990 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/4">Earlier this year the department consulted on four sets of regulations in connection with the implementation of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. However, the department did not consider it necessary to specifically consult on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Special Exemption) Regulations 2009 as they do not represent a change in government policy. The changes made to these regulations were consequential to changes in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. There was extensive consultation, scrutiny and debate on the changes in the Bill leading to the 2008 Act, which these regulations reflect, during the passage of the Bill itself. However, we do regret that it was necessary to re-lay the draft special exemption regulations. We note the Merits Committee's acknowledgement that the department acted quickly to correct the draft regulations and we will look at any lessons learnt from the laying of these regulations.</p>

This limits the scope of the regulations to make provision in relation to the keeping and examination of gametes and embryos, and not human admixed embryos. It is a criminal offence to keep a human admixed embryo without a licence. If it were necessary for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to keep a human admixed embryo in connection with crime, it would need to be stored at a licensed premise.</p>

However, it is not known how many schools have obtained an appropriate permission to cover live performances of music and the provision of entertainment facilities, or indeed any other form of regulated entertainment such as a dance event or a play. In some cases, a school may decide to put on an event by giving a temporary event notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.2/2">Although the Licensing Act 2003 requires schools and colleges to obtain a licence for regulated entertainment to which the public are invited, or for a private entertainment where a fee is charged with a view to profit, they are exempt from paying the licence fee if the event is provided by, located at and for the purpose of the school or college.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.3/1">The Government are taking steps to encourage competition on High Speed 1 from 2010 and to expand the number of European destinations available by rail from the UK. This was one of the principal objectives behind the recent financial restructuring of London and Continental Railways which the European Commission said would &quot;benefit competition and users in view of the forthcoming liberalisation of international passenger transport by rail in 2010&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/2">Following this financial restructuring, it is the Government's intention, in due course, to sell a long-term concession for High Speed 1. This will incentivise and maximise usage of the line, and encourage the concessionaire to help train operators develop new international services. It will be for the future operator of High Speed 1 to market the railway and to agree terms of access with international train operators. We understand that High Speed 1 has had some preliminary discussions with potential operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/3">The Government's interest in Eurostar is aimed at ensuring that Eurostar can continue to offer attractive service to passengers whilst also being able to compete with expected new train operators on a level playing field in the future. This was also recognised by the Commission in its approval of this support.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/4">High Speed 1 is not the only infrastructure to be used by cross-Channel high-speed trains. The Government maintain their support for the European Commission in promoting policies that ensure the regulatory arrangements and charging structures of the other infrastructure operators do not act as a barrier to competition on Eurostar routes.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.9/2">The department has already provided a range of tools to help schools make the most effective use of their resources including financial benchmarking, the strategic planning guide, the financial management standard in schools and the offer of a free one-day consultancy visit on improving value for money. The Education Procurement Centre is working with schools to carry out procurement health checks which help to identify where savings can be made. The e-procurement tool OPEN has been developed to help schools buy products online and compare prices of a range of suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.9/3">The report supports our position on surplus school balances. It is sound financial management for schools to retain a small surplus from year to year, and revenue funding is intended to support the education of children in school now. It should not be necessary for it to be channelled into capital improvement projects given that separate and substantial capital funding has been made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.9/4">Schools and authorities must work to reduce high balances over the next two years. If total revenue balances and the excessive balances held by individual schools do not reduce substantially by 2010-11, the Government will consult on further action from 2011-12 to bring the total down.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.9/5">The department provides a reference document called <I>A Guide to the Law for Schools Governors</I> (the guide) to all schools and local authorities to inform them of the legal duties applicable to governing bodies of maintained schools. The guide includes information about the allocation of schools budgets and informs governors that there is a provision in the scheme for financing schools (the scheme) for the local authority to claw back excess surplus budgets. The scheme is issued by their local authority and sets out the financial relationship between the local authority and the maintained schools in their area. The scheme must include a mechanism on how the local authority will control excessive school balances, defined as greater than 5 per cent of the annual budget in secondary schools and 8 per cent in primary and special schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.9/6">In accordance with paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 14 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (the Act), the local authority must consult all the governing bodies and schools in its area if it proposes to make any revisions to the provision of its scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.9/7">Additionally we have commenced a survey of local authorities practice and experiences in clawing back and managing surplus balances, in partnership with the Local Government Association and the results of this survey will be used to inform possible further action or guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.0/1">There are no plans to reimburse the worker registration scheme fee for those who are made redundant. The fee is designed to recover the cost of administering the scheme and is not linked to how long applicants remain in employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/2">Those who are made redundant may seek alternative employment and reregister without charge. The fee applies only to initial applications and not to those who are registering a change of employment.</p>
