There is currently one such prosecution under consideration arising from the 50 complaints received from migrant workers in the past year.

	<p pid="b.125.3/1">In 2004 the Government's Foresight report <I>Future Flooding</I> estimated that, with climate change impacts and increased economic wealth, annual average flood damages could rise between two and 20 times by the end of the century. However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the extent of these changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.3/2">The UK produces a relatively small proportion of global carbon emissions and domestic efforts alone will not have a significant effect on coastal flood risk in England between now and 2030. National action must be part of a much bigger international strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.3/3">A certain amount of climate change is now inevitable over the next few decades: we need to plan for and adapt to this. Climate scientists broadly agree that the UK is likely to face rising sea levels and more frequent floods and storms. For example, the Thames Barrier is already being used around five times a year; by 2030 we expect it to be closing up to 30 times a year. In addition, we need to minimise the effects of dangerous climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.3/4">Defra has for many years provided guidance to the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards to help them take account of climate change impacts in the design of present-day flood and coastal erosion risk management measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.130.2/1">Evidence from the Labour Force Survey 2004-06 shows that there are around 15,000 women and around 5,000 men who have two jobs each paying below the lower earnings limit but when aggregated their earnings are at least equal to the lower earnings limit, who do not otherwise qualify for the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.2/2">These are point-in-time data and people may not remain in this position for lengthy periods and may well have other opportunities to build up qualifying years during their working lives. The reforms proposed in the Pensions Bill, including the reduction in the number of qualifying years to 30 for a basic state pension, mean that people reaching pension age from 2010 will have far greater opportunity to build improved state pension entitlement over their working life.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.2/3">Table 1 below shows the estimated cost of providing a national insurance credit, from 2010, to people whose earnings would exceed the LEL if aggregated. Estimated numbers of people who would be eligible for such a credit are based on the above figures and take into account, for example, the projected increase in the working age population.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.2/4">However, such a national insurance credit would not be awarded on any form of self-certification basis without any evidence. All national insurance credits and the proposed new carer's credit are awarded on the basis of evidence. To satisfy the evidence requirement it would fall to employers to collect and aggregate earnings information to provide that evidence base, and we have ruled out aggregating earnings information in this way because of the burdens on business.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.2/5">If earnings information were to be collected on an aggregate basis by a collective of relevant employers and earnings exceeded the national insurance thresholds then national insurance contributions would be payable. It would be only right and fair to expect individuals and employers to pay national insurance on those earnings where a liability arises. It would be unfair to give people a free pass for pension purposes but exempt them from their national insurance liability.</p>

Similarly, information in the Labour Force Survey does not permit precise identification of people who are already qualifying for state pension, and so proxies have been used.

	<p pid="b.132.5/1">Defra has not estimated the total potential for landfill allowance trading scheme (LATS) liability for all London boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.5/2">Waste disposal authorities (WDAs) have a duty to hold sufficient landfill allowances to cover the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) they landfill in any LATS year. The flexibilities provided by LATS enable WDAs to meet their obligations under the scheme in the most cost effective way. They can do this by reducing the amount of waste landfilled, purchasing additional allowances, borrowing allowances from future scheme years (with restrictions) or a combination of these approaches.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.5/3">Without financial penalties, there would be no incentive for authorities to keep within the rules of LATS and the trading mechanism would not operate effectively. The penalty for landfilling more BMW than permitted by the number of allowances held in a scheme year is &pound;150 per tonne of BMW.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.5/4">The landfill allowances scheme regulations provide powers for the Secretary of State to impose supplementary penalties on waste disposal authorities that contribute to any national breach of targets. Any WDAs that failed to meet their obligations under LATS in landfill directive target years would also be liable to a supplementary penalty.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.5/5">The flexibilities included in the scheme, including the Secretary of State's power to waive or suspend penalties in given circumstances and the reconciliation period at the end of each scheme year, means that no authority should face penalties unless it takes the conscious decision to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.5/6">If the UK were not to comply with European Union landfill directive targets to reduce the amount of BMW landfilled, it may be liable to fines. An adverse ruling against the UK in the European Court of Justice could result in fines of up to &pound;180 million per year. These would ultimately be paid by council tax payers in those authorities that had failed to meet their landfill obligations. If all London boroughs failed to meet their obligations, the combined liability could be as much as 5 per cent of council tax bills. If a subset of London boroughs were to fail to meet their obligations, the liabilities on those individual boroughs could be higher.</p>
