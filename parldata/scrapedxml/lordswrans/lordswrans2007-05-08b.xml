The UKSCI report, consisting of 11 recommendations to the Government, was published in December 2005. In response, the Government accepted the recommendations in full.

	<p pid="b.249.6/1">It is possible in criminal cases to apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) following a successful application to the European Court of Human Rights. For cases to which the Government were party in domestic proceedings, which have then been the subject of a decision of the Strasbourg court against the United Kingdom, the Government would be expected to take such measures as necessary to rectify the position as part of the implementation of the judgment. The Government do not believe that it would be appropriate to make general provision for the reopening of cases between private parties following a successful application by one party to the Strasbourg court. There is a substantial risk that a general ability to reopen proceedings would adversely affect the rights and interests of other parties to domestic proceedings: an application to the Strasbourg court by a unsuccessful litigant in domestic proceedings could take some years to be resolved finally, during which period the other parties, who would not ordinarily be party to the Strasbourg case, could not rely on the conclusion reached in the domestic proceedings remaining final. There is power to include retrospective provisions in remedial orders under the Human Rights Act or in primary legislation to remedy a convention incompatibility.</p>
