	<p pid="a.77.2/1">At the November 2001 meeting in Paris of the OECD Working Party on Export Credits and Credit Guarantees an informal and voluntary agreement to raise environmental standards for capital goods exports was reached between 24 of the 26 OECD export credit agencies (ECAs). The USA and Turkey&mdash;for different reasons&mdash;were unable to support the agreement.

	<p pid="a.77.2/4" class="indent">An obligation for ECAs to screen all applications for support of projects and project related capital goods in order to identify and review those which may have an adverse environmental impact (including resettlement, indigenous or vulnerable groups and cultural heritage).</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/5" class="indent">Procedures under which ECAs would classify projects according to their sensitivity to help ensure a thorough environmental review, including a full environmental impact appraisal for sensitive sectors and locations before decisions are taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/6" class="indent">An obligation to compare or benchmark the projects against international standards such as those contained in the guidelines of the World Bank Group. Projects that did not comply with these standards would need to be fully justified. In addition ECAs would need to explain any departures from international standards through reporting and transparency procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/7" class="indent">Obligations to encourage the dissemination of information relating to environmental impacts, subject to national legal provisions on public disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/8" class="indent">Robust reporting provisions which will assist in a review of the recommendation no later than the end of 2003 with the aim of &quot;enhancing it in the light of experience&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">At the November 2001 meeting of the OECD's Export Credit Group, the United States was unable to agree to support the recommendation on Common Approaches to the Environment and Officially Supported Export Credits, principally because it did not explicitly require that:</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2" class="indent">1. All Export Credit Agency (ECA) supported projects comply with the more stringent of the host country standards or the environmental standards of the World Bank Group; or that</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/3" class="indent">2. ECAs make public environmental impact information relating to projects being reviewed by ECAs before the ECA reaches its decision on supporting a project.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/4">The UK played a key role in securing widespread support among the other OECD member states for an informal agreement which has for the first time created a level playing field in terms of environmental impact analysis in the field of capital goods exports.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/5">This agreement sets clear guidelines on the use of international standards as benchmarks. For a number of reasons, however, including legal constraints in some countries, it encourages rather than makes mandatory the advance public disclosure of environmental impact information.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/6">The agreement on common approaches is a significant beginning and we hope that the coming months will see our US colleagues in a position to join the agreement and take part in its review and development.</p>

The 55 appeals that she quoted were in the whole of North Yorkshire, rather than in the Thirsk area. The number of appeals upheld by the divisional veterinary manager is 26 and not 29. The following is the correct information in relation to these appeals.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/2">(a) The parishes where the 55 appeals were lodged against the contiguous cull were Bainbridge, Belbusk, Bishopdale, Boltby, Bolton by Bowland, Burnside, Cracoe, East/West Barnby, Embsay, Felixkirk, Fryup, Giggleswick, Gisburn, Great Fryupdale, Halton West, Hawnby, Hebden, Hetton, Hutton Mulgrave, Kepwick, Kirby Knowle, Kirby Malham, Lealholm, Linton, Lythe, Malham, Nether Silton, Over Silton, Rathmell, Rimington, Silsden, Sowerby, Sutton under Whitestonecliff, Thornton in Craven, Ugthorpe, West Bradford and Wigglesworth.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.5/4">Of these appeals there were seven cases where infection was subsequently diagnosed and infected premises declared. These were in the parishes of Belbusk, Bishopdale, Halton West, Kepwick, Lealholm, Linton and Nether Silton.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/5">(c) In three of these seven cases there were no dangerous contacts or contiguous premises.

	<p pid="a.85.5/6">(d) Infection was confirmed in four cases following the rejection of appeals by the Government's veterinary staff in North Yorkshire and infected premises were confirmed in the parishes of Felixkirk, Kepwick, Lealholm and Sutton under Whitestonecliff.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.3/1">All six countries in question control foot and mouth disease (FMD) by means of a vaccination programme. As a result, the EU maintains demanding conditions for the importation of meat from those countries in accordance with internationally recognised standards. These conditions go far beyond veterinary inspection prior to slaughter and among other things require the farm of origin and the slaughterhouse to be in an area free from cases of FMD and require any meat exported to be matured for a specified period and de-boned before dispatch. Pigmeat cannot be imported from these countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.3/2">Although the conditions under which we may currently export meat are also demanding, we can expect them to be removed once we are considered free of FMD. We will then be able to approach third countries to ask them to accept UK meat in accordance with the accepted international standards for a country free of FMD. Restrictions due to BSE will continue to limit exports of beef.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.6/1">The European Commission's proposal for an EC Regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer published in August 1998 did not include mandatory recovery of ozone depleting substances from refrigerators and other equipment, including rigid foams. It proposed that such recovery was only to take place &quot;if practicable&quot;. Following discussion by officials in Environment Working Group in November 1998, the Presidency proposed an amendment to the draft regulation to make recovery of ozone depleting substances mandatory but specifically excluding domestic refrigerators and removing the reference to foams. Since Germany, Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands objected to the exclusion of refrigerators, the Presidency proposed a further amendment to make recovery from such equipment mandatory from <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase>. The amendment did not reinstate the reference to foams. The Council of Environment Ministers in December 1998 reached political agreement on the regulation as amended.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.6/2">The amendment to the draft regulation was formally adopted as part of the common position reached at the Environment Council meeting in February 1999. Following this it became clear that there were different views between member states on the effect of the draft regulation in respect of the need to recover chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) from insulating foam in domestic refrigeration. The UK Government's interpretation was that the amended article only required ozone-depleting substances used as refrigerants to be recovered. Between 1999 until mid-2001, the UK, at the request of the refrigeration and foams industries, sought a definitive legal interpretation from the Commission. In the meantime the new regulation was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in June 2000 and became EC Regulation 2037/2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.6/3">In February 2000, the Commission circulated a table of clarifications which included an interpretation of the requirement in the regulation to remove CFCs and HCFCs from refrigeration equipment. It stated that this requirement did not cover foams in commercial refrigeration as &quot;it was the Commission's understanding that the clarification proposed here is in line with the intention of the Council during the negotiations of the new Regulation&quot;. As the effect on domestic refrigerators was not settled, officials raised the issue at the EC Management Committee meeting on the implementation of the regulation on ozone depleting substances in March and again in October 2000. In October it was agreed that foam containing CFCs was classified as a &quot;product&quot; rather than a &quot;controlled subtance&quot; and therefore recovery of ozone depleting substances from commercial refrigeration need only be done &quot;if practicable&quot;. However, as some member states emphasised the practicality of effective recovery from fridges the issue of recovery of CFC from foam in domestic refrigerators remained unclear. But in June 2001 the European Commission provided a final interpretation that Regulation 2037/2000 did in fact require the recovery of controlled substances from the insulating foam of domestic refrigerators.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.5/1">Section 1(2) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 defines &quot;mountain, moor, heath or down&quot; as excluding any land which appears to the Countryside Agency or the Countryside Council for Wales to consist of improved or semi-improved grassland. Subject to that qualification, the Act defines &quot;mountain&quot; as including any land which is more than 600 metres above sea level.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/2">The duty to prepare maps of open country (mountain, moor, heath, or down) and registered common land lies with the two countryside bodies. The Countryside Agency's criteria for identifying mountain, moor, heath and down are set out in its published mapping methodology which explains in detail how the agency will approach the task of preparing the maps. The methodology summarises the characteristics of each of the land types which comprise open country as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/3" class="indent">Mountain &mdash; all land over 600 metres above sea level and other upland areas comprising rugged and steep land, crag, scree, fell, or other bare rock and associated rough vegetation. It does not include coastal cliffs. It includes semi-natural upland vegetation, but does not include agriculturally improved or semi-improved grassland. It may include areas of bracken, scattered trees, open water, rivers, streams, bogs, mires, bare peat, or a mosaic of these.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/4" class="indent">Moor &mdash; land usually of an open character with semi-natural vegetation such as; mires (including blanket bog), heaths, rough unimproved acid grassland, and upland calcareous grassland. It does not include agriculturally improved or semi-improved grassland, but may include areas of unimproved bent-fescue grassland, scattered trees, scrub, bracken, open water, rivers, streams, bare peat, rock outcrops or other bare ground, or a mosaic of these. Moor usually occurs in upland areas but may also be found in lowland areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/5" class="indent">Heath &mdash; land of a generally open character, usually characterised by natural ericaceous dwarf shrubs. Heath usually occurs in lowland areas on nutrient poor soils. The typical vegetation types are heathers, gorse, bilberry, mires, scrub, unimproved grassland, and bracken. It does not include agriculturally improved or semi-improved grassland, but may include areas of scattered or dense naturally regenerating trees, open water, rivers, streams, carr, sand or other bare ground, or a mosaic of these.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.5/6" class="indent">Down &mdash; land comprising semi-natural grassland in areas of chalk or limestone geology generally within an open landscape. The typical vegetation type is unimproved grassland often with scattered scrub. It does not include agriculturally improved or semi-improved grassland, but may include areas of scattered trees, dwarf shrubs, streams, springs, or a mosaic of these.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.11/1">There are currently no plans to make ethnic monitoring mandatory in primary care. However, the Department of Health has, through sponsorship of pilot projects, developed several examples of good practice in primary care race equality monitoring, including ethnicity, and has encouraged the sharing of this experience. Primary care trusts (PCTs) and primary care groups, through their work in developing local health improvement and modernisation plans (HIMPs), continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the diversity of local needs, including those of minority ethnic groups, are identified. With the shift in the balance of power to the frontline and the formation of strategic health authorities, PCTs will from next year lead the development of local HIMPs and be the main focus for partnership working with key stakeholders. HIMPs inform local healthcare professionals on the concerns and priorities within a community of all local agencies as well as the public and patients who use NHS services. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act will also require PCTs to monitor the implementation of policies and programmes to ensure they meet the needs of ethnic minorities and promote good race relations between different racial groups. The Government's overall strategy to improve the nation's health will lead to a more positive effect on minority ethnic health.</p>

In 2001&ndash;02, funding included provision for the following cost pressures on the National Health Service: pay awards of around 3.9 per cent. on average; other pay pressures such as the new contract for junior doctors and the introduction of cost of living supplements for some staff living in the South of England; non-pay inflation in the National Health Service which is above the level of general inflation; growth in prescribing costs of around 10 per cent., made up of trend growth, the additional impact of appraisals made by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence and the implementation of national service frameworks.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.2/1">In the light of recent rulings of the European Court of Justice, we announced that we would amend the National Health Service Act 1977 to enable the NHS to commission treatment within the European Economic Area (EEA).

The NHS will meet the cost of the patient's travel from the point at which they begin their international journey (the airport, ferry port or international train station) to the foreign provider. Reimbursement of travel expenses between the patient's home to the airport, ferry port or international train station will be governed by the same rules that currently apply to payment of travelling expenses to hospitals in England.
