As the noble Lord is aware, the Government are committed to preventing the indiscriminate disposal of school playing fields and want to ensure that playing fields needed by schools and local communities are retained. To this end, the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires local authorities to obtain the written consent of the Secretary of State before disposing, or changing the use, of any playing field that has been used by a maintained school in the past 10 years. I can confirm that no application has been received from Bristol to dispose, or change the use, of the playing fields at the Merrywood School.</p>

Key Target 1 Consistent with Treasury requirements, to achieve at least a 6 per cent return on capital employed. Key Target 2 To increase new business income (from customers other than the UK MoD) from &pound;137 million forecast to be achieved in 1999-2000 to &pound;165 million. Key Target 3 To increase the number of staff elected as fellows of professional bodies by 5 per cent from a baseline at <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-31">31 March 2000</phrase>. Key Target 4 To achieve on time 90 per cent of the agreed milestones on work for MoD customers. Key Target 5 To maintain the level of MoD customer satisfaction as measured by core questions. Key Target 6 Over a period of three years (1998-1999 to 2000-2001), to achieve a 20 per cent increase in peer reviewed publications per professional. For 2000-2001, this translates into achieving a figure of 7.1 publications per 100 professionals from a baseline at <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> of 6.3. Key Target 7 Over a three-year period from 1998-1999 to 2000-2001), to increase by 50 per cent the number of scientific teams assessed as &quot;world-class&quot; in the technical assessment exercise. For 2000-2001, this translates into achieving 24 from a current baseline at <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> of 19.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.2/1">In order to provide a more accurate and relevant picture of the overall full-time manpower available to the Armed Forces, we plan to include in the definition of the strength of the Services all full-time personnel, including Full-Time Reserve Service personnel and, in the case of the Army, Gurkhas. In view of their discrete and specialised task in a particular location, the Royal Irish (Home Service) will be reported separately. This change will take effect from September 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.2/2">The inclusion of Full-Time Reserve Service personnel is in line with our aim to make reserve forces more relevant and usable and is a natural consequence of the Reserve Forces Act 1996, which provides for the employment of reservists in place of full-time regular personnel.</p>
