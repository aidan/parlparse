	<p pid="a.121.8/26">Her Majesty's Government have been very active in recent years in encouraging more UK exports to the US. For example, in November 1998, the Department of Trade and Industry launched its Export USA programme (now under British Trade International) designed to give small- and medium-sized companies the knowledge and confidence to do business in the US market. Over 100 companies are currently in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.8/27">Export USA is an addition to the full programme of promotional events already organised or supported by British Trade International. These events are designed to increase companies' awareness of the huge opportunities that exist for them in the US as well as helping them to understand various aspects of US business practice. The majority are sectorally focused, these sectors including aerospace, biotechnology, giftware, food and drink, creative and media and IT and electronics. In the coming year, British Trade International will be offering support for over 20 sectorally-focused trade missions to the US and for 99 exhibitions and seminars in the US--the latter being the largest ever programme for US events under the Support for Exhibitions and Seminars Abroad (SESA) scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.8/28">In 1999-2000, British Trade International ran over 30 specific US-focused events in the UK. A full programme is planned for 2000-01, specific examples being support for the largest group of UK biotechnology companies to visit the US Bio 2000 event in Boston; support for a visit to the UK by representatives of NASA to tell UK companies about the opportunities for them in the space and related industries; and an ongoing series of workshops on specific topics such as marketing in the US through the Internet, product liability and exhibiting at US trade shows.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.8/29">As well as promotional work here in the UK, Her Majesty's Government also have 12 British Consulates across the US (including Denver, which will open shortly), where the commercial staff (now under British Trade International) are very active in UK export promotion, continuing to provide specific and tailored help to UK companies looking to export to the US as well as to identify specific sales leads from US companies that are made available to UK companies via the TradeUK website.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.8/1">We welcome the consensus achieved by the UN Working Group on an optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict. This is a strong, practical text which clearly establishes that young people under 18 have a right to special safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.8/2">The UK has argued that to stop children as young as 7 or 8 being used as child soldiers, we need standards that will be widely ratified and implemented.

	<p pid="a.133.8/1">My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office (Mr O'Brien) announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-11">11 February</phrase> targets for the recruitment, retention and career progression of women in the fire service. By 2009, the Government expect 15 per cent of the operational fire service (whole-time and retained firefighters and their officers) in England and Wales to be women and for them to remain in the service and be promoted at the same rate as their male colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/2">At present, the number of women in the whole-time operational fire service is only 1 per cent. A recent report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Fire Services has confirmed that there is no possible justification for such low numbers. The target is deliberately challenging and will require brigades to take steps to encourage a more open inclusive culture and to revise procedures and practices which the Chief Inspector's thematic review found to be potentially discriminatory.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will do so as soon as possible, but not before the High Court gives judgment in the current judicial review proceedings. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary proposes to give notice to the parties to the case on the day before he expects to make his decision, and will notify the parties and another place immediately when the decision has been taken. It also remains his intention to make a full oral statement in another place when he is clear that it is appropriate to do so.</p>
