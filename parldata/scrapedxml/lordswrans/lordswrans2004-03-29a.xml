	<p pid="a.127.5/1">The British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands and St Helena are in the process of reviewing their constitutions. We regard it as essential that human rights provisions are included in their revised constitutions, and for this purpose we have provided the territories with a model human rights chapter.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/2">As the British Virgin Islands have only recently established a Constitutional Review Committee it will be some time before the government of that territory are in a position to submit their proposals for a revised constitution. Agreement has not yet been reached with the Government of the Cayman Islands on the inclusion of human rights provisions in their revised constitution, but we remain committed to that objective. In respect of St Helena, we have agreed with the territory's government on the inclusion of human rights provisions in their revised constitution and it is our objective that the new constitution should be in place by July 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/3">In respect of Pitcairn, to date human rights provisions have been taken as forming part of the territory's law. The possible application of the UK Human Rights Act to Pitcairn is currently one of the issues before the Pitcairn Supreme Court, but no decision on the matter has yet been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/4">We are working to ensure that relevant provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights are extended to the sovereign base areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The target date for implementation is <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.5/5">Since the other territories which do not have guarantees of human rights in their written constitutions do not have a settled resident population, the inclusion of such guarantees of human rights in their written constitutions would serve no purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister congratulated President Putin on his victory because it was clear that his re-election reflected the opinion of the huge majority of the Russian people.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.2/2">We note the preliminary findings of the International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) regarding the election and welcome its view that there was a &quot;genuine wish to enfranchise as many people as possible&quot; and that the election was well administered. The report goes on to note that the legal framework established by the Russian authorities &quot;promoted openness and transparency both in the conduct and organisation of the election&quot;. However, we are also concerned by the IEOM's finding that &quot;the State controlled media displayed clear bias in favour of the incumbent&quot; and that the authorities failed to attempt to rectify this situation during the campaign. As part of the EU we have called on Russia to take steps to ensure that future elections meet more fully Council of Europe and OSCE standards, including a free media.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.5/1">Staff at our Consulate General in Atlanta first became aware of Mr Maharaj's detention in October 1988 when they were told of his presence on death row in the Florida State Prison by Professor Radelet, a death penalty researcher from the University of Florida. At the same time, Mr Maharaj wrote to our embassy in Washington to alert them to his predicament.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/2">Our embassy in Washington wrote to the State Department in January 1989 to complain formally that the Florida authorities did not notify the Consulate General of Mr Maharaj's arrest as they are required to under Article 16 of the UK/US Bilateral Consular Agreement. The State Department sent an apology in May 1989.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/3">My noble friend Lady Scotland of Asthal wrote to the State Attorney in Florida in January 2001 informing her of HMG's opposition to the death penalty and complained about the breach of the UK/US Bilateral Agreement. Our Consul General in Atlanta also raised Mr Maharaj's case with Governor Jeb Bush.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.5/4">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to take a close interest in Mr Maharaj's case and to offer him appropriate consular assistance. This has, exceptionally, included instructing US lawyers to file an Amicus Curiae Brief on behalf of the British Government in Habeas corpus proceedings brought by Mr Maharaj. This brief raised the legal issue of non-notification of Mr Maharaj's arrest in 1986 in contravention of the UK/US Bilateral Agreement.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.2/1">The Home Office does not have a dedicated funding programme for tackling alcohol-related crime and disorder although various initiatives across the Home Office can contribute to reducing this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/2">Prior to 2001&ndash;02, crime reduction funding was distributed through the Crime Reduction Programme on a project-by-project basis, but no specific investment was provided to tackle alcohol related crime and disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/3">The Safer Communities Initiative was conceived as a framework for providing CDRPs with funding to supplement mainstream activity to deliver a complementary activity plan of situational and social crime reduction interventions. CDRPs were allowed to use the money to include target hardening activity, supporting repeat victims of property crime; targeted policing activity; tackling anti-social behaviour and youth inclusion work. Plans could legitimately include activity to combat alcohol-related crime and disorder. All 376 CDRPs were allocated a share of the &pound;20 million funding which was made available in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/4">Since April 2003, the Building Safer Communities Fund (BSC) subsumed CAD and SCI, and provided CDRPs with further funding to address a wide range of crime according to local priorities, including any that are alcohol-related.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/5">We also spent &pound;60,481 in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;26,739 in 2002&ndash;03 on research that was alcohol-related. In 2002&ndash;03 &pound;50,000 was also spent on a pilot alcohol arrest referral project in South Camden and &pound;30,000 on a similar project in Watford. Future funding will be considered in the light of the recently published Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England and the spending round.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/1">There is no statutory right of appeal against the decision to fast-track an asylum claim. However, should a claimant or their legal representative consider that there is good reason why a claim is not suitable for fast-tracking, they may make representations to the appropriate IND Asylum Casework Directorate (ACD) team. The ACD teams at both the Oakington Reception Centre and Harmondsworth Removal Centre can and do release claimants from fast-track processes when, for any reason, they become unsuitable for fast-tracking. This might be as a result of representations made or simply because the ACD team considers a claim no longer suitable for fast-tracking. As with the normal asylum process, there is of course a right of appeal within the fast-track process and, in addition, at the Harmondsworth Removal Centre if there is a pending appeal, the adjudicator or the tribunal has the power to order the transfer of the case out of the fast-track process.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/2">These safeguards are applied to all nationalities and types of claimant within the fast-track processes at Oakington and Harmondsworth. John B &mdash; WA15</p>

	<p pid="a.141.2/1">The Government have consulted publicly on a proposal to make simvastatin 10mg available over the counter in pharmacies, to reduce the risk of a first major coronary event in people who are likely to be at a moderate risk of coronary heart disease. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) will advise Ministers on the proposals in the light of the responses to consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/2">Although there have been no direct studies carried out with simvastatin 10mg in the proposed population, there is a very substantial body of evidence that supports the efficacy of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk. CSM was satisfied that simvastatin 10mg was effective in the proposed population.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/3">Current evidence suggests that, for adults in Western societies, it can be beneficial to reduce cholesterol levels whatever the starting point and on this basis, the measurement of cholesterol is not a prerequisite for a decision on the potential benefit of taking a statin. The intention is that pharmacists will be able to offer cholesterol testing to people who want it&mdash;including follow-up testing at defined intervals.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/4">Pharmacists will be trained to ask the right questions to make sure that they only sell statins to people who will benefit from them&mdash;in the same way as they manage the sale of all other pharmacy-only drugs. Pharmacists will be trained to ask patients about their previous medical history and any other medicines that they may be taking. The potential for drug interactions will also be addressed in the patient information leaflet and patients will be encouraged to inform their general practitioner of their use of a statin.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/5">The MHRA/CSM operates the Yellow Card Scheme by which doctors and pharmacists report suspected adverse drug relations to medicines. This system applies to both prescription and non-prescription medicines and will enable the continued monitoring of the safety of the medicine in pharmacy use.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.5/1">The Department of Health takes the lead on work to tackle obesity. However, the department cannot tackle obesity alone. Cross-governmental working is essential. The Government launched their major consultation on public health this month. The public health White Paper will provide the overarching framework to improve public health and will present real opportunities to progress work on the prevention and management of overweight and obesity.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/2">The consultation will enable a wide range of stakeholders to contribute to the debate on obesity. This will build on the work already started through the Food and Health Action Plan and the Activity Co-ordination Team. The Government will draw up their White Paper in the light of the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.8/1">Currently mink trapping is carried out in river catchments, supported by combinations of the Environment Agency (the lead organisation for the water vole Biodiversity Action Plan), English Nature and the local wildlife trusts, and other conservation organisations. These aim for local suppression of mink numbers, for example to assist water vole populations, rather than eradication.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.8/2">The current water vole projects involving mink control are not working to a strict and formal plan, in the true sense of the word, but they are all following guidance and criteria produced by the UK Water Vole Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group and they are part of an informal plan for seeking catchment-scale control of mink in various priority regions of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.8/3">There is no central recording of controlled mink numbers, but each water vole project which involves mink control keeps a record of the mink killed.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">Yes. Council Directive 80/217 permitted the treatment of swill in specialised establishments under official control and provided that such swill could be consigned from those establishments to approved premises. The directive says &quot;Member States may authorise the treatment of swill in specialised establishments equipped for the purpose, on which there are no animals and which are under official control. In this case, by way of a derogation from paragraph 2, the swill may, after heat-treatment, also be used for the feeding of pigs other than fattened pigs, provided that its distribution and use are controlled so as to avoid any risk of the swine fever virus spreading&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/2">Our legislation fully implemented the provisions of the Council directive. The consigning of properly processed swill from approved premises to approved swill feeders was at that time a legitimate activity and was permitted under the directive.</p>
