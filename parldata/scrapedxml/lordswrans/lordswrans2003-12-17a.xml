	<p pid="a.147.2/1">The Land Registry's revised framework document is published today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">Land Registry became an executive agency in July 1990 and a trading fund since 1993. During that period it has met improving financial, customer service and development targets whilst making land registration services progressively more efficient and cheaper.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">The framework document sets out the framework within which Land Registry operates. In particular, it describes the flexibilities it has in terms of financial and human resource management. It also sets out its responsibilities to its customers and its accountability to myself and to Parliament. The document has been produced following a major review of Land Registry's status and business operations in 2000. The report of that review was published in the summer of 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-13">13 October</phrase>, the Land Registration Act 2002 was implemented signalling the most significant legislative reform for Land Registry since 1925. The changes to the operation of the registry that have been brought about by the Act are reflected in the new document.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.5/1">The Electoral Commission was asked to recommend up to three regions or nations that might be able to pilot all-postal voting, and which of these regions would be most suitable to include an e-enabled element.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/2">It published its recommendations on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December</phrase>, concluding that the north-east is most suitable, followed by the East Midlands. The Electoral Commission also then ranked a number of other regions &quot;which could be potentially suitable&quot; but for which it felt unable to make a positive recommendation. These regions, ranked in order of potential suitability, are Scotland, Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, the north-west and the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/3">The Electoral Commission concluded that the remaining regions are not suitable for a pilot in time for the June 2004 elections. Moreover, they also recommended that no region would be suitable to conduct an electronic voting pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/4">The Government are immensely grateful to the Electoral Commission for conducting such a thorough and sophisticated study on this issue, ranking the regions against the criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/5">The Government accept the commission's recommendations not to proceed with any electronic voting on a regional scale in the June 2004 elections. However, it remains committed to the development of e-voting channels and will continue to work with local authorities and others to pilot these methods at future local elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/6">We remain keen, however, to proceed with all-postal voting in three regions. In scaling up towards an e-enabled multi-channel general election after 2006, we believe that pressing ahead with a wider range and variation of piloting provides the best opportunity to learn lessons and develop capabilities in these newer electoral techniques.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/7">The Government intend to pilot all-postal voting in the north-east and the East Midlands and we are also minded to proceed with all-postal voting in a third region or nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/8">The Electoral Commission have been helpful in saying &quot;that there are a number of other regions which could potentially be suitable for conducting an all-postal pilot scheme&quot;. The Government will now consider in more detail each of these further potential candidates, with a view to announcing, in the coming few weeks, where the third all-postal pilot could take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/9">There are good grounds for further consideration in several of the potentially suitable regions, and it is right that we do not rush into a decision on the third pilot, given the advice from the Electoral Commission. For example, although Scotland is well placed for a pilot because it has no local elections, there were some reservations voiced by returning officers which require consideration. We therefore intend to discuss the issues raised by the Scottish returning officers with them over the coming few weeks to see if concerns can be ameliorated and any difficulties ironed out. Similarly, the Electoral Commission also took into consideration the preferences of some returning officers in different parts of regions such as Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, and in the north-west. Further scrutiny by my department of these issues will now take place so that we can conclude which third all-postal voting pilot will proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.5/10">The Electoral Commission has indicated that it regards this way forward as consistent with its report and recommendations. All-postal voting in the north-east, East Midlands and in a third region or nation will not only improve the opportunity for turnout in those areas, but also give voters a more convenient method of expressing their democratic choice in the June elections. The Electoral Commission will report on the lessons learned from these pilots, so that in future these new opportunities can be rolled out on a wider scale.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-12-17a.149.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="149"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo031217/text/31217w01.htm#31217w01_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.149.2/1">The Government welcome Rethinking Crime and Punishment's contribution to the debate on best ways of handling drug traffickers. The main thrust of its recommendations is that drug couriers should be considered for community sentences and that arrangements should be made to allow Jamaican offenders sentenced to community penalities in the United Kingdom to serve them in Jamaica. It is for the court to consider in each case what sentence would be appropriate, taking into account all the circumstances of the offence and the offender. However, importation of drugs is a serious offence and it is unlikely that a community penalty would be appropriate. Enabling community sentences to be served in Jamaica would require changes to Jamaican as well as British legislation. More generally, the Government are continuing to work with the Jamaican authorities to put in place an assistance programme for Jamaica, including on security, crime and the underlying causes of crime and violence. A specific initiative begun in 2002 by the Jamaican authorities and supported by the United Kingdom has been instrumental in reducing significantly the number of couriers with internal concealments travelling in and being detected in the United Kingdom.</p>

This will seek to make the best use of London's transport infrastructure&mdash;one of the most extensive networks of urban public transport in the world&mdash;to provide safe, secure and reliable transport during the Games. Stratford is particularly well served, with seven rail lines running through the Olympic Zone. This will work in our favour. Moreover, extensive improvements are already planned for the London transport system, including the London Underground PPP, which will deliver on average over &pound;1 billion of investment every year for the next 15 years. ra</p>

	<p pid="a.157.2/1">The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is due to begin in 2005. The UK intends to publish a draft National Allocation Plan (NAP) for consultation in January 2004; in which the method for allocating carbon allowances will be set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.2/2">The EU Emissions Trading Directive requires that the total level of emissions reductions required from the scheme is consistent with member states achieving their Kyoto Protocol emissions targets and with their national climate change policies. Therefore, historic levels of emissions, output or input metrics may be used to allocate this total level of emissions to sectors and installations.</p>
