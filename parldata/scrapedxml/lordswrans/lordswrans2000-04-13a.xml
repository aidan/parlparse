	<p pid="a.57.5/1">The new support system is intended to meet the essential living needs of destitute asylum seekers on a short-term basis until the determination of their asylum applications. Toys cannot be considered an essential living need and they have been excluded from being treated as such by the Asylum Support Regulations 2000. However, that does not prevent asylum seekers from using their vouchers and cash to purchase toys. Nor does it prevent accommodation providers or voluntary organisations from providing toys if they choose to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.5/2">Asylum seekers will be spending their vouchers in the knowledge that no change will be given. There is no reason why an asylum seeker should not be able to obtain the full value of his voucher allocation. The largest denomination voucher will be a &pound;10 cash voucher, exchangeable for pounds sterling at a nominated post office. Each asylum seeker and each dependant will be issued one such &pound;10 cash voucher per week. The other vouchers will be in denominations of &pound;5, &pound;1.50p and a further voucher to cover any odd pence in the designated level of support. Asylum seekers will be able to use a combination of their vouchers and cash to ensure that they do not lose out.</p>

A healthy business sector is vital to our standard of living as a nation, and the department has front-line responsibility for supporting British business and for much of the underlying framework for economic activity. Business must lead in the process of modernisation by responding to the spur of competition and exploiting market opportunities. The DTI's task is to help make the UK a more competitive and profitable base for business. It works to do this at home, in Europe and on the wider international stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/2">Among the key elements of its work, the department is working to increase enterprise, innovation and the exploitation of science, to capitalise on the immense potential of electronic commerce and to help business to wire up to the digital market place. It provides help to small businesses to grow, to invest and to improve their skills. It supports economic growth in the regions working with the regional development agencies and others. It is empowering consumers and increasing protection from rogue traders taking forward the Government's energy policy and helping to ensure that business can find people with the skills it needs. The department also seeks to promote the highest standards of scientific excellence, to make the most of the advances made by science, engineering and technology, improving our quality of life, promoting sustainable growth and underpinning the UK's standard of living now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/3">It works to create open, efficient and competitive markets which reward innovation and enterprise. It aims to provide a regulatory structure for business which promotes fairness and avoids unnecessary burdens on business. It is promoting a framework for employees and employers which promotes partnership and a skilled and flexible labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.5/4">The department's aim is to increase competitiveness and scientific excellence in order to generate higher levels of sustainable growth and productivity in a modern economy. The department's objectives, which support this aim, are to promote enterprise, innovation and increased productivity; to make the most of the UK's science, engineering and technology; to create strong and competitive markets; and to develop a fair and effective legal and regulatory framework.</p>

It is putting in place a number of programmes to achieve this: a new enterprise fund to help small firms invest in success, the Phoenix Fund to promote enterprise in deprived areas and a fund to invest in business clusters; launch of the Small Business Service to give smaller businesses a strong voice within government, simplify and improve business support and tackle red tape; the Electronics Commuinications Bill, which will facilitate the use of e-mail and other electronic means of communication in commercial transactions; the joint DTI/DfEE/HEFCE Reach Out Fund to provide new incentives for collaboration between business and universities; additional funding to help business use new technology, through TCS, SMART and the Faraday partnership initiative, the Information Society Initiative and the Environmental Best Practice Programme; the Postal Services Bill, which will modernise and reform postal services and create a world-class postal network in the UK; a leading role in pushing forward the single market in Europe and in preparing for the Lisbon Summit on economic and social reform; a reference to the Competition Commission of the supply of banking services to small and medium-sized enterprises, following the Cruickshank review.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">As set out in my previous answer on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-13">13 January</phrase> (WA 132-33), in principle it is already possible for decisions of the Takeover Panel to be referred to the UK courts in an application for judicial review and for other matters connected with a bid to come before the UK courts in the usual way. However, at present the scope for judicial review of the panel's decisions is extremely limited, and the Court of Appeal has indicated in particular that it is only in exceptional circumstances that it would intervene so as to affect the outcome of a bid. Similarly, at present it is very unlikely (although not impossible) that any point of EC law could arise in connection with a panel decision which was the subject of UK court proceedings so as to make it necessary for the UK court to refer a question to the European Court of Justice. The concern has been raised that the adoption of the directive could make it more likely that points of both domestic and EC law would arise which required adjudication by the UK courts or by the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/2">Her Majesty's Government have therefore negotiated the inclusion of a clause in the draft directive which is intended to allow the courts in the United Kingdom to continue their practice of not intervening in takeover bids and, by implication, of not referring questions to the European Court of Justice. This clause, Article 4.5, includes a provision stating that the directive does not affect the power which courts may have in a member state to decline to hear legal proceedings and to decide whether or not such proceedings affect the outcome of the bid. The Government have said that they would intend to make maximum use of the flexibility provided by Article 4.5 in order to maintain so far as possible the present legal position established by the courts with respect to takeover bids, and that they will consult widely on draft implementing legislation to ensure that they achieve this result in practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.3/1">The Government invited views on their proposals on industry codes of practice in their consumer White Paper of July 1999. The White Paper included outline core principles for all codes and additional principles for e-commerce codes. TrustUK developed its criteria based on these principles in consultation with business, consumer and regulatory organisations. As a result, a considerable number of changes were made. Some consultees would have preferred more detailed criteria in some areas, while others felt certain criteria too prescriptive. The final draft of the criteria was presented to the TrustUK Working Group and a consensus of agreement formed. Codes of practice should be flexible instruments and TrustUK is developing a transparent procedure for keeping its criteria under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/2">All applications for TrustUK approval will be considered by an approval committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. To ensure no conflicts of interest arise, no one who is a member of an organisation that operates an on-line code will sit on the committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.3/14">The constitution and terms of reference proposed for the panel are as set out. These have been revised as a result of consultation and the Government believe they offer a fair way forward. The panel will be able to advise not only claimants and those who hold the items in question in their collections, but also the Government themselves. The Government intend that the panel should begin work as soon as possible. Spoliation Advisory Panel Constitution and Terms of Reference Members of the Panel</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/15">1. The members of the Spoliation Advisory Panel (&quot;the Panel&quot;) will be appointed by the Secretary of State on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit. The Secretary of State shall appoint one member as Chairman of the Panel. Resources for the Panel</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/16">2. The Secretary of State will make available such resources as he considers necessary to enable the Panel to carry out its functions, including administrative support provided by a Secretariat (&quot;the Secretariat&quot;) Functions of the Panel</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/17">3. The task of the Panel is to consider claims from anyone (or from anyone or more of their heirs) who lost possession of a cultural object (&quot;the object&quot;) during the Nazi era (1933-1945) where such object is now in the possession of a UK national collection or in the possession of another UK museum or gallery established for the public benefit (&quot;the institution&quot;). The Panel shall advise the claimant and the institution on what would be appropriate action to take in response to such a claim. The Panel shall also be available to advise about any claim for an item in a private collection at the joint request of the claimant and the owner.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/18">4. In any case where the Panel considers it appropriate, it may also advise the Secretary of State</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/19" class="indent">(a) on what action should be taken in relation to general issues raised by the claim, and/or</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/20" class="indent">(b) where it considers that the circumstances of the particular claim warrant it, on what action should be taken in relation to that claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/21">5. (a) In exercising its functions, while the Panel will consider legal issues relating to title to the object (see paragraph 7(d) and (f)), it will not be the function of the Panel to determine legal rights, for example as to title;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/22" class="indent">(b) The Panel's proceedings are an alternative to litigation, not a process of litigation. The Panel will therefore take into account non-legal obligations, such as the moral strength of the claimant's case (paragraph 7(e)) and whether any moral obligation rests on the institution (paragraph 7(g));</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/23" class="indent">(c) Any recommendation made by the Panel is not intended to be legally binding on the claimant, the institution or the Secretary of State;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/24" class="indent">(d) If the claimant accepts the recommendation of the Panel and that recommendation is implemented, the claimant is expected to accept the implementation in full and final settlement of his claim. Performance of the Panel's functions</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/25">6. In performing the functions set out in paragraphs 3 and 4, the Panel's paramount purpose shall be to achieve a solution which is fair and just both to the claimant and to the institution.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/26">7. For this purpose the Panel shall:--</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/27" class="indent">(a) make such factual and legal inquiries (including the seeking of advice about legal matters, about cultural objects and about valuation of such objects) as the Panel considers appropriate to assess each claim as comprehensively as possible;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/28" class="indent">(b) assess all information and material submitted by or on behalf of the claimant and the institution or any other person, or otherwise provided or known to the Panel;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/29" class="indent">(c) examine and determine the circumstances in which the claimant was deprived of the object, whether by theft, forced sale, sale at an undervalue, or otherwise;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/30" class="indent">(d) evaluation, on the balance of probability, the validity of the claimant's original title to the object, recognising the difficulties of proving such title after the destruction of the Second World War and the Holocaust and the duration of the period which has elapsed since the claimant lost possession of the object;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/31" class="indent">(e) give due weight to the moral strength of the claimant's case;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/32" class="indent">(f) evaluate, on the balance of probability, the validity of the institution's title to the object;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/33" class="indent">(g) consider whether any moral obligation rests on the institution taking into account in particular the circumstances of its acquisition of the object, and its knowledge at that juncture of the object's provenance;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/34" class="indent">(h) take account of any relevant statutory provisions, including stipulations as to the institution's objectives, and any restrictions on its power of disposal;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/35" class="indent">(i) take account of the terms of any trust instrument regulating the powers and duties of the trustees of the institution, and give appropriate weight to their fiduciary duties;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/36" class="indent">(j) where appropriate assess the current market value of the object;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/37" class="indent">(k) formulate and submit to the claimant and to the institution its advice in a written report, giving reasons, and supply a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/38" class="indent">(l) formulate and submit to the Secretary of State any advice pursuant to paragraph 4 in a written report, giving reasons, and supply a copy of the report to the claimant and the institution. Scope of Advice</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/39">8. If the Panel upholds the claim in principle, it may recommend either:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/40" class="indent">(a) the return of the object to the claimant, or</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/41" class="indent">(b) the payment of compensation to the claimant, the amount being in the discretion of the Panel having regard to all relevant circumstances including the current market value, but not tied to that current market value, or</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/42" class="indent">(c) an ex gratia payment to the claimant, or</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/43" class="indent">(d) the display alongside the object of an account of its history and provenance during and since the Nazi era, with special reference to the claimant's interest therein; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/44" class="indent">(e) that negotiations should be conducted with the successful claimant in order to implement such a recommendation as expeditiously as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/45">9. When advising the Secretary of State under paragraph 4(a) and/or (b), the Panel shall be free to recommend any action which it considers appropriate, and in particular may, under paragraph 4(a), direct attention of the Secretary of State to the need for legislation to alter the powers and duties of any institution.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.2/22">It may be helpful to note that in 1992 the Select Committee on Sittings of the House considered &quot;that adequate debate could be achieved and time on the Floor freed through the referral of more instruments to standing committee&quot;. It recommended that affirmative instruments be automatically referred to Standing Committee. (HC (1991-92) 20-I, para 73). This recommendation was implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.2/3">Party leaders can nominate whosoever they wish to receive a life peerage. The Prime Minister has made a commitment not to refuse the nominations of other party leaders that the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee has passed.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">The Government do not believe that a prescriptive approach to smoking in public places and in the workplace represents the most effective way of addressing the problem. A comprehensive government strategy to tackle smoking across the United Kingdom is set out in the White Paper Smoking Kills, which was published in December 1998. With regard to smoking in the workplace, a new code of practice which will define the kind of smoking policies employers need to operate in order to comply with existing health and safety legislation is currently under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is discussing with the Federation of the Retail Licensed Trade the provision of smoke-free facilities in licensed premises. A charter on smoking in public places is expected to be launched before the summer.</p>
