	<p pid="a.219.0/1">Complaints about solicitors are a matter for the Legal Complaints Service and the Solicitors Regulation Authority rather than Government, since the legal profession is independent. The Government are therefore unable to comment on individual cases.</p>

In January 2004 the Law Society issued a policy statement warning that taking success fees could be considered inadequate professional service and in February 2004 the chief executive of the Law Society wrote to firms conducting miners' cases drawing their attention to the policy statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/3">The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) has investigated 60 firms of solicitors in respect of their work under the Coal Health Compensation Scheme; 23 firms have been referred to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the SRA has won the first four disciplinary cases heard there. To date, solicitors have refunded over &pound;3.6 million to miners. This figure may rise as more investigations are completed.</p>

This has resulted in excess of &pound;900,000 being recovered for former miners or their relatives. The LCS accept that to date they have only dealt with a small percentage of the potential complainants, however their role is to make people aware of where they can go to complain if they believe they have a grievance against a solicitor, rather than encourage people to make a complaint.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.2/2">By the end of 2008 the Government expect to have paid &pound;52.8 million in coal investment aid to support mine investment and maintain access to economically viable coal reserves. This has been in addition to &pound;162 million paid under the UK Coal Operating Aid Scheme during 2000 to 2002. As a result of this past support, UK coal producers have been better placed to benefit from the recent recovery in market prices, to the extent that several new developments are now in progress which are wholly commercially funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.2/3">Following the 2006 energy review, the Government have also convened the Coal Forum to bring together coal-fired generators, coal producers and suppliers, power plant suppliers, trade unions, small businesses and government representatives.

In the last VOSA random compliance survey in 2006, 22 per cent of foreign vehicles were found to have prohibitable defects compared with 9 per cent two years earlier;VOSA has developed better targeting over recent years. Use of ANPR technology and weigh in motion sensors have enabled VOSA to concentrate efforts on vehicles and drivers more likely to be non-compliant; andthe Government have given VOSA additional examiners at the roadside to combat the rise in non-compliance. Thirty-six additional front line examiners have been recruited since 2005-06, and a further 100 are being recruited under the &pound;24 million enforcement package announced by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Jim Fitzpatrick, earlier this year.</p>
