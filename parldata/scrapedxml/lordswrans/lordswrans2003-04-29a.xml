	<p pid="a.91.6/1">My honourable friend, Mr Rammell, in his reply of <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase> to a question by my honourable friend Derek Wyatt, in another place (Official Report, col. 459W) concerning the FCO's IT systems, promised a further announcement on the FCO's Focus Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.6/2">We reviewed all the FCO's information and communications technology programmes earlier this year, in the light of the financial constraints we face. Given the relative low priority of the Focus Programme and a substantial increase in its estimated cost from &pound;23.5 million of &pound;42 million over six years (reflecting significant changes to the scope of the programme which involved a greater training requirement, enhanced security arrangements and, post-<phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>, a considerable extra investment in back-up and disaster recovery), we decided to negotiate the cancellation of the contract for the Focus Programme. Agreement was reached with Fujitsu and the cancellation took effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.6/3">At the point of cancellation, the FCO had spent in the region of &pound;9.5 million on the Focus Programme. From this expenditure, we will retain a global electronic directory and a facility allowing on-line discussion groups to help cross-departmental team working. The directory will provide the FCO with savings estimated at &pound;2.5 million over the next five years. We will also be using one of the software licences brought as part of the Focus Programme to develop a new FCO intranet. ral</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">In September 2002 the Government issued a licence for the export of military listed components for use by the Canadian contingent of the Stabilisation Force (SFOR). The components are for logistical purposes. They will be used for the specific purpose of repairing palletised load handling system vehicles used for transporting containers.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2">Bosnia and Herzegovina is subject to an EU arms embargo (imposed by Common Position 96/184/CFSP). The embargo was put in place mainly to ensure the safety of international troops and civilian personnel deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This decision does not affect the Government's continued support for the EU Common Position on arms exports to Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/3">The decision was made in accordance with our practice occasionally to make an exemption to our interpretation of the embargo by approving exports of non-lethal military goods to humanitarian, media or peacekeeping organisations where it is clear the embargo was not intended to prevent those exports and there is a strong humanitarian case for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/4">Her Majesty's Government fully support the Canadian element of SFOR and recognise their legitimate need for the right tools and reliable vehicles to carry out their job effectively. The decision underlines HMG's continued support for the work being done by SFOR in maintaining security and development in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

We have given full support to the inter Congolese Dialogue, which successfully concluded at its recent plenary session in Sun City, South Africa, providing for the early establishment of a transitional national government in the DRC, with a view to democratic elections in two years' time. The UK is an active member of the international committee tasked with supporting this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/2">The UK, through the FCO, has also been actively supporting the United Nations Observer Mission to DRC (MONUC), which is currently considering how best to deploy its mandated peace-keepers on the ground in the DRC. We are also a major contributor to the Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme for the Great Lakes. In Rwanda, contributions totalling &pound;5.047 million were made from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool in 2002&ndash;03 to support the World Bank Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.2/3">In the next few weeks, we hope to agree with Government of Rwanda a Memorandum of Understanding covering UK support for Rwanda's security sector reform process.

	<p pid="a.93.2/4">In Uganda we are actively engaged with a systematic review of defence policy and the resulting needs. The process is fully owned by the Ugandans and a draft White Paper on Defence is due in mid-2003. The paper will address both defence needs and the affordability of the various options set against the government's poverty reduction goals. In the interim we continue to engage with the government over the scale of their defence expenditure to ensure that these poverty reduction programmes are not affected.</p>

Failure to make more rapid progress was because no agreement could be reached on how the service should be funded. The farming unions were calling for a scheme that was fully funded by government. This was not possible, both because it would have contravened state aid rules and because it is government's view that industries, including the agricultural industry, should be responsible for disposing of their own waste.

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">The EU animal by-products regulation insofar as it relates to disposal of fallen stock including poultry will be enforced by local authorities. It is not possible to estimate the total cost of this enforcement activity which will depend on the level of compliance. The State Veterinary Service has 279 permanent veterinarians and 56 casual veterinarians.</p>
