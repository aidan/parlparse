Last week recorded the highest reached number of truckloads crossing through Kerem Shalom and this shows that the crossing can process 180 truckloads, without expanding capacity. Israel has announced that the capacity would reach 250 truckloads by the end of July. The volume and range of goods has increased to include a greater variety of food items, and goods such as water irrigation pipes, cloth fabric and chicken incubators. The British Government, together with the EU and the Quartet, will continue to press Israel to increase the capacity of the crossings for imports and also to allow exports which are vital to the recovery of the Gazan ecomony.</p>

	<p pid="a.330.2/1">The Government's financial support to the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) falls into three main categories: direct budgetary support to the Palestinian Authority which is used in part to pay salaries of government employees including those in the PASF; technical assistance aimed at improving the efficiency and professionalism of the security sector as a whole including the civilian police and emergency services; and direct classroom based training for the PASF. In addition to this the UK has separate activity supporting policing, justice and the rule of law in the Palestinian Territories. As our contributions to the PA budget are provided through a pooled arrangement with other donors and the funds are mixed, we cannot determine exactly how much of our money goes to pay security services salaries. We have a programme of technical assistance to the Ministry of Interior and support two leadership courses for senior and middle-ranking personnel in the PASF including civilian police. These form the bulk of our contribution to the work of the United States Security Co-ordinator. Funding for categories two and three is provided through the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Conflict Pool, a tri-departmental (FCO, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development) conflict prevention programme. Financial support totalled &#163;2.0 million in financial year 2008-9, &#163;2.7 million for 2009-10 and &#163;2.45 million allocated for 2010-11. In addition to that, under the third category, we invested &#163;100,000 in financial year 2009-10 and a further &#163;64,000 has been allocated for this financial year to provide human rights training to the PASF.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.2/2">We took the credible reports of people being killed or tortured during PASF interrogation extremely seriously. We raised it directly with both President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad. We allocated money to fund an inspectorate general within the PASF that would deal with complaints and we continue to press the Palestinian Authority to appoint someone to that role. We provided specific human rights training. Human rights performance is a key element in the Department for International Development's structured dialogue with the Palestinian Authority on budgetary support. We were encouraged by the findings of the independent commission on human rights that torture and mistreatment of people by the PASF, and the intelligence services in particular, had significantly declined by the end of last year. We remain concerned at the use of military courts, the detention of suspects without due process and reports of political interference in judicial decisions.</p>

There are no centrally collected figures on the number of prisoners with a terminal illness or who are mothers with children under the age of 11. No assessment has been made of the impact on the prison population if those categories of prisoner were to be released. We have no plans to release prisoners executively on the basis that they fall within these categories and such prisoners will continue, therefore, to be subject to the release arrangements which currently apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.2/2">The Secretary of State has the power to release certain prisoners in exceptional compassionate circumstances, for example where they are terminally ill and have a short life expectancy or are severely incapacitated or bed-ridden. Prisoners who meet the criteria can apply to be released on these grounds. Prisoners with young children may be eligible for childcare resettlement leave, where they may be considered for release on temporary licence in order to maintain ties with their children.</p>

	<p pid="a.351.2/1" qnum="HL552">To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the number of jobs that will be lost as a result of the &#163;6.2 billion reduction in grant allocations to local authorities for 2010-11 in (a) local authorities, (b) the private sector, (c) the voluntary sector and local partnerships, and (d) government departments and agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.351.3/1">The Government recently announced a reduction in grants to local authorities for 2010-11 of &#163;1.166 billion, not &#163;6.2 billion. This was part of the overall announcement of &#163;6.2 billion savings for 2010-11, to begin tackling the &#163;156 billion deficit, helping to put the public finances on a sound footing, and restoring confidence in the economy. Without action to cut the deficit we are at risk from adverse market conditions, which would mean higher interest rates for all, stifling the recovery and putting jobs at risk across the economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/2">In order to ensure that local authorities have the flexibility to maintain the services important to their area and reshape budgets around their pressures and efficiencies, the Government also announced more than &#163;1 billion of local authority grants to be de-ringfenced in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/3">It is for individual local authorities to make decisions about how the reductions in grants from the Government will affect workforce numbers in their directly employed workforce, the private sector and the voluntary sector in the context of their overall priorities and organisation of their services. It will be for individual government departments to determine the exact implications of how the reduction in grants to local authorities will affect their workforce.</p>

	<p pid="a.352.5/1">Forty-one per cent of river water bodies and 64 per cent of lakes in England and Wales assessed under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) currently fail to meet the phosphate standards for good ecological status. This is based on WFD classification data for the period 2006-08 and was used for the River Basin Management Plans, published in 2009. The main reasons for failure of the phosphate standards are sewage effluent discharges and run-off from agricultural land. There are standards for over 50 other water quality parameters in freshwaters and the sources of pollution causing failures.</p>
