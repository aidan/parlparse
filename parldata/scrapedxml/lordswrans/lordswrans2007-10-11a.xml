Between April 2003 and April 2008 we will have invested an additional &pound;300 million in the discretionary Social Fund, and in April 2006 changes were introduced to make the loans scheme simpler and more accessible. Together these measures have enabled the scheme to provide more help to more people.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">Longer term reform of the Social Fund is being considered in the context of promoting financial inclusion. The Government want to expand people's ability to manage their money and to plan ahead; this includes improving awareness of, and confidence in using, basic financial services such as bank accounts, savings and insurance as well as increasing the availability of affordable credit for those on the lowest incomes. We are exploring ways in which the Social Fund might contribute to this wider strategy and welcome ideas and views from those with an interest in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 introduced a statutory duty on public authorities to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">The disability equality duty (DED), which came into force from December 2006, is made up of two components: general and specific duties. The general duty requires public authorities to actively consider how they can deliver services and carry out functions in a way that promotes greater equality for disabled people. The specific duties require listed public authorities to publish disability equality schemes (DES) that set out how they will carry out their general and specific duties, monitor and report on progress, and have involved disabled people in developing their scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/3">The Disability Rights Commission (DRC) was responsible for ensuring that public sector bodies met their duty to promote disability equality throughout their organisations. During 2007, the DRC carried out a range of projects assessing and reporting on how the public sector had responded to the new duty, and the benefits that have been gained from it. This work now continues with the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/4">The <I>Involvement for Real Equality</I> report found that, while involving disabled people in the development of a DES might present challenges for some authorities, it could result in significant benefits if it was properly resourced and meaningfully conducted. Along with other reports commissioned by the DRC, the<I> Involvement for</I><I>Real Equality </I>report is being used to provide a baseline for future research into the DED. This includes an in-depth assessment of how the DED is being implemented in a range of public authorities which is shortly to be commissioned by the Office for Disability Issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.5/1">In conjunction with the White Paper, the Government published a railway technical strategy. It is designed to provide a long-term technical and operational vision for the railway and explain how this can help contribute to the long-term demands identified in the White Paper. The statements about a cab-based signalling system were built on a long-term vision for command control and signalling that recognised the industry acceptance of the case for introducing the European rail traffic management system (ERTMS) in the short to medium term and as a building block that facilitated the longer term vision. The ERTMS national implementation plan (developed by the Network Rail-led cross-industry team) sets out the UK's plan and the assumptions that go with it.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.2/1">At present there is no definite date for the implementation of European rail traffic management system (ERTMS) level 3, as such products are not available from the established ERTMS suppliers, but the Department for Transport and Network Rail are actively encouraging the development of advanced versions of ERTMS.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.5/1">Her Majesty's Government are unaware of any signalling engineering suppliers developing level 3 European rail traffic management systems (ERTMS). Suppliers across the world have produced a number of communications-based train control systems which are broadly equivalent to ERTMS level 3 in functionality, but based on satellite positioning technology. We hope that ERTMS catches up with these developments, which can deliver substantially improved cost effectiveness and flexibility, whether through existing suppliers or those new to the European market.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.8/1">The business case work by the cross-industry European rail traffic management system (ERTMS) programme team in December 2006 demonstrated that implementing ERTMS may bring direct improvements in capacity and performance while facilitating wider industry benefits arising from bi-directional capability, removal of line-side signals and associated signal sighting constraints. It could also offer an overall reduction in whole-life, whole-industry cost for signalling and train control.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.8/2">The business case also highlighted that these benefits are not uniform across the whole network and that full realisation of them would depend on addressing route-specific issues such as infrastructure bottlenecks and terminal station capacity.</p>
