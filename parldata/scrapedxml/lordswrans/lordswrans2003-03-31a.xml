	<p pid="a.90.4/2" qnum="HL2331">What decision has been made on the future of statutory time limits in the youth court.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-03-31a.90.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="90"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030331/text/30331w01.htm#30331w01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.90.5/1">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced statutory time limits under which cases must be brought to court and dealt with within certain prescribed time limits. These have been piloted in youth courts in six areas in England and Wales and evaluated by independent researchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/2">Sections 43&ndash;45 of the 1998 Act amended Section 22 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to provide for the introduction of three sorts of statutory time limit (in addition to the statutory custody time limits which are already in force). The limits are an initial time limit of 36 days from arrest to first listing; an overall time limit of 99 days from first listing to start of trial; and a sentencing time limit of 29 days from conviction to sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/3">The limits apply to all offences and start at the point of arrest. Whether the decision in a youth case is to reprimand, finally warn or charge, this has to be achieved within the 36-day period; after that time, the case cannot be prosecuted without an extension from the court. Once in court, the case must reach the point of trial within 99 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/4">The police or the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) can seek extensions of the initial or overall time limit but must satisfy the court that they have good and sufficient cause and that they have acted with due diligence. If these time limits are exceeded without an extension being granted, then the case must be discontinued and cannot be reinstituted unless fresh evidence comes to light. There is an appeal mechanism in relation to refusals of applications for the overall time limit but not the initial time limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/5">The evaluators recommended that statutory time limits should be implemented from a human rights perspective. They argued that delays in the youth court need to be curbed in terms of time limits rather than time targets because limits apply to each individual case rather than an average.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/6">The report recommends that before implementation there should be a right of appeal by the police against a refusal to extend the initial time limit pre-charge. This is in order to avoid victims and witnesses of crime falling foul of the system if the police fail to prepare a case on time. Primary legislation would be needed to implement this change. In addition, the report suggests removing the sentencing time limit altogether.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/7">The report also expresses the view that national roll-out would require significant funding, training and a review of courtroom and staff availability.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/8">We have carefully considered the final evaluation report and have consulted the agencies involved at national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/9">We have also given careful consideration to the priorities for the criminal justice system (CJS) following the spending review and the new national targets for the CJS. We have reviewed measures and targets which impact on performance across the board to ensure a cohesive approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/10">Although statutory time limits have been made to work in the pilot areas, concerns have been expressed by the criminal justice agencies at the burden which the limits impose on the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/11">The Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service consider that the limits have increased the administrative burden for the police and CPS in dealing with youth cases. They are also concerned that the limits might conflict with the priority being given to improving the quality and effectiveness of case preparation to reduce the number of ineffective trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/12">The overall view is that the process adds to bureaucracy&mdash;if extensions are needed, applications have to be made to the court and notice served on the defence; and the time limit has to be recalculated for periods unlawfully at large. While only a few cases were lost because extensions were not applied for or were refused, this would be much more of a problem nationally and the potential for loss of public confidence in the system would be that much greater. The impact on victims is of particular concern, especially if the case was perceived as being dropped because of a procedural technicality.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/13">We also consider that it is not necessary to have rigid statutory time limits in each and every case in order to deliver our aim of speedy and efficient preparation for trials or sentencing. In our view, custody time limits and the power of the courts to stay cases where delay amounts to an abuse of process are adequate legal safeguards against undue delay in bringing cases to trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/14">On balance, we consider that the benefits outlined by the final report are outweighed by the arguments put forward by the various agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/15">Taken together with the many other measures that are being taken to improve case management in the criminal justice system, we have decided not to extend statutory time limits across England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/16">Accordingly, regulations have been made to revoke statutory time limits in the pilot areas; these will be laid before the House shortly, to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-22">22 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/17">The focus on timeliness will continue. All CJS areas will be expected to work towards meeting and maintaining the Government's objective to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders&mdash;a target which has been achieved nationally for 15 consecutive months. And timeliness targets have been extended to encompass all youth court cases and other cases in the adult magistrates' courts and Crown Courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/18">The key to successful case management is inter-agency co-operation, with the police, prosecution and courts all playing their part as cases move through the system. We have given the youth courts the tools to monitor live cases and have provided funding for case progression officers. The local criminal justice board will monitor performance on timeliness and will report to the national board.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/19">The evaluation report is available to Members on the Home Office research website: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds</a>. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">The Home Secretary is today, together with US Attorney General, John Ashcroft, signing a new bilaterial extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/2">The current UK-USA extradition treaty was agreed in 1972 and ratified in 1976, with supplementary provisions from 1986. It is outdated and can be significantly improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/3">The new treaty reflects best modern practice in extradition. In particular, it provides that any crime attracting a maximum sentence of 12 months' imprisonment or more in both the requesting and the requested state is extraditable rather than containing a list of offences which are extraditable, as the present treaty does. The advantage of that is that it encompasses offences such as computer related crime which did not exist when the 1972 treaty was drawn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/4">The new treaty brings the evidential rules for requests from the United States into line with those for European countries and simplifies the procedure for the authentication of documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/5">As with the existing treaty, the new treaty provides that in death penalty cases, extradition may be refused unless an assurance has been received that no death sentence will be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/6">The new treaty also maintains the present position that political motivation cannot be used to block extradition in the case of terrorist or other violent crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/7">The treaty stipulates that neither nationality nor statutes of limitations will be a bar to extradition. The treaty also provides the standard speciality protection against onward extradition or surrender, and we have confirmed our understanding that this covers surrender to the International Criminal Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/8">Before the treaty can come into force it needs to be ratified by the United States Senate. It will be brought into force in the United Kingdom by Order in Council. Such an order will be made under the existing Extradition Act 1989 and will carry over when the Extradition Bill, which is curently before Parliament, comes into force. At that point the United States, like all of our extradition partners, will benefit from the new streamlined extradition procedures which the Bill seeks to put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.2/9">The United States is one of our key extradition partners and there is a significant volume of extradition business between the two countries. It is therefore important that our bilaterial extradition treaty should be as effective as possible. I am pleased that it has been possible to reach agreement on the new treaty and that the Government have the opportunity to affirm their commitment to the closest possible co-operation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.5/1">The length of time between formal acceptance of the offer of employment in the Armed Forces and the start of training varies between the services and also depends upon the specific trade that the new recruit is entering. In the Naval Service an applicant who has passed the selection process will wait an average of up to 12 weeks before joining to commence training; in the Army, individuals do not normally have to wait more than six weeks; and the average waiting time for RAF recruits to commence training is three months for officers and six/eight weeks for airmen/airwomen.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/2">However, applicants for branches and trades which are either very popular or where only small numbers are required will wait longer before being able to enlist. At its most extreme example, the waiting list to join as a Royal Navy diver is currently three years and for some flying-related branches in the RN the period is 18 months. Similarly, successful Army applicants for some specialist trades are having to wait up to a year before a course becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/3">Applicants can join an alternative specialisation and apply to transfer at a later date. However, there are applicants who are prepared to wait to join in their preferred specialisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.5/4">Of the 1,310 attested applicants currently awaiting entry to the Naval Service, 860 have been waiting for more than three months. Comparative figures for the Army and the RAF are not held centrally, but even the 408 Army recruits whose initial training was temporarily deferred recently will not have to wait more than the normal six weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.5/1">In line with the recommendation of the Medical Quinquennial Review (MQR) which we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-11">11 April 2002</phrase>, the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency (DMETA) will be established on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>. We will arrange for copies of the new agency's framework document, corporate plan and key targets for 2003&ndash;04 to be placed in the Library of both Houses. The chief executive for DMETA will be Rear Admiral Peter Kidner.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/2">On formation, the new agency will subsume the existing Defence Medical Training Organisation (DMTO). The Defence Secondary Care Agency (DSCA) will be disestablished on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, with its responsibilty for training and placement of service medical personnel transferring to DMETA. Responsibility for commissioning secondary care for service personnel will transfer to a new healthcare directorate within the Defence Medical Services Department (DMSD), formerly the Surgeon General's Department. The overseas hospitals in Cyprus and Gibraltar will transfer to the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) by <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, but during the interim period DMSD will have responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/3">DMETA will make available nominated secondary care personnel for deployments and exercises and deliver appropriate medical, dental and military training and education to specified standards to meet the operational requirement. It will bring together defence medical education and training, including the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), the Defence Deanery, the five Ministry of Defence Hospital Units and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/4">Key targets have been set for 2003&ndash;04 to provide a balanced, challenging but achievable package covering the full range of DMETA's areas of business. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/5">Defence Medical Education and Training Agency&mdash;Key Targets for Financial Year 2003&ndash;04</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/6">Key Target 1&mdash;Deployable Personnel</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/7">To meet 100 per cent of the Commander in Chiefs' requirement for secondary care personnel for operational deployments, major exercises and collective training.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/8">Key Target 2&mdash;Training Success (Quality and Quantity)</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/9" class="indent">(a) Academic. To achieve an overall academic success rate of 95 per cent across all training in the customer-approved annual agreed training requirement, based upon those students that successfully complete the required pre-course assessment where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/10" class="indent">(b) Military. Ensure that 80 per cent of all DMETA personnel, whose medical category permits, achieve their service's annual mandatory individual military training.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/11">Key Target 3&mdash;Academic Success (Timeliness)</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/12">To maintain the index of average time taken for trainees to pass through to the end of Phase II training at less than 1.05.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/13">Key Target 4&mdash;Defence Systems Approach to Training</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/14">Ensure the application of Defence Systems Approach to Training (DSAT) to a minimum of 65 per cent of DMETA course within financial year 2003&ndash;04 and thereafter achieve a year on year improvement of 15 per cent until a steady state of at least 95 per cent is achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/15">Key Target 5&mdash;Efficiency</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/16">Ensure the efficient rationalisation and usage of the current DMETA estate, reducing the agreed balance sheet value of the estate as at <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> by at least 50 per cent by 2010, thereby reducing the cost of training.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/17">Defence Dental Agency (DDA)</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/18">In respect of the Defence Dental Agency, the MQR recommended that it should continue in its present form except that it would lose some training functions to the new DMETA. It also recommended that the DDA should develop more challenging targets, including a new system of dental risk (DR) categorisation. This has now been achieved and the key targets for the DDA for 2003&ndash;04 are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/19">Defence Dental Agency&mdash;Key Targets for Financial Year 2003&ndash;04</p>

	<p pid="a.96.5/23">To achieve 90 per cent of all service personnel in dental risk categories A and B by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/24">Key Target 3&mdash;Treatment Needs</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/25">To reduce the treatment need index for each service to the following: RN at or below 400; Army at or below 600; RAF at or below 330 by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/26">Key Target 4&mdash;Military Training</p>

	<p pid="a.103.2/1">My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister has today published Regional Planning Guidance for the North West (RPG13).</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/2">RPG13 sets out the spatial development strategy that encompasses proposals for the development of the region's economy, housing and transport infrastructure and other land uses. Within the terms of the strategy, priority is given to sustainable development and investment within the North West metropolitan area (especially the regional poles of Manchester/Salford and Liverpool), together with defined regeneration priority areas. RPG13 also sets out proposals for the conservation, management and enhancement of the region's natural and cultural environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is pleased that much of the vision, objectives and core strategy of RPG13 carries forward to a great extent what was proposed in the original draft RPG prepared by the North West Regional Assembly (NWRA). RPG13 reflects the effective working that was achieved between the NWRA, local authorities and other stakeholders, all of which have made valuable contributions to refine and enhance the original draft guidance through public consultation. It builds on the inclusive process for preparing RPG that the Government have put in place. Many of the comments received in response to the consultations carried out earlier have made a positive contribution to the overall strategy for sustainable development and have been taken on board.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.5/1">The Government have today published as CM 5793 a draft Housing Bill for consultation. This aims to tackle some of the most pressing difficulties in private sector housing. The draft Bill will ensure action against unacceptably low housing standards, the impact bad landlords can have on some local communities and the stress in buying and selling a home. These proposals are part of our drive to deliver sustainable communities, as set out in the Deputy Prime Minister's long-term action programme Sustainable Communities: building for the future published in February this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/2">The draft Bill sets out specific legislation in five main areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/3" class="indent">replacing the existing housing fitness standard with evidence-based housing health and safety rating system (HHSRS) as a more effective basis for enforcement against unacceptable housing conditions;</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/4" class="indent">improving the controls on houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), including a mandatory national licensing scheme, to tackle poor physical and management standards;</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/5" class="indent">giving local authorities powers to license all landlords in areas of low housing demand or similar areas where the growth and poor management of the private rented sector frustrates efforts to create sustainable communities;</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/6" class="indent">requiring anyone marketing a home to assemble a home information pack (HIP), so that the information needed by buyers and sellers is available when the property is marketed and abortive costs on the buyer are reduced;</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/7" class="indent">modernising the right to buy scheme by tackling profiteering and emphasising purchasers' responsibilities so that it contributes more effectively to the supply of affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/8">There are additionally clauses introducing a new office of Social Housing Ombudsman for Wales to investigate complaints against registered social landlords in Wales. There are also proposals to give local authority landlords the flexibility to continue introductory tenancies by up to six months, adding to the armoury of measures to tackle anti-social behaviour by tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/9">The consultation period will run until <phrase class="date" code="">9 June</phrase>. The draft Bill, together with the explanatory notes, regulatory impact assessments and issues for consultation, has been published as a Command Paper and will also be available on the website for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Copies of all the consultation material have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/10">The Government have also today published consultation documents on the home information pack, covering its contents and its applicability in areas of lowest housing demand. There will also be separate consultation on possible changes to the powers of the Housing Corporation and National Assembly for Wales to regulate registered social landlords.</p>

In order to free up resources to strengthen the UK's diplomatic network in other parts of the world now more critical for UK interests, Her Majesty's Government have decided to make the following adjustments to our diplomatic representation in Central America. With effect from mid-summer, the embassy in San Salvador will be closed. We intend to appoint an honorary consul and for HM Ambassador at Guatemala City to be simultaneously accredited to the Government of El Salvador. Later this year and early next year we intend to reorganise our representation in Honduras and Nicaragua. In each case, we propose to appoint a charge d'affaires. The ambassadors will at the same time be withdrawn, and HM Ambassador at Guatemala City will be simultaneously accredited to both capitals.

	<p pid="a.107.2/1">We have published NHS complaints reform&mdash;making things right. It describes reforms to the NHS complaints procedure and sets out a programme to improve management of the whole complaints system, elements of which will be subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">The programme builds on the existing NHS complaint procedure, as well as wider initiatives to introduce operational improvements focused on: making the system more flexible so that there is a range of ways in which people can express concerns about the services they have received; improving the local resolution stage so that formal complaints are more likely to be resolved, reducing the need for them to escalate unnecessarily; radical reform to the independent review stage, subject to primary legislation&mdash;by placing responsibility for it with the new Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI); and making sure information about complaints and their causes are an integral part of the system that assures safe, high quality care, which is constantly improving.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">We will achieve this through a combination of changes to the structure and operation of the complaints procedure itself and by recognising the place complaints management has in the system for improving services and the quality of patients' experience of healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/4">The need for primary legislation to establish CHAI means it will not be fully operational before April 2004. This dictates the timetable for comprehensive reform of the NHS complaints procedure as a whole. In the meantime, we will pursue supporting initiatives to bring about improvements in the general approach to complaints in the NHS and pave the way for the more substantive reforms in 2004.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-03-31a.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="108"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030331/text/30331w05.htm#30331w05_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.108.0/1">The Department of Health's public service agreement (PSA), published July 2002, included a commitment to review the target on the education of children in care, in light of the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) project on that subject. Work on the SEU project is nearing completion, and we are now in a position to announce the new target, which is to improve life chances for children, including by substantially narrowing the gap between the educational attainment and participation of children in care and that of their peers by 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">This target will have been achieved if, by 2006, outcomes for 11 year-olds in English and maths are at least 60 per cent as good as those of their peers; the proportion who become disengaged from education is reduced, so that no more than 10 per cent reach school-leaving age without having sat a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) equivalent exam; and the proportion of those aged 16 who get qualifications equivalent to GCSEs graded A*&ndash;C has risen on average by four percentage points each year since 2002; and in all authorities at least 15 per cent of young people in care achieve this level of qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">The elements of the PSA target relating to the level of education, training and employment outcomes for care leavers aged 19, the proportion of children in care who are cautioned or convicted and the under-18 conception rate remain unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/4">In developing the target, the Secretary of State for Health has been keen to encourage action to support attainment by all children in care. This includes younger children, those who are able and have the potential to achieve at a high level and those with difficulties who need support to remain engaged with education at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/5">The Secretary of State therefore welcomes the SEU's proposal that, as part of the existing planning process, individual education targets should be set for all children in care and that local authorities should monitor both the appropriateness and the achievement of targets by children in care. We will be consulting stakeholders on how best to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/6">In order that the target reflects the influence of the care system on attainment, it will apply only to children who have been in care for one year or more. Nonetheless, promoting the attainment of children who spend a shorter time in care is important. The Secretary of State for Education has therefore agreed to put in place arrangements to analyse data from pupil level annual school census in order to improve our understanding of outcomes for those young people who have spent any time in care. The results of this analysis will be to inform the development of future policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.5/4">The current estimated cost for this scheme is &pound;100 million, including VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.5/5">Value for money was assessed using the Department for Transport's standard cost benefit analysis tool TUBA (Transport Users Benefit Appraisal) which includes calculation of user benefits and public and private sector transport provider impacts. The economic appraisal shows that the proposed scheme would provide significant journey time benefits to road users and reduced operating costs for both private and heavy goods vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.5/10">I attach a schedule showing the calculated annualised time savings in vehicle hours and value of time calculations for cars and heavy goods vehicles. You will appreciate that scheme development is at an early stage and these are preliminary figures which are subject to change.</p>
