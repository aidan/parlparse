Within the department's internal audit unit, there is a dedicated anti-fraud and investigation team, which examines issues of impropriety that come to light and advises management on managing risks of irregularity, fraud and corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/3">In all other cases of suspected malpractice, staff are advised to discuss the matter with their line manager or another manager. Alternatively, they can report the matter in confidence to a nominated senior officer. They can also seek the advice and support of a welfare officer, a trade union or recognised staff association representative, or one of the staff networks. The independent Civil Service Commissioners will also consider accepting a direct complaint.
