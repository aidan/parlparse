	<p pid="a.100.5/1">As the then FCO Minister of State, my right honourable friend Mr Tony Lloyd MP, made clear on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-10">10 July 1998</phrase> (Official Report, col. 687), many countries, including the UK, have in place strict controls on the export of nuclear-related goods to India and Pakistan. The UK also exercises caution over contacts between personnel from the British nuclear industry and their Indian and Pakistani counterparts. Current tensions between India and Pakistan demonstrate the need for both countries to exercise restraint.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/2">The events of <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> highlighted the fact that some terrorist groups will use any means to achieve their ends. We know that Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network have shown an interest in developing chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. To ensure that such ambitions are not realised, we are encouraging all countries, including India and Pakistan, to take all steps necessary to ensure the better physical protection of their nuclear assets. We will be encouraging both countries to consider measures which contribute to the safety and security of their nuclear programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/3">Bearing these factors in mind, and consistent with our obligations under the non-proliferation treaty, we have revised our policy as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/4">We will continue to deny all export licence applications (ELAs) for items listed on the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) Dual-Use List to nuclear and nuclear-related end users in India and Pakistan. We will consider all applications for other items assessed as licensable, including those licensable under the WMD end use control, with particular vigilance in making licensing decisions on a case by case basis. Licences may be issued if there are no end use concerns. Consistent with our obligations under the non-proliferation treaty, licences may also be issued in exceptional cases where the Government are satisfied that the proposed exports will contribute to the physical protection or security of civil or military nuclear facilities or assets in India.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/5">We will continue to discourage contacts by UK nuclear scientists or those working in the UK nuclear industry with their counterparts from, or personnel who we know are likely to work in, nuclear or nuclear related organisations in India or Pakistan. We will also discourage visits by such counterparts and personnel to UK nuclear facilities. However, this will not apply where such contacts would contribute to the safety and security of India and Pakistan's nuclear programmes, or further the UK's non-proliferation objectives, consistent with our obligations under the non-proliferation treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/6">Since carring out their nuclear tests in 1998, neither India or Pakistan has demonstrated sufficient commitment to meet their obligations to reduce nuclear tensions set down in UNSCR 1172. We are now encouraging both countries to engage in a bilateral dialogue on nuclear confidence-building measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.2/1">Yesterday the Foreign and Commonwealth Office published the Green Paper. Copies have been placed in the Library and it can also be accessed on the FCO website at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/2">The Green Paper sets out the work that has been undertaken over many years to develop measures to make the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention more effective. The Foreign Affairs Committee, and Parliament in general, have supported these efforts, for which the Government are grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/3">The paper expresses our disappointment at the failure of the states parties to agree on the text of a protocol to the convention last year, despite all our efforts. It also explains why, despite this disappointment, it is still essential that efforts continue to find ways in which the convention can be strengthened and to counter the threat from biological weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/4">The Green Paper identifies possible measures that states parties might now consider to strengthen the convention. It discusses UK priorities and the next steps ahead of the reconvened BTWC Fifth Review Conference in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase>. It also invites comments on these proposals and seeks views from honourable Members, NGOs and other organisations and individuals with an interest in this subject.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.2/1">The immunisation programme for Armed Forces personnel in the Gulf conflict involved a number of vaccines. These can be divided into three categories: those which were part of the anti-biological warfare (BW) immunisation programme; routine service health immunisations; and travel and specific immunisations against the risks associated with individuals' particular employment. These are listed below.</p>

A further paper entitled Implementation of the Immunisation Programme against Biological Warfare Agents for UK Forces during the Gulf Conflict 1990/1991, dated January 2000, provides details on how the anti-BW immunisation programme was implemented, including estimates of the numbers immunised and on the other immunisations given.

The pilot exercise will examine a number of different methods and establish whether a suitably accurate, precise and sensitive test is available. Following assessment of the results of the pilot exercise, arrangements for the main voluntary testing programme will be put in place.

	<p pid="a.107.20/1">I would like to express my deep sympathy for the Taylor family, who still have many questions left unanswered despite an intensive police investigation and a lengthy trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.20/2">This was always going to be a difficult case. It is the job of the CPS to bring cases before the courts where in their judgment there is a realistic prospect of a conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute. It is then the job of the court, in this case the judge and jury, to examine the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence. The approach of the CPS results in cases being brought before the courts that ought properly to be examined in a trial. Inevitably, there will sometimes be acquittals. If the CPS prosecuted only in cases where conviction was near certain, there would be far fewer cases and many guilty people would go free. Where there is an acquittal after a contested trial it should not be assumed that there has been a failure in the criminal justice system or that it was in any way wrong for the CPS to bring the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.20/3">However, it is important now that we take time to learn any lessons. I therefore asked the Director of Public Prosecutions last Friday to look into the handling by the prosecution of the case, to consider whether there are implications for the conduct of future cases and to make recommendations. He will involve HM CPS Inspectorate in the review. I have particularly asked the director to examine whether the time has come to introduce a system where, before trial, interviews of certain key witnesses are conducted by the prosecutor in a limited category of cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.20/4">The review will report by mid-summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.38/6">In addition, Safeguarding Our Seas commits us to review current arrangements for marine scientific research to ensure that we have the proper science base to deliver our vision. It underlines our commitment to develop our framework for environmental monitoring and that we will produce an integrated assessment of our seas by 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.38/7">The report emphasises the importance of involving stakeholders in making the decisions that affect them.

	<p pid="a.107.40/2" qnum="HL3895">Whether there has been any change in the policy of the Department of Health, as stated by Baroness Hayman on 27 January 1999 (HL Deb, col. 1009) that &quot;we do not believe that it is proper to withdraw treatment in the midst of a course&quot; where funding for treatment outside the National Health Service has been provided by a health authority; and whether the responsibility for funding treatment for individual patients will pass automatically from health authorities to primary care trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.41/1">We continue to support the statement made by Baroness Hayman. Funding for treatment secured outside the National Health Service should not normally be discontinued in the midst of a course unless commissioners can secure a clinically appropriate alternative or it is agreed that a treatment is no longer clinically beneficial. Primary care trusts have the freedom to commission locally relevant high quality services for their populations from outside the NHS. Such decisions should be made on the basis of the healthcare needs of the local community and should take account of both clinical and cost effectiveness. With the shift in the balance to the frontline, primary care trusts will become responsible for the delivery of the vast majority of former health authority functions and the totality of care for the populations they serve (subject to legislation). We have allocated funding to health authorities for 2002&ndash;03 and they in turn have allocated funding to primary care trusts on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. In future the intention is that funding allocations will be made direct to primary care trusts in line with their enhanced responsibilities.</p>
