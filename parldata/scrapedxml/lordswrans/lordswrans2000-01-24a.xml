	<p pid="a.165.2/1">The legal status of the Ridgeway National Trail allows vehicles to use most of its western half. The Countryside Agency has responsibility (along with the local highway authorities) for implementing and protecting the trail and, in addition to the maintenance work that they carry out, they have developed a Code of Respect for the Trail. Among other things the code asks users of vehicles to:</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/2" class="indent">respect the rights of others;</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/3" class="indent">limit use when the surface is vulnerable during and after wet weather;</p>

	<p pid="a.165.2/9" class="indent">watch for and respect temporary voluntary restraint signs.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/10">The agency has also reached an agreement with the Motoring Organisations' Land, Access and Recreation Association--LARA--that if the agency, or a member of the public, gives them the number plate of a vehicle breaking the code, LARA will do all it can to sanction those drivers.</p>

In addition, since the close of the inquiry, the Secretary of State has received a series of detailed representations from parties to the inquiry, including the agency. In the interests of proper administration, the department has decided to make these post-inquiry representations available to all others who appeared at the inquiry so that they may have a chance to comment on them. The Secretary of State will consider any such comments before he determines the application, which he will do as soon as is reasonably possible. It should be noted that, as part of the devolution settlement, should the Secretary of State conclude that an order should be made, the agreement of the National Assembly for Wales would be required to that decision, since the order would affect Wales as well as England.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-01-24a.167.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100395" speakername="Lord Macdonald of Tradeston" colon=":" colnum="167"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000124/text/00124w01.htm#00124w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.167.2/1">The UK Eurocontrol unit rate for 2000 is higher than the other states' rates for a number of reasons:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2">The pound has strengthened considerably against the euro, previously the ecu, in recent years. Restated at the 1997 published exchange rate, the UK Eurocontrol unit rate for 2000 would be euro 64.77--i.e. more than 20 per cent lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/3">Under the Eurocontrol charging scheme, states recover the costs incurred in providing air navigation services. This is achieved through the operation of an adjustment mechanism whereby over- or under-recoveries arising in any year are taken into account two years later. Consequently, states' unit rates are affected by the over- or under-recoveries of earlier years. For 2000, the UK unit rate has been increased by 1.4 per cent as a result of returning an under-recovery from 1998, while most states' rates have been reduced by previous years' over-recoveries. In particular, the German rate is 8.7 per cent lower due to previous years' over-recoveries.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/4">The UK interest charge is higher than that of other states, particularly those using the euro, due to higher capital employed and a higher cost of capital. Were the UK interest charge in line with states such as France and Germany, the 2000 rate would be a further 7 per cent or so lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/5">The UK also continues to incur high levels of expenditure related to development of the new air traffic control centre at Swanwick. While some other states have recently developed smaller centres, the Swanwick centre will be one of the largest in Europe. The development of the Swanwick centre places the UK at a different point in the investment cycle when compared with other states, leading to an unfavourable comparison between cost bases. However, development of the Swanwick centre is essential if future traffic growth is to be accommodated. During the 1999 summer period, nearly all the other major European operators experienced worsening ATC delays, while delays due to UK ATC were reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/6">In addition to the above, differences between states' unit rates arise from the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/7" class="indent">(a) The peak flight demand for a specific volume of airspace (density of airspace). The greater the demand for a volume of airspace, the higher the cost of providing the services to meet that demand. The derivations of states' unit rates make no allowances for differing levels of peak demand. The UK is one of the busiest areas of airspace in Europe, if not the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/8" class="indent">(b) The traffic mix within a specific volume of airspace. The greater the percentage of aircraft wishing to descend and land and take off and climb within an airspace rather than overfly it, and the greater the mix of aircraft sizes affecting separation standards, the greater the cost will be to provide the required ATC. The derivations of states' unit rates make no allowances for differing traffic mix or complexity. Again the UK (especially SE England) has a very complex traffic mix.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.5/1">The SDR conducted a rigorous re-examination of our deterrence requirements. The Government have made it clear that we shall maintain the minimum credible nuclear deterrent whilst working towards the global elimination of nuclear weapons. The longer term goals of arms control, non-proliferation and multilateral disarmament were advanced considerably by a range of SDR measures. In addition to announcing Trident as the UK's only nuclear weapon system, these included: a reduction in the number of warheads deployed in each submarine; a significant reduction in the size of the UK's total nuclear weapon stockpile; the de-targeting of Trident missiles; having only one submarine on deterrent patrol, and the placing of the submarine on deterrent patrol at several days' notice to fire. These measures have all been introduced.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-01-24a.169.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="169"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000124/text/00124w02.htm#00124w02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.169.2/1">The COT report, published in November, concluded that neuropsychological abnormalities can occur as a long-term complication following acute organophosphate (OP) poisoning, particularly if the poisoning is severe. Persistent peripheral neuropathy (disorders of the peripheral nerves) may occur, but not generally at a level which would give rise to symptoms. The body of evidence gives little support to the hypothesis that low-level exposure to OPs can cause chronic disease of the nervous system. However, the report notes that there remains a question over whether a small proportion of subjects may be at increased risk of clinically significant disease following low level exposure, and recommends further research in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">The Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) report on the relationship between OP sheep dips and illness in exposed sheep farmers and dippers found the critical exposure factor to be contact with concentrate dip: much higher rates of symptoms, predominantly of a sensory nature, were reported among those who had been principal concentrate handlers. There is very limited evidence that long-term low-level exposure to organophosphates leads to long-term neurotoxic effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3">The conclusions from these reports are in line with the findings of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council's (DSAC) Working Party report, the publication of which we announced on <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-20">20 October 1999</phrase> and which reviewed existing literature on the long term neurotoxicity of anticholinesterases. It concluded that high doses of organophosphates may have long-term effects on the peripheral nervous system, but that there is limited evidence about long-term toxic effects following low doses.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/4">During the Gulf conflict very few UK service personnel would have handled concentrated OPs. Those that did would have been Environmental Health Officers or technicians, or individual regimental hygiene duties personnel who were appropriately trained in procedures and the use of equipment. There was no evidence of acute organophosphate poisoning or of subsequent unusual ill health arising in this small group.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/5">Neither the IOM nor the COT report provides evidence which would cause us to reassess our view of the possible role of OPs in relation to Gulf Veterans' illnesses. The case for ill-health effects resulting from long term low level exposure to OPs remains unproven and there is currently no reason to believe that Gulf veterans who might have been in casual contact with dilute pesticide (e.g. from the treatment of tents and equipment) or with the malathion dust used to de-louse Iraqi prisoners of war, are at increased risk of long term ill-health.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/6">Although it remains the case that there is limited evidence of a link between low-level exposure to OPs and adverse health effects, MoD will continue to monitor the debate about the safety of OPs. We will continue to review scientific evidence in the light of potential exposures which may have occurred in the Gulf and follow future research, including that recommended by the COT report, very closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.2/1">The Government's &quot;New Beginning&quot; policy statement set out the way forward for addressing the health concerns of Gulf veterans and included a commitment to establish a fact finding team to look into the implementation of the anti-biological warfare immunisation programme during the Gulf conflict. Their work has now been completed and we are today publishing a paper entitled Implementation of the immunisation programme against biological warfare agents for UK forces during the Gulf conflict 1990-91. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/2">The publication of this paper reaffirms the Government's commitment to ensuring that Gulf veterans should have access to whatever information the Ministry of Defence possesses which might be relevant to their illnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/3">The deficiencies in the implementation of the 1990-91 anti-biological warfare immunisation programme have been, and continue to be, addressed in improvements to our current arrangements. When we again deployed to the Gulf in 1998, our immunisation programme was unclassified, all troops were fully briefed using standard material, the nature of the threat and the vaccine were described in detail and all records were updated, showing that the lessons of 1990-91 have been learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/4">The report found that the voluntary nature of the immunisation programme operated as intended in the majority of units and locations. It confirms that no unusual or previously undisclosed immunisations were given during the Gulf conflict and also explains the codewords which were sometimes used for the vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/5">Uptake of the anti-biological warfare immunisations in the early stages of the programme was high. Over 75 per cent of all personnel deployed to the Gulf region are likely to have had anthrax and pertussis, and in many units this approached 100 per cent. Uptake of the second anthrax and pertussis immunisations and the first plague was less and varied between and within formations. Uptake of the third anthrax and the second plague immunisation was rare.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">The epidemiological definition of an epidemic is an increase in the frequency of occurrence of a disease in a population above its baseline level for a specified period of time. The term epidemic can be used when describing the pattern of either infectious or chronic diseases in the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2">Administrative definitions can be set for different diseases in which an arbitrary threshold is selected above which the term &quot;epidemic&quot; is applied. In the case of influenza, the Department of Health introduced in 1996 an administrative definition of an &quot;epidemic&quot; for a rate of consultation (with a sample of general practices) of 400 per 100,000 population in a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/3">Such influenza activity in England is thus monitored through the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) sentinel surveillance scheme. This records the number of first visits to a general practitioner with influenza-illness. Other respiratory illnesses prevalent at this time of year are recorded separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/4">This system does not and cannot measure the real incidence of influenza, since it is restricted to those people who visit their general practitioner. In the present winter, the GP consultations avoided by patients consulting their pharmacists, using NHS Direct or self-medicating (as a result of special campaigns) are thought to have led to a substantial hidden element to the epidemic not revealed by the official figures. The serious nature of the illness amongst elderly people (reflected in the rates of acute bronchitis) and usage of hospitals reinforces the reality of the assessment of the severity of this winter's epidemic.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/5">The severity of the disease itself can also vary from year to year. This year the elderly have been particularly affected by the complications of influenza. The level of cases of acute bronchitis, a serious complication of influenza, is the highest the RCGP surveillance system has seen for 15 years. In describing epidemics, some other countries formally include measures of severity in the definition of an epidemic. For example, the United States declares an epidemic when the proportion of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza passes a certain threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/6">The department has not introduced administrative definitions of an epidemic for diseases other than influenza.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">We think it is right that lone parents should co-operate wherever possible in seeking maintenance from the non-resident parent for their children. Under Section 46 of the 1991 Act, if the parent with care fails without good cause to apply for child support when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of Section 6, a reduced benefit direction can be imposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/2">The total number of reduced benefit directions made by the Child Support Agency during the period May 1993 to August 1999 was around 230,000*. Of these, around 89,000** parents with care have had deductions made from their Income Support as a result. Note: Figures rounded to nearest 1,000.
