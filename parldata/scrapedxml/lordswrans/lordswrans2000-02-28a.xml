	<p pid="a.45.5/1">The Human Rights Act 1998 has preserved parliamentary sovereignty. UK courts will not be able to set aside primary legislation that is incompatible with the convention rights; instead the higher courts will, by schedule, be able to make a declaration of incompatibility. Section 19 provides for one of two sorts of statements to be made: either a statement to the effect that a Bill is compatible with the convention rights or a statement that the Minister is not able to make such a statement but that the Government nevertheless wish the House to proceed with the Bill. There is no such statutory framework in respect of European Community law.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.2/2">The correct figures for the total expenditure of the Strategic Communications Unit are as follows: &pound;77,633 in 1997-98 (during which year the SCU was only functioning for approximately three months); &pound;716,672 in 1998-99; and &pound;839,440 in 1999-2000 (budgeted, not actual expenditure).</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/3">The rise between expenditure in 1998-99 and the budget for 1999-2000 is approximately 17 per cent. Of this, approximately 86 per cent is due to the additional costs of the redesign and relaunch of the No. 10 Internet site, including the replacement of outdated computer equipment and the creation of two additional established Civil Service posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/4">Excluding website costs, the rise between expenditure in 1998-99 and the budget for 1999-2000 is 2.3 per cent. There are several reasons for this rise, including a rise in other pay costs due to annual pay increases and the upgrading of one post from Band A to SCS; an increase in spending on books and magazines; and an increase in travel and subsistence costs.</p>

For some time there has been a significant upward trend in the prison population indicating the need to provide more places in secure accommodation, including provision for female prisoners. Also, because of the introduction of home detention curfew, there were indications that fewer open places would be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.12/2">The review will take into account the projected need for open places as the prison population continues to rise and the most efficient way of providing the places required.

	<p pid="a.49.6/1">The latest available figures (1996-97) reported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are 1- per cent for France, 6- per cent for Germany and 4- per cent for the Netherlands. However, these figures are not reported on a consistent basis, so to make direct comparisons would be misleading.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.6/2">Compared to other health systems in developed countries, the National Health Service is efficient with, for example, shorter lengths of stay in hospital and more intensive bed usage. Studies have also shown it enjoys relatively low administrative costs. Management costs are expected to constitute 4.7 per cent of net NHS expenditure in England for 1999-2000. This compares to some 5.5 per cent when the Government came into office. The Government are delivering on their manifesto pledge that a greater proportion of every pound spent on the NHS will go on patient care not bureaucracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">Her Majesty's Government have no plans to impose import restrictions upon Khmer sculptures. If it was found desirable to do so, such restrictions could be introduced by modifying the open general import licence issued under the Import of Goods (Control) Order 1954 (as amended), a statutory instrument made under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 as amended by the Import and Export Control Act 1990.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.8/1">The theft and recovery of the two oil sketches by John Constable from the V&amp;A are the subject of police investigation and possible legal action. Until this process is concluded, it would not be right to provide further details. The museum has reviewed security and has taken additional measures to diminish the risks of a future theft.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/2">The research set out to examine the key features of women's incomes, drawing on existing research and undertaking new analysis. While we have information about income comparisons between individuals at particular points in time, these do not tell us about the impact over women's lifetimes of the pattern and level of their earnings, the effect of the tax and benefits systems and the importance to women's incomes of transfers within families. This new report examines these issues and shows the significant income a woman can expect to forgo over her lifetime in comparison with a man with an equivalent level of education, irrespective of motherhood. The report then analyses the further income forgone by women who have children. In both cases the report highlights the significant impact a woman's level of academic achievement will have on her earnings.</p>
