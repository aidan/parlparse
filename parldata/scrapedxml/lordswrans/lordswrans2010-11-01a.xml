	<p pid="a.343.0/1">The bank levy has been designed specifically to target risky short-term funding which led to serious liquidity problems that played a key role in the financial crisis. By design, the levy is not charged on insured customer deposits and only applies at half-rate to uninsured customer deposits (except for those from financial institutions) and funding (which has over one year remaining to maturity). The levy therefore ensures that banks make a contribution reflective of the risks they pose to the UK financial system and wider economy. The treatment of deposits also reflects the general desirability of encouraging banks to increase the proportion of their funding from deposits.</p>

This will provide us with police recorded crime data for the Government's five hate crime strands (disability, gender identity, race, religion or belief, sexual orientation).</p>
	<p pid="a.347.5/2">However, in order to balance the commitment on the better collection of hate crime data with our desire to end Whitehall interference in local policing, the data will not be disaggregated to reflect the religion or belief of offenders and victims. We are removing targets and reviewing the data burden placed on forces. We believe that the work that is being taken forward achieves this balance.</p>

In particular, the Government believe that the text lays out a path for meeting the G20 commitments that implementation of such regulation should be internationally consistent and non-discriminatory. The text would provide for a European marketing passport for all managers of alternative investment funds that meet the requirements of the directive, regardless of where they are established. For non-EU managers, the passport will be introduced through a phased regime and will therefore become available two years after the end of the transposition period, subject to a positive review by the European Securities and Markets Authority. To ensure minimum market disruption and investor access, national private placement regimes will continue to operate until at least 2018.

	<p pid="a.350.0/1">Provision already exists under Article 126(11) of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union for the use of sanctions, including financial penalties, against euro area member states which are considered to be in excessive deficit and fail to comply with the council's recommendations. The Government fully support use of these sanctions wherever applicable. However, they cannot be applied to the UK since we are not a member of the euro area. Moreover, our protocol to the treaty precludes any use of sanctions against the UK under this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.0/2">The European Commission has recently published legislative proposals to create additional sanctions, including new financial sanctions. These proposals are aimed at encouraging compliance by member states with both the EU stability and growth pact and also the broad economic policy guidelines which address macroeconomic issues including competitiveness. The draft proposals for sanctions relate only to euro area member states and thus do not apply to the UK. The Government therefore consider that their introduction should be a matter for the euro area to decide.</p>

	<p pid="a.353.3/1">The coalition Government have made tackling bullying, particularly bullying motivated by prejudice, one of their top priorities. It is not acceptable for a child to be victimised because of their race or religion. The Government will empower schools so that they can take a zero-tolerance approach to tackling bad behaviour and bullying. We will issue shorter and clearer guidance to schools on how to prevent and tackle bullying and work with Ofsted to ensure that tackling bad behaviour and bullying is given more prominence in planned changes to school inspection. The department implemented the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Achievement Programme in order to offer targeted support to Gypsy Roma Traveller parents and pupils, and specifically to identify good working practice within schools during the transition from primary to secondary school when many Gypsy and Traveller parents may decide to home educate their children. The National Strategies Programme, in common with all other national strategies programmes, will end in spring 2011. However, the good practice that has been captured during the course of this programme has been documented within the National Strategies &quot;Moving Forward Together: Raising Gypsy, Roma and Traveller Achievement&quot; resources which have been disseminated to schools and local authorities and can be downloaded from the National Strategies website.</p>

	<p pid="a.371.5/1">There has been no change in policy in relation to HM Revenue and Customs' (HMRC) statutory duty of confidentiality as it applies to the information it needs to carry out its functions, and there are no plans to make people's tax records publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.5/2">Section 94 of the Finance Act 2009 allows HMRC to publish the name and other details of those who are penalised for serious tax evasion, as the law-abiding public have an interest in knowing how we deal with serious tax evaders. This is not a precursor to making people's tax records publicly available.</p>

	<p pid="a.372.5/1">Foreign nationals who are given indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom are not automatically entitled after any number of years to be granted British citizenship. Any person applying for citizenship on the basis of their length of residency in the UK must satisfy a number of statutory requirements before being granted citizenship. An individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is unlikely to be able to meet the statutory requirement to be of good character and so would be likely to be refused British citizenship. Furthermore, where a foreign national represents a threat to our national security, the UK Border Agency will seek to deport him or her for that reason, irrespective of whether or not the person concerned has been convicted of any offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.373.5/1">The priority of the UK Border Agency remains to secure the border and control migration while it plays its part in reducing the public deficit. The UK Border Agency budget will reduce by up to 20 per cent over the next four years. The agency will be smaller, but more efficient, and we believe it can deliver its commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.5/2">The agency expects to achieve in the region of &#163;500 million savings by reducing support costs, boosting productivity and improving value for money from commercial suppliers. Within the overall settlement for the UK Border Agency, there will be higher reductions for head office and administration, and smaller for the front-line operations. This also includes cutting overhead costs by over a third over the spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.5/3">The UK Border Agency will also complete investment in technology including e-Borders and our immigration case working system to support border controls and replace costly and outmoded paper work. The agency's greater use of technology will help improve productivity and efficiency and will mean that it can target its resources-people and money-on those people most likely to cause harm to the UK.</p>
