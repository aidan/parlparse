	<p pid="a.296.8/1">Solvency II will require insurers to assess the risks they are exposed to on both the liability and the asset side of the balance sheet and to hold capital commensurate to the underlying risks. The European Commission has proposed a treatment of equity holdings, and of fixed income products, on the basis of an objective assessment of a 99.5 per cent probability (within a 1 year time horizon) that firms will be able to meet their obligations. This approach was confirmed when the Solvency II Directive was adopted in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.8/2">A wide range of international organisations have commented on the effects that Solvency II could have on the investment patterns of the European insurance industry, including on the availability of equity finance for small and medium-sized enterprises and on infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.8/3">The Government give appropriate and proportionate weight to the views of such organisations when formulating its overall negotiating position.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.5/1">The Financial Services Authority (FSA), as a member of the European Banking Authority (EBA), has been closely involved with the stress test design and implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.5/2">FSA involvement predates the establishment of the EBA at the beginning of 2011. The FSA has been involved in both the technical level of the stress test design and implementation, in the governance of the EBA through FSA representation at the EBA Board of Supervisors and Board of Management, and through the secondment of an FSA stress test expert to the EBA Quality Assurance Task Force, to help ensure consistent application of the stress test across EU banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.5/3">EBA decisions are made by the Board of Supervisors and inevitably involve some compromises to reach agreement. However, the FSA believes this year's EU-wide stress test is credible and robust, and, taken as a whole, is tougher than last year's Committee of European Banking Supervisors' stress tests, with a tough peer review process and a tighter definition of Core Tier 1 capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.5/4">The FSA believes in the value of transparency and orderly disclosures of relevant risk information to the market on a comparable basis. The EBA stress test and risk exposure disclosure templates should help market participants to reach better informed and more balanced judgments about the relative risk and soundness of individual financial institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.0/1">Female genital mutilation is an illegal and unacceptable form of child abuse and a form of violence against girls and women that the Government are committed to eradicating. We want to protect current and future generations of girls from this abuse and to ensure that those girls and women living with the consequences of FGM are given the care and support they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/2">Our focus is prevention. The Government have recently (February 2011) launched multi-agency practice guidelines for front-line professionals such as teachers, GPs and nurses. The guidelines aim to raise awareness of FGM, highlight the risks that people should be aware of and set out clearly the steps that should be taken to safeguard children and women from this abuse. Legislation alone cannot eliminate the practice so our resources will be aimed at raising awareness of the law on FGM and the health implications with communities and front-line practitioners. The guidelines are a key step in ensuring that professionals are able and confident to intervene to protect girls at risk. In addition, more than 40,000 leaflets and 40,000 posters on the prevention of FGM have been circulated to schools, health services, charities and community groups around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/3">FGM's prevalence is difficult to estimate because of the hidden nature of the crime. However, a study based on the 2001 Census suggested that over 20,000 girls under the age of 15 could be at high risk of FGM in England and Wales each year, and nearly 66,000 women in England and Wales are living with the consequences of FGM.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/4">FGM has been explicitly illegal since 1985 when the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 was passed. The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-03">3 March 2004</phrase>) repealed and replaced the 1985 Act and made it an offence for the first time for UK nationals or permanent UK residents to carry out FGM abroad, or to aid, abet, counsel or procure the carrying out of FGM abroad, even in countries where the practice is legal. To reflect the serious harm that FGM causes, the Act also increased the maximum penalty from five to 14 years' imprisonment. There have so far been no prosecutions under the 2003 Act. Research suggests that the most likely barrier to prosecution is the pressure from family or wider community that leads cases to go unreported. The CPS is due to publish new legal guidance on FGM later this summer to ensure that it is able to prosecute cases of FGM that satisfy the evidential and public interest tests within the Code for Crown Prosecutors.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/5">Temporary United Kingdom residents (refugees and asylum seekers whose application is still being considered, and anyone who has been lawfully living in the UK for 12 months immediately prior to treatment) are afforded the protections available to permanent UK residents, including access to 15 specialist clinics in the NHS which treat women and girls who have been subjected to FGM. These clinics have trained and culturally sensitive staff who offer a range of confidential healthcare services for women and girls including reversal surgery. These clinics are open to women to attend without referral from their own doctors. These clinics are funded by local PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/6">In relation to responsibility for commissioning female genital mutilation services, the consultation paper <I>Healthy Lives, Healthy People: consultation on the funding and commissioning routes for public health</I> proposed that local authorities should be responsible for working in partnership to tackle issues such as social exclusion including violence prevention. This could include supra-local commissioning of services such as female genital mutilation (FGM) clinics. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> and the Government will be publishing their response shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.311.2/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) prosecutes cases that have been investigated and referred to it by the police. Every case that is referred to the CPS for a charging decision is reviewed in accordance with the full code test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors (the code). This requires that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest for a prosecution to proceed. To date, there have been no prosecutions of cases involving female genital mutilation (FGM) as there has been insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. A case that does not pass the evidential stage of the full code test must not proceed no matter how serious or sensitive it may be. However, agencies are working closely together to raise awareness and encourage reporting of FGM, so that they can be thoroughly investigated and evidence gathered.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.2/2">The CPS is a member of the Cross-Governmental Female Genital Mutilation Steering Group to help tackle this practice, but it has not held discussions with officials from other countries on this issue. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is in regular dialogue with their counterparts in other countries on wider FGM matters. In January 2011, the UK's Cross Government FGM Co-ordinator visited Ethiopia and highlighted a number of areas for improving our work on FGM, particularly in community engagement and international diaspora relations, so that the practice of FGM can be eradicated.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.6/1">Private sector escorting companies operate within a clear framework set out in legislation and in a set of operating standards and instructions which are published on the UK Border Agency's website. The role of escorts is also subject to oversight by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, who undertakes both announced and unannounced inspections.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.6/2">The UK Border Agency expects escorts to carry out their work with the utmost professionalism and sensitivity and has, over the past few years, introduced a number of measures to ensure the protection of staff and detainees.

All DCOs are trained in control and restraint techniques accredited by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), and receive refresher training every 12 months as a condition of their individual accreditation to work as a DCO. Restraint training is delivered by professionals and we are satisfied that the techniques are safe. We have, however, asked NOMS to conduct a fundamental review of the techniques used in order to see whether they can be made even safer. This review is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.6/4">We are satisfied that private sector escorting companies have acted professionally, ensuring that those in their custody are treated with dignity and care. Where detainees complain that the use of force has been excessive, the matter is investigated by the UK Border Agency's professional standards unit. If a complainant is unhappy with the response they can ask for the issue to be re-examined by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, whose role was extended in 2006 to investigate complaints by immigration detainees.</p>

	<p pid="a.326.6/1">There is no discrepancy relating to the number of national insurance numbers issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.6/2">The latest available figures (Feb 2011) show a total of 83.36 million national insurance number (NINo) records on the department's Customer Information System (CIS). This includes NINos of people known to be living abroad and 19.63 million NINos relating to deceased persons.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.6/3">There are legitimate reasons why the number of NINos is greater than the number of the adult population. For example, there are UK citizens living abroad in receipt of UK social security benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.6/4">In 2007 a full categorisation of the NINo stock was undertaken and the results at that time were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.326.6/5">2007 NINo stock categorisation:</p>
	<p pid="a.326.6/6">55.1 million Active accounts-ie those showing current or recent use of the NINo;16.8 million accounts relating to people who are now deceased; and4.9 million inactive accounts-ie those showing no recent activity (and which do not fall into the deceased person account category) such as people who have moved abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.6/7">The NINo stock increases every year due to NINos being allocated to young people reaching the age of 16 and individuals entering the UK from abroad who require a NINo for employment purposes</p>
	<p pid="a.326.6/8">Once a NINo is allocated it needs to remain on the department's computer system. This is because the NINo provides a permanent numerical link between the individual and their national insurance contribution record, which determines entitlement to contributory benefits and state pension. The NINos of deceased individuals are retained on the system as a partner may make a claim for a contributory benefit, which is dependent on the contribution record of the deceased.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.6/9">The retention of the NINo for deceased persons on our systems-clearly marked as such to DWP staff-also provides an important counterfraud measure in that it prevents fraudsters from hijacking these numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.2/1">The Government announced in the <I>Plan for Growth</I> at the time of the Budget in March that we would create a Health Research Authority (HRA) to combine and streamline the approvals for health research that are presently scattered across many organisations, in order to reduce the regulatory burden and increase the speed and cost-effectiveness of developing new treatment and care in the United Kingdom. We said we would establish the HRA this year, initially as a special health authority with the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) as its core.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.2/2">We plan to make and lay the relevant statutory instruments this autumn to establish the HRA as a special health authority later this year. It is to take on substantive functions from the date of its establishment. The new body will be set up to focus on health research regulation. It will in the first instance bring together in one place the work of the bodies that presently provide the NRES. The new body will be well placed to make preparations for taking on board additional functions when it becomes a non-departmental public body (NDPB), subject to primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.2/3">The NRES is currently a division of the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA). The NPSA has 25 posts within the NRES head office. It also contracts with other bodies to host a further 117 posts within NRES regional centres. Of the 25 head office posts, 20 are filled by NPSA employees on permanent contracts and four by secondees or other non-permanent workers, while one is currently vacant.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.2/4">The NRES will not be replaced by the HRA. It will be a division at the core of the HRA. The NRES currently works with the devolved Administrations to promote a robust, consistent system of research ethics review across the UK. The HRA will continue this work. It will also take on the current appointing authority functions of strategic health authorities. Further consideration will be given to the extent to which it may be able to take on or carry out other functions under current legislation so that it can foster improvements across many other parts of the regulatory environment for research.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.2/5">Where we can achieve these improvements without primary legislation, we shall. Where primary legislation is required in order to develop the role of the HRA and consolidate functions, it will be introduced in a later Bill. For example, further primary legislation is needed to transfer functions from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) and the Human Tissue Authority (HTA).</p>
	<p pid="a.328.2/6">In addition to the core NRES functions and those currently performed by the HFEA and HTA, we are exploring the possibility of a number of other functions moving to the HRA when it becomes an NDPB. The aim is to streamline the approval and compliance processes and requirements for health research, as described in the <I>Plan for Growth</I>.</p>

	<p pid="a.338.8/1">Officials from the Department for Transport met recently with Home Office officials to discuss the issue of metal theft and to explore possible options to combat this crime, which affects not just the railways but also the power supply industry, churches and other historic buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.8/2">Metal theft including cable theft has emerged as one of the fastest growing crime types. It hits the railway particularly hard and causes levels of disruption out of all proportion to the value of the material stolen. The increase in cable theft has mirrored the soaring price of copper on world markets. The Deputy Chief Constable for the British Transport Police (BTP), who is also the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) lead for metal thefts, has described the thefts as one of the force's biggest challenges after terrorism. ACPO in conjunction with the Home Office have devised a national four element strategy which focuses on:</p>
	<p pid="a.338.8/3">increasing the effort required to steal metal;increasing the risk to offenders;reducing the ease and rewards to offenders stealing stolen metal; andincreasing the risk for the dealers handling stolen metals.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.8/4">BTP has a number of dedicated pro-active cable crime teams operating in areas of the country that suffer from cable theft. This year, with the support of Network Rail, BTP is deploying even more officers and crime scene investigators to problem locations. BTP continues to work closely with train operators, other police forces, the scrap metal industry and others with an interest to eradicate the problem. Methods used to deter and catch the thieves include a dedicated BTP task force with increased patrols, intelligence led policing and additional dedicated officers; the use of the Network Rail helicopter, CCTV, forensic marking, trembler alarms and other devices to protect the cable; the introduction of new type of cable that is easier to identify and harder to steal; and fast response teams to get trains on the move as quickly as possible following an incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.8/5">Information relating to cost of replacement cables and disruption to services is not held by the Department for Transport but by Network Rail. The national figures for cable theft (May 2011) are detailed below:</p>

	<p pid="a.346.2/1">At present, published government policy is strongly to discourage the deployment of private armed guards on board UK flag vessels, but HMG are now considering amending this to a position which recognises that engaging armed personnel is an option for UK flagged ship owners to combat piracy in exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.2/2">The Home Office is currently looking at the applicability of UK firearms legislation on board UK flag ships on the high seas. If legal opinion is that the Firearms Act 1968 does apply, a decision will need to be made as to whether it is appropriate and feasible to grant the authority of the Secretary of State for the possession of prohibited firearms (classes of firearms that are not sanctioned to be kept on board as part of ships equipment) in these circumstances. On the assumption that the Firearms Act 1968 does apply to UK flagged ships on the high seas, without such an authority it would be illegal to carry such firearms on board UK flagged ships. Even in circumstances where possession of firearms is duly authorised, their use must also be lawful. Use of such weapons other than in self defence or defence of others risks criminal (and civil) liability.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.3/1">According to the most recent survey by the World Food Programme (WFP), about 12 per cent of households were severely food insecure and 36 per cent could be assessed as moderately insecure. The rate of severe food insecurity is likely to have increased since the last survey mainly due to global and local food inflation: the latter partly caused by border closures with the Republic of Sudan as well as the impact of the influx of returnees and internal displacement caused by conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.3/2">The WFP reports that the current drought in the Horn of Africa will effect South Sudan in two ways. The pastoralist belt in Eastern Equatoria is part of the same livelihood zone as Northern Kenya and is therefore also affected by the drought; and the steep increase in the price of maize in Uganda is affecting South Sudan since Eastern Equatoria, Central Equatoria, Jonglei and Lakes States import key food commodities from Uganda, mostly maize grain and maize flour</p>

	<p pid="a.354.6/1">Since the previous Question on this subject from the noble Lord, officials have received a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June</phrase> from the Commission. The letter confirmed that directive 96/53/EC permits longer semi-trailers only if the criteria for one of the exemptions set out in Article 4.4 are fulfilled. The Government's view, previously communicated to the Commission, is that our proposals for longer semi-trailers fulfil the criteria for exemption in Article 4.4 (b), because their loading length (15.65 metres) can also be achieved by existing rigid/drawbar combinations. The Commission's letter did not address this point.</p>

	<p pid="a.355.5/1">Foreign artists of various disciplines successfully use the different routes of entry which the immigration system provides for those coming to the United Kingdom, depending on their purpose in coming and intended length of stay. Tier 5 of the points-based system has a category specifically for creative artists coming for periods of up to a year where the purpose involves paid work. They may currently be granted an additional 12 months maximum period if the original sponsor requires the migrant to stay beyond the original period granted. Creative artists who are non-visa nationals entering the UK for a period of three months or less do not require a visa although they still need a certificate of sponsorship. Outside the points-based system, the entertainer visitor visa enables entry, for up to six months, for those coming to perform at or take part in important cultural festivals and for other specific purposes such as charity events and music competitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.5/2">The Government are reviewing all immigration routes of entry. We are consulting currently on Tier 5 of the points-based system and will look at the issue of entry by short-term visitors as part of this work.</p>

	<p pid="a.356.5/1">The Government encourage all eligible individuals to engage with the democratic process and to vote. This is especially important among young people, who are traditionally under-represented in figures on registration and turnout. The Government, politicians, political parties, electoral administrators and wider groups with an interest in the democratic process all have a role to play in encouraging participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/2">In particular, the Government have responsibility for the statutory framework for electoral registration in the UK. 16 and 17 year olds can already apply to register as &quot;attainers&quot; to ensure they are able to vote as soon as they turn 18. In the context of the move to individual electoral registration, we are considering how to make it as easy and secure as possible for citizens to register to vote and we are exploring how online services might support this. Further research will also be conducted to identify the groups that are currently under-registered including young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/3">The research findings will be used to inform our approach to improving registration levels among these groups and will also inform wider work to promote public awareness of registration and participation of young people in the voting process.</p>
