Increasing transparency and knowledge of revenues from the extractive sectors empowers citizens to hold governments to account, so that mismanagement of funds away from sustainable development purposes becomes more difficult.</p>

In line with the EITI Global Conference's objectives, the UK delegation worked with other stakeholders to take stock of EITI's progress; address the challenges which EITI faces; and consider the next steps for taking forward the initiative. A UK statement delivered at the conference welcomed the achievements of the EITI over the past two years and committed the UK to continue supporting the EITI.

	<p pid="a.99.5/1">The actual increase to the egg industry in 2008-09 is 2.5 per cent. This is in line with the overall increase in charges needed to fund statutory surveillance for residues of veterinary medicinal products and certain other substances in British produce.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/2">Charges to the various industry sectors involved in the residues surveillance programme were not adjusted between 1997 and 2003. When the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), which operates the surveillance programme, calculated the changes needed to charges to recover its costs it was apparent that large increases were needed in the egg sector. This was in part owing to the administrative burden of invoicing several hundred egg producers based on their throughput.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/3">In response to the consultation exercise, the VMD entered into an agreement with the British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) to reduce the administrative burden on egg companies. The BEIC now pays the charge direct to the VMD and recovers the costs as it sees fit from the largest egg companies. This agreement has resulted in substantial savings to the egg industry in respect of residues surveillance.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.5/4">The 27.5 per cent figure in the statutory instrument is the increase that would be needed if the arrangement with the BEIC ended and the VMD needed to return to collecting the charges from all eligible egg companies. The charge paid by the BEIC represents the full cost of running the statutory surveillance for residues of veterinary medicines and certain other substances in Great Britain that is required under Council Directive 96/23/EC. This includes the collection and transport of samples, analytical costs and follow-up inspections on the farm of origin of non-compliant results.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.5/1">There is no consensus among the World Trade Organisation (WTO) membership for linking trade and labour issues in the WTO forum. The International Labour Organisation is recognised globally as the appropriate forum for discussions on labour issues, and is engaged in initiatives aimed at combating slavery and forced labour. The UK encourages all ILO members to improve working conditions and to work towards ratifying and implementing the ILO Core Labour Conventions, which cover forced and child labour and other issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.5/2">There are many valuable collaborative schemes to promote labour standards.

	<p pid="a.100.5/3">In some instances there is value in including core labour standards in preferential trade agreements.

Achieving that remains our focus. The Middle East quartet representative has not discussed the use of sea routes as a way of providing aid to Gaza.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.6/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as amended (DDA) already includes provisions that provide protection from disability discrimination for people who are no longer disabled, but who have had a disability that met the Act's definition of a disability. In general, the DDA defines a disabled person as someone who has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. A person who has had leprosy which met that definition is therefore entitled to the protection afforded by the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.6/2">The DDA was not intended to provide protection from discrimination based on a person's association with a disabled person. However, following the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) judgment in the case of Coleman v Attridge Law, an employment tribunal has decided that the DDA can be interpreted so as to provide protection in employment and vocational training for a person who is directly discriminated against or harassed on the basis of their association with a disabled person. The employment tribunal's decision in Coleman has been appealed by the employer in question. The Government are considering the impact of the ECJ's decision for domestic discrimination law in the context of preparing for the forthcoming equality Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.6/2">The DPP holds a number of public meetings to monitor police performance. These meetings provide an opportunity for the police commander to report to the subgroup in the district, to respond to questions from the public about how policing services are provided in the district and to deal with any issues the local community are concerned about.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/3">The chief constable has provided the following additional information:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/4">In order to establish a more effective and responsive policing structure for the local East Belfast community the neighbourhood policing programme was introduced to Victoria and Pottinger in 2007. These are closely aligned to the service delivery areas of the other statutory organisations within Belfast. The establishment levels within these neighbourhood units have also increased and officers are committed to serve for a minimum of two years. This will provide consistent points of contact and a good opportunity to build strong relationships with the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/5">To assist with the process of community engagement PACT (Partners and Community Together) meetings have been introduced in Pottinger with Victoria due to commence in March 2009. These meetings provide regular opportunities for the local community to meet police and other statutory organisations to discuss issues that cause them concern within their respective neighbourhood.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/6">In addition to the dedicated neighbourhood teams, other resources within the district have now been realigned on a neighbourhood basis. This means that 24-hour patrol officers, in addition to their normal response duties, have neighbourhood responsibilities for dedicated areas. Other units&mdash;ie, CID, Community Safety&mdash;now also reflect this neighbourhood emphasis.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/7">In a drive to introduce more visible policing across the district in January 2009, 18 extra officers were trained and fully equipped for cycle patrols which have already received favourable comments from the community. Neighbourhood shift systems within East Belfast have also been modified to ensure that neighbourhood officers are more readily available and visible each day.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/8">In order to build, broaden and sustain confidence in the police a victim care line is to be established within East Belfast. This will provide a facility whereby victims of crime can contact a free phone number and will receive up to date information on the current state of their investigations. This initiative has been developed in partnership with the local district policing partnership and is due to commence in March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.6/9">Police in East Belfast recognise that more can always be done to encourage local communities to assist police and the support and contribution of local elected representatives is necessary to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.2/1">We understand from international evidence that tobacco companies invest in marketing activities to promote tobacco products, including payments to retailers to display tobacco products advantageously. During the development of the department's <I>Consultation on the future of tobacco control</I> that was published in May 2008, the department requested information from the tobacco industry on its payments to retailers for the display of tobacco products in shops. The tobacco industry has refused to provide such information. A copy of the consultation has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">The Government do not have powers to require tobacco companies to report marketing expenditure, and therefore holds no such information. We have made no specific assessment of the impact of Canadian laws requiring the disclosure of marketing expenditure by tobacco companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.4/1" qnum="HL1444">To ask Her Majesty's Government in the Zoonoses and Animal By-Products (Fees) (England) (No. 2) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/3196), why, in the same year that fees were last set, it has been necessary to raise the charge for taking official samples from &pound;45 to &pound;55; and what are the cost elements involved.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-02-26a.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="108"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90226w0002.htm#09022653000061">
	<p pid="a.108.0/1">The base charge of &pound;55 is a fixed fee that covers costs that are associated with the supervision of, or the taking of, official control samples on all holdings. Costs are derived on estimates of the time taken to process an application (eg organising visits, systems inputs, checking test results etc) by the various grades of staff involved. These estimates of time have been multiplied by the animal health charge out rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">The animal health charge out rates are based upon the average employment costs for each grade of animal health staff (includes salary, employer's NIC and employer's pension contributions) plus overheads and notional costs (taken from the Animal Health budgets for 2007-08). These rates are then adjusted for productivity. An hourly rate is then calculated by dividing the annual rate by 215 working days and 7.4 hours per day. The 215 working days are arrived at by taking 260 weekdays and adjusting for holiday and estimated other non-delivery time (eg training).</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">The other costs relating to the base fee are based upon estimates from Defra Shared Service Division (SSD) which provides most of animal health's back office functions including: accounts receivable, accounts payable, human resources costs, etc. Due to changes in the mechanism for government accounting between Defra and animal health, the overall SSD charge to animal health has increased to &pound;2.9 million from &pound;900,000 in 2007 (322 per cent increase). This change provides a more accurate reflection of the costs to animal health in providing these services as costs are no longer subsumed/subsidised by core Defra.</p>
