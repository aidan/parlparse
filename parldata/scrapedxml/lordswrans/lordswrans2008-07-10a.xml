	<p pid="a.95.0/1">The scope of the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) directive (2002/95/EC) excludes both medical devices and monitoring and control instruments. The European Commission is currently developing proposals for a revised directive that may include bringing those two categories into scope at some future point. The Government will finalise their position on that particular issue once formal proposals are laid before the Environment Council for negotiation (expected to be towards the end of this year).</p>

Other factors, particularly treatment and variations in data collection, may play a significant role, but we have to wait for evidence from randomised controlled trials of prostate cancer screening before we can say that early detection using PSA testing saves lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">The <I>Identity Cards Scheme Cost Report</I> published in May 2008 sets out the expected costs for the delivery of the scheme as a whole, which includes identity cards and passports. In many cases, the same application will result in the issue of both a passport and an ID card. The full cost of registering individuals for passports and ID cards is included in common costs because the same technology infrastructure and business processes will be used, thus costs cannot be separated for identity cards only.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/2">The delivery of the national identity scheme will mainly be via private sector contracts.

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">The Channel Tunnel Rail Link, now known as High Speed 1, is open to any train operator that satisfies the requirements of its network statement issued in accordance with the Railways Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005. Continental train operators wishing to access High Speed 1 would also have to meet the requirements of Eurotunnel as owner and operator of the Channel Tunnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/2">The regulatory framework for international passenger services is set at the European level by the directives of the first, second and third rail packages. These ensure transparent and non-discriminatory conditions of access for all operators whose proposed services meet the requirements of the safety and interoperability directives. The European Commission reviews the implementation of these directives; the Government have no plans to carry out any separate review.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.8/1">Government have a formal role in the approval of rolling stock leases because of their responsibilities as operator of last resort. This, though, will not normally prevent train operators procuring new rolling stock on their own account unless it would lead to an increase in the level of government subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.8/2">The Department for Transport meets train operators regularly to discuss a range of topics, including proposals for extra rolling stock. However, no recent proposal for the department to fund extra rolling stock, other than through the high-level output specification process, has proceeded beyond the informal discussion stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.2/1">One of the outcomes of the Varney report was that both business and HMRC wanted to see an efficient risk-based approach to dealing with tax matters. HMRC has issued detailed guidance on its approach to tax compliance risk management for the largest businesses. The risk framework guidance makes it clear that corporate governance, including transparency in its dealings with HMRC, is a behavioural risk which will be taken into account in classifying a business as low risk or not. HMRC has supported nearly 40 per cent of large businesses to become low risk while deploying specialist resource to high-risk businesses.</p>
