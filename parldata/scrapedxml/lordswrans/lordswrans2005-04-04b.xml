	<p pid="b.70.6/1">The UK Government place a high priority on combating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and are supportive of plans to establish a National Council for small arms control in Georgia. Our ambassador to Georgia recently spoke at a seminar on this issue in Tbilisi, organised by the UK non-governmental organisation Saferworld in collaboration with the Caucasus Institute for Peace, Democracy and Development. His speech highlighted the UK objectives of: strengthening controls on the supply of small arms and light weapons; reducing the availability of weapons; and addressing the demand for weapons. Following the seminar, the government of Georgia made a commitment to establish an inter-agency commission on arms in the near future. The UK provides financial support to Saferworld for its work in Georgia through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool.</p>

The Constitutional Treaty would not make the heads of EU delegations overseas &quot;more important&quot; than British Ambassadors or High Commissioners.

The day before, my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Douglas Alexander) raised her case with the Burmese Ambassador. We continue to highlight her detention with the Burmese, reminding the regime that our European Union and international partners, including the United Nations and the Association of South East Asian Nations, have all called for the restrictions on her to be lifted and that we hold the regime responsible for her safety and security. Our embassy in Rangoon monitors the situation closely and maintains regular contact with the National League for Democracy. Aung San Suu Kyi's doctor is able to visit her occasionally and we understand she is in good health.</p>

	<p pid="b.75.3/1">The Local Government Act 2000 provides for a code of conduct to apply to members and co-opted members of every relevant authority. The Standards Board for England polices the code.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.3/2">The Act defines a co-opted member as a person who is not a member of the authority but who is a member of any committee or sub-committee and who is entitled to vote on any question which falls to be decided by that committee or sub-committee. Where a community forum is deemed, under a council's constitution, to be a meeting of the authority, whether or not a co-opted member is subject to the code of conduct will depend on whether he meets the criteria set out in the Act. It would follow that in the case of a co-opted member with no entitlement to vote the code of conduct would not apply.</p>

	<p pid="b.76.0/1">Westminster City Council has the responsibility for addressing rough sleeping in the local area. While the Government do not set targets to reduce rough sleeping in specific areas such as that between New Scotland Yard and Victoria Station, there have been significant reductions in the level of rough sleeping across all of Westminster with the last count on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-08">8 March 2005</phrase> recording 133 rough sleepers across the borough.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/2">Westminster acknowledges that rough sleeping around Victoria Street continues to be one of London's most visible and troublesome hotspots. From July 2005 Westminster is moving to a buildings based model of service delivery, with the emphasis on rough sleepers coming indoors for rapid assessment. The aim is to help vulnerable people into appropriate services that will enable them to sustain accommodation, to divert others new to the area, and bring about real reductions in people using the area to bed down at night.</p>

	<p pid="b.81.2/1">Since the directive was agreed in 2001, the Department of Health and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have consulted widely. The department and the Medical Research Council (MRC) established a joint project on the specific concerns raised by those involved in publicly funded trials. The joint project assisted trialists by identifying and documenting best practice in those areas that are regulated under the directive. It identified solutions and made information and advice available to trialists on a project website.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/2">The work begun in the joint project is continuing in the United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration. The collaboration includes representatives from the main funding bodies for clinical research in the UK, academic medicine, the National Health Service, regulatory bodies and representatives from industry and patient groups. One work stream is to streamline regulatory and governance processes associated with clinical research in the UK. Following an analysis of the cumulative effects of existing regulations, it will aim to enhance the research capability in the UK by developing and communicating best practice in relation to both research governance and statutory regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/3">The department is working closely with the MHRA to try to influence the Commission and other member states to introduce &quot;specific modalities&quot; for non-commercial trials that respond to the needs of the UK academic research community and the wider European academic community.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.2/4">The European Union Commission consulted in July 2004 on a Directive on Good Clinical Practice which referred to &quot;specific modalities&quot; that member states might introduce for non-commercial trials conducted by researchers without the participation of the pharmaceutical industry. When the directive is published, the Commission will also issue guidance on the &quot;specific modalities&quot;. A draft which addresses many of the issues raised by the academic research community is currently being considered by the Commission Working Group on Clinical Trials. The MHRA is represented on the Commission working group and is actively involved in the development of this guideline.</p>

These obligations include transporting products under specified conditions (e.g. in sealed containers) and ensuring that they are accompanied by their documentation from the BIP to their destination in the community. Drivers, pilots and masters of vessels have a degree of influence over the destination of the products which they are transporting. Clearly this is not the case for train drivers. We therefore took the view that it was inappropriate to place this degree of responsibility on them.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.11/1">In the past five years, nearly 50 per cent of the total salmon rod catch in England and Wales has been rebased, amounting to a total of about 40,000 salmon. Records of the numbers of salmon caught and released by anglers in Scottish salmon rivers have risen from less than 10 per cent in 1994 to 55 per cent in 2003, the most recent year for which data are available. The majority of these fish are expected to have survived to spawn and will thus have contributed to the better preservation of stocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.11/2">No details are available for fly-fishing for salmon specifically. However, various studies suggest that angling effort in Scotland has not decreased as a result of the increasing adoption of catch and release.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.11/3">In a report by the Tourism and Recreation Research Institute of Edinburgh University published in 1982, the estimated total number of salmon and sea trout angler rod days for Scotland was 373,703. A report produced by Mackay Consultants in 1989, estimated a total number of salmon and sea trout angler rod days of 434,900. In the report <i>The Economic Impact of Game and Coarse Angling in Scotland</i>, produced in 2004 for the Scottish Executive, by Glasgow Caledonian University and Cogentsi Research international Ltd, the estimated annual number of angler days in salmon and sea trout fishing in Scotland was 545,048.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.11/4">Limited information is available on the impact of salmon and sea trout angling on employment. In the Mackay report, a total of 3,360 full time job equivalents was estimated. In the 2004 report for the Scottish Executive, salmon and sea trout angling was estimated to support some 2,200 full-time job equivalents. However, these studies are not necessarily directly comparable because of differences the study methods and multipliers used.</p>
