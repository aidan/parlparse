	<p pid="a.175.2/1">The department has completed its review of the guidance in relation to councillors' eligibility for support through the Access to Work scheme. We agree that the situation was unclear and have therefore amended the guidance. The revised guidance makes clear that where disabled councillors receive allowances over and above reimbursement of meal and travel costs, and they meet the other eligibility criteria, they will be treated as being in employment for Access to Work purposes and may be eligible for support through the scheme. They will not now have to satisfy the national minimum wage requirements.</p>

Internally, the decision to reactivate the mission will be made at the EU Political and Security Committee (PSC) by 27 member states. The PSC's decision would depend on the Mission's evaluation of the security situation and the status of the Rafah Crossing Point facilities, including the Liaison Office in Kerem Shalom.</p>

It is a criminal offence for any person to fail, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any requirement from the commission to provide documents or attend an interview.

	<p pid="a.189.0/1">The department took over responsibility for prison health from the Home Office in 2003. Our policy is to ensure that prisoners enjoy the benefits of the National Health Service care system in line with other members of the community with services for the treatment of existing disease and support on maintaining good oral health. In 2006, 82.5 per cent of prisons were reported to have a service specification with a primary care trust (PCT). However, meeting service needs remains challenging because the amount of untreated dental disease among prisoners is approximately four times greater than the level found in the general population with higher incidence of a history of hazardous drinking, smoking and use of illicit drugs. These challenges were examined in greater detail in dentistry in prisons a guide to working within the prison environment produced by the National Association of Prison Dentistry and published by Stephen Hancocks Ltd 2010. We will shortly be building on these developments by issuing a toolkit to support PCTs in commissioning appropriate high quality integrated oral health services for prisons and to help providers understand the standards expected by PCTs when reviewing and commissioning such services.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">Three marked lists have been placed in the Library with the following information:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/2">List 1-this contains the number of started and completed acute, mental health and community hospital private finance initiative (PFI) schemes for each year since 1997-98, shown by London and non-London location and the annual expenditure for those areas. Expenditure is shown as the annual estimated unitary payments paid under the PFI contracts (which covers initial capital cost, financing charges and building maintenance and other support services over the lifetime of the contract). Information is only held centrally on PFI schemes with a capital value of &#163;10 million and above; there were a number of schemes below this threshold, which completed in the period 1997-98 to 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/3">List 2-this contains three tables:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/4">Table 1 and 2-the number of completed acute and mental health non-PFI schemes (ie using public capital) for each year since 2003, shown by London and non-London location and the capital costs for those areas (information is not held centrally on the associated financing costs (ie capital charges) and ongoing support services for each scheme). The schemes are broken down in to the bands by capital cost requested (more than &#163;250,000; between 250,000 and &#163;500,000; and more than &#163;500,000). Information is not held centrally on retrospective start dates for these schemes; we are only able to show those currently under construction. These schemes were all taken forward under the &quot;Procure 21&quot; initiative, which the department introduced in 2003 for public capital funded schemes; information on earlier public capital schemes since 1997-98 is only held for those over &#163;10 million-this is shown in table 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/5">Table 3-this shows the non-PFI funded community hospitals (ie using public capital) which have been completed and are on site under the P21 initiative; the great majority (13 of the 15 listed) are a result of the Community Hospitals Programme. This was developed as a result of the commitment included in <I>Our health, our care, our community: investing in community hospitals and services</I>, which announced that capital funding was available from 2006-07 to 2010-11 to support investment in community hospitals and facilities. A further four schemes under the programme are being funded via the National Health Service Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) initiative and are included in list 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.0/6">List 3-this contains the number of started and completed acute, mental health and community hospital NHS LIFT schemes for each year since 1997-98, shown by London and non-London location and the annual expenditure for those areas. Expenditure is shown as the annual estimated lease payments under the PFI contracts (which covers initial capital cost, financing charges and building maintenance). Information is not held centrally on retrospective start dates for these schemes; we are only able to show those currently under construction.</p>

In the courts the non-appearance of accused and witnesses results in numerous adjournments that contribute to the build-up of pending cases.

Additionally, the Government recently legislated in the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 to require individual donors to confirm, when making a donation, that they are resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom for income tax purposes. This provision has not yet been commenced. Ministers made clear during debates at the time that it would not be commenced before the summer of 2010.</p>
