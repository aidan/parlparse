	<p pid="a.62.2/1">We appreciate and share the concerns of the NGO Forum in Kabul regarding the role in humanitarian work of military personnel dressed in civilian clothes. Our objective is to meet humanitarian needs through effective and appropriate means. This includes our current funding of various quick impact projects (QIPs) through the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), including rehabilitation of schools, for example. ISAF's objective is to assist in the stabilisation process, with the agreement of the Afghan parties; we believe that quick impact projects aimed at stabilisation and recovery are therefore a valid role for ISAF, particularly given the extent of need and the lack of capacity to address those needs in a timely manner. ISAF personnel are at all times in uniform, and even when engaged in recovery/humanitarian activities alongside humanitarian workers there is a clear distinction between them. This, to the extent possible in a conflict zone, gives a measure of protection to humanitarian workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/2">We are aware of reports of coalition forces undertaking humanitarian work while dressed as civilians. The Defence Secretary has made it clear to all UK military in Afghanistan that they must make it clear they are soldiers if challenged, including by NGO personnel; they carry their arms openly, even if not in uniform for operational reasons. We share your concerns about the risks of creating the impression that all aid workers are either members of the military or closely associated with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.2/3">We continue to raise this issue with coalition partners through appropriate channels.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.7/2" qnum="HL3843">Why they rejected counsel's advice obtained by Save the Children which recommends that the Government withdraw their reservation in respect of nationality, immigration and asylum to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-04-29a.63.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="63"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020429/text/20429w01.htm#20429w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.63.8/1">We have carefully reviewed the reservation in the light of the legal opinion submitted by Save the Children and other recent requests that it should be withdrawn. We have taken legal advice which strongly suggests that the reservation remains necessary in order to maintain an effective immigration control. We consider that, notwithstanding the reservation, there are sufficient checks and balances in place to ensure that children are protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.8/2">The United Kingdom always takes its international obligations seriously. We are obliged, under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, to consider all applications for asylum made in the United Kingdom. Each application is considered on its individual merits. While awaiting a decision on their claims, all asylum seeking children have access to primary healthcare and education facilities and there are currently no outstanding cases where the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) has been cited by children seeking asylum here. The majority of asylum seeking children are, of course, accompanied by their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.8/3">We fully appreciate the potential vulnerability of unaccompanied children and the distress they may experience while awaiting a decision on their asylum claims. The need for anxious scrutiny is stressed in training and guidance to all staff involved in the asylum decision-making process. Because of the particular sensitivities surrounding applications from unaccompanied children, their cases are given priority and dealt with by specially trained caseworkers, who are provided with comprehensive instructions setting out areas to consider when dealing with such applications. These instructions are available on the Internet and are reviewed on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.8/4">All unaccompanied minors who apply for asylum are referred to the Refugee Council's panel of advisers, a non-statutory body which acts as adviser to the child in his/her dealings with the Home Office and other agencies for the duration of the asylum claim. Unaccompanied minors are not entitled to benefits but are supported under the Children Act 1989 (maintenance and accommodation being provided by social services departments of the local authorities). It has been agreed that no unaccompanied child will be removed from the United Kingdom unless we are satisfied that adequate reception and care arrangements are in place in the country to which he/she is to be removed. If care arrangements cannot be established, the child is normally allowed to remain here exceptionally, outside the Immigration Rules, on compassionate grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.8/5">For these reasons, we do not accept the recommendation made in the legal opinion forwarded by Save the Children.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">If I have understood the noble Lord correctly, he is asking whether it might be possible to re-draft our reservation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in such a way as to define specific situations where our reservation would come into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/2">The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is written in terms of broad-brush statements rather than in precise legal language. As such, it is possible for signatory countries to interpret the UNCRC in slightly differing ways and for interpretation to change over time. In view of this, I believe it appropriate to retain a similarly broad reservation. Were we to tighten the terms of our reservation, this might compromise our immigration and nationality laws at some later stage following changes of interpretation as to how the UNCRC should be applied. For this reason we believe that it is sensible to retain the reservation as presently worded.</p>

Key Targets 2 and 3 are consistent with goals set in the department's public service agreement (PSA), adapted to cover cumulative performance. The fourth key target relates to improvements in DPA customer satisfaction and the fifth to the costs of running the agency. The key targets are: Key Target 1: Key requirements compliance.

Average cumulative slippage of in-service dates <sup>2</sup> at <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase> not to exceed 12.1 months. Key Target 3: Average cumulative cost growth.

	<p pid="a.69.0/1">Since the statement of my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr Moonie) on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-23">23 January</phrase> this year, (Official Report, columns 891-902) in another place, the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency has been conducting a review to establish more clearly the exact extent of the problem with the mistaken taxation of service invaliding and attibutable pensions. This work is not complete but has revealed that some Royal Navy invaliding and attributable pensions awarded between 1973 and 1999 have also been mistakenly taxed. We will be reviewing all the case files of those who might have been affected and arranging for refunds to be made as appropriate. This will be done as quickly as possible but is expected to take some months given the need to review several thousand pension files. We will also be providing appropriate national publicity to allow those who think they might have a claim to apply for a tax refund.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/2">Our research has not so far revealed any cases where Royal Air Force pensions were wrongly taxed and there is evidence that the RAF has had in place checks which would have uncovered cases where attributable pensions should have been exempt from tax. However, we will include the RAF in our continuing work to ensure that no error is left unidentified.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/3">Our further work to date has confirmed that the problem was more extensive than originally understood but has also shown the complexity of the issues involved as over time changes have been made to the organisations responsible for administering the pensions and to the rules governing the schemes. We have therefore concluded that we should set up an internal review, completely independent of the staffs involved, to establish the precise extent of the current problems and to expose any other problems that may exist. This independent review will look across all three services, be launched as soon as possible and is likely to take a number of months to complete. The review team will be headed-up by a senior civil servant and consist of staff drawn from the Defence Internal Audit. In order to provide external confidence, the NAO will be invited to validate the procedures. We will report the findings to the House. Rebo</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/1">The five genotype groupings that are being used for the purposes of the National Scrapie Plan were put in place following extensive consultations with the sheep industry. The third of the groupings covers rams that have little resistance to scrapie and the plan permits them to be sold or used for breeding without restriction until the end of 2004. After that, any ram in this grouping, with the planned exception of a ram with the ARQ/ARQ genotype, on a scheme farm may continue to be used for breeding for a further three years or until the end of its life if that occurs sooner. Given the need to make real progress under the plan, those are long timescales and there are no plans to extend them further. Participation in the National Scrapie Plan is voluntary and it is clearly in the interests of sheep breeders to convert their flock to scrapie-resistant status as rapidly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/1">Sector skills councils (SSCs) are UK-wide employer-led industry or business sector-based bodies. They have the task to define the skills and productivity priorities confronting their sectors, develop strategies to deal with them and work with employers, government and relevant agencies such as the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to deliver specific action, including apprenticeships and occupational standards where these are relevant and the innovation of new approaches to identified skills and productivity problems. SSCs will receive up to &pound;1 million each year from my department to fund their core work. We expect that SSCs will attract additional investment from their sectors to deliver further work their sectors require. SSCs are licensed by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in conjunction with her ministerial colleagues in the Scottish Executive, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive. SSCs are accountable to the Secretary of State, through the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA), for the use of public funds in meeting their core task. As employer-led bodies, SSCs are also accountable to their sectors for their performance and any services directly delivered for a sector's benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/2">The SSDA is a non-departmental public body grant-funded by my department accountable to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. The SSDA's chair is Margaret Salmon and its chief executive is Christopher Duff. The SSDA's role is to support the development of an effective SSC network, including making recommendations to Government about the award of SSC licences and to promote the network's engagement with government and and other key partners throughout the UK. The SSDA is also responsible for funding the core work of SSCs through three-year contracts, monitoring SSCs' performance in meeting their priorities, providing skills intelligence to government and other partners for sectors without a SSC and for the co-ordination of cross-cutting sector-related work. The number of SSCs for which the SSDA is responsible will depend on the number of SSCs licensed. SSCs will be licensed for sectors where employers want them and can meet the published SSC Standard.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.5/1">If a school company were to fail, the delegated budget of individual member schools would not be at risk. In the case of a purchasing company, the company would be spending member schools' delegated budgets and therefore deemed to be acting as agent of the LEA. The LEA would be liable for the company's debts in the event of company failure, in the same way that the LEA would be liable for an individual school's debt when the school was acting as the LEA's agent. This would not be the case for service delivery companies, because such a company will not be acting as the LEA's agent. If a service delivery company becomes insolvent, its liabilities will not pass to its members as it will be a limited liability company. If a school company is unable to pay its debts there will be the normal routes which apply to all companies open to it and its creditors of placing the company in administration or winding the company up. shirley</p>
