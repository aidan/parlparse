	<p pid="b.101.2/1">The Government's consultation on the transposition of the European Union Open Access Directives, which ran from <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June 2005</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-05">5 August 2005</phrase>, advised that implementation for the Channel Tunnel was to be done by means of a bi-national regulation which is being discussed with the French Government. The broad areas to be covered by the bi-national regulation were described in the consultation document, which also invited consultees' comments on the Government's plans for transposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.2/2">Consultation on the text of the bi-national regulation itself was undertaken in agreement with the French Government from <phrase class="date" code="">3 August</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-18">18 September 2005</phrase>. The text was sent to the Channel Tunnel Concessionaires, to the railway undertakings currently operating through the Channel Tunnel and to those undertakings who had applied for safety certificates for Channel Tunnel operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.2/3">The bi-national regulation applies the principles of European law governing the rights of railway undertakings for access and transit on the Community's railways, including the requirements governing framework agreements. It does not deal with specific contracts.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.5/1">We welcome the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities (FPLD) report <i>Making Us Count </i>and the contribution it makes to understand the needs of young people with learning disabilities who also have mental health problems. The National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services, which we published in September 2004, recognised that children and young people with learning disabilities and mental health problems have special needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.5/2">The national service framework recommended that primary care trusts and local authorities should ensure that children and young people with learning disabilities receive equal access to mental health services at all tiers of service. To take this work forward we are funding a two-year FPLD project&mdash;<i>Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) Access for All.</i> The project will seek the views of young people with learning disabilities, family carers and with CAMHS and learning disability staff about current services. It will explore how these services can become more inclusive and identify clear pathways to care.</p>

	<p pid="b.103.0/1">The Government are taking numerous measures to combat noise pollution, ranging from the international to the national to the local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/2">At the national part of the spectrum, the Government are currently implementing an EU directive on environmental noise pollution (2002149/EC) that will lead, in 2007, to transport noise being mapped in agglomerations of more than 250,000 inhabitants as well as at major roads, railways and airports throughout the country. Action plans to tackle problems that are identified will follow in 2008 and then at five-yearly intervals.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/3">The Government's &quot;Planning Policy Guidance: Planning and Noise&quot; gives national guidance to planning authorities and others on how potential noise pollution should be addressed through development. The Government are currently reviewing this guidance to bring it up to date with, among other things, the UK's sustainable development strategy of 2005. The Government are also committed to developing a national ambient noise strategy by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/4">At the local level, the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 will give local authorities further powers for dealing with neighbourhood noise once they come into force in spring 2006. The new measures include powers for local authorities to deal with misfiring intruder alarms and the extension of the Noise Act 1996 to enable local authorities to issue fixed penalty notices of &pound;500 to licensed premises causing excessive noise.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/5">The Government are also developing a neighbourhood noise strategy for launch in 2007. This will review existing legislation for dealing with noise nuisance, including the statutory nuisance regime under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, as well as any gaps that existing legislation does not address. A draft scope for the Strategy will be consulted on later this year.</p>

There is no requirement additionally to publicise the entitlement to compensation in the event of an individual delay.</p>
