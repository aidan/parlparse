	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The decision to convene a service inquiry will normally be made within five days of either the incident itself or, where applicable, receipt of the reports of other investigative agencies from which it can be determined if anything of consequence may be learned by convening a service inquiry. Service inquiries into air occurrences are convened within 48 hours of the incident. Once a service inquiry has been convened we aim to make the report available within 40 weeks. However, the length of time an inquiry takes is determined partly by the nature of the incident under investigation and partly by the complexity of the case. Service inquiries will include those into covert operations, technical investigations into aircraft crashes, and incidents in hostile environments including those at sea. The need to adjourn an inquiry pending a police investigation and difficulties securing witnesses while on operations or travelling overseas could also of course cause delay.</p>

The next decision for the purchase of three aircraft to facilitate participation in the operational test and evaluation of JSF in the USA is currently planned for January 2009. Unit production costs for JSF are dependent on the number and timing of aircraft purchases for all partner nations and the delivery profile.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.3/1">The endorsed force-level figure for Operation Herrick 9 is 8,067 service personnel. The exact number of personnel in theatre will naturally fluctuate on a daily basis for a variety of reasons, including leave (rest and recuperation), temporary absence for training, evacuation for medical reasons, and the roulement of forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.2/1">For Phase 1 of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the European Commission approved two types of opt-outs for UK installations: one for installations with climate change agreements (CCAs) and the other for installations that were already in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS).</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/2">Within the UK, a total of 389 installations chose to opt out, 330 on the basis of their CCAs and 59 on the basis of their involvement in the UK ETS. The UK ETS opt-outs were required to enter the EU ETS on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, when the UK ETS ended. Seven of these were cement-sector installations, 34 offshore installations and six food-sector installations.</p>

In 2007 the allocated allowances and verified emissions increased whilst the number of installations in the sector stayed the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has informed me that it keeps a record of cancelled treatment cycles where the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been reported. As I stated in my reply on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-13">13 October 2008</phrase> (cols. <I>WA 31-32</I>), in 2007 this applied to 611 out of a total of 35,946 cycles. This gives an indication of the perceived risk of OHSS across the United Kingdom. The HFEA has advised me that it is of the view that there would be minimal value in assessing those national data on perceived risk against the actual incidence of OHSS in one fertility centre, as reported in<I> Human Fertility </I>(vol. 10, issue 3, pages 183-87).</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2">Professor Balen's report (published in 2005 and updated this year) compares the HFEA record of perceived risk of OHSS with larger data sets from across Europe. The HFEA commissioned Professor Balen to write a report on OHSS as part of its review of sperm, egg and embryo donation in 2004. The report provides an overview of OHSS, its incidence and the spectrum of the condition. The report is the result of an extensive literature review into OHSS, including the article in<I> Human Fertility</I> mentioned above. As a result, the HFEA does not intend to compare the figures in the <I>Human Fertility </I>article with the figures outlined in the report.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.5/1">The Welsh Assembly Government provide local health boards with funding to meet the needs of the local population, and the Health Commission Wales (HCW) with funding to meet the needs of those requiring specialised care in Wales. The funding is allocated directly to these organisations to provide services based upon the principle of ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate level of care irrespective of where it is provided. Consequently, there is no specific funding allocated for patients requiring specialised treatment in hospitals in England that is not available in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/2">Revenue is provided to local health boards (LHBs) and the HCW annually to purchase the necessary care (specialist and non-specialist) for the residents of Wales. LHBs and the HCW have contracts with both Welsh and English providers to service the needs of the population. The way in which the money is spent is no different in either country&mdash;that is, in general, services are provided by block or cost and volume contracts for that care. Where there are requirements outside the block or cost and volume contract, individual patient contracts are used (with English providers requiring prior authorisation from Welsh LHBs).</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/3">For instance, patients from north Wales who require cardiac surgery will have it carried out in the cardiothoracic centre in Liverpool, but it is paid for by the Health Commission Wales as part of the overall contract that the HCW has with the various providers in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.5/4">It is important to reiterate the key principle: there is no difference in the way the money is spent, irrespective of which side of the border, Wales or England, it is delivered. It is based on patient need and the most appropriate place for that to be met.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.5/1">Building on recent publications, Modernising Scientific Careers is set in the context of a vision for a National Health Service that empowers patients and the public, works in partnership with staff, and has quality as the organising principle. The case for change was made in the next-stage review documents published in June 2008, <I>High Quality Care </I><I>f</I><I>or All </I>and <I>A High Quality Workforce</I><I>,</I> which set out the need to modernise healthcare careers as the NHS addresses the challenges for the future around:</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/2">the changing nature of demand for healthcare services, including the effects of demography, changing public and patient expectations, more community-based care and technological advance; the changing nature of the supply of healthcare services, including changes driven by improvements to technology, changes in the composition of the workforce, their desired working patterns, and improvements to productivity, which also include the drive to promote more and better self-care and better use of the workforce; andthe changing nature of professional practice and the need to develop new skills and more team working, changes in accountability, leadership and independent practice and changes in the relationships between clinician and manager.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/3">Four key questions were at the heart of developing these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/4">First, how will the roles played by healthcare professionals change and what will be the implications for career frameworks? This has included looking at changing roles and career structures.Secondly, how should workforce planning be carried out to deliver trainees and a workforce of the right size, structure and skill? In answering this we have had to look at our core assumptions, the roles of different organisations as well as skills and resources.Thirdly, how should education be commissioned and funded to deliver trainees and a workforce of the right size, structure and skills? This has involved a review of how we commission and fund education and training as well as the capacity and capability required.Fourthly, how should we change the infrastructure and content of education to ensure the future workforce has the right skills? We have looked at education structures, regulatory structures and changes to selection processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.5/5">These questions were considered and addressed by four working groups made up of key stakeholders and leading thinkers. The output from these groups resulted in the commitments set out in <I>High Quality Care </I><I>f</I><I>or All</I> and <I>A High Quality Workforce</I>. These documents also provide further reference to background evidence and research and both have already been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">Seniority payments were part of the remuneration arrangements introduced in 1990. An interim scheme was included in the 2006 statement of financial entitlements, when remuneration arrangements for general dental practitioners changed from a fee-based system to one based on annual contract values agreed between primary care trusts (PCTs) and dental providers. The interim scheme has run for the three years of the transition to local commissioning. Seniority payments are a direct charge against PCTs' financial allocations for primary dental services. With effect from April 2009, it is proposed there will be no new entrants to the scheme but those dentists already entitled to payments will continue to receive them. There will be no immediate savings as a result, as the change will not affect allocations to PCTs.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.0/1">Accounting for information technology equipment is covered by the financial reporting standard (FRS) 15 tangible fixed assets. Central government applies this standard with only minor adaptations and interpretations as detailed in the <I>Government Financial Reporting Manual</I> (<I>FReM</I>).</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/2">Under FRS 15, departments as the user of the asset are responsible for assessing fixed asset lives&mdash;ie, the period over which the asset is to be depreciated. FRS 15 also requires that the useful life of an asset should be reviewed at the end of each reporting period.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/3">Controls over equipment in use, the replacement of that equipment and whether to recycle are decided by individual departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.3/1">Academy buildings are now procured by local authorities (LAs) either as part of their Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme or through the Partnerships for Schools national framework. Funding for the building project is not usually allocated for a project until it has moved beyond the feasibility stage and is in the implementation stage. However, were a sponsor to withdraw from an academy project once funding had been allocated, the LA, Partnership for Schools and the DCSF would decide whether to proceed with the refurbishment or new build for the academy either for the benefit of the predecessor school or schools, or for use by another academy or school project.</p>
