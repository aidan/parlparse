	<p pid="a.1.2/1">I am not aware that any specific consideration was given to including United Kingdom Armed Forces personnel in the abuse of trust offences in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. However, the 2003 Act could apply to personnel if they fall within its provisions and, where they do not, personnel are subject to other civil criminal offences such as sexual assault. Additionally, personnel suspected of a breach of trust offence could be tried under the appropriate sections of the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 or the Naval Discipline Act 1957 and, on conviction, face imprisonment. Personnel whose normal duties involve caring for, training, supervising or being solely in charge of service personnel aged under 18 in the Armed Forces are now subject to Criminal Records Bureau checks and will be subject to monitoring under the provisions of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 when it comes into force in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">We are aware that a number of detained Iranian Kurds have been carrying out a co-ordinated hunger strike since the end of August to protest against their treatment in detention&mdash;for example, lack of access to lawyers and families, the use of solitary confinement and unfair trials. We have not yet made specific representations to the Iranian Government about this, but the issue is due to be raised in the next EU human rights demarche in Tehran. The UK and the EU are very concerned about the treatment of ethnic minorities in Iran, including increasing discrimination against Iranian Kurds. In recent months large numbers of Kurdish citizens have been detained and Kurdish rights defenders have received lengthy prison sentences and, in some cases, death sentences for peaceful activities in support of their rights. It is particularly worrying that vague national security charges are increasingly being applied to human rights activists. The EU issued a public declaration on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-06">6 August</phrase> stating that it was &quot;greatly disturbed&quot; by the infringement of rights of Iranian Kurds and the numerous human rights violations against journalists, trade unionists, students and human rights defenders belonging to Iran's Kurdish minority. The statement called on Iran to fulfil its human rights obligations towards all Iranian citizens irrespective of ethnic origin.</p>

For example, these Acts strengthened the rights of employees not to be dismissed on the grounds of taking lawfully organised, official industrial action. There have been no EU legislative changes during this period concerning the rights of workers to strike, including changes proposed under the treaty of Lisbon, which provides that existing rights and principles recorded in the Charter of Fundamental Rights will continue to have effect as they always have done on EU institutions and member states when implementing EU law.
