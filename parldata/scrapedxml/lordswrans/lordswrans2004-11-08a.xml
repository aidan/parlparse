They also have concerns about the levels of cost to public funds if individual petition were used extensively to explore the meaning of the provisions of a treaty. However, they wish to consider the merits of individual petition on a more empirical basis and, to enable them to do that, they have decided to accede to the right of individual petition under the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.1/2" qnum="HL4318">What research they have undertaken or commissioned on alleged abuse of the war pensions scheme arising from placing the burden of proof for entitlement on the Ministry of Defence, leaving the claimant only needing to raise a &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;; and what figures they have on the prevalence of such abuse in each of the past five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.2/1">The Ministry of Defence deals with a small number of claims that are made fraudulently or in error, but these are not the principal issue in this case. The question is whether it is right to pay awards where service is unlikely to have been the cause of death or injury and whether these resources would not be better used to improve the level of awards to the more seriously disabled who are not well served by current arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/2">For claims made within seven years of leaving service, war pension legislation provides that there is no burden on the claimant to prove that service caused the injury or death in question and that he receives the benefit of any reasonable doubt. The claimant himself is not required to raise that doubt. For claims made more than seven years after leaving service, the burden is on the claimant, but only to the extent that he has to raise a reasonable doubt.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/3">It is inevitable therefore, given the eligibility criteria, that war pensions will be awarded where it is unlikely&mdash;and in some cases highly unlikely&mdash;that the injury or death was caused by service. No figures are kept on the number of war pension claims which succeed because of the preferential burden of proof, though the recent analysis of the effect of the amendment to the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Bill proposed by the noble Lord gives our estimate of the effect of changing burden and standard of proof for the new Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. I am placing a copy of this in the Library of the House.</p>

I am arranging to place a copy of this letter in the Libraries of both Houses. The MoD is confident that the assumptions are a fair and realistic assessment of the effect that such a change will have on the number and levels of awards.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.0/1">The cadet forces are voluntary, community-based organisations promoting the personal and social development of young people. The focus is on bringing adventure and enjoyment, with a view to steering the cadets towards responsible citizenship. Funding is not linked to sex, ethnic origin or type of education as one of the main keystones of the cadet forces is social inclusion. The MoD funding made available for the financial year 2003&ndash;04 is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/2" class="indent">Sea Cadet Corps (SCC)&mdash;&pound;8 million&ndash;&pound;9 million. Funding is also provided by the Sea Cadet Association (SCA).</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/3" class="indent">Army Cadet Force&mdash;&pound;40 million. Some additional activities are funded by charity.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/4" class="indent">Air Training Corps&mdash;&pound;21 million. Again, some additional activities are funded by charity.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/5" class="indent">Combined Cadet Force (CCF)&mdash;Each CCF is essentially a partnership between the individual school and the Ministry of Defence. The MoD, through the single services, contributed in the region of &pound;15 million in FY 2003&ndash;04 to the CCF. In addition, the CCF benefits from the infrastructure established to support the other cadet forces. In many cases schools also provide additional funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/6">The fact that cadet force funding has passed spending scrutiny year on year indicates that we believe these youth activities are of considerable value to both the Armed Forces and to society as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">The Government do not believe that there is a conflict of interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">Nevertheless, as required by the Cabinet Office code of practice for board members, all non-departmental public bodies, including UK Sport, should have in place proper procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest with chair and board member personal, business or other interests as well as the interests of close family members, which may arise out of carrying out board responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">These rules include a requirement for declaring, and if necessary resolving, any potential personal or business conflicts of interests in relation to the work of the public body concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/4">A register of members' interests appropriate to the body's activities should be kept up to date. The register should, as a minimum, list direct or indirect pecuniary interests that members of the public might reasonably think could influence board members' judgment. Board members are strongly encouraged to register non-pecuniary interests that relate closely to the body's activities, and interests of close family members and persons living in the same household as the board member.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/5">Board members should declare at board meetings any interest that relates specifically to a particular issue under consideration, for recording in the minutes. Board members should not participate in the discussion or determination of matters in which they have an interest, and should normally withdraw from the meeting if their interest is direct and pecuniary, or if their interest is covered in specific guidance issued by the body or the sponsoring department which requires them not to participate or to withdraw from the meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/6">These controls are effectively operated at UK Sport. All board members, including Sue Campbell as chair, are required to complete and maintain a declaration of interest's statement. UK Sport also maintains a related party transactions register that is published with the annual accounts.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.5/4">For Office for National Statistics (ONS) international comparisons of productivity (ICP), individual countries' national gross domestic product at current prices are converted into comparable volume measures using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) current purchasing power parities (PPPs) to remove cross-country price differentials. Any further details such as estimates of hourly productivity for different sectors could be used to help our understanding of national relative productivity positions, but there remain some particular measurement and data difficulties so that ONS does not currently publish such detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.5/5">Some countries publish productivity measures for their business sector or marketed economy (eg the US and Canada). It is common to focus on parts of the economy because the economy is considered to be measured more accurately at an individual sector level. Historically, the UK has focussed more on industry detail, rather than institutional sectors, and headline UK measures highlight the production industries where there is a long series of consistent output and labour series forming the basis for productivity measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.5/6">On public sector productivity, we have asked Sir Tony Atkinson, Warden of Nuffield College, Oxford, to carry out a review of &quot;Measurement of Government Output and Productivity for the National Accounts&quot;. Sir Tony published an interim report in July 2004, and his final report is due in January 2005. Once I have considered Sir Tony's final report, it will be for me to decide what changes to make to statistics produced by ONS.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.5/7">On the employment side, ONS publishes public sector employment statistics (with the next set of figures due to be released during November). ONS is also leading a programme of work to improve the quality of these statistics in collaboration with government departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.5/1">The Government do not keep a record of the numbers of badgers killed on British roads. Badgers are not considered a general danger to road safety or the occupants of vehicles, although, as with any medium or larger-sized animal, there is always the potential for adverse consequences for occupants if a vehicle collides with or swerves to avoid such an animal.</p>
