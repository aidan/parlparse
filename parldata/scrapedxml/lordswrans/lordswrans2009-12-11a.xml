	<p pid="a.165.2/1">Early this year DECC and Defra initiated a major new research programme (AVOID), aimed at assessing how the world can avoid dangerous climate change. AVOID is being delivered by a consortium of experts, led by the Met Office, and including the Grantham and Walker Institutes and the Tyndall Centre. A significant component of AVOID during the past 10 months has been to deliver new climate science evidence, specifically to inform the UK delegation ahead of Copenhagen, in particular with respect to emission pathways associated with limiting global temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius, a review of climate change impacts and the costs associated with impacts and mitigation action. Key results to date are available on the programme website<sup>l</sup> and it is expected that associated research papers will, be published in the scientific peer-reviewed literature in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/2">A summary of results will be presented at the Copenhagen negotiations in December.</p>

The department's policy is not to release any information that might lead to individual children being identified where data released could be combined with other data. As 69 local authorities identified a total of 210 home educated children that they assessed as receiving no education at all, we are not able to release a breakdown of these data by local authority as the numbers for each individual authority would be very small and individual children might be identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2">We did not collect information on the ethnic or cultural background of home educated children receiving no education, nor their age, so we are unable to provide information on the number from a traveller background, or the number that are in years 10 or 11.
