Wine and certain fresh fruit and vegetables are also required to indicate country of origin.

	<p pid="a.131.0/1">The results of the Medix survey show the importance of engaging the active support of practising clinicians. It is encouraging therefore that the same survey also shows a substantial level of support for the national programme.

	<p pid="a.131.0/2">As well as the national professional bodies and groups, the national programme team has engaged closely with expert primary care practitioners, including practising general practitioners, who are there to represent and feedback issues with their professional colleagues. As we move towards implementation of the national applications, systems and services the five regional implementation directors have undertaken extensive consultation with a range of NHS clinicians and managers.

	<p pid="a.131.3/1">We welcome the guideline on National Health Service fertility services in England and Wales that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase>. The guideline's recommendations on the assessment and treatment of couples are based on considerations of clinical and cost effectiveness. In order to move towards implementation of the guideline, and to introduce a national minimum level of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) service across the country, we have asked all primary care trusts to offer at least one cycle of IVF to all those eligible by April next year. We have also asked that priority be given to couples who do not have any children living with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/2">Although we recognise, as does NICE, that the NHS cannot reasonably be expected to implement the guideline in full overnight, we expect the NHS to make progress to full implementation in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/3">The Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection will inspect NHS service provision using criteria it develops which take into account the Secretary of State's statement of healthcare standards, which are currently open to public consultation. These draft standards currently propose that NHS treatment and care should be based upon nationally agreed best practice and guidance, including that issued by NICE.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.5/1">The gynaecology department at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital currently operates a system called partial booking. Partial booking is an interim step on the way towards full booking. Full booking is where the patient can choose a convenient date at the point of referral. In specialties where waiting times are long, partial booking allows the patient to choose a date that is convenient for them nearer to the time of their expected appointment, usually around four to eight weeks in advance. This process also has the effect of reducing the number of DNAs (did not attend) as patients are more likely to keep their appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.5/2">We are informed by Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trusts that its partial booking system started in the gynaecology department in August 2000 and has reduced the DNA rate from 19 per cent to 10 per cent. The trust also assures me that the gynaecology department is working to reduce long waits and ensure that, in line with our expectations, no patient is waiting longer than 17 weeks for a first outpatient appointment by the end of March this year.</p>
