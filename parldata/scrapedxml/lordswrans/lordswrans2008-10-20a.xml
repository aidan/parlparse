Studies have examined the potential utility of tilt-rotor aircraft in a wide range of operational scenarios including casualty evacuation in Afghanistan, but we do not currently assess that tilt-rotor aircraft would provide an advantage over the aircraft in our existing fleet in meeting our operational requirements.</p>

Hypothecating taxes to particular spending programmes causes inflexibility in spending decisions and can lead to a misallocation of resources, with reduced value for money for taxpayers. The spending review process ensures that resources are allocated efficiently to deliver government objectives and ensures priorities, such as education and health, receive the increased levels of funding, as set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

Driving licence holders are required by law to notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency of any change of address, but there is at present no similar requirement on passport holders. Identity and Passport Service records therefore hold only the address given at the time a passport application was made and in many cases this will not be correct when the passport is due for renewal 10 years later.</p>

The aim of these standards, which are currently being developed by the National Policing Improvement Agency, will be to assist the service to continue to improve performance and mainstream activity on equality and diversity. The standards will be set within a framework which will support authorities and forces in setting equality standards locally with national oversight retained through a new, more robust HMIC inspection regime including a proposed 2010 workforce inspection which will scrutinise (among other issues) the equality standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/5">The Government are currently consulting on whether the equality standards should include local employment targets such as for race and gender. This shift from national target-setting will provide for targets being agreed locally by police authorities in consultation with communities.

The DWP is therefore the lead contracting authority for the existing Post Office card account, and will be the lead contracting authority for the replacement Government card account which is currently the subject of a tender process. The department is responsible for Post Office network policy and also manages the Government's shareholder interests in Post Office Ltd.

	<p pid="a.88.0/1">The UK Border Agency only detains those Zimbabwean nationals who have committed crimes within the United Kingdom, are subject to deportation action and have been assessed as unsuitable for release due to being either a threat to the public and/or likely to abscond. Provisional management information indicates that, as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-29">29 September</phrase>, there were 36 Zimbabwean nationals convicted of crimes within the UK who were held in detention pending deportation action. All such individuals have the opportunity to apply for release on bail to the independent Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/2">The situation in Zimbabwe is currently being considered by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. We have no plans to resume enforced returns to Zimbabwe before the tribunal has reached its conclusion. The timing of the resumption of enforced returns will take full account of the situation in Zimbabwe at the relevant time.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/3">Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, we expect unsuccessful asylum seekers to return to their country of origin. Return and reintegration assistance is available through the International Organisation for Migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/4">We will continue to help those Zimbabweans who want to go home voluntarily.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/5">The Prime Minister informed Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-10">10 July</phrase> that the Government are actively looking at the situation of those Zimbabweans who do not have a protection need but who have not returned home voluntarily. That consideration is currently ongoing and the Government will report back to Parliament once this has been completed.</p>
