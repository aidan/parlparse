	<p pid="a.192.5/1">The contract between Her Majesty's Courts Service and the private bailiff companies that undertake work on behalf of magistrates' courts does not contain a specific requirement for private bailiffs to refer back to magistrates' courts before using the power of forced entry.

	<p pid="a.192.5/2">As part of the tender process for awarding these contracts, the internal controls operated by the contractors were reviewed to ensure the arrangements to use forced entry are controlled and only used where appropriate.

	<p pid="a.193.2/1">It is expected that all Her Majesty's Courts Service civil enforcement officers and the approved enforcement agents who execute warrants on behalf of magistrates' courts explain their powers to defaulters as a matter of best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/2">This requirement is made specific in respect of the use of forced entry through guidance issued to all civilian enforcement officers and approved enforcement agents on the use of the search and entry powers under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. The wording used in the guidance states that before applying the powers of forced entry a civilian enforcement officer or approved enforcement agent should always explain (to the defaulter) that they have the power to force entry and will use that power if the occupier is not willing to let them in peacefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/3">The contracts held between Her Majesty's Courts Service and the approved enforcement agents sets out the protocols and procedures that approved enforcement agents must adhere to when executing warrants on behalf of Her Majesty's Courts Service. Specifically Schedule 4, the contract service specification, details the procedures to be taken when contact is made with the defaulter. The wording used in the specification states that when contact is made the authorised employee shall provide in writing the powers vested in the contractor. This notification will include the powers of forced entry provided under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.5/1">The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 at Schedule 4A sets out the powers of authorised officers executing warrants. Section 1 defines &quot;authorised officer&quot; as civilian enforcement officers or approved enforcement agents.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/2">Section 2(1) and (2) states that an authorised officer may enter and search any premises for the purpose of executing a warrant of arrest, commitment or detention issued in proceedings for or in connection with any criminal offence. The power may be exercised (a) only to the extent that it is reasonably required for that purpose; and (b) only if the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the person whom he is seeking is on the premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/3">Section 3 states that an authorised officer may enter and search any premises for the purpose of executing a warrant of distress issued under Section 76 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 for default in paying a sum adjudged to be paid by a conviction. The power must be exercised only to the extent that it is reasonably required for the purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/4">Detailed guidance is available in HM Courts Service's <I>Search and Entry Powers (Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004) Guidance to Civilian Enforcement Officers and Approved Enforcement Agents</I>. A copy is in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/5">If a defaulter can prevent the execution of a warrant merely by refusing to open his or her front door, the practical value and credibility of enforcement proceedings is substantially impaired. The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 at Schedule 4A now gives civilian enforcement officers (CEOs) and approved enforcement agents (AEAs) an explicit power to enter premises in order to execute warrants and to use reasonable force in order to do so. This provides CEOs and AEAs with a defence to any civil and criminal liability that would otherwise arise. It is also applicable to the execution of warrants of distress for criminal enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.8/1">We welcome this report. Since 2000-01, local authority expenditure on services for looked-after children has increased from &pound;1.3 billion to over &pound;2.1 billion in 2006-07 and as a result outcomes for children in care have been improving in recent years. However, the Government recognise that more needs to be done and the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 makes the necessary legislative changes to support implementation of our <I>Care Matters </I>programme of reform. We agree that children in care need to be placed in the setting which best meets their needs and a key priority is to ensure that children are placed in the most appropriate accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.8/2">Our ambition is to enhance the range and choice of placements for looked-after children, while ensuring that all placements are of a suitable quality. The steps we are taking to improve local commissioning, in particular the new sufficiency duty introduced by the Children and Young Persons Act, are key to delivering this ambition.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.8/3">Residential care must be of a high standard and staffed by a trained and well supported workforce. We know from Ofsted inspections that a small minority of children's homes do not manage to meet these standards. That is why we are revising the national minimum standards for children's homes and strengthening Ofsted's powers to enforce these standards through regulations under the Children and Young Persons Act 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.8/4">To achieve our ambitions for all children in care, we need a better understanding of what types of provision for children in care are most effective at meeting different children's needs. That is why we are piloting multi-dimensional treatment foster care, and social pedagogy in children's homes, to develop a much better understanding of what works, particularly for the most vulnerable children.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.8/5">The local and national-level performance frameworks for looked-after children reflect the importance that central and local government and our partners place on achieving real improvements in outcomes for children in care.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.8/1">Some civil servants are eligible to receive non-consolidated performance payments, in recognition of their performance in achieving agreed objectives. These payments are ring-fenced at the beginning of the year from the existing pay bill of departments and are distributed to staff at the end of the year based on performance. They are also non-consolidated and as such they have to be re-earned each year and do not add to future pay bill costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.8/2">In respect of the banking institutions, UK Financial Investments (UKFI) manages the Government's shareholdings in recapitalised banks.

Bonus payments which are subject to deferral and appropriate clawback properly reward long-term performance and ensure bonuses are not solely based on past performance but also shape future performance.</p>

Of a budget of &pound;112 million in 2008-09, the MoD will spend approximately 40 per cent, the FCO 30 per cent, and DfID 30 per cent; and DfID is involved in part-funding several projects that contribute towards DfID's objectives, but are managed by other government departments. Examples include the International Inspiration Project (led by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport), which aims to use the power of sport to transform the lives of children and young people of all abilities, in schools and communities across the world; and the returns and reintegration fund (led by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office), the primary aim of which is to increase the number of foreign national prisoners and failed asylum seekers who return to their countries of origin, while ensuring that those who return are effectively reintegrated.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.5/1">Whether UK government spending counts as official development assistance (ODA) depends on the activities funded, not on which department finances them. The Conflict Prevention Pool (CPP) and stabilisation aid fund (SAF) both operate on the basis that they will finance some activities which qualify as ODA, and some which will not. As a result some of the transfers to the CPP and SAF may not score as ODA. We expect that most of the other transferred funds will finance activities which score as ODA. Overall, the transfers will not significantly affect the UK's ODA/gross national income ratio.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.5/1">The Government did not give statutory force to the Food Standards Agency voluntary guidance that bacon produced from imported pork should not be described as British bacon for the following reasons. The United Kingdom and the European Commission (EC) are signatories to the World Trade Organisation agreements which stipulate that the country where the last significant change took place is the country of origin. Neither the UK nor the Commission can prevent in law a producer labelling their product in accordance with this principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.5/2">Furthermore, food labelling rules are harmonised in the European Union and a requirement that bacon could only be called British if it originated from British pigs would intrude on EC competence. As I indicated in my earlier answer, these rules are under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.2/1">Under current policy, every life and indeterminate-sentence prisoner serving a sentence with a tariff of six years or more is entitled to have their case reviewed by the Parole Board three years prior to the expiry of their tariff. The purpose of this review is to enable prisoners who have made good progress to be transferred to open conditions prior to the expiry of tariff, in order that the risk of harm they present may be tested in open conditions, to inform the Parole Board's decision on or post tariff expiry as to whether they might be released into the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.2/2">To be able to confirm the number of prisoners who have not had their cases reviewed by the Parole Board at a point three years before the expiry of their judicial tariff would require a manual audit of all records of all such prisoners serving a tariff of six years or more. To undertake a manual exercise of this scale would incur disproportionate cost. However, modifications which are currently being made to the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Public Protection Unit Database (PPUD) will enable such information to be stored centrally, albeit in respect of those prisoners whose pre-tariff parole review commences on or after <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> and I will write to provide you with that information at that time.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.5/1">The Government have implemented the offender management model for the management of offenders in custody who are assessed as presenting a high risk of serious harm, are considered a prolific or other priority offender or who are serving an indeterminate sentence for public protection. These groups are highly likely to be serving a long sentence. The offender management model requires a community-based offender manager to oversee the sentence from start to finish, paying particular attention to the transition from custody to the community. The offender manager prepares a sentence plan to cover the custodial period of the sentence, ensuring that the offender receives the interventions required to enable him or her to resettle in the community. Following release, long-term prisoners are subject to a period of licence when they will be supervised by the probation service.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.5/2">Subject to the requirements of the sentence plan, which is based on an individual assessment of needs, prisons participate in a range of accredited programmes designed to tackle offending behaviour and substance abuse. The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) works in partnership with the Learning and Skills Council and is engaged with employers nationally, regionally, and locally to offer offenders education and training which will help them find employment on release. Subject to a risk assessment, prisoners approaching the end of a long sentence will be released on temporary licence to undertake training, community or paid work, to attend job interviews and make other preparations for work and accommodation on release. There are also a range of short programmes which help prisoners with personal finance and family relationship issues. Prisoners receive help with meeting accommodation needs. NOMS is currently working with key stakeholders to pilot an initiative to enable prisoners to open bank accounts while in custody. NOMS also works with the Department for Work and Pensions and Jobcentre Plus to ensure that prisoners due to be released have appointments made with local jobcentres and benefits offices. And there are arrangements in place to ensure continuity of healthcare for any ongoing medical needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.5/3">In 2007-08, the Prison Service exceeded its targets for the percentage of prisoners released with employment (109 per cent against target) and accommodation (115 per cent) on release.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.3/1">The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) has, in response to concerns from the research community, reintroduced a financial cap on its first grants scheme so as to be able to support more researchers early in their careers. This follows an increase in demand for these grants and in the average amount of funding being sought.
