	<p pid="a.375.5/1">The experience of the UK and our international partners in post-conflict environments is that economic interventions, including in agriculture, can be an important tool for stabilisation. Addressing short-term economic needs by rehabilitating infrastructure, procuring from local markets or resolving property disputes can help change perceptions, relationships and behaviours and provide incentives against violence. Early interventions to create jobs can deliver a critical peace dividend, and create the political space to address underlying conflict drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.5/2">The strategic defence and security review recognises the need to tackle instability and conflict overseas, including in Africa, through an integrated approach across government. The forthcoming Building Stability Overseas strategy, to be published in March 2011, will address this in greater detail. We already carry out joint conflict analysis across government to inform our strategies, most recently in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. The Africa programme of the tri-departmental conflict pool remains an important means of strengthening collaboration between the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p>

This was the result of a national security risk assessment process undertaken since May 2010, and the subsequent National Security Council decisions on the national security tasks and planning guidelines as set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review. The review clearly outlines that more defence engagement should be directed towards conflict prevention, security sector reform and capability building in priority countries. Defence diplomacy and our ability to project power overseas are essential elements in an integrated comprehensive approach to building our prosperity and protecting our security.</p>

	<p pid="a.377.6/1">The UK enjoys good relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-ASEAN-and its members on a broad range of issues, including trade and investment, education, and defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.6/2">The UK considers the ASEAN region to be strategically important, not least due to the number of emerging economies within it. UK priorities for the relationship are to strengthen existing economic ties and to promote democracy and good governance. Security issues, including counterterrorism and piracy, are also important issues.

The revised code will ensure remuneration is consistent with effective risk management and bank employees will no longer receive all their bonuses in cash while leaving their shareholders, and potentially the taxpayer, exposed to the long-term risks they take. Alongside this, the Government have developed world-leading policies that directly target the risks inherent in the banking sector and will work to increase competitiveness in the industry. The Independent Commission on Banking has been established with a specific mandate to investigate these issues and the Government have introduced a levy that incentivises less risky banking activities. In combination, these measures will address the problems of remuneration and excessive risk-taking.</p>

	<p pid="a.383.5/1">The UK's target under the renewable energy directive (2009/28/EC) is to ensure that at least 15 per cent of energy consumed across electricity, heating and transport comes from renewable sources by 2020. The UK national renewable energy action plan sets out a lead scenario showing how the UK might meet this target and in this lead scenario around 30 per cent of electricity would come from renewable sources in 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.5/2">Actual costs of meeting the overall 15 per cent target will depend on how technology costs and the market evolve between now and 2020. We know that the short-term price impacts of increasing renewable energy will be negligible. By 2020 we estimate that, when taken in isolation, deploying renewables will increase domestic electricity bills by 26 per cent (&#163;105) compared to what they would have been without these measures. However, when taken together with all energy and climate change policies we expect domestic electricity bills to fall by 5 per cent (&#163;26). Any calculation of &quot;additional&quot; costs of renewable energy depend on assumptions about fossil fuel prices; with higher fossil fuel prices the relative cost of renewable sources of energy would be lower.</p>

	<p pid="a.399.5/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> the Government have funded conflict prevention, stabilisation (post-conflict reconstruction) and discretionary peacekeeping activity from the conflict pool. Funding for the pool is provided through the spending round separately from departmental expenditure limits and is managed jointly by the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence. The conflict pool for 2010-11 is &#163;178.5 million, which is allocated to four regional programmes (Africa, the Middle East, wider Europe and South Asia) and one thematic programme (Strategic Support to International Organisations). In addition to the conflict pool, conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction activities are also funded by the Stabilisation Unit or bilaterally through Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.5/2">The spending review and the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) have both underlined the importance the Government attaches to conflict work, in particular long-term conflict prevention and stabilisation programmes. The conflict pool will be sustained over the next spending review period, increasing to around &#163;300 million in 2014-15. A new Building Stability Overseas strategy will be published in spring 2011 and the conflict pool will be a key instrument for delivery of this strategy. Priorities and allocations for the conflict pool for the next financial year will be determined in the coming weeks. We will seek to maintain a range of activities in priority regions where the risk and impact of conflict is greatest.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.3/1">The power-sharing inclusive Government have made some progress since their inception in February 2009, most notably on the stabilisation of the economy. Progress on political reform has been slower.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.3/2">Earlier this year, we were encouraged by the appointment of the Media, Electoral and Human Rights Commissions. Progress by the commissions has been slow in the face of intransigence from hardliners; however, we welcome the issuing of newspaper licences by the Media Commission, an essential element in preparing the conditions for credible elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.3/3">There has been a considerable reduction in the severity and frequency of human rights abuses since the formation of the inclusive Government. Despite this, we remain concerned about ongoing abuses, particularly around the rule of law and the hardliners' continued exploitation of their control of the security apparatus and judiciary for political ends. The recent constitutional reform process has shown that state actors still have a capacity for violence and intimidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.3/4">Persistent intransigence from hardliners, including the recent unilateral appointments made by President Mugabe, led Prime Minister Tsvangirai to declare a constitutional crisis earlier this month. We share Prime Minister Tsvangirai's frustration and support him in his determination to remain in the Government. In the absence of a road map to credible and properly monitored elections, the inclusive Government continue to offer the only credible means of transforming Zimbabwe and delivering basic services to its people. But to succeed, it needs a clear commitment from all parties to work together to implement the reforms set out in the global political agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.3/5">We will continue to work with our international partners in considering how best to work with reformers in Zimbabwe and the region, including South Africa, to improve prospects of reform in Zimbabwe and to prepare for credible and properly monitored elections.</p>
