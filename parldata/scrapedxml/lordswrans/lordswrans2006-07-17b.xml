	<p pid="b.161.41/1">We are very concerned about the reports of an attack on <phrase class="date" code="">5 July</phrase> on Hamrat esh-Sheikh, a city in north Kordofan. The newly formed National Redemption Front claimed responsibility. However, it seems more likely to have been carried out by north Darfur rebel groups led by the Sudan Liberation Army/Unity with some Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) involvement. This is a clear attempt by spoilers to extend the Darfur conflict which has caused so much suffering.</p>
	<p pid="b.161.41/2">It is totally unacceptable to spread the violence from Darfur to other regions. We call on all sides to implement the Darfur peace agreement and previous ceasefires, to which all in the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and JEM have agreed. We urge the Government of Sudan to show restraint in the face of this attack to prevent any further escalation of conflict.</p>
