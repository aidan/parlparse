	<p pid="a.159.3/5">Once a school is named in a statement the governors are under a duty to admit the child. Parents can also make representations for non-maintained special or independent schools to be named in statements, but LEAs do not have to name such schools if they feel one of their own schools can meet a child's needs. If parents are unhappy about the school named in their child's statement they have right of appeal to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal. In 2002&ndash;03:</p>

In the light of these and other responses the Government have decided in principle that the council should continue primarily as a source of strategic advice to Government, navigation authorities and other waterway bodies about the inland waterways generally. The Government have also decided in principle that the council should be reconstituted as an independent body reporting to and supported by Government and that its formal ties with British Waterways should be severed. The Government are at present exploring ways in which these conclusions can be implemented and hope to make a formal announcement about the council's future soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.8/1">Environmental stewardship will be launched in England in 2005 to replace the existing agri-environment schemes (environmentally sensitive areas countryside stewardship and organic farming schemes). Environmental stewardship has three elements: entry level stewardship (ELS), organic entry level stewardship and higher level stewardship.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.8/2">There are no specific options for traditional orchards in entry level stewardship but applicants might choose to manage them under a grassland option. Opportunities for grant aided management of orchards will be available within higher level stewardship. It is envisaged that the management requirements will be similar to those that currently apply to traditional orchards managed within countryside stewardship.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-09-08a.162.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="162"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040908/text/40908w02.htm#40908w02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.162.0/1">We intend to fulfil our manifesto commitment to enable Parliament to deal with the issue of hunting with dogs.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/2">Some opponents of hunting want this issue to be dealt with as a matter of great urgency, while supporters of hunting want nothing to change and many other people regard it as being less important than many other policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/3">We have made it clear that the issue does not have as high a priority as issues like jobs and schools and hospitals and transport, to name a few. But it is an issue that has absorbed an enormous amount of valuable parliamentary time, over several years, and before the last election we acknowledged that it was time to enable Parliament to reach a conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/4">We have made efforts to find a constructive way forward, based on the evidence, through the Burns committee report and the work of the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality which culminated in public hearings in Portcullis House in 2002. The proposals put to the Commons last year would have banned hunting except where a particular activity could be proved&mdash;to the satisfaction of an independent tribunal&mdash;to be necessary for pest control and to involve less suffering than available alternatives. The Commons decided by a substantial majority on a free vote to go further and require a complete ban apart from a few very restricted statutory exceptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/5">This House then considered the Bill but failed to return it to the Commons before the end of the Session last November. That was disappointing and the only way the Government can be sure to fulfil their manifesto commitment is now to reintroduce the Bill in the form it left the Commons last year. The Government are therefore giving notice of the Bill's reintroduction in the Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/6">It will be a matter for the Commons to decide, but the Government believe that the provisions of the Parliament Acts will be available if an unaltered Bill is sent to this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/7">In addition to the Bill, the Government will ask the Commons to agree a Motion to commence the Bill's provisions in relation to hunting, but not hare-coursing events, two years after its enactment. Special procedures exist under the Parliament Act 1911 for changes to be made if agreed to by both Houses. This period will give those involved in hunting more than adequate time to cease activities which are to be banned, for humane arrangements like the dispersal or re-homing of dogs and for re-focusing any business activities on alternatives like drag-hunting or disposal of fallen stock if they wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/8">These welfare considerations do not apply to hare coursing events. Violence and intimidation associated with illegal coursing events is a real and pressing problem in many areas of the countryside today. We have received many representations asking us to take firm and speedy action to enable the police to tackle these associated evils. That can only be done if the nature of the relevant offences is changed from that of trespassing to the activity of hare-coursing itself, which is a clear provision of the Bill. There can be no justification for delaying further in giving the police the powers they need to crack down on the criminals involved. So the offences in the Bill banning hare coursing events should continue to come into force three months after the Bill is passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/9">The Government have condemned threats of illegal action by some supporters of hunting and believe that most people involved are law-abiding people who are prepared to respect the will of Parliament. Extra time for implementation will make it even clearer that illegal actions and threats or intimidation are totally unjustified. If people wish to continue their opposition to legislation, they have the option of the ballot box through which to express their views.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/10">Animal welfare is also a major consideration for the Government&mdash;in terms of dogs and horses as well as the wild animals which are hunted. Dogs used for hunting are normally shot when they are no longer needed but the extra time for implementation will mean that there is even less reason for any suffering to be caused to them because of the ban. The RSPCA has offered to help with re-homing hounds&mdash;an offer for which the Government are very grateful&mdash;based on its experience of re-homing a considerable number of greyhounds each year. Drag-hunting offers alternative activities for those who have to give up hunting. And the horse industry in this country is buoyant, with increasing activity in a variety of leisure and sporting activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/11">As has consistently been the case, all noble Lords on this side of the House will have a free vote on the Hunting Bill. While this legislation is not a government priority, it is an issue on which noble Lords and Members of the House of Commons have expressed strong and consistent views over many years.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.0/1">The department has had a number of discussions with the lead authorities throughout the development and assessment of the Metrolink extensions. As part of this process, the department considered information on the expected economic and regeneration impacts submitted by Greater Manchester passenger transport executive (GMPTE). Any discussions with other local districts and the business community will have been for GMPTE to undertake, as the promoter of the scheme. The decision to withdraw funding approval for the extensions was taken because of another significant increase in costs. Costs had almost doubled since the scheme was first approved, despite the scope having been reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.0/2">The department will work closely with the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive on developing alternative proposals. These will be considered on the basis of their value for money, including their wider benefits, such as employment and other economic impacts, and affordability.</p>
