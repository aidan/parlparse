However, this is not the only source for agricultural workers. Migrants from a number of other routes, such as working holidaymakers and dependants of workers, are free to work in the UK. For example, 284,000 students, who are able to work for 20 hours a week in term-time and full time in holidays, came to the UK in 2005. The horticultural industry is also able to recruit workers from all over Europe, including Poland and the other seven states that acceded to the EU in 2004. From July 2004 to March 2007, 23,970 workers who registered with the worker registration scheme, required of workers from the 2004 accession states, registered as being employed in farm worker/farm hand occupations; over that same period, 62,900 workers in all registered to work in agriculture.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.11/1">The relevant change in legislation introduced by Section 58 of the Children Act 2004 was debated thoroughly in both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.11/2">The Director of Public Prosecutions has issued strengthened guidance to Crown prosecutors on cases of assault. The guidance now includes the concept of disparity between the parties as an aggravating factor. This means that, where an adult assaults a child, this will often be prosecuted as assault occasioning actual bodily harm, even though the same act against an adult would have been prosecuted as common assault. The &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; defence is not available for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>

The review is due to report in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/1">Recital 11 of Council Directive 2004/113/EC states that &quot;services&quot; should be taken to be those within the meaning of Article 50 of the EC treaty, which refers to them as services normally provided for remuneration or related to activities of a commercial or industrial nature or provided by craftsmen or professionals. We consider the types of services generally provided at a place occupied or used for the purposes of organised religion, for example churches, mosques and synagogues, do not fall within Article 50 because they will generally relate to religious observance and practice; for example, communal worship and religious teaching. Recital 3 of the directive gives further guidance in making clear that, while prohibiting discrimination, it is important to respect other fundamental rights and freedoms including freedom of religion. We therefore consider these matters to be outside the scope of the directive and have sought to make this clear in the draft regulations on which we are consulting.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/2">It should, however, be noted that our proposals for implementing the directive&mdash;such as introducing the directive-based definition of indirect sex discrimination and extending protection from direct discrimination on grounds of gender reassignment&mdash;will apply to organisations that provide goods, facilities, services or premises to the public, including any that may do so in a way that reflects the tenets of a particular faith or belief, and to religious organisations, such as churches, where the service or facility is provided to the public but the nature of the service is not directly related to religious observance or worship. Generally it will be unlawful for such organisations to discriminate against a person because of their sex or on grounds of gender reassignment. Limited exceptions to this will be, for example, where voluntary bodies or charitable organisations confer benefits on one sex only and to do so is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">The Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation, the food supplements directive and the medicines directive remove barriers to the free movement of goods within the European Union (EU) by regulating content, sale and labelling of products. Jersey and Guernsey are not part of the EU; instead, they have a relationship with the EU provided by Protocol 3 of the United Kingdom's (UK) treatyof accession to the European Community. Discussions on exactly how the requirements of these directives apply to the Channel Islands are continuing between the UK and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">The Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey have not said when they will review current legislation or introduce new legislation to implement the requirements of the directives and the regulation. If the island Governments agree that the directives and regulation apply to them, the dates for implementation set within the original EU legislation would apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">The Ministry of Justice is supporting the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in their communications with the Channel Islands over these directives, and has had correspondence with the chief executive of Guernsey on this issue. The MHRA and its lawyers will give advice and assistance as requested by the Bailiwicks to implement medicines directives.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">The Lord Chancellor met the Chief Minister of Guernsey on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-24">24 April</phrase> this year. Many issues were discussed, including the UK's view on both the medicines directive and the food supplements directive. The Lord Chancellor last met the Chief Minister of Jersey at a dinner he hosted on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>. The opportunity to discuss these directives did not arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/5">The FSA, MHRA and Ministry of Justice have met the Health Food Manufacturers' Association to discuss issues relating to the trade in food supplements and unlicensed medicinal products via the Channel Islands. Further information has been requested to assist in discussions with the island Governments. There are no plans to invite the Governments of Guernsey and Jersey to a meeting with the Health Food Manufacturers' Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/6">A copy of the MHRA's response to the consultation by the Bailiwick of Guernsey on its draft medicines legislation will be placed in the Library. The MHRA, in its response, said that the proposed legislation did not implement the medicines directive; it offered assistance to the Bailiwick of Guernsey in implementing the directive and asked for the Bailiwick's proposed timescale.</p>

No attempt has been made to date to quantify these costs. If such collections are to be valued, they will require quinquennial revaluations in line with accounting standards.

If an animal agent was identified, that would also need to be licensed for release under Section 16 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. A group of independent experts would be appointed to critically evaluate the research findings and data before any decision was made on seeking authority to release.</p>

These provisions make it an offence to plant, or cause this species to grow, in the wild.

	<p pid="a.109.8/1">There are a number of national programmes in place in relation to specific training undertaken by police officers to identify people with learning difficulties and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/2">Probationers during their initial police learning and development programme (IPLDP) are taught specific modules covering this area. These include, by way of illustration, interviewing victims and witnesses who have learning difficulties or disability issues. This training is applied contextually via case studies throughout. As well as having its own specifically developed modules, the IPLDP is structured in such a way that it links to other resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/3">An example of this is the requirement for all student officers to complete the e-learning element of the police race and diversity learning and development programme (PRDLDP) module relating to disability. It takes approximately two days to cover these modules.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/4">The PRDLDP is a major programme aimed at improving police performance in race and diversity. It applies to all police officers, staff and the wider police family. The programme, through force-based diversity training and a new and comprehensive range of e-learning materials, will ensure that every member of the police service can achieve the relevant national occupational standards (NOS) relating to fostering and promoting race and diversity. It identifies six key strands of diversity, including one which focuses specifically upon &quot;Disability and the Police&quot;. This module of PRDLDP is entirely dedicated to police learning relating to disability. The training programme is contextualised to reflect different situations to ensure the programme and the accompanying learning materials are relevant both to individual roles and to the needs of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/5">NPIA Design and Development is about to release the safer detention programme for custody officers, which strongly links to IPLDP. The safer detention programme has a number of references to learning difficulties and disabilities, which are in four modules lasting a total of two days and three hours. In addition, individual forces will augment this training depending on local needs and particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/6">The training of probation and prison officers is a matter for the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/7">The training for probation officers lasts two years. During this training, diversity is a consistent theme, and both academic emphasis and practical experience are focused on identifying all barriers to progression while in contact with the service. These would include any issues around learning difficulties and disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/8">No specific training is given to prison officers in identifying people with learning difficulties but, under Prison Service Order 2855, governors must ensure that procedures exist for prisoners to be able to disclose disability, including learning disabilities, both on reception and subsequently. Each prison must have a disability liaison officer to ensure that disabled prisoners' needs are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.0/1">The Government's first priority for pensioners was to tackle the number of pensioners living in poverty. We have made considerable progress; since 1997, the number of pensioners living in relative poverty has fallen by 1.1 million, from 2.9 million to1.8 million. Now, for the first time in a period of sustained growth, once housing costs are accounted for, a pensioner is no more likely to be in poverty than anyone else in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/2">Minimum income guarantee, pension credit, winter fuel payments and a 7 per cent real-terms increase in the value of the basic state pension have all contributed to improving pensioner incomes. Pension credit means that no pensioner has to get by on less than &pound;119.05 a week, or &pound;181.70 for couples.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/3">But we are not complacent; we realise that there is more to do to ensure that pensioners get the money they are entitled to and to strengthen state pensions as a foundation for private saving. The Pensions Bill, which we are currently taking through Parliament, will make state pensions more universal and more generous and will enshrine our commitment to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee in line with earnings growth in primary legislation. These reforms will be complemented by our proposed new system of personal accounts, which are intended to extend the benefits of low-cost savings to those without access to a good occupational pension.</p>

Network Rail plans to upgrade the line in October 2009 to enable an hourly Exeter-London Waterloo service to operate in December 2009.
