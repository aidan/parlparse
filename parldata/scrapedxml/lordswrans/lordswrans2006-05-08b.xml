	<p pid="b.112.0/1">The national bowel cancer screening programme will be rolled out nationally over the next three years. Funding for the first year of the screening programme is being transferred to the national cancer screening team in Sheffield, and Wolverhampton will be the first local screening centre.</p>

	<p pid="b.112.0/3">NHS cancer screening programmes are taking all the necessary action to ensure successful rollout of the programme, including the procurement of testing kits. The kit supplier has been notified that the first order is for 100,000 kits.</p>

	<p pid="b.112.0/6">The number of people actually tested will depend on the numbers who choose to take up the invitation. Based on the pilot, we are anticipating a response rate of around 60 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.118.5/1">Paragraph 23 of the Dental Auxiliaries Regulations 1986 prescribes that a dental hygienist shall not be permitted to scale teeth,</p>

	<p pid="b.118.5/3">The Dentists Act 1984 (Amendment Order) 2005 empowers the General Dental Council (GDC) to make rules on the supervision of dental work which will replace these regulations. At its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-07">7 December 2005</phrase>, the GDC agreed that the rules should provide wider scope for treatments by dental care professionals such as dental hygienists and dental therapists. The GDC has agreed that a dentist should carry out a full mouth assessment and provide a treatment plan specifying the intervals at which the patient should attend for further examination or treatment. Pending the reassessment, the patient could take the treatment plan to any appropriately registered dental professional who could, within the overall limits of the plan and the limits of his or her competence, treat the patient. The GDC has also indicated that it would welcome proposals to expand the curricula of dental care professionals to enable increased direct access by patients to dental care professionals, where there is robust training to ensure that patient safety is protected.</p>
