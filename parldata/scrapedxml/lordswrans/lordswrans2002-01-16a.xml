	<p pid="a.154.8/1">By the end of January immigration detainees held in local prisons will, if their detention is to continue, be transferred to immigration removal centres. This has been made possible by the opening of three new removal centres at Harmondsworth, near Heathrow, Dungavel in Lanarkshire, and at Yarlswood in Bedfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.8/2">Additionally, immigration detainees are held in two dedicated prison establishments: a unit in Her Majesty's Prison Lindholme, near Doncaster; and Her Majesty's Prison Haslar. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is taking steps to establish these as immigration removal centres under the control of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office as from February. Detainees in these establishments will be subject to Detention Centre Rules, rather than the Prison Rules as at present. It may take some time before the facilities in the new centres match those of other removal centres, but that is our intention.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.8/3">Asylum seekers are also detained in two wings of Her Majesty's Prison Rochester. These detainees will be transferred to other immigration removal centres by the end of January. A new removal centre will be established at Her Majesty's Prison Dover in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.8/4">It will always remain necessary to hold small numbers of immigration detainees including asylum seekers in prisons for reasons of security, or who are awaiting deportation on conclusion of a prison sentence. Any asylum seeker who is held on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence, or is serving a custodial sentence will also be held in prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.5/1">The office of the Deputy Prime Minister in the Cabinet Office is headed by the Deputy Prime Minister. He is supported by a Minister of State (Mrs Barbara Roche MP), by a Parliamentary Secretary (Mr Christopher Leslie MP), and by myself for business in the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/2">As First Secretary of State, the Deputy Prime Minister continues to deputise for the Prime Minister as required, drawing on the resources of other parts of the Cabinet Office as necessary. He oversees the work of the Social Exclusion Unit, which reports to the Prime Minister through him. He is also responsible for the Regional Co-ordination Unit and the nine Government Offices for the Regions. The Prime Minister has also asked him to be responsible for a White Paper on regional governance, in close liaison with my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and in co-operation with other Cabinet colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/3">On international matters, the Deputy Prime Minister supports the Prime Minister. He continues to play a role in international climate change discussions and negotiations on behalf of the Prime Minister. More recently, the Prime Minister has also asked the Deputy Prime Minister to take on a similar role in preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) to be held in Johannesburg in September 2002. In addition he sees visiting dignitaries and undertakes overseas visits on behalf of the Prime Minister; and oversees the work of the International Public Service Group. He also carries ministerial responsibility for the British-Irish Council and will deputise as necessary for the Prime Minister at meetings of the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/4">The Deputy Prime Minister chairs Cabinet committees on domestic affairs and on the nations and regions; and sub-committees on social exclusion and regeneration and on energy policy. He also chairs the newly established Ministerial Group (MISC18) on WSSD and continues to chair the Committee on the Environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/5">The Minister of State in the Deputy Prime Minister's Office supports the Deputy Prime Minister across the full range of his duties. In particular, the Minister oversees the work of the Regional Co-ordination Unit and the Government Offices for the Regions, reporting to the Deputy Prime Minister on the development of their role and on the work of the regional network of the COI. The Minister leads on projects arising out of the work of the Social Exclusion Unit, is responsible for the work of the Business Co-ordination Unit, and acts as sponsor Minister for a number of PIU projects. She is also a member of a number of Cabinet committees, including those on the regions and social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/6">In addition, the Minister of State in the Deputy Prime Minister's office is Minister for Women. She co-ordinates equality issues across Whitehall as Chair of the Cabinet sub-committee on equality and has responsibility for the implementation of Article 13 (reporting to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry) and co-ordination of cross-cutting equality issues (on behalf of the three lead equality Ministers). She also reports to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry as the Cabinet Minister for Women on the day-to-day oversight of the Women and Equality Unit and sponsorship of the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Women's National Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/7">The Parliamentary Secretary supports the Minister of State and the Deputy Prime Minister across the range of their duties. He is also the Minister answerable in the Commons for the business I deal with and for day-to-day decisions on the Civil Service under the Prime Minister as Minister for the Civil Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/8">As Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, I report direct to the Prime Minister. I also work closely with the Deputy Prime Minister as appropriate on related cross-cutting issues covered by the Cabinet committees under his chairmanship.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">The analysis makes many assumptions and is a simplistic association between a rising incidence of breast cancer and the use of induced abortion but the analysis does not show this relationship to be causal. The potential link between induced abortion and subsequent breast cancer requires a more sophisticated study that would consider the effect of other risk factors and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund report will provide this.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-01-16a.163.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="163"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020116/text/20116w03.htm#20116w03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.163.2/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Environment (Mr Michael Meacher) represented the UK at the Environment Council held in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-12">12 December 2001</phrase>. This was the final Environment Council of the Belgian Presidency. Council reached political agreement on two common positions, with the UK voting in favour of both. Council agreed conclusions on a wide-ranging set of topics: sustainable development, international environmental governance, a review of the Pesticides Authorisation Directive (91/414 EC), a Commission communication on the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme and a communication on a strategy for dioxins, furans and PCBs. There was a policy debate on a proposed directive setting up an EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/2">There were four items on the agenda under the heading of climate change. Council heard a report back on the successful outcome of the Seventh Conference of the Parties (COP7) in Marrakech, which took place between <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-29">29 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-10">10 November</phrase>. The importance of member states now pressing ahead with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol was stressed. Council also heard a Presidency progress report on a decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Once the decision is agreed, individual member states and the EU will be able to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the expectation being that they will do so before the World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/3">Council conclusions were also agreed on the implementation of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP), a package of common and co-ordinated policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that has been prepared in discussion with member states and stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/4">During an orientation debate on a proposed EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme, all member states expressed support for the establishment of such a scheme. Member states were split on whether the initial phase should have voluntary or mandatory participation. There was broad agreement, however, that credits should be allocated free of charge during the initial phase, and there was also broad support for starting with carbon dioxide alone, with a view to extending the scheme to other greenhouse gases in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/5">Political agreement on a common position was agreed on a proposed directive to bring Community rules into line with the second pillar of the Aarhus Convention dealing with public consultation in environmental decision-making. The Council endorsed European Parliament amendments aiming to improve information to the public about decisions taken, and to enhance the use of electronic media. The Commission wanted the proposal to apply to updating of all permits, including very minor changes. The common position will only apply in such cases likely to give rise to significant environmental effects. The Commission reserved its position to return to the issue at second reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/6">Council reached political agreement on a proposal to introduce sulphur-free (&lt;10ppm) petrol and diesel in every member state from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> alongside existing fuels. Council agreed that from <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase> the use of this fuel should be mandatory. The proposal will mean lower exhaust emissions and will facilitate improvements in fuel economy in the future. The UK achieved its key objective of ensuring that the agreement would not impose fuel quality restrictions of fuel (diesel) used by non-road mobile machines (NRMMs) in advance of a full Commission review of the costs and benefits of such a measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/7">Council agreed conclusions in response to the Commission's communication on a strategy for dioxins, furans and polychlorinated biphenyls. The strategy proposes a number of actions aimed at preventing the formation and release of these substances; further identification of sources; establishment of indicators; and faster, cheaper measurement methods. Council broadly welcomed the Commission's approach, and asked for it to consider a number of options, including the setting of limit values for emissions under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, improved measurement methods, and possible instruments for the control of non-industrial sources of emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/8">Council heard a brief Presidency progress report on the proposed regulation on traceability and labelling of GMOs. Some provisional agreement had been reached on parts of the text, although issues such as the scope, and the treatment of derived products, need further work. The UK supports the need for an effective traceability and labelling system to deliver reliable information and dependable consumer choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/9">Council conclusions on the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS) clarified the role of Environment Council and its complementarity to other Council formations and the GAC's general co-ordinating role; offered views on the four priorities identified by the Gothenburg European Council and promoted the development of an external dimension to the EU SDS. Council asked the Permanent Representatives to report back on how to improve arrangements for co-ordinating work on sustainable development. On global environmental governance, Council agreed conclusions underlining the need to strengthen international environmental structures, as part of the preparations for, and follow up to, the World Summit on Sustainable Development. They referred to the need to strengthen the financial situation of UNEP, including a call for countries to step up their efforts to contribute at the level of the UN assessed rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/10">Conclusions on the Commission's evaluation of the Pesticides Authorisation Directive (91/414 EC) broadly supported the Commission's approach. Council recognised that the review of existing active substances could not be completed within the current timetable of end of 2003. It therefore extended the period for the review to the end of 2008 but to only the end of 2005 for higher priority susbtances. Council also called on the Commission to cover a number of detailed issues in further work in this area including the proposed revision of the directive and a thematic strategy on pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/11">The Commission presented a proposal for the revision of Directive 96/82 (Seveso II), and a proposal for the revision of recovery and recycling targets in the directive on packaging and packaging waste. The Commission also gave progress reports on proposed directives on an EU chemicals strategy, recycling of batteries and accumulators and air quality limits for heavy metals in ambient air. The UK drew member states' attention to the problems for air quality posed by rising background levels of ozone precursors, and asked the Commissioner to consider what action was necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/12">Council also heard progress reports on a thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides and on the revision of Regulation 2455/92 (trade in certain dangerous chemicals) which is necessary to enable the EC to become a party to the Rotterdam Convention. There were also progress reports on the ratification of the Rotterdam Convention and the IMO Convention on TBT, and on Community implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Commission also briefed Council on the progress of accession negotiations on the environment with the candidate countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/13">Over lunch Ministers held a discussion on global environmental governance and the outcome of the recent WTO negotiations in Doha. Ministers agreed to press heads of government to attend the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, and to include a commitment to that effect in the Laeken European Council conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.0/1">There are no plans as at this stage to introduce policy guidelines on the loan of items from government-sponsored museums. This is a matter for the trustees of those museums with reference to their governing legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/2">The length of the proposed loan of individual objects, amounting to less than 1 per cent of the Royal Armouries entire collection, to the Owlsley Brown Frazier Historical Arms Museum in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, has yet to be determined. The terms and conditions of such a loan will be in line with the armouries' current loans policy and, as with other loans currently made by the armouries, will be monitored and reviewed regularly. The Royal Armouries' intention is that the planned loan will be on a strict cost recovery basis. However, the armouries will seek to use its presence in the United States to enhance its academic status and generate fundraising revenue at no expense to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/3">It is for the trustees of the Royal Armouries to determine which objects to lend from their collections in accordance with section 21 of the National Heritage Act 1983, and what terms and conditions to attach to such a loan.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.0/1">Historic vessels still afloat are not covered by the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 or any other statutory controls, therefore a review of their presentation will not be included in the proposed review of marine archaeology legislation. However, following the important work done by the National Historic Ships Committee in producing its core collection and designated vessel lists, which have provided an invaluable guide to this aspect of our maritime heritage, we are currently considering a policy for the preservation of historic ships.</p>
