	<p pid="b.204.2/1">The Government set out proposals to address the falling numbers of students studying A-level mathematics in their response to Professor Adrian Smith's inquiry into post-14 mathematics education.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.2/2">Revised A-level mathematics specifications were introduced in September 2004 to deal with concerns that the content of the AS specification was too great to be mastered in the first year of study. The content is now spread over four AS units rather than three. There is no change to the A-level standard and the revisions were widely welcomed by the maths community. These changes should encourage more young people to study A-level mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.2/3">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority are undertaking research to analyse the patterns of young people studying A-levels but not taking A-level mathematics. This will help to inform the development of longer-term provision.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.2/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the noble Lord in response to these Questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government two parliamentary Questions in relation to what action is being taken to ensure that the sewerage and roads infrastructure in the maritime area of Carrickfergus is brought up to departmental standards for adoption, and what is the value of development bonds retained by the Department for Regional Development with regard to the maritime area in Carrickfergus. I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/4">I should explain that the responsibility for bringing development roads to adoption standard rests with developers. When development roads and sewers are properly constructed to the department's standards, Roads Service will complete the adoption promptly.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/5">There are approximately 1,500 metres of development roads within the maritime area of which around 300 metres of the road known as Rodgers Quay was adopted in November 2000. The remaining roads have been constructed, but adoption has been delayed because of problems with the adoptable sewers within the Morrison Homes developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/6">Colleagues in Water Service have advised that the adoption for the sewage, pumping station adjacent to the Windrose public house will be issued as soon as the developer has submitted essential associated documentation.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/7">In those areas where adoption is not yet completed, I understand that Water Service is liaising closely with developers to ensure that the sewers and pumping stations are brought up to adoption standards as quickly as possible. However, the one exception to this is the storm sewers serving Rodgers Quay, which are to remain private. The sewage pumping station at Swifts Quay, which was constructed in the early 1990s by Carrickfergus Borough Council, is not currently adopted. Water Service is presently in discussion with the Department of Social Development, which is now responsible for the station, about its possible upgrading to adoption standard. I can further advise that no application has been received for the adoption of the sewers serving the commercial development fronting onto the Marine Highway and the infrastructure will, therefore, remain the responsibility of the property owners.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/8">I have been assured that Water Service will advise us when the outstanding preliminary certificates of adoption have been issued so that we can proceed with roads adoption procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/9">You also asked the value of development bonds retained by the department regarding the maritime area in Carrickfergus. I am advised that the original total value of bonds for adoptable roads and sewers in the maritime area was &pound;478,938. Bond reductions to the value of &pound;155,900 have been released in respect of an area adopted in November 2000 and the preliminary certificate issued to Lynwood Homes. Bonds to the value of &pound;323,038 are, therefore, presently retained for the adoptable roads and sewers within the maritime area.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/10">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.2/1">Between April 2000 and March 2006, the Government have made &pound;5.35 million available to support child contact centres, both supported and supervised, and to their representative organisations. This sum includes &pound;2.9 million allocated under the 2002 spending review to: develop 14 new supervised centres; support one already existing supervised centre; and to provide sustainability funding to 36 existing supported and supervised centres that are members of NACCC.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.2/2">From within the &pound;2.9 million sum, approximately &pound;287,000 has been allocated to the premises costs for the 14 new and one existing supervised centres. In addition, from within this sum approximately &pound;130,000 has been allocated to the premises costs of the 36 NACCC centres who received funding through the sustainability fund. It is not possible to disaggregate the figure of &pound;130,000 to show the exact amount allocated between supervised and supported centres, in part because a number of centres offer both types of service.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.2/3">The sum of &pound;5.35 million also includes &pound;0.5 million that has been made available for training and consultancy services to the 14 new supervised centres and the one already existing centre developed under the 2002 spending review. This sum of &pound;0.5 million enables the provision of training to all centres that are members of NACCC and which are seeking to become accredited under the accreditation programme run by NACCC. It is not possible to disaggregate this figure to show the exact amount allocated between supervised and supported centres, in part because a number of centres offer both types of service.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.2/4">The remainder of the &pound;5.35 million sum totals &pound;1.95 million. &pound;100,000 of this has been allocated to NACCC for administering the 2002 spending review funds to individual centres. The remaining &pound;1.85 million has provided individual grants totalling &pound;800,000 to supervised and supported centres; enabled NACCC, Welcare, NCH and Coram to develop models of child contact (&pound;900,000); and evaluate, through an ISB project, child contact centre partnership working in three areas (&pound;150,000).</p>
	<p pid="b.206.2/5">Exact expenditure figures on buildings and premises and across the whole of the 2002 spending review period will not be known until after the allocation period has ended, in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.2/6">More recently, under the 2004 spending review, &pound;3 million is to be made available in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;4.5 million in 2007&ndash;08 for services in support of child contact, including child contact centres. In the White Paper, <i>Parental Separation: Children's Needs and Parents' Responsibilities, Next Steps</i>, published in January 2005, the Government announced plans to look at ways in which contact centres can be used more widely to help parents and children following separation. Contact centres should not be seen solely as places where actual content takes place, but also as a base for outreach services, which can support parents and children beyond any formal period of court-mandated contact. Furthermore, the Government are exploring options to ensure that services to support child contact are easily accessible to parents and children. Contact centres will be one of those options, while others include extended schools and children's centres, which may also be able to provide services such as advice for parents, family mediation and parenting education support.</p>

	<p pid="b.208.5/1">There are currently 17 academies open. They are in high-cost, inner-city sites, have a roll average of 1,305 and have cost on average &pound;26 million each to build. A 1,500 place secondary school in a moderate area costs around &pound;20 million, in a high-cost area &pound;32 million. The best comparison to an academy is a 1,300 place secondary school in a high-cost area which would cost around &pound;28 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.5/2">Capital cost figures for new schools can vary considerably, depending on factors such as location, the prevailing site, market conditions and whether it is new build or refurbishment. In particular, the inner-city nature of most academy sites often adds significantly to their costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.5/3">A further 10 academies are opening in September this year; there are an additional 37 academy projects in implementation; and many more in early planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.5/4">Private sponsors provide a contribution of up to 10 per cent. of the capital cost of a new academy, up to a ceiling of &pound;2 million. For the 17 academies currently open, the ratio of the sponsors' contribution to the overall cost of the project is shown in the following table.</p>

Funds are allocated on the basis of the criteria governing each grant stream, and the availability of funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.2/1">Arrangements already exist to validate and quality assure the 11-plus transfer tests and the development of the pupil profile and therefore the Government have not adopted the standards of the American Educational Research Association or the American Psychological Association.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.2/2">The 11-plus transfer tests are conducted by the Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) on behalf of the Department of Education. CCEA commission an external agency to develop the tests which undergo extensive and rigorous testing and analysis to ensure their validity in terms of the elements of the subjects specified for the tests, that they reflect the relevant programmes of study and that the standard is consistent from year to year. In addition a series of reliability measures are used to ensure internal consistency of the tests. The agency is recognised internationally for its expertise in test development and its staff adhere to a code of practice governing all aspects of test development. CCEA also employs a number of additional quality assurance procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.2/3">The pupil profile currently being developed will provide a range of useful information on each child's progress, aptitudes, interests and aspirations. It will be based on well-supported teacher assessment rather than a regime of annual testing. CCEA has been developing and trialling the pupil profile over the last two years to ensure that it is robust, manageable and useful for parents, pupils and teachers. Details of the evaluation of the trials to date will shortly be published on the CCEA website. Development work will continue in 2005&ndash;06. CCEA will ensure that the pupil profile will meet standards of validity and reliability by bench-marking them against the Assessment Reform Group's principles for effective teacher assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.2/4">The pupil profile is not an alternative to the 11-plus transfer tests: Its purpose is to provide a holistic picture of a pupil's progress, aptitudes, interests and aspirations that will help to inform choices throughout a pupil's education. It will also help parents to make informed choices about the post-primary school which best meets their child's educational needs, supported by other information available from the primary and post-primary schools. The pupil profile will not be used to determine a rank ordering of pupils for use by schools to determine which pupils to admit. Where schools are over-subscribed, admissions criteria will be used by schools to determine which pupils are admitted.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.2/5">Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-26">26 January 2004</phrase> that the last transfer tests will be held in autumn 2008. Detail of the new arrangements will be announced after the responses to the recent consultation have been analysed.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.4/2" qnum="HL982">What training in the adjudication of Form 11/1 (notice of intention to organise a public procession) had been undertaken by those Northern Ireland police officers who adjudicated on forms in respect of Loyal Orange Lodge 710 and Loyal Orange Lodge 1974; and whether these officers had access to any legal opinion on the issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.5/1">Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Officers do not adjudicate upon applications to parade made via Form 11/1. Indeed, PSNI Officers do not make any adjudications in relation to parades whatsoever. Therefore, the issue of whether or not they are in receipt of a legal opinion is irrelevant to the parades referred to in this Parliamentary Question.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.5/2">The function of the police in respect of form 11/ls is to receive them from parades organisers; they are then passed to the Parades Commission which considers them and issues a determination, if the form contains the necessary information to allow it to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.5/3">If the Parades Commission decides there is insufficient information on a form for them to make a determination, then organising or participating in the parade which was notified to the commission via the defective form becomes illegal, and the police will investigate potential offences with a view to forwarding a file for consideration by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) where appropriate. Decisions on whether to prosecute each individual case are taken by the PPS.</p>

Although they have generally been superseded by EC Social Security Regulations which provide for uprating of state pensions for European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss nationals moving between the UK and other member countries, the UK also has reciprocal agreements which provide for uprating of state pensions with the following countries: Austria; Belgium; Cyprus; Finland; France; Germany; Gibraltar; Iceland; Ireland; Italy; Luxembourg; Malta; the Netherlands; Norway; Portugal; Slovenia; Spain; Sweden and Switzerland.</p>

	<p pid="b.236.2/1">We have made substantial progress in the eight years since 1997 in achieving an equitable system of admissions across both the primary and secondary sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.2/2">We do not support selective education. However, where selection exists, we believe it is for local parents to decide whether or not it is removed; and the grammar school ballot process allows parents to decide if selection should be removed.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.2/3">We have also legislated in order to simplify the admissions process and to make the system fairer for parents and children. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.236.2/4" class="indent">issuing codes of practice for admissions and admission appeals. These give clear guidance on acceptable practices to admission authorities and to schools;</p>
	<p pid="b.236.2/5" class="indent">giving local authorities and other schools the right to object to any admission arrangements and parents the right to object to some admission arrangements, including some forms of selection in place before 1997; and</p>
	<p pid="b.236.2/6" class="indent">introducing co-ordinated admissions to secondary schools (for 2005) and to primary schools (for 2006). This system has had a significant impact in improving parents' chances of obtaining a preferred school, as parents can no longer hold more than one offer of a school place within their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.2/7">However, the key to a fair system does not rest with admission arrangements alone but in driving up standards across the broad range of schools so that all parents have access to good quality education. Nationally, the Government have implemented a range of improvement programmes, including literacy and numeracy strategies, creating academies and developing specialist schools, all of which contribute to raising standards across a broad range of schools. We also have a programme of providing capital funding for those good and popular schools who wish to expand to do so, thereby providing more places for children at good schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.5/1">The main interpretative reference to a timescale is in the Interpretation Act 1978. This provides that (subject to the provisions of the Summer Time Act 1972) whenever an expression of time occurs in an Act, or in subordinate legislation, or deeds or other instruments and documents, the time referred to shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be held to be Greenwich mean time.

	<p pid="b.238.5/1">We consider each case on its merits and it is part of our normal process to consider any new information or representations prior to removal of anyone from the United Kingdom. Given the general nature of the representations surrounding the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe we ensure that every case involving a failed asylum seeker from Zimbabwe is looked at before removal in the light of current information, not just those who are the subject of representations.</p>
