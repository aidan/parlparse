	<p pid="a.177.5/1">Central government do not provide core funding for individual citizens advice bureaux. Each bureau is a separate registered charity operating independently, providing a service geared towards the needs of local people, and is therefore funded mainly by local authorities, with additional funding, often on a project basis, from charitable trusts, the Legal Services Commission (LSC), the Financial Inclusion Fund etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.5/2">It is, therefore, for local authorities to determine the structure and level of core funding they provide to individual bureaux that will best meet the needs of their local communities. While there may be specific requirements in certain locations for Polish-speaking advisers, it is for local authorities and their CABs to work together to determine need and some bureaux have engaged Polish-speaking volunteers. Central government do provide some further assistance. LSC contracts with bureaux include provision for interpreters, and the face-to-face debt programme, which the department funds, provides a language line translation service.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">The Government have put in place a series of reforms to tackle poverty and disadvantage faced by vulnerable groups. The Government's most recent announcements are set out below.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-13">13 May 2008</phrase>, the Chancellor announced further support for low- and middle-income families for 2008-09. For the current tax year, income tax personal allowances will be increased by &pound;600 for all taxpayers under 65. Around 22 million basic rate taxpayers will benefit from this change.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/3">This year, adults aged 60 and over will benefit from an additional payment of &pound;50, and those aged over 80 from an additional payment of &pound;100 to be paid alongside the winter fuel payment. In addition, extra help for the vulnerable this winter will be provided by an increase in cold weather payments, which will triple from &pound;8.50 to &pound;25 for this winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-17">17 July 2008</phrase>, the Chancellor announced a postponement of the 2p per litre increase in fuel duty that was planned to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase> to support families and businesses in the face of sharp rises in world oil prices. This means that main road fuel duty rates will remain at 50.35p per litre after <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October</phrase> this year. The duty is 17 per cent lower in real terms than in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September</phrase>, the Government announced a new &pound;1 billion package of energy efficiency measures, including at least 50 per cent off a range of energy saving measures for all households, with 11 million of the most vulnerable households qualifying for these free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-02">2 September</phrase>, the Government announced reforms to the support for mortgage interest (SMI) system&mdash;SMI is paid to people on income support, pension credit and income-based jobseeker's allowance to help to meet the interest payments on their mortgage&mdash;to more accurately reflect the value of people's property and reduce the waiting time before help from SMI is available. The Government will keep this system of support under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/7">Disabled people have access to a range of benefits in recognition of their extra support needs. The employment and support allowance offers financial help and personal support to disabled people who are out of work, and disability living allowance provides a contribution towards the extra costs arising from disability. The disability premium in income-related benefits is also paid in recognition that the least well-off disabled people need additional help.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.2/1">A full analysis of the way discrimination law is enforced in the courts and tribunals was undertaken as part of the discrimination law review. As a result, we are making a number of changes in the forthcoming Equality Bill, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.2/2">allowing employment tribunals to make wider recommendations in discrimination cases, which will benefit the wider workforce and help to prevent similar types of discrimination occurring in the future;transferring disability discrimination school education cases in Scotland (including education cases relating to admissions and exclusions) to the Additional Support Needs Tribunals for Scotland, and;making provision for the use of expert assessors to advise judges in court cases involving discrimination across all the protected grounds.</p>
