	<p pid="b.203.11/1">The new agreement does not vary significantly from the previous agreement. The key difference is that it has a Third-Pillar legal base rather than a First-Pillar one, in order to comply with the European Court of Justice ruling of <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-30">30 May</phrase>. Unlike a First-Pillar agreement, a Third-Pillar agreement requires domestic implementation measures, and this has been done through a direction under the Air Navigation Order requiring airlines to provide PNR data. At present, the US authorities pull information from airlines' reservation systems, but it is intended to move to a system in which airlines push data to the US as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.11/2">Like the 2004 agreement, the new agreement is due to expire in late 2007. The new agreement refers to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) instead of US Customs and Border Protection (which is part of the DHS) to reflect changes to the internal structure of the US Administration. However, the DHS is giving the same undertakings in support of the new agreement as the CBP gave in relation to the 2004 agreement. In a letter to the EU, the DHS has set out how it interprets those undertakings in the light of developments, including new US legislation, since 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.11/3">The changes to the agreement do not materially affect the level of data protection for individuals. Although the data protection directive does not apply to the processing of personal data in the Third Pillar, the new agreement reflects the same data protection principles as the old one.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.29/2">The National Trust and English Nature, as owners and managers respectively, recognised that extensive, low-intensity stock grazing was required to bring the site into favourable condition and to contribute to the Government's public service agreement target for SSSIs. Since 2000, extensive discussions have been held with all interested parties, including the Open Spaces Society and highway engineers, on how grazing can safely be re-established. The proposed cattle grids, the locations of which are supported by highways design consultants and county council highway engineers, are necessary to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.29/3">Despite this extensive consultation, some objections were sustained. Because the proposals include works on common land, the Secretary of State ordered a public inquiry, held before an independent inspector, which was held in August 2006. The decision is awaited.</p>

The plan sets out how these hazards are being removed or reduced, so that by 2033 all remaining radioactive wastes and materials will be in a passive condition that is safe for long-term storage or disposal. UKAEA is consulting the public about the condition of the site in 2033, and the outcome of this will determine the degree of ground remediation that needs to be undertaken.

	<p pid="b.203.50/1">Since the start of operations at Dounreay in the 1950s, the site has been authorised at various times to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous radioactivity to the environment. It has been a condition of these authorisations that the environmental impact is measured and reported. This has shown that the elevated levels of radioactivity found in the environment around Dounreay as a result of authorised disposals are well below the limits for public exposure to radioactivity. In addition, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency carries out its own monitoring, and the results are published annually in the <I>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment</I> series.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.50/2">It is now known that particulate in the form of fragments of irradiated nuclear fuel entered the liquid effluent disposal system at Dounreay and was discharged to sea. Seabed surveys have detected these fragments, or particles, in the sediment near the old discharge point. The action of the sea on the sediment is thought to transport the particles, which have been detected during routine monitoring of the beaches at Sandside and Dunnet and the foreshore at Dounreay. UKAEA, on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, is consulting on feasible options for remediation. The outcome of this consultation is expected to help identify environmentally acceptable methods of dealing with this issue. UKAEA believes it will not be practicable to retrieve all particles released from the site, but the offshore source should be substantially reduced. Any particles detected on local beaches as a result of regular inspections are removed.</p>

The study will undertake the necessary research to establish whether biological control is a feasible method for the long-term, sustainable management of Japanese knotweed in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.98/2">The research has looked at a wide range of possible agents from the home range of Japan and has so far been narrowed down to two potential host-specific agents&mdash;a fungus and an insect.

In Cornwall, a more proactive programme has been implemented by the agency in association with the Cornwall Knotweed Forum.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.107/1">The initial release of the electronic prescription service was developed to time and to budget in February 2005. It is being deployed in general practitioner practices and community pharmacies nationwide. In this phase of deployment, electronic messages run in parallel with the existing paper prescriptions and the changes from a patient perspective have been minimal. The only difference patients may notice is the addition of a barcode to their paper prescription. An information leaflet for patients has been produced and is available in GP practices and community pharmacies. Evidence to date suggests that patient inquires have been minimal.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.107/2">The next release of the service will commence deployment in 2007 and will bring the possibility of fully paperless prescriptions. In addition, patients will be able to nominate a particular dispenser where their (electronic) prescriptions will normally be sent. It is important to note that there is no element of compulsion associated with the nomination of a dispenser. Patients do not have to nominate and are free to revoke or change an existing nomination at any time. To maximise patient convenience, patients who choose to nominate will be able to nominate up to three types of dispensing contractor depending on their individual needs. These can include a dispensing practice, a community pharmacy and a dispensing appliance contractor.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.107/3">The communication campaign for the next release is being developed. It is intended that patients will be given full information on the process of nomination which will enable them to decide if (and who) they wish to nominate. It is anticipated that patients who regularly use the same dispenser now&mdash;such as a dispensing practice&mdash;will continue to do so in future if that is the most convenient option for them. They can do this with or without using the nomination facility.</p>

These regulations are aimed at achieving a satisfactory standard of life safety, including in situations where a fire breaks out. They do not require the installation of sprinklers in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.119/2">My department issues guidance on fire safety in schools. Our current guide, Managing School Facilities Guide 6, <I>Fire Safety</I>, published in 2000, includes advice on sprinklers (<a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/fire">www.teachernet.gov.uk/fire</a>). We include further information on sprinklers in our new guide, Building Bulletin 100 (BB 100)<I>, Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools</I>. This sets out how to achieve a satisfactory standard of life safety, and therefore how to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations, and suggests ways of improving property protection. BB 100 is still in draft form and is being revised following public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.203.119/3">One of the messages that came back from that exercise was the need for the department to issue more detailed guidance on the use of sprinklers in schools, over and above what was already in BB 100. Consequently we commissioned further studies to be carried out. Work on these is nearing completion and additional guidance on sprinklers will be incorporated in the final version of BB100. We expect to publish this early in 2007.</p>
