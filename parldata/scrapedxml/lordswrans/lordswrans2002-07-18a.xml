	<p pid="a.167.2/1">I have been advised by the Acting Chief Constable that although there were proposals for the closure of Carryduff earlier this year, these plans were repealed following the conclusion of a public consultation exercise. As such, there are now no current plans to close Carryduff station or to decrease the number of officers serving Castlereagh District Command Unit, which covers the Carryduff area. The Government remain committed to providing the necessary resources to ensure that the police service operates effectively, however, the future of policing in Carryduff is an operational matter and as such is the responsibility of the Chief Constable in consultation with the Policing Board.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.5/1">The primary duty of the police officers on duty in Old Palace Yard and at Carriage Gates in New Palace Yard is to ensure that entrances to the Palace are kept secure. In addition, officers on duty at Carriage Gates are instructed to assist Members of the House of Commons to cross Bridge Street when Divisions are held in that House. This is because the lights at the junction of Bridge Street and Parliament Street are traffic controlled, and pedestrians may have to wait for well over a minute to cross the road safely. The risk of accidents is correspondingly heightened. In contrast, the Abingdon Street crossing in Old Palace Yard is pedestrian controlled, and waiting times are no more than 15 to 30 seconds. When the existing dog-leg is replaced in the autumn, the crossing will be significantly safer and less time-consuming. I will also undertake to discuss with the police what further assistance can be given to Members.</p>

A National Implementation Support Team has been established to help local National Health Service and social services organisations through the transition from separate to integrated services, encouraging and supporting them to make appropriate investment in equipment services to meet the NHS Plan targets. Team members report that good progress is being made in some areas; &pound;30.75 million has been invested in modernisation of hearing aid services. Almost one-third of the country will be covered by digital sites by March 2003. Initial evaluation of the pilot study showed significant benefits for people provided with digital hearing aids as part of a modernised service.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">Officials had the necessary powers of entry to carry out a compulsory vaccination programme during the 2001 outbreak under Section 16 of the Animal Health Act 1981. This section gives powers to vaccinate and enter a premises for the purpose of vaccination with respect of animals which (a) have been in contact with a diseased animal (b) appear to Ministers to be or to have been in any way exposed to the infection of disease or (c) are in an infected area. For this purpose the whole of Great Britain was considered an infected area as it had been declared a controlled area.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/2">The Government have sought to enhance these powers of entry to premises through provisions in the Animal Health Bill. Currently, if a farmer refused to allow his animals to be vaccinated he could be subject to a court injunction which would potentially delay vaccination to the point of rendering the vaccination programme ineffective. The new powers in the Bill would enable inspectors to seek a magistrate's warrant granting entry to premises for vaccination purposes. This more rapid procedure would be subject to certain conditions provided in the Bill being met.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.3/1">The Bank of England suspended issuance of the new ''Elizabeth Fry'' &pound;5 note after it was discovered that, on some notes, it was possible to remove part or all of the serial numbers, when the note was rubbed vigorously. The problem was traced to unexpectedly slow drying of the numbering ink on some of the notes, when the numbers were printed over the new varnish coating. This varnish had been introduced to make the note more durable. In future the Bank will put the varnish over the numbering, as tests have shown that this solves the problem. The notes already printed will undergo extensive drying treatment to ensure that the numbering ink dries thoroughly.</p>
