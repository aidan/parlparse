The scheme aims to bring young people close to understanding how decisions are made and inspire a new generation of leaders;Communities and Local Government is funding Operation Black Vote (OBV) under the Empowerment Fund. OBV will receive a total grant of &#163;250,000 to further develop it National MP/Leadership scheme, allowing 50 individuals a unique opportunity to gain insight into the civic and political arena. The 50 shadows will be expected to work with their communities, with the hope that they would reach about 100,000 people, inspiring more BME councillors, MPs, activists and leaders in the community. The programme will run over three years; andCommunities and Local Government is also funding OBV under the Tackling Race Inequalities Fund (TRIF) programme. OBV will receive &#163;271,228 over two years until March 2011. The project will engage public sector workers, trade unionists, community leaders, councillors and students to ensure that they are more politicised and better organised, and broaden civic involvement from increasing voter registration to taking up posts as elected representatives.</p>
