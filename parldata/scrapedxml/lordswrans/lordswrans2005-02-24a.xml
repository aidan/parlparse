While some improvements to passenger handling and harbour facilities might be possibilities for the future, the present transport infrastructure priority of the Montserrat Government and DfID is completion of the island's new airport and re-introduction of fixed-wing air services this year. Some good recreation areas and facilities already exist, such as football and cricket pitches and two all-weather sports courts. The possibility of more facilities will be considered as part of development of a new capital town at Little Bay. DfID is also supporting work to develop Montserrat's excellent potential for more tourism.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.2/1">The joint combat aircraft (JCA) ISD noted for planning purposes in the initial tailored main gate was December 2012. The &quot;tailored&quot; main gate was an interim approval point for the system development and demonstration phase of the programme. Subsequently the schedule for introducing this aircraft into service has been extensively reviewed in the light of the time taken in the United States to resolve the well known weight growth problems incurred by the STOVL variant of the JSF aircraft. Planning assumptions are now based on a revised ISD of December 2014. A firm decision on the ISD does not have to be made before the UK purchases significant numbers of aircraft. Our first planned purchase is December 2008 and by this time, with aircraft design frozen and initial development flights complete, the JCA programme will have increased maturity to make informed decisions on in-service dates. This approach remains coherent with our intention to introduce the JCA progressively onto the future carriers. This progressive approach seeks to de-risk the integration of the various complex elements of the carrier strike capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.6/1">The Government do not intend to cancel their support for rail freight activity that takes lorry traffic off the roads. Indeed, the Government have just announced that up to &pound;2 million of additional money will be made available in each of the next two years for new applications for company neutral revenue support and track access grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.6/2">The SRA expects that CNRS will support around 650,000 container movements on rail in 2004&ndash;05. All of these movements are potential lorry journeys, although details of the roads that each would have used are not available.</p>
