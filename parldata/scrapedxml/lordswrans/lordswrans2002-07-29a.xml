As the recent NAO report (The 2001 Outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease, paragraph 4.51 page 94) made clear, many contracts which would normally have been put out to tender were awarded without competition. The department reverted to normal competitive tendering where the circumstances and priorities permitted. We are unaware of any other road haulage contracts in Northumberland awarded on the basis of the negotiated procurement procedure without the prior publication of an Official Journal (OJEU) notice.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.0/1">The ICES Advisory Committee on Ecosystems monitors the ecosystem effects of fishing activities, including the impact of fishing on the wider marine environment. UK and Spanish scientists contribute to the work of this committee. However, the committee's work to date has made no distinction between the impact of fleets receiving subsidies and those that do not. The one stock that could be described as &quot;fished out&quot; in historic British waters is herring. This took place before the introduction of the common fisheries policy(CFP). The stock has since improved under it.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/2">The CFP is the means by which fisheries are managed in the European Union and the UK is keen for progress to be made through the present reform of the CFP on the removal of counter-productive fleet subsidies and the greater integration of environmental concerns in fishing policy. This will require measures to address the adverse effects of fishing on marine habitats. Progress in these areas will depend on co-operation between all member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.6/1">The Rural Payments Agency's processing of agricultural grants and subsidies is mainly office-based, apart from a small percentage of compliance inspections in the field. It consists largely of checking the eligibility, based on standard rules, of claims received from farmers and traders and arranging payment. There is a wide customer base and the total value of payments made is &pound;2.2 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.6/2">The schemes in the England Rural Development Programme are for the most part specially tailored to individual farms or projects, each requiring detailed assessment to ensure benefits will be delivered. In the agri-environment schemes, for example, the processing of applications involves a site visit by a technical expert in almost every case both to assess and develop the proposals and to give conservation management advice. Experience has shown that such visits are important in terms of securing the desired environmental outputs; for example, habitat restoration, over the life of the 10-year agreement which the land manager will subsequently sign, and hence obtaining best value for money for the taxpayer. The customer base for these schemes is narrower and the total value of payment is just over &pound;200 million. For all these reasons the administration costs are higher.</p>

We have considered the many comments made on the specific issues on which Managing radioactive waste safely sought views, and the other comments which some recipients offered, and are now outlining the next steps which the UK Government and devolved administrations have agreed will be taken in the policy process.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/2">We now propose to press ahead with a review of waste management options. The review will seek the views of interested stakeholders, the public and government departments. We will appoint an independent body to oversee the review process which will make recommendations on the option, or combination of options, for managing radioactive waste which achieves long-term protection for people and the environment. We will review all options and revise the timetable to a four rather than five stage process. We, the UK Government and the devolved administrations, will continue to be responsible for taking the ultimate decision on the management option.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/3">We propose that the new body will be in place by the end of the year. We will advertise widely for the members of this new body and they will be appointed jointly by Ministers from the UK Government and the devolved administrations. We will be seeking people who will bring technical expertise and people who will bring a wider perspective of environmental, health, social or ethical issues. We will also want to ensure that its membership is drawn from across the UK. Further details will be announced later. This new body must win public confidence and operate in an open, transparent and inclusive manner. The review process must engage with stakeholders and the public. The first step of the review will be to set the framework for debate by establishing broad agreement on the wastes to be considered, the range of management options for each of them, and the criteria against which these options should be assessed. The second step will be to assess each option including commissioning any new research required. The final step will draw up recommendations for Ministers to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/4">The Managing radioactive waste safely consultation was the first stage in our programme. The appointment of the new body will signal the beginning of stage 2, and the process of assessing options, and it will end when we publish and explain our decision. Stage 3, around 2006, will be a public debate on how the decision should be implemented, including any site selection criteria. Stage 4, around 2007, will be the start of the implementation process including any necessary legislation. In making these changes we have taken account of views received and research undertaken. We believe that this approach will result in a more dynamic and extensive process of public engagement as the review progresses, rather than the series of public consultation exercises originally envisaged. We shall not set rigid timetables and deadlines. But we shall go faster if we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/5">Our priority is to reach the decision which achieves long-term protection of people and the environment, which inspires public confidence, and which is practicable. This approach, coupled with regular reports to the UK and Scottish Parliaments and the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, will reach far more people and encourage active involvement in decision making, rather than occasional opportunties to react to consultation papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/6">The waste from our existing nuclear facilities will arise over the next century or so. So we intend, in our assessment of waste management options, to include not only materials currently classified as waste but also to consider the consequences of providing for other materials which may be have to be managed as waste during that period, such as some separated plutonium, and uranium, as well as certain quantities of spent nuclear fuel. The future management options for the UK's civil plutonium include its possible use as a fuel. However, up to 5 per cent of this stock may be so contaminated that, even though it may also be technically possible to treat and use this amount for fuel, it might prove uneconomic to do so. The Government are currently undertaking a study of the possible options for the future management of UK owned civil stock and will want to consider the results of that exercise before reaching their own conclusions on this issue. More generally, the Government urge the other owners of these materials, on a voluntary basis, to put in hand procedures now which would allow them to identify those materials which may become not economically reusable.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/7">The review of options will not consider potential radioactive waste sites. Our priority is to assess the management options and decide how to manage the waste. But we need to recognise that the assessment of some options will raise siting issues&mdash;including, as some consultees have suggested, whether local communities should have a veto or be encouraged to volunteer, and whether they should be offered incentives. It is important to ensure that we are clear and open when drawing up any criteria which might eventuallly be needed to identify sites in the option assessment process, and the issues which they raise.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/8">Over the summer and autumn, we shall publish more detailed proposals. These will include details of the new body and its terms of reference, and more detailed proposals for stage 2. They will also address pressing issues such as arrangements for managing waste safely in the short term and an announcement on waste substitution. We shall report progress on the other issues covered in the consultation, including decommissioning nuclear sites, the powers of the environment agencies, managing spent sealed sources of radioactivity, and waste classification. We will also set out how the policy process relates to other programmes, particularly the UK Government's proposals for Managing the nuclear legacy published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-04">4 July</phrase>. A summary of the consultation responses will be placed in the Library of this House, and those of the devolved administrations. Copies of individual responses are available in the department's library, and in those of the relevant departments in the devolved administrations.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.5/1">There is no evidence that Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease or variant CJD has ever been transmitted to patients through blood or blood products. Since 1998 the Government have acted on expert advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines to minimise the unknown risk to patients of vCJD by sourcing plasma for the manufacture of licensed blood products from the United States and Germany.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.5/2">The United Kingdom Expert Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Blood and Tissues for Transplantation (MSBT) is actively reviewing other possible ways in which the unknown risk from vCJD in blood might be reduced even further. This includes the importation of transfusion plasma known as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (used in managing patients with severe burns, massive blood loss and supporting intensive care unit patients); the possible exclusion of people who have received blood transfusions from giving blood and work on reducing the plasma component of blood platelets. The review involves detailed risk assessments about the possible impact of such measures on secondary transmission of vCJD and the impact on the UK blood supply. In the case of FFP, the review is looking at the need for confidence in the viral inactivation techniques used for non-UK plasma and the availability of sustainable supplies. Decisions on some of these measures will be taken later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.5/3">These issues have not been referred to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence as the membership of MSBT is set up specifically to look at blood safety issues and seeks specialist advice or includes the relevant specialists among its members.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.5/1">The Government's position on conscientious objection to abortion remains unchanged. Section 4 of the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, provides that, except where treatment is necessary to save the life of or prevent grave permanent injury to the pregnant woman, &quot;no person shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement, to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/2">This exemption does not extend to giving advice, performing the preparatory steps to arrange an abortion where the request meets legal requirements and undertaking administration connected with abortion procedures. Doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion should make their views known to the patient and enable the patient to see another doctor without delay if that is the patient's wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/3">The General Medical Council booklet Good Medical Practice states that general practitioners' views about a patient's lifestyle or beliefs must not prejudice the treatment they provide or arrange. If they feel their beliefs might affect the treatment, this must be explained to the patient, who should be told of their right to see another doctor. Breach of this guidance may expose a doctor to a charge of serious professional misconduct and disciplinary action by the GMC.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.2/1">The early reports of a cancer incidence in Valladolid in Spain were first noted in December 2000 and have subsequently been reported in the press. After this case received much national and international attention the World Health Organisation released a statement saying that none of the recent reviews has concluded that exposure to the radiofrequency (RF) fields from mobile phones or their base stations causes any adverse health consequence.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/2">The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (the Stewart Group) was set up to investigate the public health implications of mobile phone technologies. Its report, based on a review of all available research to date, was published in May 2000. It concluded that the balance of evidence does not suggest that the mobile phone technologies put the health of the general population at risk. It did, however, include a recommendation to set up a substantial research programme. This programme, jointly funded by government and industry, is currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">The Stewart Group also recommended that there should be an audit of base stations to ensure that exposure guidelines were not exceeded and that base stations on or near to sensitive sites should be a priority. The Radiocommunications Agency, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, undertook 100 audits in 2001 on schools with masts on their premises, and this exercise showed a level of emissions far below the international guidelines. All the results are on the agency website (<a href="http://www.radio.gov.uk">www.radio.gov.uk</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.143.5/2">In addition, publications from the Miscarriage Association and the Still Birth and Neonatal Deaths Society show that women may experience a variety of emotions, which can range from disappointment, anger, guilt, to wonder about what they did wrong, why their pregnancy ended or why their baby died. Having a miscarraige at home can sometimes be a distressing, frightening and lonely experience for some women. Women certainly feel a sense of loss and need time to grieve over the lost baby.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">Women seeking an abortion should be given clear information beforehand to help them prepare for the procedure and staff are on hand to give support. A study published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology <sup>1</sup> found that two years after early medical and surgical abortion procedures there were no significant differences between women who had undergone medical abortion or surgical abortion in either general, reproductive or psychological health. Almost all women placed a high value on the provision of choice of method of termination. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' evidence-based guideline The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion considered the mental health implications of termination and concluded &quot;only a small minority of women experience any long term, adverse psychological sequelae after abortion&quot; and stated that referral for further counselling should be available for these women.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/2">Guidance issued by the Department of Health in 1991 states that, for babies born dead before 24 weeks, the fetal tissue should be incinerated if the parents have not expressed any specific wishes about disposal. Terminations carried out after 24 weeks gestation (the legal age of viability) are registered as stillbirths and the law requires the body to be buried or cremated.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">RU 486, now more commonly known as mifepristone (Mifegyne), is licensed for use in medical termination of pregnancy. Information on how to use mifepristone, as well as information on possible side effects, is provided in the product information for prescribers (summary of product characteristics (SPC)) and patients (patient information leaflet (PIL)).</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">Warnings and contraindications for the use of mifepristone which are included in the SPC and PIL are as follows: allergy to mifepristone or any component of the product, suspected ectopic pregnancy, pregnancy not confirmed by ultrasound scan or biological tests, chronic adrenal failure, severe asthma not controlled by therapy and presence of a inter-uterine device in situ. In addition, special care should be given to patients with haemostatic disorders with hypocoagulability or with anaemia, and patients on long-term therapy with corticosteroids since corticosteroid efficacy can be decreased by concomitant treatment with mifepristone.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/3">istone is not recommended for use in patients with hepatic or renal failure or in women over 35 years of age and who smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/4">As with all medicines, Mifepristone is not without side effects. Some of the side effects experienced by patients such as pain, uterine contractions, or cramping and vaginal bleeding result from the termination of pregnancy. Side effects of the medication which may occur in some women include nausea, vomiting, stomach cramping, hypersensitivity reactions such as skin rashes and urticaria, headaches, malaise, hot flushes, dizziness, chills and fever.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/5">The Medicines Control Agency, with advice from the independent scientific advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines, is responsible for monitoring the safety of all marketed medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/6">The safety of mifepristone was evaluated at the time of granting a marketing authorisation and continues to be monitored using information from clinical trials, post-marketing studies and from spontaneous adverse reaction reports. There have been a large number of studies and reviews of the safety of mifepristone published in the scientific literature in the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/7">Induced abortion is one of the most commonly performed gynaecological procedures in Great Britain. Abortion, both surgical and medical, is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term and complications are uncommon. All available evidence in terms of safety and efficacy of mifeprestone was reviewed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists when producing its evidence based clinical guideline The Care of Women Seeking Induced Abortion (2000) and is referenced. Medical abortion is one of the methods recommended in the guideline.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.5/1">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists's evidence-based guideline The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2000), which applies to both medical and surgical abortions, recognises the importance of women seeking abortion receiving accurate impartial information. Verbal advice must be supported by printed information which every women considering abortion can understand and may take away and read before the procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/2">Clinicians caring for women requesting abortion should try to identify those patients who require more support in decision-making than can be provided in the routine clinic setting. Facilities for additional support, including access to social services, should be available. Appropriate information and support should be available for those who consider, but do not proceed to, abortion.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/3">Professionals should be equipped to provide women with the information they need in order to give genuinely informed consent: that abortion is safer than continuing a pregnancy to term and that complications are uncommon; description of the abortion methods that are available; immediate complications; and complications in the early weeks following abortion. During the procedure, staff are on hand to give support to women.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.5/4">The guideline also considers the mental health implications of termination and concludes: ''Only a small minority of women experience any long-term, adverse psychological sequelae after abortion. Early distress, although common, is usually a continuation of symptoms present before the abortion. Conversely, long-lasting, negative effects on both mothers and their children are reported where abortion has been denied.''</p>

	<p pid="a.149.6/2">Data on patients waiting for elective admission is collected on the consultant's main specialty function.

	<p pid="a.150.2/1">We published the standards for the Diabetes National Service Framework in December 2001. The forthcoming delivery strategy for the framework will set requirements for implementation at local level. Planning at a local level will respond to these requirements, taking account of local priorities and progress, and showing how milestones will be reached. Local strategies to deliver the framework will also be integrated in the wider planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/2">Funding for diabetes is being considered as part of the current government Spending Review, together with other priorities. The Budget provides the highest sustained growth in NHS history, with annual average increases of 7.4 per cent in real terms over the five years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08. Decisions about the allocation of the increased funding will be announced later this year. The pace of change for delivery of the Diabetes National Service Framework will take account of the resources that will be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/3">Diabetes shares a number of common risk factors with coronary heart disease and stroke. Investment in the promotion of healthier lifestyles and in the control of blood pressure, in particular, will help to combat all three conditions. The standards for the Diabetes National Service Framework highlight the importance of common strategies for prevention and treatment. In doing so, they build on the National Service Frameworks for Coronary Heart Disease and Older People.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/4">Under the new general medical services contract for general practitioners, a quality framework will reward practices for delivering quality care and provide extra incentives to encourage even higher standards of care. The NHS Confederation and the General Practice Committee of the British Medical Associations are negotiating the content of the quality framework and this includes detailed clinical standards and their levels. The framework agreement makes clear that the standards will be fair, reasonable and evidence-based.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.2/1">Nobody will be subject to compulsory treament under the Bill's proposals who does not meet all the conditions for compulsion. It is not a question of different people being treated under different conditions. (a) The best estimate of the number of patients who could be so dealt with can be derived from the latest statistics of the number of inpatients detained in hospitals under the Mental Health Act 1983. This bulletin is prepared by the Government Statistical Service and was last published in October 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/2">We should add to this the estimate of people who are dangerous by virtue of severe personality disorder and who could be treated under the Bill but could fall outside the scope of the 1983 Act. This estimate is derived from the Office for National Statistics Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of Prisoners (1997). The estimate is that 124 such people might be dealt with per annum under the Bill. (b) It is estimated that in total 26,774 people per annum coud be made subject to compulsory treatment under the Bill. This is based on experience of the operation of the 1983 Act; 26,650 formal admissions to hospital were recorded in 2000&ndash;01; and the estimate of the number of people who are dangerous by virtue of severe personality disorder and who could be treated under the Bill but who could fall outside the scope of the 1983 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/3">We do not expect any significant change in the diagnosis of mental disorder under which people meet the conditions. It is likely, however, that the number of people with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder treated under the powers of the Bill will be higher than those of the 1983 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/4">At <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>, 13,829 people were detained. The break-down by mental disorder was:</p>

	<p pid="a.151.2/9" class="indent">Not specified: 959 (c) The same classes of treatment will be available for patients who fall within the scope of the draft Bill as to those that are available for all other patients with mental disorders. (d) The same procedure for referring treatments to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence will apply to all treatments that may be provided to patients with mental disorders.</p>
