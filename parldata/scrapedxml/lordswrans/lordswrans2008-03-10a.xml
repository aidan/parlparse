	<p pid="a.193.1/2" qnum="HL2116">In view of the conclusion of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee in December 2006 that the prevalence of BSE in the United Kingdom sheep population was likely to be zero and that the precautionary measure of splitting sheep to remove the spinal cord was unnecessary, when they will adopt the European Union-approved process of vacuum removal, as practised in France and elsewhere; and how much this alternative method would benefit the United Kingdom sheep and meat industry annually.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.2/1">The Community TSE Regulations ((EC) 999/2001) lays down the rules for prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). This requires that the spinal cord of sheep and goats over 12 months of age, or which have a permanent incisor erupted, must be removed and stained and disposed of as specified risk material (SRM). The Community regulation does not specify any method of removal and no particular methods of removal are specifically European Union approved.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/2">We have been advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that the latest Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) advice on the prevalence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom sheep flock is that it may be zero or in the worst case no more than 10 flocks would be affected. SEAC has also advised of the importance of maintaining current SRM controls in order to minimise public health risk were BSE ever to enter the sheep flock and that a possible human health risk from atypical scrapie (another TSE of sheep) cannot, at present, be ruled out. SEAC has not issued any advice on the method of removal of spinal cord in sheep and goats.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.2/3">We have also been advised that the FSA will be re-examining the effectiveness of the suction method for removal of sheep spinal cord and the possible methods of verification of complete removal. The agency will remain in close contact with the industry during this re-evaluation of the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.5/1">Testing of swill for the presence of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus was not carried out, either on a general or specific basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/2">The noble Baroness may be aware that more than one inquiry into the 2001 FMD outbreak found that there were strong grounds for concluding it was caused by feeding unprocessed swill to pigs at the index premises. All the epidemiological evidence points towards this being the correct conclusion, although the body of evidence would not include empirical results from testing of swill.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/3">However, testing of unprocessed swill for the presence of the FMD virus would be of limited value. The chances of detecting FMD in a batch of swill, if present, would be minimal and would not help reliably to establish the absence of such virus with any degree of confidence. With such a virulent disease, a little virus goes a long way, and as we have seen, its presence combined with any failure in processing requirements has disastrous consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/4">Once the FMD epidemic unfolded in 2001, it became imperative that the ban on swill feeding should be introduced urgently. This was due to the background level of virus which would have been present. Testing of batches of swill prior to processing would not have helped in those circumstances. The greatly increased risks with its use needed to be curtailed as soon as it was practicably possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-12">12 February</phrase> there were fewer than 30 cases whose serious multiple injuries were sustained before the Amendment Order 2008 (SI 2008/39) came into force and who were paid an exceptional additional benefit under Article 15B of the new rules. Under the rules of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, individuals have up to five years in which to make a claim. Accordingly, there may be others who have yet to claim. It is estimated that payment of additional benefits will cost an additional &pound;2 million to &pound;4 million following the revised rule coming into effect. Total cost for the cases paid so far amount to &pound;1,009,481. This has been met from within the existing costs of the scheme.

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">The Government are aware of the concerns of bus operators and local authorities but are confident that the overall level of funding for the statutory minimum provision of concessionary travel is sufficient. The Government provided an extra &pound;350 million in 2006-07 and &pound;367.5 million in 2007-08 for the statutory concession and are now providing councils with a further &pound;212 million dedicated to funding rollout of the extension to the statutory scheme. For many local authorities this will equate to increases of more than 33 per cent against what they currently spend on concessionary travel. Our proposed distribution of additional funding for an extension to an England-wide concession from April is through a formula-based special grant, as requested by local authorities. A report on the grant has been laid before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">The formula used to allocate the funding takes explicit account of the likely drivers of cost of the new concession and is based on the most popular options among respondents to our recent consultation on the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">Although there are some controls placed on their administrative management, religious organisations in Cuba are numerous and are expanding. The UK's policy on Cuba aims to encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the EU Common Position of 1996. The UK makes regular representations to the Cuban Government on human rights issues and will continue to do so. We welcome existing dialogue between religious organisations and the Cuban state, including the recent visit of Cardinal Bertone from the Vatican.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">Our discussions with these Governments have focused on the suffering caused by forced marriage and the need for all countries to tackle the problem. This has led to practical partnerships ensuring UK citizens facing forced marriage can be assisted as quickly and effectively as possible. Encouragingly a draft Forced Marriage Bill was introduced in Pakistan in 2007. However, it was not adopted by its Parliament during 2007, and it is not yet clear whether it will be reintroduced in 2008.</p>

The CHM is supported by expert advisory groups whose membership includes specialists in clinical therapeutics as well as drug safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">The National Health Service Litigation Authority operates two non-clinical risk pooling schemes for NHS trust hospitals and NHS foundation trust hospitals. The liabilities to third parties scheme (LTPS) provides cover for a wide range of non-clinical liabilities, subject to pre-determined excesses and limits of cover set out for each type of liability in the rules governing the scheme. The property expenses scheme (PES) provides cover in relation to damage to buildings and other property and related matters such as business interruption. Levels of cover vary according to member income subject to excesses and up to a maximum of &pound;1 million for property damage and one million pounds for business interruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/2">Long-standing government policy has been that NHS trust hospitals should rely on the LTPS and PES for non-clinical risk cover, and should not use commercial insurance. All NHS trusts are members of both the LTPS and the PES. NHS foundation trusts are also eligible to be members and we are not aware of any that have given up their membership since achieving foundation status. However, the greater independence of NHS foundation trusts means that they are free to obtain additional insurance from the commercial sector if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/3">The PES is not intended to cover the extremely rare event of catastrophic damage to property, such as the complete destruction of a hospital complex. Apart from anything else, it would be impossible to assess accurately in advance what the likely costs of such an event might be. Each would have to be considered on its own merits, taking into account all the local circumstances before decisions could be taken on the best way forward, including funding options.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">In addition to managing liability claims made against National Health Service organisations, a key function of the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) is to &quot;contribute to the incentives for reducing the number of negligent or preventable incidents&quot;. The NHSLA achieves this aim through an extensive risk management programme, the core of which is provided by standards and assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">The current version of the risk management standards for NHS hospital trusts issued by the NHSLA incorporates organisational, clinical and non-clinical/health and safety risks. Previously, the NHSLA issued separate clinical and non-clinical risk management standards. The risk issues addressed by the NHSLA standards include those that are known to give rise to a significant number and/or cost of liability claims made against the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/3">The NHSLA risk management standards for acute trusts comprise five standards, each with 10 criteria and set at three incremental levels. All NHS trusts are assessed against the standards by a specialist team with the frequency of assessment ranging from annually to once every three years depending on the level achieved by the trust at its previous assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.6/1">Evasion is the deliberate omission or misrepresentation to gain a tax advantage, and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) targets evaders through enhanced data matching capabilities, as well as by amending legislation to remove opportunities for evasion. The recent offshore disclosure arrangements under which 45,000 people made disclosures yielded around &pound;400 million. This work is underpinned by the Government's introduction of the new penalty regime to deter and penalise tax evasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.6/2">The Government are also committed to tackling offshore tax evasion. They are working with the OECD and the EU to promote transparency and exchange of information, which are key to tackling the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.6/3">The Government are in the process of negotiating tax information exchange agreements with British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependences and have recently concluded one with Bermuda. Following the 2007 offshore disclosure arrangements, the Government are also in discussion with the banking industry with regard to obtaining further offshore account information on UK residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.6/4">The Government actions to target offshore tax evasion need to be clearly distinguished from the proposed changes to the rules on residence and domicile. The remittance basis of taxation does not represent a form of tax evasion. Rather, it offers an alternative basis of taxation, which helps to make the UK an attractive destination for international talent and investment. The Government's reforms will retain these special rules, while ensuring that they operate more fairly.</p>

Our ambassador in Hanoi attended the last dialogue, which was held in Hanoi on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-19">19 December 2007</phrase>. We also raise our concerns with the Government of Vietnam independently of the dialogue, both bilaterally and with our EU counterparts. For example, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Meg Munn, raised our concerns on human rights with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister at the Association of South East Asian Nations summit in Singapore on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November 2007</phrase> and with the Deputy Foreign Minister during his visit to London on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-29">29 November 2007</phrase>. Additionally, she raised the issue with the Vietnamese ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October 2007</phrase>.</p>

With regard to existing programmes, WFP is conducting country-specific analyses and we will consider whether additional contributions might be appropriate when the results are available.</p>
