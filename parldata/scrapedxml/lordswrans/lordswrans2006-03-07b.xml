These policy areas continue to be subject to QMV.

	<p pid="b.125.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State plans to lead a trade mission organised by Invest Northern Ireland to India during the Easter Recess. The purpose of the mission is to support the objectives of Invest NI and its clients, who are actively targeting India for new investment and trade opportunities. Both Queen's University and the University of Ulster will also be involved, in order to further their interests in developing research and collaboration linkages with the Indian Institutes of Technology. Additionally, the visit will support the work of Tourism Ireland, which is promoting the island of Ireland to Indian tourists.</p>

The economic threats and opportunities which India in particular and Asia more generally presents are common to both parts of Ireland. My right honourable friend has no plans to negotiate with anyone outside of his area of responsibility nor do we consider that this type of visit has any detrimental effect on Northern Ireland as an investment location. On the contrary, co-operating together to assess the threats and to maximise the opportunities can bring mutual advantages north and south.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.2/1">The Government announced in November 2005 that a renewable transport fuels obligation (RTFO) will be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase>. The RTFO will require all suppliers of transport fuels in the UK to ensure that 5 per cent of their total fuel sales come from renewable sources by 2010 in order to help meet our climate change objectives. In practice, this is likely to mean that by 2010 the vast majority of UK forecourts will be selling standard fuel blended with biofuel, with most private and commercial vehicles also running on blends that include biodiesel or bioethanol.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.2/2">The Department for Transport provides limited grant funding towards the installation of alternative refuelling and recharging infrastructure. The RTFO should ensure that refuelling facilities for alternative fuels will be available in large scale across the UK by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.2/3">I understand that bioethanol is already being sold in blends of up to 5 per cent at around 150 outlets in the south-east and north-west of England, but as retailers are not generally distinguishing the fuel as renewable we do not have precise numbers. Information on sites selling other renewable fuels is available on a regional basis from <a href="http://www.est.org.uk/fleet/calculators/refuelling/index.cfm?mode=results">http://www.est.org.uk/fleet/calculators/refuelling/index.cfm?mode=results</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.2/4">The Government have also put in place a number of incentives to encourage the uptake of clean and fuel-efficient vehicles. These include fiscal incentives such as the company car tax and vehicle excise duty systems, which are both structured to reward those who purchase the most fuel-efficient, low CO2 vehicles. These incentives are deliberately technology-neutral and we are not setting specific targets for any particular technology such as for hybrid vehicles. The Government's <i>Powering Future Vehicles</i> strategy, published in July 2002, sets a target that by 2012 cars with a fuel efficiency of 100 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometre or better will make up at least 10 per cent of new car sales.</p>
