	<p pid="a.129.2/1">Agriculture remains by far the most dangerous of all the major industries in Great Britain. The incidence rate for fatal injuries to workers in 2009-10 was four times higher in agriculture than in construction. The toll of deaths from largely well known and preventable causes is unacceptable and is recognised as such by the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">HSE will continue its risk-based approach to health and safety in agriculture, targeting those activities which present the highest risk of injury. In view of the nature of these businesses, which are often small or micro in size, HSE uses a range of approaches to engage with the industry. Work activity includes a &quot;Make the Promise&quot; communications campaign; an increased number and type of safety and health awareness days; training and education (through vocational qualifications); working with manufacturers and suppliers of farming equipment; and partnership work with farming organisations.</p>

Defra has contributed &#163;250,000 to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee to facilitate work on invasive species and climate change in the territories during the international year of biodiversity. Most of this funding has now been given to the territories to work on these priorities. Added priority was also given to the territories during the last funding round of the Darwin Initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.8/1">The estimated annual costs contained in the Wigley report do not directly compare to the estimated costs of meeting the targets in the Climate Change Act, as set out in the impact assessment of that Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/2">While the costs in the Wigley report are investment costs, those in the Climate Change Act impact assessment are resource costs derived from the MARKAL model, which calculates emission reduction pathways that minimise costs</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/3">This estimates the costs of the 80 per cent reduction target in 2050 and includes welfare impacts as well as energy system costs. They are relative to a counterfactual world in which investment would have taken place in other power plants and energy system related equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.8/4">The Climate Change Act impact assessment estimates the total resource costs of meeting the 80 per cent target at between &#163;14.7 billion and &#163;18.3 billion per year. This excludes short-term transition costs, such as changes that might occur in the short or medium term as the economy adjusts to changes in energy policy. These costs are outweighed by the estimated annual benefits of the Act, which are estimated at between &#163;20.7 billion and &#163;46.2 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.5/1">Frome magistrates' court is a satellite court for Yeovil magistrates' court. Following the merger of the Mendip and South Somerset local justice areas in January 2008, there have been some occasions where court users in the Mendip area have been required to attend Yeovil magistrates' court. This has been most likely to affect those cases where the defendant is in custody and the case cannot be heard at Frome either because there is not a suitable court sitting or there is insufficient capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/2">Since the merger of the local justice areas there have been no significant adverse impacts on the attendance at court of residents from the immediate area in and around Frome. The majority of offences committed in the Frome area have continued to be dealt with at the magistrates' court in Frome.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/3">The proposal to close Frome magistrates' court is currently out to public consultation and an initial impact assessment has been produced. The impacts, costs and benefits of the proposed court closures will be considered more fully during the consultation phase and a full impact assessment will be produced alongside the consultation responses.</p>

If a building is assessed as sufficiently ruinous or dilapidated as to be seriously detrimental to the amenities of the neighbourhood, local authorities are given similar powers by Section 79 of the Act.

	<p pid="a.142.2/46">In 2007 the Department for International Development (DfID) made a &#163;400,000 contribution to the UN development trust fund to support the setting up of the Office of the Quartet Representative in Jerusalem. This fund is administered by the United Nations Development Programme and its aim is to provide operational and logistical support to the representative (quartet) mission team and staff based in Jerusalem, so as to enable the effective and quick implementation of the quartet objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/47">We welcome the efforts of the quartet and the Quartet Representative-Tony Blair-and would particularly highlight recent efforts to help ease the border restrictions in Gaza. A great deal of progress has also been made on economic development in the West Bank, which shows that it is possible to have a functioning state, and which is a very important component of driving forward the Middle East peace process.</p>
