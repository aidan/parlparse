	<p pid="a.149.2/1">The grant letter from the Secretaries of State for Children, Schools and Families, and for Innovation, Universities and Skills to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) outlines plans for 118,000 successful apprenticeship completions in England in 2008-09 and 129,000 in 2009-10. The grant letter also specified an overall apprenticeship completion success rate target for 2008-09 of 65 per cent, subject to factoring in the effects of the current economic downturn. In 2007-08 113,000 people completed an apprenticeship in England and completion rates reached an all time high of 64 per cent. The 2007-08 completion rate for apprentices with learning difficulties and/or disabilities was 60 per cent. We will continue to work to improve access to and successful completion of apprenticeships and, going forward, will expect apprenticeship completion rates for people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities to be no lower than for non-disabled learners.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/2">The Government are committed to ensuring that people who have learning difficulties or disabilities have full access to apprenticeship learning opportunities and to the specialist support and equipment they may need to complete their apprenticeships successfully. We have put in place support systems, including for the Connexions service to cater for people with learning difficulties and disabilities up to the age of 25, and through duties on the LSC to help young adults with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. We also provide extra funds to help make this happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">The department is not planning any such audit for claimants' solicitors' costs under the coal health compensation schemes. Costs for handling claims under the schemes are paid in accordance with the claims handling agreements but the department is not privy to any further arrangement between claimants and their representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/2">However, the department has welcomed the report by the National Audit Office published in July 2007 and the subsequent Public Accounts Committee report examining the coal health compensation schemes. These are available to view at <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0607/coal_health_compensation.aspx">www.nao.org.uk/publications/0607/coal_health_compensation.aspx</a> and <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmpubacc/350/350.pdf">www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmpubacc/350/350.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/3">The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal hearing referred to misconduct between the solicitors and their clients which is a separate issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/4">As the legal profession is independent and self-regulating, complaints about solicitor misconduct are a matter for the Legal Complaints Service and Solicitors Regulatory Authority, rather than the Government. However, both DECC and the Ministry of Justice continue to support the Legal Complaints Service in its programme to highlight the issue of deductions from coal health compensation which to date has secured in excess of &pound;3.6 million in refunds to claimants.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/5">Both DECC and the Ministry of Justice have welcomed the recent report by the legal services complaints commissioner on the handling of coal health compensation claims. The report highlighted that overall the LCS had improved the way it handled miners' complaints between February 2008 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase> and had taken note of the 11 issues raised in the LSCC's earlier report of January 2008.</p>

Detailed information on performance payments is not collected centrally, but data that are held indicate that the cost is approximately 1 per cent of the total pay bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.9/2">For the SCS, performance payments are used to incentivise staff to deliver business objectives successfully. Reward arrangements for the SCS, including the size of the non-consolidated performance pay pot, are based on the recommendations of the independent Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB). In 2007-08, 7.6 per cent of the SCS pay bill was available as non-consolidated payments. Only 7.1 per cent of the pay bill was spent in this way, equating to &pound;23.1 million. In his Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-17">17 June 2008</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister accepted the SSRB's recommendation that 8.6 per cent of the SCS pay bill be made available as non-consolidated payments in 2008-09.

	<p pid="a.157.5/1">We understand that there is some cost and effort involved in obtaining new CRB disclosures for each new member of staff. However, there are risks associated with porting disclosures. For example, there may have been a new offence committed since the previous disclosure; the disclosure may have been tampered with; or the person's identity may have been checked incorrectly. It is the responsibility of the employer to ensure that their staff are suitable to work with children. Therefore, the employer should satisfy themselves that checks have been completed correctly and that the employer has the full information to make a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.5/2">The introduction of the vetting and barring scheme from October 2009 will improve safeguarding arrangements. However, we have proposed to continue the requirement for CRB checks as it is important those who employ people who work in the looked-after children's sector have access to the more finely grained criminal history in order to decide on suitability. We will review current statutory requirements for CRB disclosures once the vetting and barring scheme has been fully implemented across the workforce.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.0/1">The most recently published fuel poverty figures show that in 2006 around 2.7 million households in England were not connected to the mains gas network, with around 20 per cent of them estimated to be in fuel poverty. Around 900,000 households rely on heating oil as their main fuel for central heating and just under a quarter of these were fuel poor in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/2">Warm Front is the Government's flagship scheme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England for vulnerable householders. The scheme currently provides grants for specified insulation and heating measures up to the value of &pound;2,700. or &pound;4,000 for oil central heating (including properties with no access to the gas network).</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/3">The Government recognise the specific challenge of assisting properties in rural communities. The Warm Front Scheme Management Board considers on a regular basis whether to approve appropriate alternative technologies on to the scheme, where they might prove cost-effective. One example is through Warm Front and National Energy Action where we are currently carrying out a pilot using solar thermal technology together with electric heating.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/4">In addition, Warm Front has a networking team which operates in rural areas to help bring assistance to vulnerable households in rural communities. Proactively engaging with local organisations and area-based schemes, the team helps to increase the take-up of grants and energy efficiency advice in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/5">The carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) is the Government's principal policy for driving up household energy efficiency by 2011. Under CERT the major energy suppliers have an obligation to direct at least 40 per cent of carbon savings at priority group households. This includes important measures for hard-to-treat homes such as solid wall insulation and central heating. Suppliers installed around 80,000 heating measures through fuel switching in the previous three-year obligation period to March 2008 (the second energy efficiency commitment, EEC2). The Government recognise there is a high up-front cost for these measures and therefore under CERT we have introduced specific incentives to help improve the financial viability of fuel switching, with a particular focus on homes which are off the gas grid.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/6">The principal barrier to providing new gas connections to communities and households beyond the mains gas network is the cost to the customer. Ofgem recognises the benefits that access to gas offers low-income households, and has incentivised the large gas networks to connect deprived communities under the 2008-13 gas distribution price control. This packages a range of existing funding sources and uses independent gas transporters with an aim of ensuring the maximum number of vulnerable and fuel poor households should be connected to the gas network at least cost. Those households who will be assisted under the scheme qualify because they either reside within the 20 per cent most deprived areas according to the index of multiple deprivation, qualify for assistance under Warm Front (or similar schemes in the devolved nations) or fall within the priority group under CERT.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.2/1">The document Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 01-04 <I>The Management of Used and Infected Linen in the Healthcare Sector</I> does not currently exist and therefore there is no revision taking place. The current guidance associated with this area is HSG (95) 18&mdash;<I>Hospital Laundry Arrangements for Used and Infected Linen</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2">The department is currently producing HTM 01-04: <I>Decontamination of </I><I>L</I><I>aundry and </I><I>Infected L</I><I>inen </I>(working title) as part of the suite of HTM documents that provide guidance on decontamination in the healthcare sector. HTM 01-04 is intended to provide a replacement for HSG (95) 18&mdash;<I>Hospital Laundry Arrangements for Used and Infected Linen</I> and provide a more complete guidance package on uniform and laundry decontamination to assist with the reduction of risks associated with healthcare-associated infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/3">HTM 01-04 is being produced with the assistance of a wide cross-section of stakeholders who have been engaged in a formal steering group with departmental officials and the technical authors for the document.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/4">The steering group is actively involved in contributing evidence and in the review of the draft guidance material. The steering group membership includes a broad range of industry representatives including, among others, the Textile Services Association and Sunlight Services Group as representatives of industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/5">The approach and structure used within this guidance has been changed following consultation with the steering group members. The changes are intended to ensure that the guidance is equally usable and useful for both large and small laundry service providers. Improvements have also been made to aspects of the guidance concerned with laundry sorting and management at hospital ward level.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/6">The department has commissioned additional research on the removal of Clostridium difficile spores from laundry. The results of this research will, if necessary, shape aspects of the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/7">Department practice requires that the draft guidance be subject to peer review before final publication can take place. The department intends to publish HTM 01-04, subject to a successful peer review, during the autumn of 2009.</p>
