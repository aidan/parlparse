Over 160 responses were received and Treasury officials are currently considering and analysing these responses in the policy design process. No decisions have yet been made on the design of the duty. The Chancellor will announce the policy in the autumn. The initial impact assessment published with the consultation document made an estimate of carbon reductions from the increase in the duty of 0.5MtCO2 in 2010-11.

	<p pid="a.166.6/1">The Freedom of Information Act is working effectively with a total of 105,000 requests dealt with under FOIA by central-government-monitored bodies during the period 2005 to 2007. Ninety per cent of these requests were answered within time; that is, a response was provided within the standard deadline or a permitted deadline extension was applied. Of those requests where it was possible to give a substantive decision on whether to release the information being sought, 64 per cent were granted in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.6/2">Currently, the Government are considering the response to their recent consultation on extending the coverage of the Act and are awaiting recommendations from a review of the 30-year rule commissioned last October by the Prime Minister. Other than any proposals they may put forward resulting from those initiatives and a number of minor orders, such as the order currently before Parliament to add six public bodies to the list of public authorities subject to the Act, the Government have no plans for reform at present. The legislation is, however, kept under constant review.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.5/1">The Government believe that in the formulation of Section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the definition of each offence is precise.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/2">The section is intended to protect children from adults who communicate with them through, for example, meetings, telephone conversations or the internet, and then arrange to meet them with the intention of committing a sexual offence against them, either at that meeting or subsequently. The offence is committed when the adult intentionally meets the child or travels with the intention of meeting the child intending to do anything to or in respect of the child which, if done, would involve the adult in the commission of a relevant offence. When Section 73 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 is implemented, the offence will also be committed if the child travels to meet the offender.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/3">The evidence of the adult's intent to commit an offence may be drawn from the communications between the adult and the child before the meeting or may be drawn from other circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.5/4">This is covered in more detail in the Explanatory Notes to the Act, which can be viewed on the website of the Office of Public Sector Information.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.3/1">The Government are committed to enhancing the important role that women have to play in preventing and resolving conflicts and building sustainable peace. The UK was a driving force behind the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325, which placed these issues firmly on the UN's agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.3/2">We promote the implementation of UNSCR 1325 throughout Sudan. In 2007, the UK contributed 60 per cent (US$590,701) of the total budget of the UN Common Humanitarian Fund, which includes support for civil society projects to prevent gender-based violence and to promote women's leadership in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.3/3">Through the Department for International Development's governance programme, we provide training for the police, judiciary and prison officers to enable them to tackle gender-based violence more effectively and support local non-governmental organisations to run workshops and media campaigns on HIV/AIDS, reproductive health and gender-based violence. Our embassy in Khartoum has supported conflict mitigation and peacebuilding initiatives which have encouraged women to lead on reconciliation efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.3/4">In the UN, the UK supported the inclusion of language on UNSCR 1325 in Security Council resolutions relating to the UN peacekeeping missions in Sudan. For example, the following language was included in the most recent mandate for the UN mission in Sudan:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.3/5" class="indent">&quot;emphasising in particular the role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding, as recognised in resolution 1325&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.3/6">The UK also supports the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations' work to incorporate gender issues into all peacekeeping missions. Additionally, we raise gender-related issues through the EU-Sudan Dialogue on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.3/7">We continue to develop our national action plan on UNSCR 1325, to promote and support the crucial role that women have to play in delivering sustainable peace and security in conflict areas, including southern Sudan.</p>
