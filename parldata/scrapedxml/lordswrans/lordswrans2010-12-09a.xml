	<p pid="a.79.2/1">The Codex General Standard for Irradiated Foods (CODEX STAN 106-1983, REV. 1-2003) states that &quot;The maximum absorbed dose delivered to a food should not exceed 10 kilogray (kGy), except when necessary to achieve a legitimate technological purpose&quot;. Doses up to 10 kGy will substantially reduce the number of viable bacteria in the majority of cases and the Codex standard allows for higher doses where there is a legitimate need. However, although irradiation can help to reduce the level of bacterial contamination in food it should not be seen as a replacement for good manufacturing practice and should only be used as part of a wider hazard analysis and critical control point plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">The exception to exceed 10 kGy &quot;when necessary to achieve a legitimate technological purpose&quot; was based on the findings of a joint study between the Food and Agricultural Office, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Health Organisation. This study concluded that there was no detrimental effect to the look and texture of dried herbs and spices from higher doses of irradiation and that these higher doses could reduce the risk of bacterial growth for certain pathogens which have been shown to be more resistant to radiation treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">It should also be noted that these changes to the Codex standard have not been adopted by European Directive1999/3/EC which limits the irradiation of dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings to a maximum overall average absorbed dose of 10 kGy. This was endorsed by the findings of the European Scientific Committee on Foods in 2003 which concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the removal of the upper limit of 10 kGy.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/5">In 2008-09, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) commissioned a number of building inspections by chartered surveyors from the Valuation Office Agency. The Valuation Office surveyors changed the method of valuation for many buildings in Rome from a market-value-based approach to a depreciated replacement cost approach, to reflect the true cost to the FCO of replacing these assets. This led to a nominal increase in the total value of the FCO's assets in Rome in 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.5/3">As Director General of the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking Her Majesty's Government on what rate of interest receivable is assumed in national accounts in respect of the debt owed by Iceland to the United Kingdom; and where this income and the attendant funding cost appear in national accounts. [HL4676]</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/4">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) produces statistics according to internationally agreed national accounts standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/5">Lord Sassoon's response to your earlier parliamentary question on this subject (HL2846) explained that discussions are ongoing to reach agreement with Iceland to repay the loan made by the previous government in respect of Iceland's obligations under the Deposit guarantee Directive to UK depositors in Icesave. At the present time, agreement has not yet been reached between the UK and Icelandic governments on the nature and timing of the settlement of the Icelandic debt. Consequently, there is no rate of interest yet assumed within the UK national accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/6">The treatment of the financial crisis within the UK national accounts and the UK public sector finances is detailed in a 2009 ONS article Public Sector Interventions in the Financial Crisis: Statistical Classification Decisions available at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/nojournal">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/nojournal</a> /Financial-crisis.pdf. The specific impacts of the Landsbanki Islands of London branch and the Icesave internet product are detailed in Chapter 13 of that article.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/7">When agreement has been reached on the mode of repayment, including any agreed interest payments, ONS will consider the most appropriate recording of the relevant transactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/8">The national accounts do not identify separately the attendant funding costs of the UK's assistance to Iceland. As explained in Chapter 31 of the ONS article above, these relate to the interest costs incurred by the UK government resulting from the borrowing it undertakes to fund financial sector interventions. Such additional borrowing is undertaken as a part of the government's general financing programme. Within the National Accounts, interest on central government borrowing appears as variable RVFK in the 'uses' section of the central government 'allocation of primary income account' - see for example Table 5.2.3 of the National Accounts Blue Book 2010, available at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/product.asp?vlnk=1143">www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/product.asp?vlnk=1143</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.2/4">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) produces two main measures of consumer inflation, the consumer prices index (CPI) and the retail prices index (RPI). The CPI measures inflation for the UK as a whole whilst the RPI inflation measure covers the vast majority of the UK household sector. The construction of the indices focuses on these broad measurement targets, which means that measures of inflation by income decile are not produced as part of the monthly CPI and RPI production process and are therefore not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/5">You may be interested to know that the ONS conducted a special analysis in September 2008 and published estimates of average price changes experienced by households grouped by income decile for the 12 months ending April 2008. This analysis, which was based on the RPI, concluded that there was little variation in the average price change experienced by the different income groups during this period.

Further, it would not be appropriate for the Government to comment on the merits of a planning application. To do so could prejudice a decision should an application subsequently come before Ministers; for example, on appeal.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.8/1">We are proposing to make prisons places of hard work and industry. As part of this, we are looking to expand the prisoner working week to up to 40 hours within prison industries which we estimate currently provides the equivalent of about 9,000 FTE places for prisoners per day in just under 400 workshops. A significant number of prisoners also work in functions such as catering, cleaning and land-based activities. We also want to make it easier for the private sector to get involved in training, providing work and employing prisoners on release.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.8/2">These plans will increase the number of prisoners engaged in meaningful and productive work, help replicate the working week and instil dignity, a work ethic and discipline, and through improving skills for sustained employment aid rehabilitation on release. This will form part of our wider plans for reform, details of which will soon be published in a Green Paper for consultation.</p>

We will continue to monitor the carbon impact of policy and investment decisions to ensure we remain on course to deliver those targets. Emissions of greenhouse gases from the transport sector are projected to fall significantly over the coming decade, in large part as a result of improvements to the fuel efficiency of new vehicles and the uptake of low carbon fuels.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/2">The Department for Transport has not made a detailed estimate of the likely effects of increases in rail fares on transport emissions, but the overall impact is likely to be small. The fare increase was one element of the spending review announcement. Other measures such as the local sustainable transport fund and the package of support for ultra low carbon vehicles are expected to lead to reductions in carbon emissions.</p>

The ETV has also been tasked to provide a passive escort service for Minch transits on 27 occasions (as part of its MCA contract).

	<p pid="a.101.8/1">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) do not recover the cost of attending incidents where there is grave and imminent risk to life, although it would be very unusual for these types of situation to involve the use of an emergency towing vessel (ETV). When a ship gets into difficulties and is within reasonable distance of an ETV, an ETV may be tasked to stand by in the event that tug assistance would help to prevent pollution. In these cases, it is usual for the ETV contractor to provide towage services on commercial terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.8/2">The safe operation of a ship is at all times the responsibility of the Master. Should a ship become disabled and be incapable of navigation, to the extent that it presents a potential threat to safety of life and/or the maritime environment within UK waters, the MCA would encourage the Master to take all necessary action to reduce or mitigate the risk. This action may include the owner of the ship arranging a commercial tow through a contract for towage services or on salvage terms.</p>
