	<p pid="b.67.2/1">Some of the recommendations mentioned in the <i>March of Dimes</i> report cover areas which the international development community strongly promotes: family planning, control of communicable diseases in women of reproductive age (such as syphilis, HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis and malaria), and the importance of nutrition.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.2/2">The UK Government, through the Department for International Development and the Department of Health, provides core budget support to the World Health Organisation and other agencies, such as UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which work in these areas.</p>

Around 40 per cent of all child deaths take place within the first month of life (and mostly within a few hours of birth). This is why the UK Government focus on millennium development goal 5 (Improve maternal health), as part of the wider efforts to reach millennium development goal 4 (Reduce child mortality).</p>

	<p pid="b.68.11/1">It is unlikely that income tax (the tax most in question) will be payable on single farm payments before those payments have been received.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.11/2">Single farm payments due during 2005 become subject to income tax as part of the profits of a farmer's trade included in his accounts for a period of account ending in the 2005&ndash;06 tax year (or, in some cases, in the 2006&ndash;07 tax year). The first income tax payment to reflect any single farm payments for 2005 will be the final instalment of income tax payable in respect of the 2005&ndash;06 tax year, which is not due until <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January 2007</phrase>. If the single farm payments are taxed as part of the profits for the 2006&ndash;07 tax year, that instalment of income tax will not become due until <phrase class="date" code="">31 January 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.2/1">Where decriminalised parking is not in force, parking offences are enforced by the police service. The level of fine for a criminal parking offence is set by Schedule 2 to the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 and the level of fixed penalty is set by order made under that Act. The most recent order is the Fixed Penalty (Amendment) Order 2003, S.I. 2003, No 1254.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.2/2">Where decriminalised parking is in force, parking contraventions are enforced by local authorities. Outside London, the levels of additional parking charges (including penalty charge notices) for parking contravention are set in accordance with procedures in the Road Traffic Act 1991 and the order under that Act putting decriminalised parking in place in the local authority. In particular they must be set in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of State. Inside London, the level of additional parking charges (including penalty charge notices) is set in accordance with procedures in the Road Traffic Act 1991. A local authority must set the level of such charges in conjunction with a joint committee and subject to the approval of the Mayor of London and the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.2/3">Local authorities outside London must chose between one of three penalty charge notice (PCN) levels: &pound;40, &pound;50 and &pound;60. London authorities must chose between PCN levels of &pound;60, &pound;80 and &pound;100. There is a discount of 50 per cent for PCNs paid within 14 days. An authority may use different PCN levels in different parts of their area but few do.</p>

	<p pid="b.77.3/7" class="indent">increased donor funding for disaster risk reduction, and the UN international strategy for disaster reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.3/8">The United Nations is taking forward these reforms, with the support and participation of the wider donor community, including the UK, the NGO community, and the Red Cross movement. In December 2005, a new upgraded UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was approved by the UN General Assembly. It was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March 2006</phrase> with $254 million from 38 donors, including $70 million from the UK. The CERF will enable UN humanitarian agencies to respond rapidly to sudden disasters, such as earthquakes; time-critical responses in slow-onset disasters, such as famines; and essential life-saving actions in ongoing but under-funded crises. The first payments from the fund have been made for the drought in the Horn of Africa, and the deteriorating conflict situation in C&ocirc;te D'Ivoire.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.3/9">A number of proposals for strengthening the UN humanitarian co-ordinator system are being taken forward, including developing a pool of suitable candidates and associated training. Alongside this, the UK is leading seven other donors in piloting pooled country level funding in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo during 2006. The UK is also providing support to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in developing a set of global humanitarian performance benchmarks, initially for mortality, nutrition, and health. The Government have supported progress over the past 12 months in reforming the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and also launched their new Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.3/10">In September 2005, the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which deals with humanitarian issues, established a new &quot;cluster&quot; system to deliver more accountable and predictable humanitarian response. Certain agencies have responsibility for co-ordinating the response in key under-performing sectors, and developing networks, or clusters, of other agencies and NGOs to work together to improve capacity, performance, and effectiveness. The UK Government are currently considering, along with other donors, how best to support this initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.3/11">In January 2006, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development called for further reform of the international humanitarian system by improving the quality and focus of the UN Flash Appeals system; developing agreements on the use of military assets; and for more accountability in humanitarian response on funding, performance, and impact of assistance on beneficiary communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.3/12">The Government will consider carefully the findings and recommendations of the forthcoming inter-agency evaluation of the response to the Asian tsunami, and any reviews of the Pakistan earthquake, to assess whether further improvements to the international humanitarian system might be necessary. It is too early to assess the impact of the response to the Horn of Africa drought.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.1/2" qnum="HL5209">What recent steps they have taken through aid and other programmes to increase economic and education opportunities in (a) India, and (b) Pakistan in order to reduce poverty.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-05-03b.79.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="79"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060503/text/60503w04.htm#60503w04_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.79.2/1" class="italic">India</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/2">DfID's largest aid programme is to India, where we provided &pound;245 million in 2005&ndash;06. All DfID's support is aimed at reducing poverty, which as we know has many, inter-linked dimensions, including low levels of income, assets, literacy and well-being. DfID's largest programmes in India are in education and health which have an indirect but very significant impact on economic opportunities for the poor.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/3">India is making impressive progress in growing its economy and reducing income poverty, and DfID contributes to this in a number of ways. Nationally, working with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), DfID assists the Government of India to make their increasingly open trade regime deliver their potential for promoting sustainable growth and reducing poverty. In Orissa, one of the poorest states in India, DfID is working with the Government to improve the investment climate through measures such as simplifying regulations facing businesses. DfID supports several micro finance programmes to promote access to credit and other financial services to poor people, both within India and in having better information about money transfer services for remittances from family and friends working abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/4">DfID supports rural livelihood programmes in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, which are designed to improve economic opportunities for poor people through increasing access to markets and diversifying livelihoods in the agricultural and non-farm sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/5">DfID supports governments and municipal authorities in Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh in efforts to improve urban management and the urban environment, particularly for poor people and slum-dwellers. Many aspects of these programmes will increase economic opportunities&mdash;e.g. by reducing the cost or time to fetch clean water, by improving roads to better link people, jobs and goods and services. There is also a local economic development component to these programmes, including business or skills training and grants for starting small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/6">DfID also assists the Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh with power sector programmes which are designed to improve efficiency and financial sustainability of the power sector in these states. Better-run services should reduce power outages and so remove a major constraint on firms' productivity, increasing investment and jobs in a range of sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/7">To increase educational opportunities, for the past two years DfID has been supporting the Indian Government's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) universal elementary education programme, together with the World Bank and the European Commission. DfID's commitment is &pound;210 million over the five years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08. SSA is the central government's prime vehicle for delivering on the universal primary education MDG and the 2002 constitutional amendment that made elementary education a fundamental right. The aim is to ensure that by 2015 all children in India are receiving eight years of basic education of acceptable quality, regardless of sex, caste, creed, family income or location.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/8">SSA is a priority for the Indian Government, who have greatly increased their funding of the programme in the past two years, in part funded by an earmarked tax. Large numbers of teachers are being recruited and trained, teaching and learning materials are in mass production, new schools and classrooms are under construction and there has been a huge drive to get children into school. Remarkable progress is being made:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/9" class="indent">enrolments for 2004&ndash;05 among the 6&ndash;14 years age group have reached 94 per cent (201 million children);</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/10" class="indent">the number of out-of-school children has fallen from 25 million in 2003 to 13.5 million in March 2005;</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/11" class="indent">drop out rates have fallen; and</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/12" class="indent">strong progress has been made towards gender and social equity, including for scheduled caste children and children with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/13">The remarkable progress with SSA is helping to ensure that all girls and boys in India can have the opportunity to complete a full course of primary education, though further large-scale investments in the primary education system are needed to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/14">DfID and other UK government departments are also supporting the Indian Government to access information, ideas and experience from the UK and elsewhere in diverse areas of education and skills development.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/15">Increasing economic and education opportunities is recognised and appreciated by our partners in India and is set to remain a key part of our support to India.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/16" class="italic">Pakistan</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/17">DfID Pakistan became a fully devolved operation in Islamabad only at the beginning of 2005. It has agreed a country assistance grant programme worth &pound;236 million with the Government of Pakistan for the period 2005&ndash;06 to 2008&ndash;09. Poverty reduction in all its many facets is the central focus of the programme, which operates under three major pillars: (a) income growth (including access to microfinance), (b) accountability of the state to its citizens (good and better governance) and (c) service delivery (including education, health and water and sanitation).</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/18">DfID recently released the first &pound;20 million tranche of the &pound;85 million poverty reduction budget support programme to the Government of Pakistan. Among the indicators for the first year is a requirement for increased social sector spending by the Government. This increased money in the Government of Pakistan's budget will have a national impact on improved education in Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/19">In addition to this, 17 per cent of the recently approved devolved social services programme in Punjab (total value $220 million) will be spent in the education sector, with a significant emphasis on adult literacy, a major issue for Pakistan where over 40 per cent of the population is illiterate. The aim of the programme is to achieve progress on the millennium development goals related to poverty, gender, education, health, and water and sanitation, with the purpose being to strengthen devolved social services for more equitable, efficient and sustainable delivery of social services in Punjab.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/20">In direct education programming, we are providing &pound;700,000 of funding to the National Education Assessment System, in collaboration with the World Bank. This programme is a government-led system of testing to establish quality of learning and the factors that influence that learning. Findings from the tests will help the Government of Pakistan better to address areas of concern in the education system, such as curriculum and teacher training, thereby improving the overall quality of the education system.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/21">DfID is actively supporting the Government of Pakistan's Poverty Reduction Strategy, which focuses on increasing incomes and employment opportunities for the poor through sustained economic growth. DfID poverty reduction budget support is aimed at helping the Government of Pakistan achieve their targets of accelerating economic growth while providing adequate social safety nets for the marginalised.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/22">On economic opportunities for the poor, DfID is providing &pound;20 million for increasing access to micro-finance through two large NGOs, the Kashf Foundation and Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN). With DfID support, Kashf is targeting to increase its clients (mostly poor women) from 75,000 to 300,000 in five years. The RSPN programme provides micro-finance, social mobilisation and building small-scale infrastructure to improve livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/23">DfID is also helping the Government of Pakistan to improve access to finance through analytical studies and information sharing on global best practices. The Government have asked us to support a household survey that would ascertain a baseline on access to financial services in Pakistan. As part of this programme, we recently submitted a report to the Government on the potential for increasing the level of remittances (mostly from the UK) to re-habilitate the earthquake affected household in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province (NWFP).</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/24">DfID is also helping to improve the enabling environment for investment and private sector development. In this connection, DfID is providing &pound;12 million to support a tax administration reforms programme. The programme aims at improving the tax administration culture through automation, capacity building and reducing corruption. DfID is also supporting the development of a competition framework and investment climate assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/25">In the Punjab province, DfID is helping the provincial government to develop a vision for private sector development and creation of employment opportunities. The programme focuses on improved infrastructure, reduced barriers to business and improved communication networks. DfID is also considering a large programme to improve income growth opportunities in the poorer districts of Punjab and NWFP.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.0/1">Since 1997, the Ministry of Defence has refused or omitted to give effect to recommendations of the Parliamentary Ombudsman in one case&mdash;that of the report <i>A Debt of Honour</i>, published in July 2005, which concerned the Far East Prisoners of War and Civilian Internee Ex Gratia Payment Scheme. The report made four recommendations; that the department should:</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/2" class="indent">review the operation of the ex-gratia scheme;</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/3" class="indent">fully reconsider the position of Professor Hayward, who had brought the complaint, and those in a similar position to him;</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/4" class="indent">apologise to Professor Hayward and to others in a similar position for the distress which the maladministration identified in the report had caused them; and</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/5" class="indent">consider whether it should express that regret tangibly.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/6">The department accepted immediately the third and fourth recommendations. The department initially rejected the first and second recommendations but subsequently discovered further information that led it to undertake a review of the scheme; the findings of this review were given in a Statement by my honourable friend the Minister for Veterans on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 681). In his Statement, the Minister for Veterans announced that eligibility under the scheme would be extended and, on the basis of the evidence that Professor Hayward provided to the ombudsman, we would now expect him to qualify under the scheme. The Ministry of Defence has now, in effect, implemented all the recommendations in the ombudsman's report.</p>

DfID is currently at an advanced stage in developing a new phase of support, jointly with other donors, which will include scaling up AIDS treatment in Zimbabwe. The aim is to establish a UN-managed multi-donor fund for procurement of anti-retroviral drugs, including paediatric formulations, that will be delivered through the public health service. This has necessarily involved UN-led technical discussions with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, which have been constructive. No DfID funding is going directly to the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/3">Along with other donors, DfID has also contributed &pound;23 million to a UNICEF-led programme of support for Zimbabwe's National Plan of Action for Orphans and Vulnerable Children. This programme offers grants to non-governmental organisations, faith-based organisations and their partners at the community level. Many children with AIDS will benefit from this programme. Priorities include keeping children in school and protecting children from all forms of abuse.</p>
