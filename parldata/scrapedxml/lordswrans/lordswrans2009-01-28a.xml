	<p pid="a.43.2/1">Risk management has been an important aspect of the development of the Afghan Social Outreach Program (ASOP), and a process which the UK has been involved in. Non-military risks and benefits have been identified, including the need to have close co-ordination with other government ministries to avoid overlaps. The community councils established under ASOP are designed to fill a hole in local governance left after the postponement of district council elections scheduled to take place in 2005. It is intended that community councils will cease to exist once democratically elected district councils are established in 2010. In insecure areas, ASOP forms a significant step toward improvements in local governance, by offering communities a means to present priorities and concerns to government. Rural development projects will not be adversely affected by ASOP councils, as these offer a single forum for prioritisation and co-ordination.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.5/1">It is vital to the UK that Afghanistan once more becomes a stable and secure state, able to suppress violent extremism within its borders therefore contributing to wider regional security. Britain's own security is at risk if we allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.5/2">UK forces, along with 41 other contributing nations, are in Afghanistan at the invitation of the democratically elected Afghan Government, with the support of the vast majority of Afghans and at the request of the United Nations. The reason we are there is to establish the right security environment in which accountable and effective institutions can develop and where Afghan-led reconstruction and development can be established.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.5/3">Our Armed Forces in Afghanistan consistently perform their duties with bravery, commitment and professionalism. They have a difficult job to do and the progress they have made is a credit to their proficiency and dedication. However, that progress has come at a high cost, including loss of life. Every military casualty is a tragedy and our condolences go to the families of the men and women killed in Afghanistan. We have no illusions about the challenges posed by those who oppose central government rule. But we have the right strategy for delivering success, and members of our Armed Forces are resolute in doing what their country asks of them.</p>

We do not agree that the formal arrangements need revision, but endorse fully the requirement to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the ANSF and international forces. In December 2008, Commander ISAF, General David McKiernan, issued a new tactical directive on respect for Afghan culture, specifically house searches, during military operations. This directive has been widely welcomed by the international community and represents a further significant step by ISAF in its efforts to minimise the impact of its operations on ordinary Afghans.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.3/1">The National Standards for Enforcement Agents are intended for use by enforcement agents rather than magistrates or Her Majesty's Courts Service fines officers. However, both magistrates and Her Majesty's Courts Service fines officers routinely consider the circumstances of defendants and defaulters as part of their decision-making process. Where issues of vulnerability are made known to them, these will be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/2">Her Majesty's Court Service contracts place a specific obligation on its private enforcement agents in respect of vulnerable members of society. This requires them to adhere to and implement these standards while engaged on enforcement activities on behalf of Her Majesty's Courts Service. They are instructed not to take any action to levy distress without prior reference to the court where the individual falls into one of categories deemed as vulnerable. Complaints by members of the public about the conduct of the contractor must be reported to Her Majesty's Courts Service regional contract managers together with details of how those complaints have been dealt with and resolved. These are reviewed as part of the contract management process.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/3">The contract requires AEAs to provide a monthly management report to HMCS regional contractor managers on contractor performance. The report provides details on the execution rate of warrants, training undertaken by contractor staff and any complaints received by the contractor on action taken by their staff. Contractors must report any circumstances and situations where a complaint or issue is raised by defaulters who consider the enforcement of the warrant has been undertaken inappropriately or incorrectly. These will include any situations involving those in the vulnerable person categories. Any complaints or correspondence received by contractors must be investigated. In addition, Her Majesty's Court Service regional management will investigate the complaint to determine that the bailiff took the correct action or if the situation requires further investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/4">Further reporting protocols in new proposed contracts will strengthen the control and monitoring arrangements available to HMCS on contractor performance. This includes quarterly and six-month assurance reporting. There is also a requirement for each contractor to make an annual operation report reviewing their management of the contract. Combined, these reports form the basis for the HMCS director of enforcement to make an annual report covering the operation of all regional contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/5">The reports received as the six-month and yearly stages of the contract would be reviewed and reported on to the HMCS compliance and enforcement and main HMCS management boards as part of this report. It is expected that the contractor will detail its procedures and processes and the agreed authorisation methods with each HMCS region and area within these reporting requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.5/1">The Government have no plans at this time to seek to ratify the Fourth Protocol with reservations. The Government's concerns with Article 2 relate to the particular nature of British nationality and immigration arrangements which permit a person to be lawfully within United Kingdom territory without necessarily permitting them to be lawfully within all parts of United Kingdom territory. This may particularly conflict with the provision under Article 2(1) that &quot;Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence&quot;. This assessment has been made by the Government on the basis of the advice of officials and lawyers; there would obviously be no substantive assessment of the compatibility of British law and policy with these obligations by the European Court of Human Rights or our domestic courts unless and until the obligations were accepted by the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.5/1">The number of occasions on which the Secretary of State has refused to sign a warrant is not recorded centrally.

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">Given that only two applications, both found inadmissible, have been made during the period of nearly four years since the United Kingdom accepted the right of individual petition under the Optional Protocol to the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Government wish to see which further applications are made under this Optional Protocol, how they are handled by the relevant committee at the United Nations, and whether their outcome demonstrates substantive benefit to people in the United Kingdom from individual petition. This will assist the Government in assessing the advantages and disadvantages of other individual petition mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">As the noble Lord is aware, the structure of discrimination law in the United Kingdom developed separately from the broad principle of equality founded on human rights. However, our discrimination law specifically prohibits unjustified discrimination in the performance of public functions and the provision of goods, facilities and services, and the principle that like cases should be treated alike is also recognised by our courts in the context of judicial review of administrative action. Combined with the prohibition on discrimination in the protection of the convention rights, most of which are civil and political rights, under the Human Rights Act, there are a broad range of means by which individuals may challenge discriminatory treatment in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.0/1">Community rules governing the labelling of wine marketed in the European Union make no provision for the ingredients or products used in the process of winemaking to be labelled. However, food labelling arrangements under Directive 2000/13/EC require that ingredients derived from specific allergenic foods that are used in the production of wine, such as sulphites, be displayed on the label using a &quot;contains X&quot; statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/2">The European Commission has published a proposal for ingredient listings on alcoholic drinks. However, the Commission also proposes an exemption for wine, beers and spirits pending a report by the Commission. There are currently no clear views from other member states, which have yet to discuss this issue in detail.</p>
