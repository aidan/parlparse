This fund will be allocated to individual farmers severely affected by low dairy prices and, as a result, encountering liquidity problems. Following discussions with the farming industry, we are currently consulting stakeholders on options as to how best allocate this money. The option chosen will be done on the basis of providing help to farmers, in a non-discriminatory way, while keeping administrative costs to a minimum and supporting a competitive dairy sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">Defra's consultation relates to England. However, it is part of a UK-wide consultation process within which the devolved Administrations are conducting parallel consultations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, seeking views on the same two options.</p>

It should be noted that data from these monitored sites alone might underestimate the number of actual exceedences of the NO2 limit value. A full assessment of exceedences on the basis of both modelled and monitored data will be reported to the European Commission in September 2010.</p>

It is possible to travel by public transport between Louth, Gainsborough and Cullompton and their alternative courts in time for the start of court hearings and after hearings have ended. There is no regular public transport between Launceston and Bodmin that fits with court start and finish times. However, this has been the position in the East Cornwall local justice area for many years and, since the transferral of most cases to Bodmin in 2000, allowances for travel time have been made when listing cases involving someone from the Launceston area who is dependent on public transport.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.0/1">The safety of personal information is of paramount importance to the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). The department has stringent procedures in place to safeguard the security of data from the National Pupil Database (NPD) and there have been no breaches of security.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/2">The National Pupil Database is held at the DCSF Darlington headquarters' data warehouse on the DCSF internal network which is connected to the Government Secure Intranet (GSI). Access to the full database is limited to a small team of seven staff in DCSF's Darlington office, which produces extracts from the NPD to support wider analytical work.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/3">Individual pupil information from the NPD may be disclosed only to a &quot;prescribed person&quot; for specific purposes defined by the Education (Individual Pupil Information) (Prescribed Persons) Regulations 2009. The data in the NPD may be shared with other government departments and agencies for these purposes. The DCSF may also disclose individual pupil information to independent researchers who a legitimate need for it for their research, but each case will be determined on its merits and subject to the approval of the department's chief statistician.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/4">The data held in the NPD are used to inform, influence and improve education policy and to monitor the performance of the education service as a whole. For example, the NPD is used to calculate contextualised value added (CVA) to measure school effectiveness and is also used to compare pupils' national curriculum assessment, GCSE and post-16 attainment by key pupil characteristics such as ethnic group, special educational needs status and free school meals eligibility to help set and measure national indicators and targets. The inclusion of postcode data allows for residency-based analyses to help target resources as effectively as possible; for example, matched data extracts are routinely provided to local authorities to help monitor indicators and targets and inform their funding formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/5">The NPD is a longitudinal database and a valuable resource for research into educational achievement and participation. The information currently held allows for the tracking of pupil attainment at key stage 5 with their achievement back to key stage 1. Additionally, the NPD includes information about further education (FE) achievements and higher education (HE) entry data, matched to achievements at school. Our retention policy, including archiving data with the National Archive, is currently being developed as part of gaining accreditation to ISO 27001.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.2/1">The response to the Committee on Petitions from Ministry of Justice officials states that we would not agree that the European Parliament (House of Lords Disqualification) Regulations 2008 are discriminatory in nature. The position of hereditary Peers was given full consideration by the House of Lords during the debate held on those regulations on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-14">14 October 2008</phrase>. The response explains that the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill that is currently before Parliament includes provision to allow a person who is a life Peer or an hereditary Peer who is a member of the House of Lords to resign at any time from the House of Lords. We consider that this provision, if it is approved by Parliament, will address the issues raised in petition 1737/2008, as it will ensure that any member of the House of Lords who is elected to the European Parliament may resign their membership of the House of Lords in order to take up his or her membership of the European Parliament.</p>

In order for the proceeds from the sale of donated goods to qualify as a gift under the current Gift Aid legislation, the donor must know the amount for which the goods have sold and confirm that this amount is to be treated as a gift. It is only after the goods are sold that the donor can confirm that they have paid the tax which is to be repaid to the charity. Without these assurances Gift Aid cannot apply to the gift, which is why there is a requirement to contact the donor.</p>
