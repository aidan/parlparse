	<p pid="a.170.8/1" qnum="HL9712">To ask Her Majesty's Government what response they are making to Macmillan Cancer Support's concern about the effect on cancer patients of time-limiting contribution-based employment and support allowance for those in the Work-Related Activity Group to 12 months, in view of cancer patients often requiring longer than 12 months to return to work because of their condition and a lack of suitable jobs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-06-14a.170.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100992" speakername="Lord Freud" colon=":" colnum="170"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110614w0001.htm#11061456000114">
	<p pid="a.170.9/1">Time-limiting will only affect those who receive contributory ESA and who are placed in the Work Related Activity Group. ESA was never intended to be a benefit for the long term for people in the Work Related Activity Group. A time-limit of one year strikes a balance between allowing people with longer-term conditions to adjust to their health condition and providing a level of access to contributory benefits that is appropriate for contributory benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.9/2">People receiving contributory ESA in the Work Related Activity Group will have access to the full range of employment support including the Work Programme. Those whose benefit has come to an end as a result of the twelve month time limit can remain on the programme if they wish, which will ensure that they continue to receive all the support they need to help them return to, and remain in, work.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.9/3">We recognise that people with most severe health conditions may need longer-term support. People with the most serious disabilities and health conditions, including many people with cancer, who are placed in the Support Group will not be subject to time-limiting. This includes people who are receiving courses of certain types of chemotherapy, who are automatically placed in the Support Group. And we have just amended legislation so that individuals awaiting or between courses of certain types of chemotherapy will also automatically be placed in the Support Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.9/4">The 12-month time limit will not apply to anyone receiving income-related ESA, whatever group they are assigned to. People moving off contributory ESA as a result of the time limit will be able to apply for income-related ESA (if eligible) if they still require support.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.9/5">We are determined that the social security system should support people who are diagnosed with cancer in the most sensitive, fair and appropriate way and have been working with Macmillan and others to achieve this. As part of his second independent review of the work capability assessment (WCA), Professor Harrington has asked Macmillan Cancer Support to look into how people with cancer are assessed and to make recommendations for improvements. In particular, Professor Harrington has asked Macmillan Cancer Support to consider whether people receiving oral chemotherapy should be placed directly into the Support Group. We look forward to receiving Professor Harrington and Macmillan's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.0/1">The UK fell in the PISA mathematics ranking from eighth (of 32) countries in 2000 to 28th (of 65) countries in 2009. One reason is that new countries joining the survey are outperforming the UK. Some countries already in the survey are raising their score and moving above us. In PISA 2009, England had a relatively small score gap between high and low achievers-compared to the top-performing countries England had fewer high achievers in mathematics.

	<p pid="a.175.0/2">The schools White Paper, <I>The Importance of Teaching</I>, signalled the Government's desire to learn from the best in the world. This includes the commitment to ensure that as many mathematics lessons as possible are taught by specialists. There will be stronger incentives to encourage the best graduates to become maths teachers, and a selection of subject enhancement programmes to develop and sustain teachers' continuing professional development across all phases of the school curriculum. We will also seek to improve the specialist subject expertise of graduates in related subjects who teach mathematics in schools. Through the national curriculum review, we are ensuring that our curriculum compares favourably against the curricula of top-performing countries, including those that rank highly in PISA scores for mathematics. The schools White Paper also signals the Government's determination to improve all aspects of schooling by:</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/3">sharply reducing the bureaucratic burden on schools;setting clear expectations for what children must know and be able to do at each stage in their education;ensuring proper assessment of pupils at each vital transitional stage;restoring the authority of teachers and head teachers;increasing freedom and autonomy for all schools;strengthening accountability by putting far more information into the public domain; and making it clear that schools-governors, head teachers and teachers-have responsibility for improvement.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/2">Clinical services are defined as services that are provided to patients in England on behalf of the National Health Service. Where providers of such services were acting as undertakings they would be subject to competition law. This has been the case since the UK joined the European Union. For commissioners of NHS services, the case law suggests that they are unlikely to be acting as undertakings in respect of their purchasing activities, whether for clinical or non-clinical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/3">Commissioners would, however, be subject to EU procurement law as they are now. This has been the case since the UK joined the European Union.

	<p pid="a.185.2/1">The UK Government are very concerned about malnutrition in Zimbabwe. As the UNICEF report indicates, undernutrition results from a combination of poor dietary intake and disease. Other contributing factors include: poor access to basic services (health, water and sanitation) and the low status afforded to women. Improving nutrition requires interventions on a number of fronts.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.2/2">The UK has been supporting a range of interventions which tackle the multiple causes of undernutrition in Zimbabwe. For example we have provided 47,000 people with access to anti-retroviral treatment and other key medicines in 2010. We have provided cash transfers to 45,000 people and agricultural inputs to over 1,200,000 people in 2010-11.</p>
