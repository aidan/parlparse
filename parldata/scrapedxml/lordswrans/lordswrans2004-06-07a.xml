	<p pid="a.1.8/1">Coalition Provisional Authority advisers to the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) do have access to some figures on civilian deaths. However these statistics are not reliable, as Iraqis often bury their deceased relatives without official notification/registration. This has been particularly true during periods of heightened conflict. The MoH does not therefore have accurate figures for civilian deaths or their causes for the past year. The MoH is gradually re-establishing standard practices and procedures, although these are basic. In the longer term the Iraqi Interim Government may be able to evaluate the causes of civilian deaths and injuries.</p>

We fully support the efforts of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to end permanently the use of forced labour. Burma's general system of preferences trade privileges were suspended by the EC in 1997 in response to our concerns over forced labour in country. The EU has repeatedly condemned Burma's lack of progress on forced labour, most recently in March, at the ILO's meetings in Geneva. In June 2004, the ILO's governing body will give further consideration to the situation in Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.0/1">During the period <phrase class="date" code="1993-04-01">1 April 1993</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, 47 incidents (complaints) concerning allegations of ill health from exposure to sulphuric acid had been received and investigated by HSE's Field Operations Directorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/2">The complaints were predominantly raised by members of the public, typically passers-by or local residents, but included a number of occupationally related incidents raised by spray operators and other workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/3">The conditions of approval for the use of sulphuric acid as a pesticide in relation to period of notice and exclusion of unprotected individuals were not relevant to every incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/4">In eight of the 22 incidents involving the owners/residents of properties within 25 metres of the land being treated, prior written notification had been provided by users. In 12 of the incidents, prior written notification had not been provided. In the remaining two incidents, the information was not accurately recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/5">In 10 of the 15 incidents involving members of the public alleging various failures to comply with good application practice, adequate warning notices had been posted in footpaths/at points of access to or adjacent to the treated crop. In three of the incidents, adequate warning notices had not been posted. In one incident the information was not accurately recorded and the remaining incident related to alleged exposures over a period of time rather than to any identifiable, specific application/treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/6">Of the remining incidents, three concerned passing road users, three occupational exposure and in the remaining four incidents, the status of the complainant and the relevance of the conditions of approval was not clear from the investigation report.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/1">The basis of the Prime Minister's statement that &quot;economic growth would be almost &frac12; per cent lower over the next two years if net migration were to cease&quot; lies in the Treasury's trend growth assessment, as explained in recent Pre-Budget and Budget Reports and the paper <i>Trend Growth: Recent Developments and Prospects</i>, HM Treasury, April 2002, published alongside Budget 2002. Net inward migration contributes to economic growth by adding to the population of working age and hence labour supply. Treasury assumptions about growth in the population of working age are informed by recent data and Government Actuary's Department projections. Latest data for net inward migration show that it contributed 0.4 percentage points to growth in the population of working age betwen 2001 and 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.3/2">The international representatives' grant aid programme (IRGAP), operated by UK Sport, was set up to assist international postholders with the travel and subsistence costs they incur while attending scheduled meetings of their international federations. Standard estimates for the costs of travel to, and subsistence within, a country are the basis of grant calculations for the grant that postholders receive. Senior postholders will receive between 75-100 per cent of the estimated costs of any particular trip as a grant, depending on the priority. A grant (G) is calculated according to the following formula: G = P [&quot;T + D + (S x N)&quot; - &quot;C + K&quot;], where travel costs are (T), the distance rate (From &pound;0&ndash;&pound;100) depending on which part of the UK the journey starts (D), the daily subsistence rate (S), the number of days a meeting lasts (N), cash subsidies provided by the international federation (C), accommodation or in-kind assistance provided by the host (K), the grant allocation percentage determined by UK Sport (P).</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/3">It should be noted that a significant number of international representatives do not receive grants because their international federations and/or meeting hosts subsidise all the travel and subsistence costs either in cash or in kind. In those instances, the individual is not eligible for IRGAP grants.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-06-07a.24.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="24"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040607/text/40607w07.htm#40607w07_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.24.2/1">The Government do not specify the content of the general practitioner training curriculum. This is the job of the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice, which is the competent authority for general practice training in the United Kingdom. The JCPTGP is an independent professional body, and it is required by Section 9(3) of the Vocational Training Regulations 1997 to determine and publish the curriculum to be followed by a GP registrar (that is a trainee GP).</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/2">The regulations do specify seven competencies which must be tested, and which the curriculum must therefore teach:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/3" class="indent">factual medical knowledge sufficient to enable the doctor to perform the duties of a GP;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/4" class="indent">the ability to apply factual medical knowledge to the management of problems presented by patients in general practice;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/5" class="indent">effective communication, both orally and in writing;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/6" class="indent">the ability to consult satisfactorily with general practice patients;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/7" class="indent">the ability to review and critically analyse the practitioner's own working practices and to manage any necessary changes appropriately;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/8" class="indent">clinical skills; and</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/9" class="indent">the ability to synthesise all of the above competencies and apply them appropriately in a general practice setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/10">GPs are therefore expected to learn in training the skills needed to deal with all their patients.</p>
