	<p pid="c.154.8/1">The UK's relations with Belarus are closely co-ordinated with EU partners to maximise influence. The EU's benchmarks and the common position limit ministerial contact, but offer Belarus improved relations with the EU in exchange for better behaviour on democracy and human rights. Under the UK presidency, the EU called clearly for the forthcoming presidential elections to be free and fair and agreed that the EU would consider restrictive measures if they were not. We call upon the government of Belarus to invite the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to monitor these elections and stand ready to provide election observers to the OSCE's international election observer mission. We are also keen to increase engagement with the Belarusian people. The EU has therefore outlined further steps to be taken to this end and to strengthen support for civil society, including through technical assistance and by opening a European Commission delegation in Minsk. We will support and encourage efforts to take this agenda forward in 2006, through our bilateral diplomacy and programme assistance with our partners.</p>

	<p pid="c.157.2/1">The FOI Act gives the Secretary of State power to set an upper limit (known as the appropriate limit) for the cost of responding to FOI requests. The public authority is not required to comply with requests whose cost exceeds that limit. The Act also enables the Secretary of State to make regulations for public authorities to charge for requests that cost less than the appropriate limit. Under the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 the appropriate limit was set at &pound;600 for requests to central government and &pound;450 for requests to public authorities outside central government. Public authorities could only charge for the cost of disbursements (such as photocopying and postage) if the cost of complying with the request was less than the upper limit.</p>
	<p pid="c.157.2/2">DCA has no plans at present to revise either the appropriate limits or to change the fees that may be charged under those limits. As with any new regulations, however, provision was made for a review of fees and a ministerial commitment was given at the time of the passage of the regulations through Parliament that this should take place after the Act came into force. The timetable for any review has not been set and no decisions have been taken on the scope of any review.</p>

The average clearance time for claims made by veterans of the 1991 Gulf conflict is 95 days for 2002&ndash;03, 86 days for 2003&ndash;04 and 89 days for the year 2004&ndash;05.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-24c.160.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="160"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060124/text/60124w03.htm#60124w03_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.160.3/1">Revenue allocations are made direct to primary care trusts (PCTs), not to strategic health authorities. The allocations are made to PCTs on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A robust population base is determined for each allocation round. The allocations are then calculated using a weighted capitation formula. The formula determines PCTs' target shares of available resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.3/2">The components of the formula are used to weight each PCT's &quot;crude&quot; population according to their relative need (age, and additional need) for healthcare and the unavoidable geographical differences in the cost of providing healthcare (the market forces factor). The formula is used to set targets, which then inform allocations. The formula does not determine allocations. Actual allocations reflect decisions on the speed at which PCTs are brought nearer to target through the distribution of extra funds (pace of change policy).</p>
