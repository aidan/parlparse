	<p pid="a.132.3/1">We are pleased to announce the start of an assessment phase (AP) to be led by Lockheed Martin UK Ltd, with Westland Helicopters Ltd as strategic sub-contractor, to determine how best to sustain the capability of the Royal Navy's Merlin Mk1 helicopters for future operations. Merlin Mk1 already delivers a quantum leap in capability over the aircraft it succeeded, the Sea King Mk6, and is recognised as crucial across the spectrum of maritime operations. We anticipate an upgraded aircraft entering service towards the end of the decade, building on significant operational experience and technological advances to ensure that the full potential of this versatile and capable aircraft is realised and that it continues to meet our security challenges for decades to come. The AP, costing &pound;18 million, will investigate the most cost-effective way to sustain this world-beating capability and the scope for enhancements to broaden the utility and versatility of the aircraft. The partnering of Lockheed Martin as prime contractor with the world-class manufacturing skills of Westland as strategic sub-contractor is believe to offer the lowest risk to the Ministry of Defence. The AP is planned to complete at the end of 2004 after which a decision will be made on the scope and programme for the demonstration and manufacture phase.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.3/1">The end year flexibility (EYF) scheme applies to the NI departmental expenditure limit (DEL), and as a consequence all organisations which are funded from this source can benefit in that the resources available to Northern Ireland are higher than would otherwise be the case. Within this arrangement there is automatic carry-over for some specified categories of expenditure, the largest of which is capital: for the remainder the amount carried over is returned for central redistribution to programmes early in the following financial year. In the case of North/South bodies, the budgets are set for each calendar year, as distinct from financial year, and thus there is no scope for specific EYF arrangements for their individual budgets. In practice, the contributions from Northern Ireland and Ireland to North/South bodies can be managed to address any planning issues that emerge.</p>

We announced in February that the next stage in this process, formal public consulation on draft revised regulations, will take place later this year. We aim to have the revised regulations in force by April 2004.

	<p pid="a.146.2/1">In the light of today's publication of British Energy's preliminary results for the financial year 2002&ndash;03, I am taking this opportunity to inform the House about two aspects of the restructuring plan: the value of the aid that Her Majesty's Government have agreed to give to the company based on BE's estimates of its liabilities; and the company's plan to dispose of its 50 per cent stake in Amergen, its joint venture in the US.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/2">Value of the aid</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/3">In his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November 2002</phrase>, my noble friend Lord McIntosh said that the Government would contribute significantly to the company's &pound;2.1 billion of historic nuclear fuel liabilities that are managed by BNFL and extend to 2086. In addition he said that the Government would underwrite the fund that will be used to pay for the costs of decommissioning BE's nuclear power stations. These costs together with BE's uncontracted liabilities were estimated in the company's statement to the Stock Exchange on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-28">28 November</phrase> at &pound;1.6 billion. To the extent that BE's payments fall short of the fund's requirements, the Government will make up the difference. He stated that the cost to government of meeting these liabilities would average &pound;150 million to &pound;200 million a year for the next ten years and would fall thereafter. The DTI is currently considering how the value of its aid for BE should be reported in its annual accounts for 2002&ndash;03, and will be discussing this with the National Audit Office,</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/4">BE today has estimated the total value of government's indemnity as &pound;3.6 billion (net present value) in their preliminary annual results for their financial year 2002&ndash;03. This figure is simply the difference between their estimate of the total liabilities underwritten by government and funds held by the Nuclear Liabilities Fund (NLF). It does not include an estimate of the future contributions by BE to the NLF to fund its own liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/5">We expect the European Commission may shortly disclose, as part of the state aids process, a valuation of &pound;3.3 billion (net present value) for the aid. This figure was prepared according to EC requirements. It is calculated by discounting the estimated amount of aid that government might provide after taking into account an estimate of the amount that the company will contribute to fund its own liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/6">This &pound;3.3 billion figure includes &pound;0.9 billion for the estimated value to BE of a tax disregard provided for in the Electricity (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, the commitment to contribute significantly to the historic nuclear fuel liabilities, and an estimate of government's contribution to decommissioning and uncontracted liabilities. The tax disregard will not result in any extra cost to the Government. It has been provided to avoid a large tax charge hitting BE as a result of the aid and thus the need for the aid to be correspondingly higher to achieve the same effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/7">It is important to note that estimates of this kind are subject to a significant degree of uncertainty, particularly when different accounting treatments, assumptions, and discount rates are used in their calculation. The key points are that government's underlying commitment remains the same as it was last year and that our estimates of the cost to government (&pound;150 million&ndash;&pound;200 million a year on average for the next 10 years falling thereafter) is unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/8">Amergen</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/9">British Energy has been taking steps to realise its 50 per cent interest in Amergen, in accordance with the restructuring principles agreed with the Government on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/10">The company had planned to be in a position to enter into a sale agreement by <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase>. I understand from BE that although discussions with a number of interested parties are ongoing, this timetable will not now be achieved. British Energy, however, has reaffirmed its intention to dispose of its interest in Amergen as soon as practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/11">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has confirmed to British Energy that, in view of the progress made to date to sell British Energy's interest in Amergen, she can continue to support the restructuring. However, as my noble friend said in his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-28">28 November</phrase>, the Government remain prepared for administration in the event that, for whatever reason, the restructuring fails.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.2/1">The best figures on song thrush numbers in gardens come from the RSPB's long-running &quot;Big Garden Birdwatch&quot;. From 1979 to 2003 there was a decline of 31.1 per cent in the mean number of song thrushes recorded in each garden taking part in the survey. Comparing 2003 with 1985 (when the survey was carried out much more regularly), the decline is 57.1 per cent. These figures show that the decline in numbers occurring in gardens is similar to the overall national trend during the same period. There is the suggestion that the decline since 1985 in gardens has been greater than the national trend but a more detailed anlaysis of the data would be needed to confirm this.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/2">The BTO has carried out a garden bird survey &quot;Garden Birdwatch&quot; since 1995 which suggests that song thrush numbers in gardens have been roughly stable in the period 1995&ndash;2003, a trend mirrored by national Breeding Bird Survey data from all habitats.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">The Pesticide Safety Directorate has published reviews of methiocarb (1998) and metaldehyde (1996), two of the major components of slug pellets. The report for methiocarb raised concerns regarding the effects on small mammal populations and noted a high risk to mammals. Methiocarb has high acute toxicity to birds, but considered the risks of direct poisoning of birds from slug pellets quite unlikely because of the repellants used in their manufacture. Metaldehyde was considered to pose a high risk to small mammals and birds from primary and secondary poisoning. Acute poisoning of birds can therefore result from slug pellets, although the number of recorded incidents is relatively few.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/2">Methiocarb does however pose a high risk to some non-target invertebrate populations. As a result, slug pellets, along with other broad-spectrum insecticides, may have contributed to observed declines in farmland invertebrate populations, which include prey items for farmland birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/3">Such potential indirect effects of pesticides acting on bird populations via changes in their food supply are not currently considered during pesticide registration. However, the Pesticide Safety Directorate has established a subgroup of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, currently chaired by English Nature, with the aim of proposing methods for assessing wider biodiversity effects of pesticides.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/2" qnum="HL2980">Whether they will set out the statistical basis for the statement made in the House of Lords on 14 May by the Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: &quot;We subsidise every cow in Europe to the tune of two dollars a day&quot; (HL Deb, col. 291); whether this figure also applies to the United Kingdom; if not, what would be the appropriate figure for the United Kingdom; and whether they will set out the statistical basis for the figure which does apply to the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/1">The quoted figure is based on the latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Producer Support Estimate (PSE) for 2000 of 16.8 billion US dollars for the dairy sector. In 2000 there were estimated to be 20.7 million dairy cows suggesting support in 2000 of 2.22 or 2.04 US dollars per cow per day.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/2">The PSE is an internationally respected measure of the annual monetary value of gross transfer at the farm gate from consumers (through prices higher than world levels) and taxpayers (through direct support) arising from policy measures that support agricultural production.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/3">Using the same methodology, but looking at the UK in 2000 suggests a support figure per dairy cow of around 1.60 US dollars. This lower UK figure is a consequence of particularly low prices in the UK compared with the EU as a whole in 2000, following a sharp appreciation of sterling against the euro.</p>
