	<p pid="a.43.2/2">This means approximately 2,650 personnel who are unable to deploy, but the vast majority of whom are contributing to military capability in supporting roles in home locations. A little under half of these service men and women are unable to deploy for non-medical reasons, such as compassionate or disciplinary circumstances, or because they are under the age of 18.</p>

The current restrictions (which cover the period October 2006 until October 2012) seek to strike a fair balance between the protection of local communities from excessive aircraft noise levels at night and the provision of air services at night where they are of benefit of the national, regional or local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.5/2">Details about the economic benefits of permitting night flights formed part of the regulatory impact assessment which accompanied the June 2006 decision document setting the noise restrictions for the 2006-12 period.

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">The cost of equalising pensions for Gurkhas at the same level as the Armed Forces Pension Scheme has been estimated by the Government Actuary's Department at approximately &#163;1.5 billion, at 2007 prices, comprising a one-off payment of &#163;500 million and &#163;50 million each year for 20 years. This would mostly apply to around 10 per cent of the retired Gurkha community, largely officers, where there is a more significant difference between the Gurkha Pension Scheme and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. In the majority of cases Gurkhas receive at least equivalent value from their pensions, due to the early age at which they can begin receiving payments, compared to those on Armed Forces Pension Scheme 75, or its predecessor.</p>

The original procedure advised by HKID was for 4B applicants to apply for an Hong Kong special administrative region passport. If these applicants had not registered or naturalised as Chinese citizens, nor had an automatic claim to Chinese citizenship, their application would be rejected and they would be issued with a full refund for the passport fee. The rejection letter would serve as documentary evidence in their application for registration as a British citizen under Section 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981. After four days of using this procedure, HKID requested that it be changed. Both sides agreed to simplify the process, with the BCG liaising directly with HKID to verify whether 4B applicants had registered or naturalised, or whether they had an automatic claim to Chinese citizenship.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">Section 89 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 places a duty on the Highways Agency to remove litter from motorways in England. Responsibility for removing litter from the all-purpose trunk road network, with the exception of roads managed by a design, build, finance operate company lies with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">Litter collection on motorways is one of the numerous duties carried out as part of the Highway's Agency's routine maintenance function and costs for individual activities are not recorded separately. It is therefore not possible to provide costs for litter collection.</p>
