	<p pid="a.291.2/1">We are aware of reports of the Deputy Secretary of the Afghan Lower House of Parliament's remarks regarding a call for the execution of Christian converts from Islam. The remarks were made during a debate over a recent series of Afghan television reports, which showed video footage of Afghans converting to Christianity. As a result, two international non-government organisations (Norwegian Church Aid and Church World Services) have been accused of proselytising and are currently under investigation by Afghan authorities. Under Afghan law, proselytising is illegal and conversion from Islam is a capital offence. We are following the investigation closely, but cannot pre-empt the findings at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/2">The Government are opposed to the death penalty under all circumstances and continues to strive for the global abolition of capital punishment. The Government also strongly support the right to freedom of religion or belief, including full implementation of those norms laid out in Article 2 of the Afghan Constitution which provides for freedom of religion. As an EU member, the UK adopted a set of EU council conclusions on Freedom of Religion or Belief. These conclusions reaffirm the EU's commitment to promote and protect freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, including the right to adopt, change or abandon one's religion or belief, of one's own free will. The Government are working to support all individuals who face discrimination and persecution on the basis of religion, including Christians, wherever they are in the world. Pending the outcome of the investigation, we will raise this matter with the Afghan Government as necessary. We are not aware of any reports of converts to Christianity being tried or executed for apostasy in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.5/1">The issue of airside passes is controlled by Birmingham International Airport acting under the guidance of the Department for Transport. Aviation security records show that the deputy head of the Secretariat for the IMB chair contacted the airport management in July 2009 to enquire about the process for obtaining passes and explaining the statutory role of the IMB.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.5/2">The airport contacted the Department for Transport to clarify the role of the IMB, which did not appear amongst the list of statutory bodies held by DfT. It would seem that an initial delay arose whilst clarification was sought over the use by the IMB of the phrase &quot;exemption&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.5/3">The DfT corresponded directly with the IMB to explain that exempted status was confined to a small number of groups seeking access to airside areas, for example armed police patrols.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.5/4">All other persons, including control agencies, are subject to body and baggage searches. Once it had been confirmed that IMB members were not seeking exempt status, to which they would not have been entitled, the process for obtaining passes was set in train. A further delay ensued because, as with all applicants for passes, references had to be obtained and a suitable sponsor identified. Local UKBA management only learnt of the issue in late October 2009 and immediately intervened to support the pass application process. At no time was there was any objection in principle to the issuing of the passes.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.2/1">In February 2003 the previous Government announced that anyone wishing to make an asylum claim would need to do so in person, and postal applications for asylum would no longer be accepted. This change was made as part of the reform of the asylum system and sought to minimise potential abuse. Although we expect individuals to make their claim at a port of entry, it ensures that those who submit a claim for asylum as their circumstances have changed whilst in the UK, are properly introduced to the asylum system.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.8/1">This Government are committed to the radical devolution of power, away from Westminster and Whitehall to local councils, communities and homes across the nation. This includes more financial freedom for local government in exchange for greater transparency and accountability to citizens. Localism and decentralisation are key priorities. They will allow radical reform and enable councils to deliver savings. Rapid progress is already being made in this balance of power shake-up, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.8/2">consultation with councils about where best to reduce burdens on them;a move away from the wasteful inefficiency of central targets and towards local accountability with the scrapping of comprehensive area assessment which cost taxpayers between &#163;12 million and &#163;39 million a year; and the introduction of a Bill to stop council restructuring in Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk which will save the taxpayer &#163;40 million in unnecessary costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.8/3">The Government have already taken action on expenditure reductions by pledging to freeze council tax for 2011-12, and will seek to freeze it for a further year, in partnership with local government. The Government have also provided councils with greater flexibility for local spending decisions through removing restrictions on some &#163;1.2 billion of grants this year. There is still a lot of potential gain through new practices, for example shared services, joint working and smarter procurement procedures. The radical town hall transparency that this Government have announced will be a driver for such change.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.8/4">In the Queen's Speech, legislation was announced which, alongside other policy changes, will devolve greater powers to councils and neighbourhoods and give local communities control over housing and planning decisions.</p>

The specific power to issue a nolle prosequi-which was formerly held by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland and which acts to terminate any prosecution on indictment-was transferred on devolution of justice and policing to the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
