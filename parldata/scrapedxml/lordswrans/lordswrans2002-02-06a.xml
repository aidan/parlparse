	<p pid="a.94.6/1">The criteria for the selection of priority habitats requiring habitat action plans were published in December 1995 by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group. The steering group decided that habitats requiring habitat action plans must meet one or more of the following criteria: habitats for which the UK has international obligations; habitats at risk, such as those with a high rate of decline especially over the last 20 years, or which are rare; areas, particularly marine areas, which may be functionally critical (essential for organisms inhabiting wider ecosystems such as sea grass beds for spawning fish); areas important for key species i.e. UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.6/2">Habitat action plans for 45 priority habitats that met these criteria were published by October 1999. A subsequent review of the gaps in the priority habitats series carried out by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee identified a further seven priority habitats thought to meet the criteria. Ponds of high ecological quality are one of the habitats identified.</p>

The project team will clarify the roles and responsibilities and interventions of government to help sport better achieve its own objectives. They will develop an overall strategy for guiding government's decisions on sports policy (including major events) and review the existing institutional and financial arrangements in the context of government's own wider objectives. The initial scoping note for the project is available on the PIU website (<a href="http://www.piu.gov.uk/2001/sport/scope.shtml">http://www.piu.gov.uk/2001/sport/scope.shtml</a>). My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will be the sponsor Minister for the project. The unit aims to complete its study by summer 2002.</p>
