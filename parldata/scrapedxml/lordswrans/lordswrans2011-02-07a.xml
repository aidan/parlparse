	<p pid="a.10.2/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, as amended, provides that no payment shall be made for donation unless specified in directions by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/2">Any payment to egg donors is therefore a matter for the HFEA. The HFEA launched a consultation on egg and sperm donation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-17">17 January 2011</phrase>, which includes the issue of payments to donors for inconvenience or expenses. The Government have not had discussions with the HFEA about this. The consultation states:</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/3">&quot;The law on the donation of sperm, eggs and embryos is set both by UK legislation and by a European directive which was implemented in 2007. This legal framework means that the UK has a responsibility to ensure that:</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/4">donation is voluntary and unpaid;</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/5">donors act from altruistic motives;</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/6">donation is in the spirit of contributing to a wider social good ('solidarity between donor and recipient' is the term used in law); and</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/7">there is an adequate supply of donor tissues and cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/8">Payment for donation is not allowed by law. The essence of donation is the act of giving. Because the act of giving is generous and humane, the law does allow donors to receive compensation for inconvenience. This is different from and additional to compensation for expenses and loss of earnings&quot;.</p>

No role is assigned to the authority in relation to appeals, which are considered by a separate appeals committee as established by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Appeals) Regulations 2009 (SI2009/1891).

	<p pid="a.22.2/1">The findings of the report are disappointing, given the level of dissatisfaction of many people with dementia and their carers with the quality of dementia care in the home. As the report makes clear, people with dementia want to stay at home and remain independent for as long as possible. It is not a question of spending more to make this possible. The report shows that there are savings to be made if people with dementia stay at home rather than entering residential care or going into hospital. The recommendations contained in the report are entirely consistent with the Government's policy on dementia care and the objectives in the national dementia strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.5/1">The financial impact of the abolition of the Health Protection Agency (HPA) was redacted from the published impact assessment. The HPA engages in a significant degree of commercial activity and its ability to generate income could be negatively impacted by publishing commercially sensitive information. The impact assessment process estimated a relatively small financial cost to abolishing the agency and merging its staff and functions with the Department of Health. It also sets out the major organisational benefits of what the Government are planning, but we acknowledge that these are harder to quantify in monetary terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.5/2">The primary objective of abolishing the HPA is not a financial one. The HPA is just one component of a system that is currently spread across central government, local government, the National Health Service and other arm's-length bodies such as the National Treatment Agency. Our intention is to replace that with a clearly defined and unified system for protecting and improving the nation's health.</p>

A proportion of the &#163;2.8 billion savings will be delivered by members of the Teachers' Pensions Scheme (TPS). The Government have proposed clear principles for the design of these changes: that low earners should be protected and that changes are progressive so that those on higher salaries make a greater contribution. The Government also expect to take forward further public service pensions' reform in response to the Independent Public Service Pension Commission's final report, which is due in March 2011, in the context of the clear commitment that individuals' accrued rights will be protected.</p>
