	<p pid="b.237.2/1">There is no shortfall of spare parts for Apache helicopters in Afghanistan. The current Apache helicopter deployment to Afghanistan is our top priority. Over the timescale of the current operational deployment to Afghanistan, there has been a 4 per cent reduction in UK flying days due to the unavailability of spare parts. There has been no effect on the availability of weapons systems for UK training and there is no requirement for Apache to be available for other theatres of operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.2/2">The budget for Apache for the financial year beginning April 2006 has been increased by &pound;9.1 million, and an additional &pound;1 million has been committed on urgent operational requirements. I am not releasing information on the flying hours for the eight Apache aircraft deployed to Afghanistan as to do so would prejudice the security of our Armed Forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.11/1">Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 did not begin to take place in departments until after equality schemes approved by the Equality Commission were in place, around mid-2001. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06 in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure there were nine equality-related consultations undertaken. (Listed in table below with number of responses received for each).</p>
	<p pid="b.237.11/2">For each consultation we consult groups and individuals who have requested that they be included in our Section 75 consultation list (a copy of which has been placed in the Library), which was established as part of our equality scheme for these purposes. This list is updated continuously, but at least every year. Backdated lists are not kept.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.11/3">In addition to equality-related consultations, the department consults key stakeholders as part of good policy-making practices generally, and because one must consult on legislation even where no adverse equality impacts have been identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.11/4">With regard to the noble Lord's second Question, the information on what extent and what form consultation responses addressed equality of opportunity issues could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, for every equality-related consultation issued, policy makers record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses received is published (usually on the department's website). All of this information is publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.11/5">It is difficult to identify specific changes that have occurred to a policy as a result of consultation alone. This is because, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development cycle&mdash;through, for example, pre-consultation or informal consultation&mdash;there will be no negative equality impacts evident.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.23/1">Equality-related consultations arising from Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 began after equality schemes were approved by the Equality Commission in 2001. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, in the Department of Finance and Personnel there were approximately 26 equality-related consultations and a list of these can be found in the following table. The noble Lord may also wish to refer to the department's website at <a href="http://www.dfpni.gov.uk/index/about-us/publications">www.dfpni.gov.uk/index/about-us/publications</a> where the department's statutory five-year review of its equality scheme and the department's annual reviews to the Equality Commission are publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.23/2">For each consultation the department consults groups and individuals who have requested that they be included. The Department of Finance and Personnel Section 75 consultee database was established as part of the department's equality scheme for these purposes. This database is updated on a regular basis in consultation with those Section 75 groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.23/3">In relation to whether and how groups respond to consultation, this information is not readily available in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the noble Lord may wish to note that for every equality-related consultation issued, officials record to whom consultations were issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses is published (usually on the department's website).</p>
	<p pid="b.237.23/4">In relation to policy changes arising from consultation, when equality is mainstreamed effectively into decision-making throughout the policy development process, there may be no changes to the policy per se at a later stage following consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.26/1">Since the department's equality scheme was approved by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-15">15 February 2001</phrase>, the department has undertaken 20 consultations on draft equality impact assessments (EQIAs). These are listed below. The groups consulted were drawn from the consultee list set out in the equality scheme, which is updated regularly. This information has been placed in the Library. In addition, each draft EQIA records the groups consulted.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.26/2">The information requested on responses to consultations cannot readily be collated in the form requested and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, all final EQIAs record the outcome of the consultation process, including any changes made to proposed policies. EQIAs may be accessed on the department's website at <a href="http://www.drdni.gov.uk/DRDwww_FOI/">www.drdni.gov.uk/DRDwww_FOI/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.26/3">It is difficult to identify changes made to policies as a result of consultation as with the mainstreaming of equality pre-consultation with relevant groups helps to ensure that policy proposals take account of Section 75 issues from the outset. However, pages 28 to 30 of the five-year review of the equality scheme identify a number of changes made to policies as a result of consultation. These policies include: the regional transportation strategy, water reform, the regional planning policy statement on housing, the accessible transport strategy and the Blue Badge Scheme. The five-year review may be accessed on the department's website at <a href="http://www.drdni.gov.uk/DRDwww_FOISearch/document.asp?doc=9764">www.drdni.gov.uk/DRDwww_FOISearch/document.asp?doc=9764</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.29/1">The Equality Commission formally approved the Departments Equality Scheme in March 2001. Since then, the department has formally consulted on 14 equality impact assessments as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.237.29/2">Provision of relevant, accurate and timely information and advice about Social Security benefits.Private Sector Housing Grants.Accommodation for Travellers.Unauthorised Encampments.District Council's Community Support Programme.Child Support Northern Ireland Field Operations.41 Compact between Government and Voluntary and Community Sector.Urban Regeneration&mdash;Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy.Urban Regeneration&mdash;Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy for Belfast.Urban Regeneration&mdash;Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy for other Regional Towns and Cities.Urban Regeneration&mdash;Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy for the North West.Uptake of Social Security Benefits.Customer Service (access to Social Security Benefits).Town/City centre reinvigoration.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.29/3">The department consults a variety of groups and individuals who have requested that they be included in our equality consultee mailing list. The list is available on the department's website at <a href="http://www.dsdni.gov.uk">www.dsdni.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.29/4">In relation to whether and how groups respond to consultation, this information is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, for every equality-related consultation issued, policy makers record to whom consultation documents are issued, who responded and what was said. A summary of consultation responses and more lately an analysis of these are published at the end of each individual consultation exercise. Information on the department's annual progress report to the Equality Commission and the five-year review of the equality scheme is available on the website at <a href="http://www.dsdni.gov.uk">www.dsdni.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.29/5">In relation to policy changes, consultation is just one stage in the equality impact-assessment process. When equality is effectively mainstreamed into decision-making from the outset of the policy development process, it is very difficult to attribute specific developments or changes to any particular aspect of the policy development process.</p>

Firelink will then be rolled out on a regional basis over a two-and-half-year period. As fire vehicles are converted to Firelink they will be able to use the system for voice communications. Once FiReControl is in place in a region there will be an ordered transition by each fire and rescue service to the fully integrated system.</p>

A draft of the full business case will be published in October and we will publish another version in the new year after contracts are signed with the IT suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.65/1">The effectiveness of a school is judged by Ofsted on a common grading scale. Grade 1 is outstanding, grade 2 good, grade 3 satisfactory and grade 4 inadequate. Grade 4 inadequate is divided into two categories; schools requiring special measures and schools requiring significant improvement. In both categories a school would be judged not to be providing an acceptable standard of education. Placing a school in one or other category requires further consideration of whether the capacity for improvement is demonstrated by the school. If it is, a school may be judged to require significant improvement and if not the school may be placed in special measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.68/1">As part of the national curriculum in geography, all pupils between the ages of 11 and 14 must learn about ways of identifying differences in development between countries, the factors that influence development and the impact differences in development have on quality of life. They must study countries in different states of economic development and how and why each country may be judged to be more or less developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.237.68/2">Citizenship is part of the national curriculum for all pupils aged between 11 and 16 and provides many opportunities for schools to teach about international development. Pupils are taught about the political, social, economic and environmental implications of the world as a global community and the opportunities for groups and individuals to bring about social change both nationally and internationally.</p>
