	<p pid="a.219.5/1">In <I>Ready for work: full employment in our generation</I> we announced that we would amend regulations to increase Jobcentre Plus adviser discretion so that a lone parent who is claiming JSA will not be penalised if they leave a job, or fail to take up a job, because appropriate affordable childcare is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.5/2">Under the Childcare Act 2006, from April 2008 all local authorities in England and Wales are required to take reasonable steps to secure sufficient childcare to meet the needs of working parents. In doing so, they must have particular regard to the needs of lower-income working families. In determining an appropriate level of supply in their areas, local authorities will liaise with local Jobcentre Plus management to assess projected levels of demand from parents moving from welfare into work and to ascertain any specific requirements our customers have. The reforms announced in <I>Ready for Work</I> apply only to lone parents with school-aged children. In England, the aim is that all schools will offer extended school services by 2010, including for school holiday periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.5/3">The provisions of the Childcare Act do not extend to Scotland. However, the devolved Administration has a stated objective of improving the availability of childcare for working parents and has invested significantly in this area in recent years. Following discussions, officials in the Scottish Executive have indicated that the projected levels of increased demand for childcare in Scotland resulting from these regulations can easily be absorbed by current provision.</p>

There is no requirement on local criminal justice boards to set up adult restorative justice schemes, but a survey carried out in May 2006 showed that 13 boards were delivering a variety of adult restorative justice initiatives at all stages of the criminal justice system and 13 boards had appointed a restorative justice lead person. Since the survey, six more boards have appointed a restorative justice lead person and the conditional caution has been extended nationally, which provides a further opportunity to deliver adult restorative justice where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/1">The use of sirens by the police and other emergency services is controlled by Regulation 99 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. This permits the use of sirens only when it is necessary or desirable to do so either to indicate to other road-users that the vehicle is responding to an urgent incident or to warn other road-users of the presence of the vehicle on the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2">Use of blue warning lights is controlled under the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989, as amended. These permit blue lights to be fitted to emergency vehicles, including vehicles used for police purposes. The aim is to prevent excessive use, as this could diminish the impact of the lights. Use of the lights is not mandatory but they may be used at emergency scenes, to indicate urgency when on the way to such scenes, or to warn others of the presence of the vehicle or a hazard on the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3">It is for the emergency services to consider how best to use sirens and lights for maximum effectiveness and minimum environmental disturbance. Subject to the regulations and any guidance from those services, drivers of emergency vehicles are expected to use their professional judgment to decide when and where the use of sirens and blue lights is appropriate. Drivers ought to be fully aware that sirens must be used with restraint, particularly at night, so as not to cause a nuisance to residents or other road users. There will, however, always be occasions when it is necessary for the emergency services to use sirens and/or blue lights in the interests of road safety and the protection of the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.3/2">Exit controls were phased out from 1994. As part of the Government's 10-point plan for delivery, by Christmas 2008 the majority of foreign nationals will be counted in and out of the country. This will build on the successes of our early testing of the e-borders programme (Project Semaphore) which already covers more than 30 million passenger movements and has led to 18,000 alerts and more than 1,500 arrests.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.3/3">This is part of a sweeping programme of border protection which also includes the global rollout of fingerprint visas, compulsory watch-list checks for all travellers from high-risk countries before they land in Britain and ID cards for foreign nationals.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.6/1">The Government of Iraq are working to establish a system of security and justice based on the rule of law. This will only be achieved when all Iraqi citizens have confidence that justice and law enforcement institutions are empowered and capable of administering justice impartially.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.6/2">We are actively working with the Iraqi Government in support of their work towards this goal, as part of wider coalition efforts. We have provided technical support to a range of justice sector institutions, including the Iraqi police service, the Iraqi correctional service and the judiciary. We are also working to involve a wider range of international partners with expertise in this field in support of the Iraqi Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.6/3">Our work is designed to complement Iraqi and other international efforts and all our work is designed so as to be sustainable by the Iraqi authorities in the longer term. We evaluate our work carefully to ensure that we are building professional capability that will deliver real change on the ground. We seek continually to adjust our approach to respond to changing circumstances on the ground and our evaluation of what has been delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.6/4">Real change in how justice is administered in Iraq must be led by the Iraqi Government. While there has been some progress in building respect for the rule of law, long-term challenges remain. The parallel efforts of the UK and others to support security improvements and political reconciliation will also help create the conditions for the rule of law to operate effectively and fairly in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.5/1">The GB and NI traffic census data used to provide HGV kilometres does not record tonnes of goods lifted. It also includes types of heavy vehicles which do not carry goods, therefore it is not possible to derive an equivalent value of tonne kilometre of goods carried.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.5/2">The variation in tonnes of CO2 per billion vehicle kilometres between 1990 and 2005 in the previous answer is a result of changes to the composition of the vehicle fleet and increases in the amount of goods carried. Changes in European standards on emission limits for wider air quality benefits may also have resulted in small increases in fuel consumption. Increasing the load on a vehicle will increase its fuel consumption and resultant CO2 emission, but the overall effect is to increase efficiency and reduce the amount of CO2 emitted per tonne kilometre travelled.</p>
