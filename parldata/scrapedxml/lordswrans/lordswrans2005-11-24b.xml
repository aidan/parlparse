	<p pid="b.227.8/1">Paragraph 5(1) sets out the grounds on which matters may be referred to the court and makes it clear that it covers the whole of Paragraph 4. Paragraph 4(4) limits the extent under this schedule to which compensation for lost contracts can be offered through an action taken through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.8/2">To further explain, under Paragraph 1 of the schedule to the regulations, certain activities conducted for the services of the Crown do not infringe the rights in a community design (registered or unregistered). Normally, the government department concerned has to settle the terms of use with the holder of the community design (Paragraph 2 of that schedule). The government department may also have to compensate the holder (or an exclusive licensee) for loss he suffered as a result of not being awarded a contract (Paragraph 4). Paragraph 4(4) sets out that no compensation is payable through these provisions for any contract lost where the use is not for services of the Crown (in other words which falls outside paragraph 1). This provision thus attempts to avoid any doubt that non-Crown usage cannot be compensated for as crown use, and must be the subject of a contract if it is not to infringe.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.8/3">A similar approach has been adopted in the Registered Designs Act 1949 (see first schedule, Paragraph 2A(4)); and, in relation to design right, in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (see Section 243(4)).</p>

	<p pid="b.228.2/1">Although the Home Office is responsible for scrutinising proposals for new offences, no comprehensive records are kept centrally of all new criminal offences created or abolished across the Home Office or government more generally. Criminal offences may be created for different reasons and do not necessarily extend the scope of the criminal law. For example the Sexual Offences Act 2003 created and repealed a large number of offences without significantly changing the overall coverage of the law. The latest information available shows that between one May 1997 and April 2005 the Home Office created 404 new offences. More detailed information is not held and could be identified and listed only at disproportionate cost. However it is possible to set out the number of offences created in each Home Office-sponsored Act since one May 1997. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created two new offences. It also created nine racially-aggravated offences (amended by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 to &quot;racially or religiously aggravated offences&quot;), but these are based on existing offences and do not render unlawful behaviour which would otherwise have been lawful. The Data Protection Act 1998 created four new offences. The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 created 12 new offences. The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 created four new offences. The Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999 created one new offence. The Terrorism Act 2000 created 38 new offences. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 created four new criminal offences. The Football (Disorder) Act 2000 created two new criminal offences. The Licensing (Young Persons) Act 2000 created one new criminal offence. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 created three new criminal offences. The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 created 69 new criminal offences. The Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 created three new criminal offences. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 created two new criminal offences. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 created 15 new criminal offences. The Vehicle (Crimes) Act 2001 created 12 new criminal offences. The Private Security Industry Act 2001 created 10 new offences. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 created 19 new offences. The International Criminal Court Act 2001 created two new criminal offences. The Mobile Telephones (Re-programming) Act 2002 created five new criminal offences. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 created 19 new criminal offences. The Police Reform Act 2002 created 23 new criminal offences. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 created 28 new criminal offences. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 created, modified or re-enacted 61 criminal offences. The Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 created one new criminal offence and modified another. The Anti Social Behaviour Act 2003 created 15 new criminal offences. The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 created two new criminal offences. The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 created two new offences. The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 created eight new criminal offences and modified six criminal offences. The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 created three new criminal offences. The Drugs Act 2005 created two new criminal offences. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 created 26 new criminal offences</p>

	<p pid="b.239.2/1">The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability project has recently entered the assessment phase and it is therefore too early to say what the final designs and specifications for these vessels might be and where the work will be carried out. We will use the assessment phase to look into the potential options, taking into account best value for money and wider industrial factors, before any decisions are made at the main gate investment point.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.5/1">The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) does not have competence for the management of salmon stocks or fisheries within European Community waters because the EU is a single party to the NASCO Convention. Parties to the convention are required to manage stocks and fisheries within their waters. We understand .that the draft review of mixed stock fisheries for Atlantic salmon in European Community waters is still being considered by the European Commission and we are not aware of any timetable for presenting this to the Council of Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.8/1">The Government do not believe that a tourism tsar is needed to co-ordinate policy with the tourism industry. My honourable friend the Minister for Creative Industries and Tourism works closely with the industry to ensure that the Government's tourism and other policies promote and support our visitor economy. He is greatly assisted in this by VisitBritain, which has successfully assumed an industry leadership role since 2003, in partnership with private sector organisations including the Tourism Alliance.</p>

	<p pid="b.240.2/1">The Government reformed the funding of tourism in 2003. VisitBritain was established as a marketing body for Great Britain with an additional remit to promote English tourism, and the English regional development agencies took on responsibility for strategic tourism development in their regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/2">The Government believe that these arrangements are working well in setting the major priorities for the funding of tourism by the public sector, which exceeded &pound;300 million in 2004&ndash;05. However, the Government are continuing to work towards better co-ordination in funding at national, regional, and local levels. My honourable friend the Minister for creative industries and tourism announced a new strategic advisory body for tourism on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>. The Tourism 2012 Group will shape and advise on the industry's preparations for the London Olympic Games, and improved co-ordination in funding decisions will be one of its main priorities. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is also considering how its structures for engaging the industry and the public sector at regional and local levels may be further improved.</p>
