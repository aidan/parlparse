Ratification of the protocol can only begin once there has been successful completion of the negotiations. We hope therefore that these will be concluded before the agreed deadline of the BWC Review Conference at the end of 2001.

	<p pid="a.35.2/1">The flight plan indicated a route to the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse and then a course change to port on a track following the western shoreline of the Mull. The first way point or landmark the pilots entered on the on-board navigational computer was the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse. At 0.95 nautical miles, or about 20 seconds before impact, the crew released the computer from its fix on the Mull and set it to indicate the bearing and distance to the next way point at Corran, 87 miles to the north.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/2">There is no evidence of any significant change of course and none of the decision, if any, that the crew made. When the crew released the computer from its fix on the Mull, the pilots knew how close to the Mull they were and, given the deteriorating weather and the strict visibility requirements under visual flight rules they should by that time already have chosen an alternative course. As they had not done so, they could--and, under the rules, should--have either turned away from the Mull immediately or slowed down and climbed to a safe altitude.</p>
