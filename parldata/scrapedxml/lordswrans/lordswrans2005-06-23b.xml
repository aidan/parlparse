	<p pid="b.196.0/1">United Kingdom assistance for reproductive health programmes is provided in support of the principles of free and informed choice set out at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994 and re-affirmed in various international forums since. These principles reject coercion in matters relating to child bearing and reproduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/2">DfID assistance, through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), is helping to promote non-coercive approaches to family planning in line with the ICPD plan of action. In recent years there have been some positive changes to China's population policy in recognition and compliance with the ICPD principles on people's reproductive rights and choices. This was reflected in the new population law issued in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/3">The UNFPA's work in the areas of reproductive health and family planning, and gender equity and ageing has helped local governments in China to pilot non-coercive approaches to family planning. In the UNFPA programme counties, birth targets and quotas have been abolished, and abortion and sterilisation rates, along with maternal mortality, have dropped significantly.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/4">DfID is also supporting the State Council AIDS Working Committee Office to strengthen its strategic capacity. The State Family Planning Commission (SFPC) is a member of this committee, and this support will enable it better to play its role in raising HIV and AIDS awareness.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/5">The Government believe that this work is important and that the UNFPA's sustained engagement in support of reform is a positive force for change and should continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.196.3/1">This year started with hope of a new beginning for the people of Sudan, with the signing in Nairobi of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) by the government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.3/2">The CPA is a huge achievement and deserves international support to ensure that it is fully implemented. It is clearly the best hope for peace across the whole of Sudan, and we cannot risk this failing. Early and visible dividends are key to consolidating support behind the peace agreement. Donors at the Oslo meeting discussed how they would work together to support the priority areas contained in the Sudan Joint Assessment Mission report, to help the people of Sudan realise their own futures, and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. At the same time they made clear that the situation in Darfur had to be resolved; some (including ourselves) made some or all of their support conditional upon progress there.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.3/3">The UK remains gravely concerned about the humanitarian and human rights crisis in Darfur. We have committed &pound;90 million to the humanitarian response in Darfur/east Chad since September 2003, and &pound;32 million to support the African Union's monitoring operation in Darfur. We sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1593, which referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC has now launched a formal investigation into these crimes. We are also playing a leading role in supporting the African Union's efforts to end the conflict in Darfur, in its mediation at the peace talks in Abuja.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.3/4">We have made clear to the government in Sudan that the full benefits of a peace dividend, including work on debt relief, will not be achieved without peace in Darfur. The UK has stated that it is willing to chair a group of donors to look at the restructuring of Sudan's external debt. This is however conditional on significant progress by the Government of Sudan in resolving the Darfur conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.3/5">G8 countries have agreed to complete the process of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) by making available additional development resources for such relief. This relief will provide significant support for countries' efforts to reach the goals of the Millennium Declaration, while ensuring that the financing capacity of the international financial institutions is not reduced. For International Development Association and African Development Fund debt, 100 per cent stock cancellation will be delivered by relieving post-completion point HIPCs that are on track with their programmes of repayment obligations. Sudan is by definition, a heavily indebted poor country, and will be eligible for some HIPC debt relief when it reaches decision point within the initiative. Only when Sudan has reached completion point, has a proven track record of sound financial management and of using funds for poverty reduction, and has received full HIPC debt relief, will it receive multilateral debt cancellation under the G8 debt agreement. The UK will not take forward work in the international arena on Sudanese debt relief until progress on Darfur is made.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.0/1">As we have always made clear, serious human rights abuses have taken place in Darfur, and those responsible must be brought to justice.

	<p pid="b.198.3/1">We have not assessed the validity of mortality estimates recently presented by the Coalition for International Justice (CIJ). However, the Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) questioned the legitimacy of the CIJ study because of its survey design and quantitative methodology. The estimate is based on extrapolating limited data from relatively small areas and groups over the entire population of Darfur and entire period of the crisis, despite the very variable circumstances across Darfur during this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.3/2">Accurate mortality figures for the Darfur crisis are not available. The World Health Organisation is currently undertaking a second crude mortality survey, which will ascertain the effectiveness of humanitarian interventions in Darfur, and where these need to focus. It will only give a snapshot of the situation. We have to accept that we are unlikely ever to get a full picture of deaths from this conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.3/3">The United Nations International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur was tasked to investigate the human rights abuses in Darfur. During its work the commission conducted extensive interviews in all three Darfur states and studied numerous raids in minute detail. The commission made no attempt to come up with a Darfur-wide death toll, but reported that estimates of the number of damaged or destroyed villages in Darfur were between 700 to over 2,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.5/1">The African Union (AU) led an assessment mission to Darfur in March this year to look at the AU force's performance. Military experts from the EU, UN, UK, US and Canada participated in this mission. On the recommendations of the assessment team, the AU decided to expand its mission in Darfur to over 7,700 personnel in order to fulfil its current mandate and to provide a secure environment throughout the region. The UK welcomed this decision, and has allocated &pound;19 million to support the expansion. This brings our total support to the AU mission to almost &pound;32 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.5/2">At present, the AU has deployed almost 2,700 of the planned 3,320 staff for its mission. The shortfall is mainly due to delays in identifying and deploying suitable police officers. Our understanding is that approximately 460 police are deployed, out of a mandated 815. Efforts to close the gap continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.202.2/1">Jan Egeland estimated in March that 10,000 Sudanese civilians were dying each month in Darfur. Estimates of deaths in Darfur vary from 70,000 to 300,000 and above. Accurate figures are not available and even though the World Health Organisation is undertaking a second crude mortality survey, it will give only a snapshot of the situation. We are unlikely ever to get a full and wholly accurate picture of deaths from this conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/2">There are 2.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Darfur and many of these would be put at great risk if humanitarian operations were suspended by any organisation for reasons of insecurity. This is why the Government fully supported the African Union's (AU) decision to increase its troop numbers from 3,000 to 7,700 and why the Government recently announced a further &pound;19 million in funding to the AU mission in Darfur. This brings the UK's total funding to the AU to almost &pound;32 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.0/1">The Government do not give prior scrutiny of export licence applications to non-governmental organisations (NGOs). All applications for the export of military-listed goods from the UK are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national export licensing criteria, taking full account of the prevailing circumstances at the time of application. These criteria include assessment of the risk that a proposed export would seriously undermine the economy or seriously hamper the sustainable development of the recipient country. All relevant government departments are involved in this assessment and NGO reporting on particular destinations is taken into account. The Government take very seriously the need for transparency in export licensing decisions, and we now produce quarterly reports in addition to our annual report presented to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.203.3/1">The UK is playing an active role in the negotiations on the UN Secretary-General's proposals for reforming and strengthening the UN Human Rights machinery. These are currently ongoing in New York and will culminate with the Millennium Review Summit in September. It is not possible at this stage to guarantee the outcome of the negotiation, given the wide variety of views amongst UN partners. But the UK, along with our EU partners, is working towards an outcome which will both enhance the UN bodies which deal with human rights, and strengthen the relationship between the human rights structures and the rest of the UN system. In particular, we support the Secretary-General's proposal for a new permanent Human Rights Council on the same footing as the Security Council and Economic and Social Council, with a clear mandate to address urgent human rights situations as and when they arise. We are also urging stronger links between the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Security Council and proposed Peacebuilding Commission, such that the High Commissioner can bring urgent and grave situations to their attention whenever appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.2/1">The Ministry of Defence's system for reporting the readiness of UK forces uses NATO readiness categories and has already been widely shared with allies. The recommendations made by the NAO cover further technical developments in the MoD's internal risk management arrangements and in the public reporting of military readiness under our public service agreement and are specific to the UK. The MoD's latest public service agreement report to the end of March, available at <a href="http://www.mod.uk">www.mod.uk</a>, shows that no UK forces were reporting critical weakness that would make it impossible for them to deploy on new operations if they were required to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.3/1">UKTI employed consultants to advise on its sector prioritisation exercise in 2004. The consultants looked at sectors both (a) in terms of their contribution to the UK economy and their potential for international growth and (b) the extent to which sector teams in UKTI (and their private sector advisory groups) could add value nationally. The result, which was validated by a private sector-led panel, was a reduction in the number of national sector teams responsible for taking forward national strategies. These teams have retained their industry advisory groups. Some sectors have been absorbed into wider sector teams, and others will be co-ordinated on a national basis by an international trade team in one of the English regions. UKTI has used separate advisory panels to make recommendations, on a sector-by-sector basis, for the distribution of funds under the support for exhibitions and seminars abroad (SESA) scheme. The future of these panels will depend on the arrangements UKTI will make for a revised SESA scheme, and on which it is currently conducting consultations.</p>
