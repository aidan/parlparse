	<p pid="a.90.5/1">Carbon savings from individual renewable energy technologies and coal-mine methane are not available at present. There are no reliable figures of the amount of coal-mine methane vented at present upon which to base any estimates of emissions savings, although work on this has been contracted. It should be possible in future, once the renewables obligation is in place, to calculate the carbon savings by renewable energy as each renewable energy certificate will be assumed to have resulted in a saving of 0.12kg of carbon. The emissions savings resulting from coal-mine methane use are not as well defined, but for each kWh generated would be expected to be considerably higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.5/2">We have estimated that 10 per cent renewables electricity by 2010 will lead to around 2.5 million tonnes of carbon savings a year by 2010. We have no equivalent figure for coal-mine methane as it is not clear how far the industry would have developed by then.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">Mr Anthony Gerald Dickinson was unanimously convicted by a jury at Leeds Crown Court in June 1991 on two counts of murder. He received a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">It is now some considerable time since the case was originally heard and many of the key participants in the original investigation and prosecution have retired or left their respective organisations rendering specific detailed inquiry as to detailed case handling issues impracticable.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/3">So far as can be ascertained, the solicitors representing Mr Dickinson at that time were provided with full disclosure, prior to the trial, of all relevant material arising in the case to enable the proper conduct of the defence on Mr Dickinson's behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/4">Following Mr Dickinson's conviction, his application for leave to appeal against that conviction was considered and rejected by the Court of Appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/5">The Home Office was also asked to consider the case and it commissioned two further police investigations into the background of the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/6">In addition to this, the case has been considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and has been the subject of proceedings before the High Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/7">These procedures have not resulted in the case being referred back to the Court of Appeal for its further consideration as to whether the conviction was unsafe.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/8">From the information available it can be ascertained that the Crown Prosecution Service and the police have, throughout each of these reviews, co-operated fully with the appropriate authority considering the case when they have been requested to do so, and it appears that the Crown Prosecution Service has ensured that the relevant material has been available to allow a comprehensive review of the evidence to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/9">There is no information on the Crown Prosecution Service's files to suggest that it or the police have done otherwise than to act properly and promptly in the release to Mr Dickinson's solicitor of unused or any other material where it has been appropriate to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/10">Throughout this case the conduct of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service has been the subject of regular and intense scrutiny at each stage of the review process.</p>

These figures represent cases referred to the CPS following charges made by the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/2">The 12,227 cases dropped in court included 372 cases where the defence produced documents showing the defendant's innocence at court. In these cases, the prosecution had no opportunity of discontinuing proceedings before the hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/3">Information on those cases discontinued at court due to no evidence being offered or as a result of an adjournment being refused is not collated centrally.

	<p pid="a.95.5/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>, there were 290 lawyers in post within CPS London. In the previous six months, 50 lawyers have been recruited. A further 15 lawyers have confirmed start dates between April and August 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">The rates paid to independent barrister agents in London are subject to a central agreement with the Bar Council that is applied nationally. The rates paid to solicitor agents are agreed locally and can vary both across and within CPS areas. The rates paid to agents are the same for both magistrates' and youth courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/2">The fees paid to barristers under the existing agreement for sessional work in the magistrates' court are &pound;112 for a half-day session and &pound;175 for a full-day session, plus an additional uplift of &pound;25 when the advocate is engaged to prosecute a heavy court, namely a remand court with 25 or more cases or 40 or more defendants.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/3">Occasionally, an advocate will be engaged to prosecute a specific case in the magistrates' court, e.g. a lengthy summary trial, and a special fee will be negotiated for that individual case which will sit outside the sessional rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/4">The average brief fee paid to junior counsel in the Crown Court during the period October to December 2001 (the latest period available) was &pound;365.90. Crown Court rates are higher because of the increased level of experience and expertise required to prosecute the more serious, lengthy and demanding cases before a judge and jury in the Crown Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/5">The CPS introduced a graduated fee scheme for most Crown Court cases committed or sent for trial after <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-29">29 October 2001</phrase>. The scheme has replaced the current brief fee arrangements and will remunerate external advocates at broadly the same level as legally aided defence advocates.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/2">The rates paid to barristers under the central agreement were last revised in April 1992.

	<p pid="a.97.3/1">The main government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC Clinical Sciences Centre currently has two groups whose research is directly relevant to familial hyperlipidaemias (inherited metabolic disorders). They are the Molecular Medicine Group, led by Professor James Scott, and the Lipoprotein Team, led by Drs A K Soutar and B L Knight. The MRC's relevant expenditure for 2000&ndash;01 is estmated at &pound;871,000. This figure does not include other research that may be relevant to these disorders but not specifically looking at them.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/2">In addition, the MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health. These are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. Awards are made according to their scientific quality and importance to human health.</p>

The department does not currently fund any research focusing specifically on familial hyperlipidaemia but it funds research projects that may have some relevance to this condition. Current research projects include two prospective cohort studies on risk factors for cardiovascular disease, both of which include blood lipid levels, and a systematic review of the long-term outcomes of the treatments for obesity and implications for health improvement and the economic consequences for the National Health Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/4">Recently completed research projects include those on cost-effectiveness of screening for hypercholesterolaemia versus case finding for familial hypercholesterolaemia and cost-effectiveness of the statins.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/5">In addition to specific projects, the Department of Health provides NHS support funding for research commissioned by the research councils and charities that take place in the NHS.

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">No. The researchers, led by Dr Bruce Ames, of the University of California at Berkeley, gave a combination of acetyl-L-carntinine and alpha-lipoic acid to rats the age of which was the equivalent of humans in their seventies. He estimated that the effect on the rats was the equivalent of making a 75 to 80 year-old human act middle aged.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">These two chemicals occur naturally in the human body and both are available in health food shops. Acetyl-L-carntinine is sold as an energy booster and alpha-lipoic acid as an antioxidant with anti-ageing properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">Studies were conducted into the biochemical action of the supplements comparing the behaviour of old and young rats and testing the memory of the animals fed the compounds. Results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/4">This treatment has not yet been shown to be either safe or effective in humans. The fact that these chemicals occur naturally does not mean that they are safe when given in large doses, and nor does it mean that the combination is effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/5">The combination has been patented and further studies are being conducted. In due course, marketing authorisation could be sought from the Medicines Control Agency in the United Kingdom. But until the quality, safety and efficacy of a medicinal form of these chemicals has been established, doctors will not be able to prescribe them, except on a named patient basis, with the manufacturer providing supplies. Doctors do this in the knowledge that they bear the full legal and clinical responsibility for the patient's condition in relation to that treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.3/2">The Learning and Skills Council has made an impressive start in addressing employers' needs in these skills areas. It established, in July 2001, 16 pathfinder centres of vocational excellence. One of these focuses on construction skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.9/1">The Northern Ireland Office was responsible for the management of funding to ex-prisoners and victims groups under Measures 4.4 and 4.6 of the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (Peace I).</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/2">Victims and ex-prisoners have received the following amounts under both measures:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/3" class="indent">Ex-prisoners = &pound;4.3 million</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/4" class="indent">Victims = &pound;2.8 million</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/5">When the programme was first introduced in 1995, the European Commission's (EC) aim was to use the funding to reinforce progress towards a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation. Measure 4 of that programme was designed to promote social inclusion of those who were at the margins of social and economic life. Specifically, Measures 4.4 and 4.6 were aimed at both ex-prisoners and victims groups as the EC considered that it was particularly appropriate to support these groups in order to achieve the objectives. In the event, many more projects were put forward by ex-prisoners grups than by victims groups and therefore the majority of this funding was allocated to ex-prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/6">In the main, this funding has been used to provide training and development officers and counselling services for ex-prisoners and their families. Victims groups were also successful in securing funding from these measures for similiar projects. However, victims of the Troubles have access to other support in addition to the &pound;2.8 million awarded under Peace I.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/7">Since 1998, government has committed over &pound;18.25 million to support victims of the Troubles, funding a number of initiatives including:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/8" class="indent">&pound;700k for a Family Trauma Centre which provides therapeutic service addressing the psychological needs of families and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/9" class="indent">&pound;300k for an Educational Bursary Pilot Scheme&mdash;for individuals whose education was directly affected by the Troubles: 350 people received awards.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/10" class="indent">&pound;3 million to the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund, with a commitment of a further &pound;2 million at a rate of &pound;1 million per year for the next two years. The fund has put in place a number of schemes including: the Small Grants Scheme, the Chronic Pain Management Scheme, the Respite Break Scheme, the Wheelchair Assessment Scheme, the Amputee Assessment Scheme, and the Education and Training Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/11" class="indent">&pound;225k for a Victims Support Grants Scheme (now closed) to assist community groups and voluntary organisations to take forward recommendations in the Bloomfield report; and more recently a further &pound;750,000 to extend this small grants scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/12" class="indent">&pound;6.1 million core funding for groups who support victims of the Troubles.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/13" class="indent">&pound;500k for initiatives in Great Britain, including &pound;250k for the Legacy Project. This project aims to identify and meet the needs of victims of the Troubles living in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/14" class="indent">&pound;1.5 million over the next three years for the development of the Northern Ireland Centre for Trauma and Transformation.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/15" class="indent">&pound;1.5 million over the next two years to the devolved administation's Strategy Implementation Fund to help Northern Ireland departments fulfil their commitments to addressing victims' needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.9/16">In addition, Peace II, which is administered by the devolved administration, contains a specific measure for victims with funding of approximately &pound;6.67 million, targeted mainly at re-training and re-employment. This specific targeting at victim and victims' groups means that they will not be competing with others for this money.</p>
