	<p pid="a.97.3/1">The Government have consistently called for a full, credible, impartial and independent investigation into the Gaza flotilla incident. Part 1 of the Turkel Commission report appears to be a thorough analysis of the evidence before the commission, and included international involvement. The participation of Lord Trimble and Brigadier-General Ken Watkin as international observers was essential. Both observers stated clearly that they thought that the commission was independent. However, it is clear that although the commission made efforts to hear both sides, not all relevant evidence was available to the commission. This is to be regretted.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/2">Clearly this is a complex issue. We are studying the report in detail and await the second and final part of the report in due course. It is now important that the UN secretary-general's panel of inquiry can draw on the full evidence available as part of its own ongoing investigation.</p>
