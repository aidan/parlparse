	<p pid="a.88.5/1">The Air Accident Investigation Branch, which is investigating the accident at Heathrow in January 2008, has not concluded that there is a high probability of further accidents caused by fuel icing on the B777. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has also investigated an incident of engine power loss on the B777 which did not result in an accident. NTSB technical reports about this incident did not in fact conclude that there was a high probability of further incidents of power loss cause by fuel icing, although this was suggested in their press statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.5/2">Since the accident at Heathrow in January 2008 Boeing has developed a range of changes to operating procedures to ensure that aircraft crews can minimise and manage any risk associated with potential ice accumulation in the fuel system. These procedures have been approved by European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (US FAA) and have been made mandatory for all US and European airlines. Both EASA and the US FAA are content that, subject to the application of these procedures, B777 aircraft with Rolls-Royce Trent engines are safe to remain in service. The new procedures were shown to be effective in the incident investigated by the NTSB referred to above when thrust control was successfully recovered following an uncommanded power reduction in a single engine on a Delta Airlines Boeing 777 on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-26">26 November 2008</phrase>.</p>

The VMD is encouraging the manufacturers of these products to apply for an authorisation to market them in the UK and has offered a 50 per cent reduction on application fees for these products.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/2">Veterinary surgeons already have the authority to import and administer veterinary medicines to animals under their care under the prescribing cascade.

	<p pid="a.91.3/1">The tri-departmental Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF) seeks to manage numerous projects, across a broad range of strands, in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Money transferred at parliamentary estimates reflects latest forecast expenditure by departments, based on judgments made in theatre on the likelihood of spend in-year and in accordance with priorities set by the tri-departmental programme board. While best efforts are made to ensure that estimates of forecast expenditure are robust, the operational environment in which SAF projects are delivered means that these can be subject to variation over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/2">By the Spring Supplementary Estimate (SSE), estimated forecast expenditure indicated an imbalance between DfID, MoD and the FCO, which transfers at SSE sought to correct. Any reduction in forecast DfID project expenditure was matched by a reallocation of funds to other Iraq SAF projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.2/1">The Government believe that the question of whether one technique in stem cell research has superseded another is, at this stage, entirely premature. Advances over the past decade in embryonic stem cell research have fed into advances in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Therefore, it is impossible to predict what the relative contributions of nuclear transfer and PS cell technology might ultimately be to medical needs. That is why the Government continue to support all forms of stem cell research.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.8/1">Information on the capital value and estimated revenue payments for the lifetime of each completed private finance initiative (PFI) scheme together with the start on site and opening dates has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.8/2">The revenue payments are the annual payments made by National Health Service trusts to their private sector partners. This is to cover the cost of the funding raised by the contractors on the project (known as senior debt) in terms of financing charges and repayment of principal, building maintenance, lifecycle costs and, in many cases, non-clinical support services such as cleaning, laundry, catering, portering and security. On an annualised basis, the cost of the funding, comprising finance charges and principal in varying proportions, accounts for approximately 50 per cent of the annual payment for a scheme including non-clinical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.8/3">PFI schemes are normally funded by two types of senior debt finance; traditional fixed rate project finance (a bank loan) and index linked bonds, priced by reference to bank and gilts rates respectively. Each source of debt finance has its relative merits and their prices move in relation to each other depending on market conditions. Decisions on the preferred source are made as part of the value for money calculation by the trust and its private sector partner at the time of preparing the full business case (FBC). To these rates is then added a margin, which is an annual charge pricing the risks in the project. Both funding routes also involve a number of costs associated with arranging and maintaining the funding for a scheme such as arrangement and commitment fees. The combination of rates, margins and fees is the overall financing charge&mdash;the equivalent of an interest payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.8/4">The overall financing charges therefore vary from scheme to scheme and depend on several factors. Information on financing charges is contained in the FBC for each scheme, which must be made publicly available following its approval. The financing charges are modelled for each year of the term of the loan in the financial models which are contained in the FBC and are fixed for the public sector, but these may differ from the actual charges incurred in any year by the private sector (the risk sits with the senior debt provider and contractors). The information on the actual finance charges paid in any one year for all PFI schemes which have opened could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.8/1">The Government are currently examining the potential impact of the convention against enforced disappearance on the law of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.8/2">In particular, lawyers are analysing the extent to which common law provisions may need to be replicated in statute law, and the introduction of one or more specific criminal offences. If the Government decide to ratify the convention, these changes to the law would require primary legislation, which would be introduced when parliamentary time allowed. Decisions would also need to be taken in due course on whether the UK required any reservations or declarations upon ratification. These are complex issues requiring further consideration and analysis which will take some time to complete.</p>
