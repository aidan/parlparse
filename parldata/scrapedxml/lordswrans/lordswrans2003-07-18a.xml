In relation to the criminal law, we believe it is more appropriate that one ministry, the Home Office, should be responsible and have as its primary focus the criminal law, fighting crime and responsibility for the police. It provides a firm base for the criminal justice system and that, together with the joint working between the Home Office, my department and that of my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General, will deliver real improvements in bringing the guilty to justice quicker and in public confidence in the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.5/1">The UK was a driving force behind the adoption of Resolution 1325 in October 2000 and maintains an active and positive approach towards its implementation both in London and through the UK Mission to the United Nations in New York. The UK used its presidency of the UN Security Council in July 2002 to host an open debate on UNSCR 1325, led by the UN Department for Peacekeeping Operations, with the participation of the UN Special Adviser on Gender, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the UN Department for Political Affairs.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.5/4">The UK helped UNIFEM to put together a programme of work on women, peace building and gender justice and has pledged &pound;3m towards that work. This ambitious programme, now in its second year, aims to increase women's participation in peace negotiations and post-conflict justice mechanisms. With our support, UNIFEM has published an independent assessment of how women are affected by armed conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.5/5">In Iraq the UK is committed to including women in all phases and at all levels in the reconstruction. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister's special representative and his team in Baghdad are working closely with Ambassador Bremer and officials in the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to increase the representation of women in all strands of the rapidly evolving political and reconstruction process, such as the governing and economic councils. In addition we have seconded a gender expert from the government's Women and Equality Unit to the CPA's gender equality team and an FCO official in the CPA's governance team, who have been engaged in the involvement of women in the political process. The CPA has also facilitated an Iraqi-led women's conference consisting of five workshops, the recommendations from which will feed into the political process.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.5/6">We will continue to seek opportunities to further the implementation of Resolution 1325 in areas of conflict.</p>

However, we are aware of reports from the media and NGO's about attacks on villages by the army that have resulted in civilian deaths. Kontras, an independent Indonesian NGO has provided unconfirmed statistics that 176 civilians were killed and 15 went missing between the introduction of martial law on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-19">19 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-18">18 June</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.187.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-20">20 May</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary issued a joint statement with the Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, calling on the Indonesian armed forces to ensure full respect for human rights and to show maximum restraint while they carry out operations in Aceh. This was reinforced by my honourable friend the Minister of State at the FCO (Mike O'Brien) during his visit to Indonesia from 3 to <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-04">4 June</phrase>, when he discussed Aceh with President Megawati and other senior members of the Indonesian Government. He raised the issue of civilian deaths and stressed that the Indonesian armed forces must respect human rights and act in accordance with international law in Aceh. He also urged the Indonesian Government to resume negotiations as soon as possible, stressing that military action alone would not resolve the problems in Aceh; only political negotiation could offer a long-term solution. We will continue to raise this with the Indonesian Government, both bilaterally and with others including our EU partners, Japan, the US and the World Bank.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.2/1">In his second special report on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) the Secretary-General recommended an increase in the MONUC troop ceiling to 10,800 from the present level of 8,700. We support this increase to enable troops in sufficient numbers to be deployed in Ituri. We are presently pushing, in the Security Council, for agreement to the increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/2">We are supporting the imposition of an arms embargo on Ituri and the Kivus. This should give the necessary political leverage to act against regional states, such as Rwanda and Uganda, and to act against the DRC Government if they arm rebel groups in the region where the worst atrocities have been taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/3">The present MONUC mandate expired on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase>. There was insufficient time for detailed consultations on the new mandate giving Chapter VII powers to MONUC, the increase in troop ceiling plus the implementation of an arms embargo. It was therefore agreed that there would be a technical rollover until <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-30">30 July</phrase> when a new resolution should be adopted including all of the desired measures. This new mandate will continue until June 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.6/1">Under the Oil for Food programme set up by UN Security Council Resolution 986 (1995) Iraqi oil revenues were divided between the North of Iraq (13 per cent), the South and Centre of Iraq (59 per cent), the United Nations Compensation Commission (25 per cent), UNMOVIC's operating costs (0.8 per cent) and the Oil for Food Programme's operating costs (2.2 per cent). The revenues spent in North and South/Central Iraq were held in separate accounts. The funds in the Northern account were spent by the United Nations while the funds in the South and Centre account were spent by the Iraqi Government. This was done so that the oil revenue from the whole of Iraq was spent on the whole of Iraq. Had the funds not been divided in this way, Saddam Hussein would have systematically discriminated against the Kurds in the north. The need to keep the two accounts separate disappeared when Saddam Hussein fell. The two accounts were consolidated by UN Security Council Resolution 1483 so that oil revenues from the whole of Iraq could best be spent on the whole of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.6/2">The consolidated Oil for Food account is held by the French-owned BNP bank and controlled by the UN Treasury. The funds are being spent on Iraq-wide humanitarian contracts that are being assessed according to their utility by the UN and the Coalition Provisonal Authority with Iraqi involvement.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.5/1">We regret that not one of the 605 Kuwaitis missing after the Gulf War has so far been found alive. The UN envoy, Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov, reported recently that a number of remains at a recently discovered mass grave site at Samarra in Iraq were believed to be missing Kuwaiti nationals. The Government of Kuwait have confimed the remains of one missing national. The Tripartite Committee established after the invasion of Kuwait, under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has begun to investigate mass graves in Iraq. The coalition has so far received reports of more than 50 mass grave sites and we believe there may be more than 80. The UK sent a team of forensic experts to Iraq who have made recommendations on the treatment of mass graves, including identification programmes. The Coalition Provisional Authority has set up an Office of Human Rights and Transitional Justice which will put these recommendations into effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.5/1">The Privy Council late yesterday made an order, the Consular Fees Order 2003, which will increase passport fees with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-02">2 October 2003</phrase>. Full details are set out in the order, which will be made on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-29">29 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/2">The fee for a passport applied for by post or through the UK Passport Service's high street partners will increase from &pound;33 to &pound;42 for a standard 32-page passport, and from &pound;19 to &pound;25 for a passport for a child.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/3">The fee for a passport applied for through the guaranteed one-week fast-track service will increase from &pound;63 to &pound;70 for a standard 32-page passport, and from &pound;49 to &pound;60 for a passport for a child.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/4">The fee for a passport applied for through the guaranteed same-day premium service (available only for passport renewals) will increase from &pound;78 to &pound;89 for a standard 32-page passport, and from &pound;64 to &pound;71 for a passport for a child.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/5">A new fast-track collect service will be made available for those using the fast-track service to opt to collect their passport from a passport office instead of having it posted. This involves the higher costs of production at a passport office instead of the central printing press where the majority of passports are produced, which will be reflected in higher fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/6">The order will also increase fees for applications made overseas to British consular posts. The fee for a standard 32-page passport will increase from &pound;54.50 to &pound;56.50 and the fee for a child passport will increase from &pound;34.70 to &pound;36.50.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/7">In the UK there will no longer be a separate fee for amending passports. Where a person wishes to amend the personal details shown, a new 10-year passport will be issued. British consular posts overseas will continue to offer an amendment service if requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/8">From early 2004, at the majority of British consular posts overseas, a new temporary passport costing &pound;45.60 and valid for up to 12 months and for multiple journeys will be available to travellers who have lost their passports or had them stolen, and need to continue their journey quickly. The target turn round time for issue of a standard passport is five days.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/9">Fees for 48-page passports will also be increased, but collective passport fees for organised school trips will not change.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/10">The average increase in UK passport fees is &pound;8.71. This is a substantial increase made necessary by several factors. Most importantly, it allows investment in the security and integrity of British passports, and improvement in customer service, to continue. Susbtantial work is in hand in the following key areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/11" class="indent">Introduction of biometrics in passports&mdash;this is necessary to improve security, meet new International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and allow continued UK participation in the US visa waiver programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/12" class="indent">Addressing problems associated with passports lost, stolen and lost in the post&mdash;initiatives include a new database to allow better control and sharing of information on missing passports, tighter procedures for replacing missing passports, developing arrangments to send all new passports by secure delivery methods.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/13" class="indent">Identity confirmation&mdash;initiatives include creating a single database for British passports issued in the UK and at all British consular posts overseas and trials of identity checking through a range of public and private sector databases.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/14" class="indent">Fraud detection and prevention&mdash;new fraud investigation units have been established in passport offices, staff training is being enhanced, analysis of management information is being improved and an exhaustive check on past applications to detect trends is being undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/15" class="indent">Customer service&mdash;substantial improvements in the electronic application route are being developed, call handling arrangements are being improved, and the Liverpool passport office is moving to new premises with better public facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.5/16">The increase is also needed to meet an obligation to repay previously accrued deficits to HM Treasury by October 2004, currently amounting to &pound;26m. The Passport Service has found savings of &pound;10m from its current budget in order to deliver efficiency savings and constrain the level of fee increases while pursuing the UKPS fraud prevention programme.</p>

Responsibility for approving contractors and for monitoring performance, including any obligations relating to equality, rests with the relevant departmental accounting officer or officers. The Government are committed to equality in all their activities and the Office of Government Commerce and the DTI's Small Business Service have recently launched two procurement pilots. One is based in the West Midlands region and one in Haringey, north London.
