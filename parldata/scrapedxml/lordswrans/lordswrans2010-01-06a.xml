	<p pid="a.93.5/1">The part played by IT systems in the difficulties experienced by the CSA is well documented. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is currently undertaking a major programme which includes the development and deployment of new information technology and systems. The new IT systems are intended to provide significant improvements in efficiency and in client experience, overcoming the shortcomings of the existing systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/2">The strategy for these new systems was based upon some initial feasibility work and upon the proposals of Tata Consulting Services (TCS), which was appointed in March 2009 to design and build these systems. Rather than build bespoke applications, the commission's IT strategy is based on commercial off-the-shelf packages, which are widely used in banking and other industries, which it is configuring and integrating. This will ensure that it maximises the re-use of existing and proven functionality while ensuring that it meets specific needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/3">Given that the commission has selected to adhere to the hosting, network, desktop, application maintenance and service integration strategies of the Department for Work and Pensions, relevant parts of its IT strategy were discussed with the department. In addition, the commission's future systems programme has been reviewed by the Office of Government Commerce and the department's Risk Assurance Division. The commission has also discussed its IT strategy with other government departments in the context of its plans to interface with their data and systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.2/1">Estimates of the cost of extending free personal care at home to all those with the highest needs, as presented in the Impact Assessment for the Personal Care at Home Bill, incorporate three specific demand effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/2">First, the number of older people who would otherwise have entered residential care, but who choose instead to receive free personal care at home, has been estimated. Secondly, older people whose needs would otherwise be classed as critical under <I>Fair Access to Care Services</I> were it not for their receipt of informal care may in future decide to withdraw from their informal care in order to qualify for free personal care. An estimate of the number of such individuals has been included in the estimated costs. Thirdly, the Personal Social Services Research Unit's estimate of the number of older people who would in future qualify for free personal care at home, but who currently neither receive free personal care nor make a means-tested contribution, includes those with unmet need. It is therefore not just an estimate of the number of older people who pay for all of their own care now; it also includes those who are not fully meeting their needs privately.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/3">The Scottish experience of extending free personal care differs in respect of coverage, in that it is not limited to those with the highest needs and it includes people in residential care. In addition, the relative prices of residential and home care, eligibility criteria and preferences may also differ. For these reasons, it was not considered appropriate to extrapolate changes in demand for personal care in Scotland to the English context.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">The Pre-Budget Report announced that councils will make &#163;250 million efficiency savings by 2012-13 from reducing the significant variations in the proportion of funding that councils spend on residential care provision through supporting more people to live for longer in their own homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.2/2">These efficiency savings will be used to help meet the ever-growing pressure on budgets from demographic changes and to support more people to live in their homes through the offer of free personal care for those with the greatest need. These savings may be used alongside the funding made available by the department to deliver the proposals of the Personal Care at Home Bill.</p>
