	EU Meat Plants: Veterinary Supervision
</minor-heading>

<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-03-22a.27.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100388" speakername="Lord Luke" colon="" colnum="27"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000322/text/00322w01.htm#00322w01_wqn0">
	<p pid="a.27.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2" qnum="HL1425">What steps they are taking to obtain information from the European Union member states concerning regulations in each state regarding veterinary supervision in abattoirs of both live and dead stock.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-03-22a.27.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100284" speakername="Baroness Hayman" colon=":" colnum="27"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000322/text/00322w01.htm#00322w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.27.2/1">In 1998, we requested information, through Agricultural Attaches in our Embassies in member states, about the implementation of EU requirements on veterinary supervision in meat plants in those countries. The level of information received was somewhat patchy and covers only 10 of the 14 member states surveyed. The results show that supervision levels and frequencies vary between member states and that supervision levels in GB premises are not significantly higher than in other member states. Indeed, they are probably lower than in some.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/2">In addition, the Meat and Livestock Commission's report on meat inspection charges and other enforcement costs, published in October 1999, found that most other member states operate national inspection systems under arrangements similar to those operated by the Meat Hygiene Service in Great Britain, although the role of the official veterinarian and the meat inspector varies between member states. Moreover, the MLC found that in the nine member states surveyed, official veterinarians were fully qualified veterinary surgeons who had undertaken a minimum of five years' training as required by EU law.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/3">The results of our own survey and the MLC report have been published and are available in the Library of the House. We have also passed copies of both to the European Commission. We agree with the conclusions of the Meat Industry Red Tape Working Group that a modern hazard-based control system is the way forward and are actively pressing the Commission to progress the fundamental changes required to EU legislation. Indeed, my right honourable friend the Minister, at his meeting with Commissioner Byrne on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-06">6 March</phrase>, pressed hard the case for a review leading to its replacement with rules based on more targeted risk assessment. Member states' officials are due to discuss the Commission's proposals for a fundamental review of ante and post mortem inspection procedures later this month.</p>

A number of projects within the programme are designed to identify the extent of variation in the use of the Act. They include analysis of age, gender, race and a range of socio-economic factors which may account for such variation. We have not yet received final reports from all the projects in the programme but a summary of the main findings taken from preliminary reports has been compiled. The summary report will shortly be available on the DH website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth.htm">www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth.htm</a>.

	<p pid="a.31.5/1">The department is arranging to provide Mr Naylor, the author of this request, with access to anonymised individual pupil KS3 to GCSE/GNVQ information in order that he can, under the appropriate confidentiality constraints imposed by the department, conduct research on behalf of the National Grammar Schools Association. The linkage over the last few years of information on individual pupils' progress provides a more robust basis of analysing the relative performance of schools and local authorities than does the method and information used in Statistical Bulletin 13/84.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/1">All maintained schools must provide RE and daily collective worship for all registered pupils and promote their spiritual, moral and cultural development. These requirements are set out in DfEE circular 1/94, which was sent to all schools. The requirements are underpinned by Ofsted inspections which report on the extent to which schools are meeting their statutory requirements, including those in relation to collective worship. Schools whose provision has been criticised following Ofsted inspection can seek support from their local Standing Advisory Committee on Religious Education. In addition, there is a statutory complaints procedure under which any individual can raise concerns about provisions relating to the school curriculum, including religious education and collective worship. Complaints must be dealt with by the local education authority, with ultimate right of appeal to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">Mexico is an increasingly important trading partner for the UK. Our exports are on a rising trend, having more than doubled since 1995. It is difficult to estimate the future effects of the EU/Mexico Free Trade Agreement on this performance, but the agreement presents major opportunities which British Trade International will promote in its three year Mexico campaign which my right honourable friend the Minister for Trade launched on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-20">20 January</phrase>.</p>
