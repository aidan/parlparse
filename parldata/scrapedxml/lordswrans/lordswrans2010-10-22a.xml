	<p pid="a.207.2/1">My Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-11">11 October 2010</phrase> stated that the United Kingdom will be unable to withdraw from the directive. I can further explain that, in line with Article three of Protocol 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union concerning the position of the United Kingdom (and Ireland) in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, the UK is able to opt in to a draft directive within the three month opt-in period, but that the Government cannot then subsequently reverse this decision (to opt in). This means that the UK will be bound by any text that is agreed after qualified majority voting (QMV) in the Council of Ministers. However, should the Government not like the final negotiated proposal the UK can vote against it and attempt to form a blocking minority alongside other likeminded member states in order to prevent its adoption.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/2">As the UK has opted in to the EIO at this stage, we are able to participate in negotiations on the same footing as other member states, including the power to vote at council. The Government hopes to successfully negotiate a final agreement that is favourable for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/3">As for parliamentary discussion, there has been full adherence to the parliamentary scrutiny procedure and the Government gave consideration to the recommendation by the House of Lords European Scrutiny Committee that the UK opts in to the EIO. Oral Statements were also given in both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-27">27 July</phrase> in order to give Parliament the opportunity to debate the Government's decision to opt in to the EIO. The European Scrutiny Committees continue to receive regular updates on the EIO and we have undertaken to do this throughout the negotiation process. The European Scrutiny Committees have the option to call for a debate on the EIO if, and when, they see necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1" qnum="HL2424">To ask Her Majesty's Government, further to the Written Answer by Earl Howe on 28 July (<I>WA 373</I>), how claims can be made for healthcare costs against European Union countries for their nationals receiving medical treatment here, and payments sought from non-European Union nationals for treatment in the United Kingdom, if patients are not required to disclose their nationality as part of the standard registration process in primary medical services.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-10-22a.209.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100305" speakername="Earl Howe" colon=":" colnum="209"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101022w0001.htm#10102225000021">
	<p pid="a.209.3/1">The National Health Service is first and foremost for the benefit of people living in this country. Entitlement to access free NHS hospital treatment is based on whether someone is ordinarily resident in this country, not on British nationality or the past or present payment of national insurance contributions or United Kingdom taxes. &quot;Ordinarily resident&quot; is a common law concept interpreted by the House of Lords in 1982 as referring to someone who is living lawfully in the UK voluntarily and for settled purposes as part of the regular order of their life for the time being, with an identifiable purpose for their residence here which has a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described as settled.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/2">Under European Community regulations, visitors from one European Economic Area (EEA) country to another are entitled to free or reduced cost treatment in the same way as the local population when the need for that treatment is necessary during the visit. They should show their European health insurance card to demonstrate entitlement and the treating country can then make a reimbursement claim to the patient's country of residence.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/3">In the case of visitors to the UK from outside the EEA, there is no provision through which visitors can automatically be entitled to free NHS hospital treatment. Anyone who is not ordinarily resident is subject to the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended. The regulations place a legal duty on NHS hospitals to establish whether a person is ordinarily resident, exempt from charges or liable to be charged. Where it is established that charges apply, they cannot be waived for any reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/4">A person who is found liable for charges, or who refuses to provide the appropriate evidence to confirm their claim to free treatment, will be asked to pay in advance of receiving any treatment. However, when in a clinical opinion medical treatment is immediately necessary, it will not be withheld and should go ahead without delay. The NHS is essentially a humanitarian service and no-one in need of immediate treatment will ever be left to suffer just because they cannot pay. In cases where immediately necessary treatment is given and the patient is without funds to pay, the hospital should provide only such treatment as is clinically required to stabilise the patient to allow them to return to their own country. This decision will be made locally, based on clinical judgment. This will ensure that the hospital does not incur additional expenditure that it cannot recover, which has a knock-on effect on services that can be provided to NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/5">The noble Lord may be interested to note that the department began a consultation on the access of foreign nationals to the NHS in February, aimed at preventing health tourism. The series of proposals consulted on included a number of options requiring visitors to the UK to have health insurance and extending the period of time that UK residents can stay outside the country on a regular basis before losing their automatic entitlement to NHS treatment. The proposals set out in the consultation are aimed at deterring health tourists entering the country to obtain NHS treatment and to increase the payments that the NHS receives from treating overseas visitors. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-30">30 June</phrase>, and we are currently considering a formal response.</p>

The seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for all people aged 65 and over and also for those aged under 65 who have an underlying health condition; this includes pregnant women as they are at particular risk from complications if they contract H1N1 swine flu.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.3/14">In 2009, two applications were refused as a direct result of a confirmation of identity interview. Identity interviews were added to the passport process primarily to address first time application fraud through deterrence and fraud detection arising from a personal interview. In addition to the two instances of confirmed fraud in 2009, applications have also been withdrawn when customers are advised that an identity interview is required. In 2009, 695 applications were withdrawn at this stage. This underlines the usefulness of the interview process as a potential deterrent to those attempting to make a fraudulent passport application. IPS is currently reviewing its interview processes to improve on fraud prevention and deterrence.</p>
