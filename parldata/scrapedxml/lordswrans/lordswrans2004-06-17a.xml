	<p pid="a.83.3/1">Health and Safety regulations do not specify the maximum acceptable temperature for an office, although the Health and Safety Executive does give guidance that, &quot;An acceptable zone of thermal comfort for most people in the UK lies roughly between 13&deg;C (56&deg;F) and 30&deg;C (86&deg;F)&quot;. While I understand that this indicative maximum temperature was not exceeded in the Grand Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>, I regret that overall conditions deteriorated to the extent that it was found to be necessary to adjourn the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/2">The reason for the deterioration in conditions was a mechanical fault which caused the air-conditioning equipment to shut down. Unfortunately, due to the age and design of the equipment, when an event such as this occurs there are no automatic visual or audible warnings. In this particular instance, once staff were informed of the conditions in the Moses Room at about 5 p.m., the fault was immediately rectified. However, as the temperature in the room had already risen considerably, it took some time to restore the room to a normal temperature.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/3">It seems that the fault was probably caused by a build-up of dust on the cooling coils arising from stone cleaning activity in the vicinity. Action has now been taken to have the cooling coils cleaned, and staff are actively monitoring the temperature in the Moses Room to avoid a repetition of this unfortunate occurrence.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/117">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/118">1. Table T1.6 is a &quot;ready reckoner&quot; showing the estimated effects of various illustrative tax changes on tax receipts in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. The tax changes are assumed to take effect from April 2004. The estimates depend on forecasts of economic variables such as prices, earnings and interest rates. They are consistent with the March 2004 Budget. The estimates only cover the direct effects of tax changes on tax receipts. In practice changes to the tax regime will affect economic variables which in turn would have further effects on tax receipts.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/119">2. The figures are shown on a full year accrual basis and a national accounts basis (NAB). The national accounts basis aims to recognise tax as the tax liability accrues, irrespective of when the tax is received by the Exchequer. However, some taxes are scored on a receipts basis, principally reflecting the difficulty in assessing the period to which the tax liability relates. Examples of such taxes are corporation tax, self-assessment income tax, inheritance tax and capital gains tax. This approach is consistent with other Government publications.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/120">3. The table is designed to be used as a ready reckoner. The effects of the changes can be scaled up or down over a reasonably wide range. Thus a reduction of 2p in a tax rate will cost roughly twice as much as a reduction of 1p. However, the extra cost of increasing an income tax allowance or rate limit by more than the amount shown falls as the allowance or rate limit rises. Therefore estimates are given for different percentage changes, and for reductions as well as increases, for the main income tax allowances and limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/121">4. The total cost or yield of a group of changes can be broadly assessed by adding together the estimated revenue effects of each change. However, if income tax allowances are increased substantially then the cost of a subsequent cut in tax rates will be reduced. In such cases the revenue effects of combining components from the ready reckoner can only be taken as a rough guide.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.6/1">No research has been commissioned in the past three years into the incidence of pre-cancerous skin lesions in England. We have commissioned the National Institute of Clinical Excellence to produce improving outcomes guidance on skin tumours, including melanoma. This guidance is due for publication in April 2005 and is aimed at informing commissioners and providers how to configure their services to provide the best outcomes for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.6/2">As skin cancers are caused by exposure to ultra-violet radiation from the sun, a range of measures has been taken to ensure that the public are aware of the simple steps they can take to minimise the risks. The United Kingdom health departments are providing &pound;400,000 funding to Cancer Research UK for the SunSmart Sun awareness campaign. In addition, the Department of Health continues to provide funding for the Meteorological Office ultra-violet index and core funding for the National Radiological Protection Board.</p>

A large number of applications covering ministerial commitments were received for funding from April 2004 which resulted in intense competition for limited funds. This has resulted in many applications being rejected, including those from TOAST.</p>
