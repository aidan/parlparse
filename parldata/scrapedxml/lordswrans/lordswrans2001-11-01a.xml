	<p pid="a.170.2/1">The Government would be delighted if the public order situation improved sufficiently to remove the need to resort to baton rounds. The whole community has a contribution to make to the achievement of that aim but, sadly, we are not there yet.

	<p pid="a.170.2/2">However the Government have accepted the Patten recommendations to look for alternatives to the baton round and, to that end have already published the outcome of the literature review which represents the first phase of the project to look into alternatives for baton rounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/3">The Government have published strict guidelines in the use of baton rounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/4">The Chief Constable of the RUC has also publicly stated that baton rounds are used only when there is a risk to life that cannot be countered by other means. They are not for crowd control.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.2/6">During the past weekend, over 40 security force personnel were injured as a result of public order disturbances. No baton rounds were discharged.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/2">The chief inspector's report describes the work of the inspectorate over the past year and reports some of its principal findings. Magistrates' courts committees (MCCs) are seen to have made improvements in many areas. In particular, the co-operation between the courts, police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) at an operational level has strengthened further. The progress made on the operation of the Narey reforms aimed at reducing delay in the magistrates' courts and the Government's pledge to reduce the time taken to deal with persistent young offenders are examples of the benefits of close working.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/3">There have been advances made in the collation of performance information and in the way it is presented to the MCC, but effective analysis of this information remains a weakness for a number of MCCs. This is in spite of the situation being highlighted in last year's report. MCCs are, however, demonstrating a better awareness of the need to provide the strategic direction and of leaving operational matters to their officers.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.5/1">I have today announced a number of changes to the way applications for exceptional Community Legal Service funding will be handled. These changes are designed to make it easier for applicants to obtain funding in cases that would normally be outside the scope of the CLS. They follow on from the recent case of R v the Legal Services Commission and the Lord Chancellor ex parte Jarrett, and from our experience of handling exceptional cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/2">The main changes are as follows. A new test has been added to the existing criteria for obtaining exceptional funding. Previously, apart from satisfying the standard funding code criteria, applicants had to show that their cases raised matters of significant wider public interest or were of overwhelming importance to them. Now, it will also be possible to get funding if, without representation, it would be practically impossible for the applicant to proceed or there would be obvious unfairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/3">Different criteria have been developed for inquests. This is because these cases are different from standard court cases, the criteria for which are not always suitable. For example, there is no need for a test of overwhelming importance, since the death of a loved one will always be of overwhelming importance. The test for inquests is instead whether the family of the deceased need representation in order to help the coroner carry out the task of determining the cause of death.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/4">I have authorised the Legal Services Commission to grant funding in certain types of inquest without having to seek my authority in each individual case. This will make the application process shorter and more convenient for the bereaved. The cases in question are those where the death has occurred in police or prison custody, or during the course of police arrest, search, pursuit or shooting.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/5">These changes reflect the Government's continuing commitment to human rights. Although the court did not find against the Government or the Legal Services Commission in Mrs Jarrett's case, it encouraged us to reconsider our guidance on exceptional cases, which I have been happy to do. The new test for obtaining exceptional funding will make a major contribution towards achieving access to justice for people whose cases are complex or difficult, or who have particular problems that legal representation can help with. At the same time, the new arrangements for handling applications in inquests will improve the service we are able to give bereaved applicants, at a time when it is important for us to be as supportive as possible.</p>

In addition, every force's performance is risk assessed during formal inspections, including the road policing aspects.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.5/1">These figures are not centrally available.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.5/2">It is recognised that levels of early retirements due to ill health are too high. Figures have fallen over the last five years but remain at unacceptable levels in certain forces. The Home Office has asked the Police Negotiating Board to explore and agree ways to deliver a fair and more consistent approach towards early retirement due to ill health, so that forces can match the performance of the best quartile by 2005. We also hope to introduce a national occupational health strategy for the police service which should assist forces to manage cases of ill-health more effectively at the outset.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.2/1">The figures requested are not centrally available.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/2">The Police Pensions Review of March 1998 gave consideration to increasing normal retirement age to 60 and concluded that it was not a feasible option. Representatives of force medical officers told the review that very few officers beyond 55 years of age could be expected to be fit enough to perform the range of duties required of constables and sergeants. However, as part of the police reform programme we have asked the Police Negotiating Board to explore and agree flexible arrangements that give managers in the police service the scope to retain officers beyond 30 years where they wish to be of further use to the service.</p>

	Public Order Act: Incitement to Racial Hatred

	<p pid="a.183.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/2" qnum="HL856">How many (a) prosecutions and (b) convictions there have been in England and Wales for incitement to racial hatred in each year since the Public Order Act 1986 came into force; and what was the maximum penalty imposed in each year.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-11-01a.183.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="183"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo011101/text/11101w04.htm#11101w04_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.183.2/1">Records for prosecutions for incitement of racial hatred under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 have been kept since 1988. The records relate to the year that the application for consent to prosecute was dealt with and so it is not possible to state with any certainty how many prosecutions resulted in convictions in any given year. Also, there are no centrally held records that can provide reliable information as to the maximum sentence imposed in any given year. The number of applications for consent to prosecute for each year since 1988 and the number of convictions resulting from the prosecutions are summarised in the table below.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/2">In addition, figures published in the Crown Prosecution Service Racist Incident Monitoring Annual Report 1999-2000 shows that the number of racist incidents sent for prosecution rose from 1,603 in 1998-99 to 2,417 in 1999-2000. Prosecutions were brought against 1,832 defendants (76 per cent) on 2,651 charges. Guilty pleas were tendered on 66 per cent of the charges and there were convictions after trial on another 12 per cent of the charges. In total 2,078 (79 per cent) of the 2,651 charges prosecuted resulted in convictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/3">Almost half of the prosecutions were new offences of racially aggravated crime brought under the Crime and Disorder Act 1988, which came into force in September 1999. A high proportion of the remaining offences contained admissible evidence of racial aggravation and were prosecuted under other legislation.</p>

It was agreed that a further working group should be established to build on the work of the steering group and to bring forward detailed proposals for the reform of the domestic committee structure of the House. The working group will be chaired by me, and will include a Back-Bench member from each of the parties and from the Cross-Benches. The report of the working group will be presented to the Offices Committee in the new year.</p>
