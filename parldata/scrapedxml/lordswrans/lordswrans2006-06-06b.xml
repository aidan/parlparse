	<p pid="b.180.5/1">International non-governmental organisations maintain that, in 2005, only China carried out more executions than Iran. Iran does not publish official statistics of the total numbers of executions. The Iranian authorities continue in their failure to apply even the most basic of standards to the use of the death penalty. Many death sentences are carried out in public. The execution of two youths aged 17 and 20 in Khorrambad (Lorestan province) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-13">13 May</phrase>, barely a month after the crime for which they were hanged, raises serious questions about whether the death sentence that was handed down was the result of a fair trial and whether the two were able to exhaust all avenues of appeal open to them.</p>
