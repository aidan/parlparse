	<p pid="b.240.2/1">Section 4 of the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, states that, except where treatment is necessary to save the life of or prevent grave permanent injury to the pregnant woman, &quot;no person shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement, to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/2">The House of Lords ruled in 1988 that this exemption does not extend to giving advice, performing the preparatory steps to arrange an abortion where the request meets legal requirements and undertaking administration connected with abortion procedures. Doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion should make their views known to the patient and enable the patient to see another doctor without delay if that is the patient's wish. No recent discussions have taken place between the Secretary of State for Health and leaders of the medical profession on the interpretation of this ruling.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/3">The General Medical Council (GMC) booklet <i>Good Medical Practice </i>states that general practitioners' views about a patient's lifestyle or beliefs must not prejudice the treatment they provide or arrange. If they feel their beliefs might affect the treatment, this must be explained to the patient who should be told of their right to see another doctor. Breach of this guidance may expose a doctor to a charge of serious professional misconduct and disciplinary action by the GMC.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/4">The Department of Health has issued guidance on best practice where there are ethical objections to abortion, through the Recommended Standards for Sexual Health Services, produced for the department by the Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual Health.</p>

	<p pid="b.246.3/1">In the document <i>Identity Cards&mdash;The Next Steps</i> (Cm 6020) published in November 2003, the Government made clear that the costs of the first stage of the identity cards scheme would be met from charging or from departmental budgets. This is consistent with my right honourable friend the Home Secretary's remarks at the Second Reading debate on the Identity Cards Bill which referred only to fees charged to card holders. Clause 37 of the Bill allows for a range of fees to be set for different features of the scheme and for the issuing of passports, not all of which would fall on ID card holders. HM Treasury's guidelines allow for a range of fee strategies, including non-full cost recovery, subject to Ministers' and HM Treasury's agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.252.2/1">The number of large self-administered pension schemes which have made refunds to employers in connection with a fund surplus on a rolling three-year basis from 1994&ndash;95 to 2002&ndash;03 are available on the HMRC website at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/pensions/table7-7-september04.pdf">www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/pensions/table7&ndash;7&ndash;september04.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.2/2">The tax on these refunds would have been levied at 40 per cent. in respect of payments made to <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-10">10 May 2001</phrase> and at 35 per cent. for payments made thereafter. No estimates are available for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.2/3">The Government will introduce regulations under Section 37 of the Pensions Act 1995 as amended by the Pensions Act 2004 to provide that a payment of surplus may be made to an employer only where an actuary has certified that the scheme is funded to full buy-out&mdash;that is, that the assets are sufficient to secure the scheme's liabilities through the purchase of annuities&mdash;and where the trustees are satisfied that the payment to the employer is in the interests of the members of the scheme. There is no &quot;funding limit&quot; in Pensions Act legislation to make such a payment if the scheme is funded to this level; the regulations will be permissive.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.2/4">The existing tax legislation on pension fund surpluses will be replaced by the new, simplified tax regime for pension saving which comes into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>. This new regime sweeps away the numerous existing complex tax regimes and replaces them with a single universal regime for tax-privileged pension savings. One consequence of the new regime will be to remove the existing rules requiring pension fund surpluses to be repaid to sponsoring employers. Where, in line with the new Pension Act regulations, a surplus is repaid to an employer there will be a tax charge at the rate of 35 per cent. on the pension scheme. This change will mean that there will be no funding limit for 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.2/5">If an occupational pension scheme exceeds its funding limits this does not lead to tax relief already given to members being recovered from them. Although there are limits, under the tax current regime, on contributions that can be made to personal pension schemes, there is no funding limit.</p>

	<p pid="b.253.2/1">There is growing evidence that using automatic enrolment (or &quot;opt-out&quot;) is one of the most effective ways of increasing levels of workplace pension scheme membership. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July</phrase> we published the guidance, <i>Automatic enrolment in workplace pension schemes: guidance on the regulatory framework</i>, to show companies which want to provide their employees with good pension provision how they can use automatic enrolment to help more of them to make the most of that provision. Employees will be able to opt out of the scheme if they prefer, whether to make alternative provision or otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.2/2">The guidance specifically addresses concerns within the financial services industry that it is difficult, under current regulations, to use automatic enrolment in group personal pensions (GPPs) or stakeholder pensions (SHPs) and sets out the Government's view of the circumstances in which automatic enrolment into workplace GPPs and SHPs can be used within current regulations.</p>

Such attacks are an issue for all sections of society and appropriate action is taken at strategic and operational level by government departments, statutory agencies and a range of community partners. We have introduced a range of measures to combat hate crime including specific offences with increased maximum penalties for racially aggravated violence, harassment and criminal damage introduced in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998; and sentencing guidelines on aggravating factors in Northern Ireland. We encourage local crime and disorder reduction/community safety partnerships to work closely with the police to ensure that those who commit crimes are brought to justice. We encourage all victims to report such crimes so that they can be dealt with and appropriate preventive measures put in place.</p>

	<p pid="b.256.0/1">The Government's road safety strategy and casualty reduction targets&mdash;<i>Tomorrow's Roads&mdash;Safer for Everyone published </i>March 2000, sets out a 10 year plan to improve road safety. The strategy addresses a wide range of road safety issues including inappropriate or excessive speeding. The strategy includes over 20 proposals on speeding including revising guidance on setting local speed limits, which will be issued later this year, and the setting up and nationwide roll out of safety camera partnerships. The first three-year review of the strategy was published in April 2004. This set out progress so far and includes measures to deliver further improvements in speed awareness and speed management up until 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/2">In respect of illegal number plates the Government's strategy is to take action against motorists who display illegal number plates and to introduce new legislation to prosecute suppliers who sell them.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/3">The Road Vehicles (Display of Registration Marks) Regulations 2001 specify the typeface, colouring and the British Standard that number plates must conform to. Failure to display plates that conform to these regulations is an offence subject to a maximum penalty of &pound;1,000. In practice, the offence is enforced by police officers issuing a fixed penalty notice resulting in an on the spot fine of &pound;30.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/4">In addition, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency may withdraw any vehicle registration mark that is illegally displayed. A joint initiative between the agency and the Association of Chief Police Officers was introduced in 1999. Under this scheme, the police notify DVLA of number plate offences and DVLA warns offenders that any repetition will result in the registration mark being permanently withdrawn from use.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/5">The Road Safety Bill, currently before the House of Lords, would make it an offence to sell a number plate that does not comply with regulations relating to the display of registration marks.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/6">Powers are available to tackle the problem of illegal noisy exhaust systems. Under the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, Regulation 54 requires that &quot;every exhaust system and silencer must be maintained in good and efficient working order and shall not after the date of manufacture or be altered so as to increase the noise made by the escape of exhaust gases&quot;. Under Regulation 97 it is also an offence &quot;to use a vehicle in such a manner as to cause any excessive noise which could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care by the driver&quot;. Enforcement of these requirements is by the police and in the case of maintenance, at MOT.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/7">For motorcycles; it is an additional requirement that after-market/replacement silencers must not be sold or fitted unless they bear an appropriate approval mark that differentiates between acceptable and noisy silencers. Silencers marked &quot;not for road use&quot;, or similar, are illegal if used on public roads. Due to safety considerations and the practicalities of enforcement at the roadside, such markings are not required in the case of other vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/8">Powers are available to local authorities to prevent or abate noise nuisance from any vehicle in the street. These powers are generally applied to stationary vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="b.259.2/1">Decisions on taxation are a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who keeps all taxes under review as part of the usual Budget process. In determining appropriate levels of vehicle excise duty (VED) for all road users, the Chancellor will continue to take into account all relevant environmental, social and economic factors, including the competitiveness of the UK haulage industry. Levels of VED for UK lorries were significantly reduced in 2001, and have not increased since then.</p>
