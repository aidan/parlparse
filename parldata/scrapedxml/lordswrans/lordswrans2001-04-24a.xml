	<p pid="a.31.2/1">We are advised by the Food Standards Agency, which is responsible for issues of food safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/2">Food imported from countries outside of the European Union is subject to import controls at United Kingdom ports. All foods of animal origin from third countries are subject to harmonised EU import controls, including documentary and identity checks, and to prescribed levels of physical checks. Imported foods of non-animal origin from countries outside the EU are subject to inspection under UK legislation. Food may be detained at ports whilst checks are undertaken and food found not to comply with hygiene requirements may be destroyed, used for purposes other than food, or re-exported.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/3">In addition to controls at import, all imported food, including food imported from other EU member states, may be inspected at the point of destination in the UK and is subject to the same checks at retail level as food produced in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/4">In light of current concerns about illegal imports of food of animal origin, the Food Standards Agency has written to port health authorities and local authorities to ensure continued vigilance and checks on imported products both at the point of import and at the retail level.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/5">Finally, the Government are considering as a matter of urgency whether controls on imports of meat and meat products can be made more effective.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">The Ministry of Defence policy for procuring food and dealing with the waste food from catering services fully conforms with current national and EU regulations and is subject to inspection by local authority environmental health officers. Current regulations permit three methods of waste food disposal:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2" class="indent">With local authority agreement, food waste may be macerated through kitchen garbage disposal units and drained away through the mains drainage system.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/3" class="indent">Contracts may be let with licensed environmental waste removal contractors, who subsequently dispose of the food waste by incineration or landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/4" class="indent">Agreements may be made for the disposal of wet food waste to pig swill contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/5">The majority of MoD establishments dispose of food waste through macerator systems or contract disposal rather than pig swill contractors. Where agreements exist with makers of pig swill, the contractors must comply with strict legal restrictions applicable to the carriage and processing of food waste. Contractors are required to be licensed by local authorities and MoD establishments entering into agreements with contractors have a responsibility to ensure that the contractors hold appropriate licences in accordance with extant legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/6">Only one such agreement exists between the MoD and Mr Waugh. For over 25 years an unwritten agreement has existed between local Army commanders and the Waugh Brothers to dispose of a minimal amount of wet food waste on an occasional basis from the Whitburn Training Camp located between Sunderland and South Shields. The Waugh Brothers are licensed by the local authority to collect food waste for delivery to an authorised processor. The agreement was conducted at nil cost due to the very small volumes of waste involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.2/1">The task of buying food for the Armed Forces is carried out by the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) food supply contractor, 3663. Both the Ministry of Defence and 3663 have been working extensively with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Meat and Livestock Commission, and farmers' representatives to explore ways to increase the proportion of British meat that MoD can buy competitively. This has been a successful initiative and we are hopeful that more British meat will be procured as a result. Value for money is achieved for all meat purchases by scrutinising the prime cost of meat that 3663 supply via monthly price checks and independent benchmarking as well as being fully open to audit by Special Procurement Services, a support group of the Defence Procurement Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.3/1">The Transport and Telecommunications Council concluded that the Commission should be able to delay a measure proposed by a national regulatory authority for a period of one month during which it could make public a detailed opinion stating why it considered the measure to be incompatible with Community law and, in particular, the objectives referred to in Article 7 of the proposal for a Directive on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. Since undertakings will be able to appeal against such measures under Article 4 of the Directive and the Commission's powers to take infringement proceedings under the Treaty will be unaffected, the Government believe that this should act as a powerful incentive to national regulatory authorities to act appropriately and strikes the right balance between flexibility for appropriate regulatory intervention and consistency of application across the Community for undertakings.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/2">The Council also welcomed the conclusion of the Stockholm Summit that the Commission work together with the Council towards a supportive policy framework for third-generation mobile communications within the Union, including agreement on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy as well as broadband networks, and that the Commission be invited to examine the effect of third-generation licensing on European competitiveness and the advancement of the ICT field.</p>

I am not, therefore, able to answer precisely in the form of the question.

	<p pid="a.40.6/1">Latest figures show that from January 1998 to the end of January 2001, 91,700 young people had started the full-time education and training option of New Deal; 44,000 young people started the voluntary sector option and 41,700 started the environment taskforce option. As the Employment Service does not routinely record the type of employment of New Deal leavers, it is not possible to say what proportion has become self-employed. However, over the same period as above, 42,100 people started subsidised employment, of which 3,180 started test trading through the subsidised self-employment route.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.6/2">The Government recognise the importance of self-employment in encouraging innovation from young entrepreneurs and, as such, support for those wishing to become self-employed is an important part of the wide range of provision available to New Deal participants. In addition to those who have started test trading, many others have already benefited from information, advice, and training in how to set up and run a business and produce a business plan. The New Deal for Young People options provide good tailored training for real jobs, as well as developing general employability--half the people gaining jobs after an option said they received training in those jobs. Nine out of 10 were satisfied with their training.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.6/3">In the Green Paper Towards full employment in a modern society, we said that we will introduce more individually tailored provision in the option period of the New Deal. This will include development of modular, intensive courses and provision with greater relevance to local labour markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.6/4">Nationally, 279,020 young people have been recorded as gaining jobs. In addition, we know that many people will have left New Deal for employment without telling the Employment Service; these people are not included in the figures. However, extensive surveys show that at least 56 per cent of those recorded as an unknown destination will have entered employment, indicating that a further 82,208 young people gained jobs from New Deal.</p>
