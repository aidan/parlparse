	<p pid="a.69.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2" qnum="HL2282">What recent action they have taken to combat retail crime; what estimate they have made of its cost to retailers; and what further action they are considering.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-04-26a.69.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040426/text/40426w01.htm#40426w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.69.2/1">The Government do not routinely collect information about the cost of retail crime but do take crime against the retail sector very seriously and are taking a wide range of actions to combat this. The British Retail Consortium conducts an annual retail crime survey and the most recent, published in June 2003, estimated the total cost of retail crime in the United Kingdom in 2002 at &pound;2.25 billion. This includes the cost of crime prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">The Government have provided &pound;15 million over the past three years to improve the security of small retail businesses in deprived areas. Around 12,500 individual businesses have benefited from the scheme. As part of this scheme we also commissioned and funded a nation-wide series of security training seminars for small retailers.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">We have also agreed to provide &pound;899,000 to the British Retail Consortium for the formation of the Action against Business Crime (AABC) group. The AABC group will provide support to existing retail/business crime partnerships and will set up 100 new business crime reduction partnerships in priority locations over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/4">Local businesses are encouraged to become a member of their Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). The CDRP aims to work together to do what it can reasonably to prevent and reduce crime within its local authority area. This could also be a way to reduce fear of crime within the local community, especially if local businesses can help the community to find solutions to its local problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/5">Anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) can also be used to protect shopworkers. ASBOs can prohibit persons entering specified areas such as shopping centres; they can also prohibit persons engaging in specified anti-social acts, for example shoplifting, verbally abusing shopworkers, writing graffiti on a shop, and can also prohibit persons approaching specified persons.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/6">Drug-related crime is of concern to many retailers and so we are piloting two schemes, in Brighton and Northampton, to help reduce drug-related retail crime by ensuring that persistent shop thieves with drug problems have access to treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/7">In January of this year we set up a forum of small business representatives, many of which are retail organisations, to provide them with an opportunity to voice concerns and make suggestions direct to the Government. As a result of the concerns raised in the forum three working groups have been developed. These groups are business led and will examine the police response to business crime, possible options for incentivising business to take crime reduction measures and help to develop a strategy to provide crime reduction information and advice to business.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/8">We believe that it is important to work with the retail sector in crime reduction, and representatives of the Home Office, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Small Business Service have played an active role in the crime sub-group of the industry-led Retail Strategy Group. The group will produce a report shortly and we will take account of its recommendations when considering further action to combat retail crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">Yes. The Government believe in integration with diversity. This means both breaking down the barriers to and positively promoting integration, including working with communities to face down racism and other forms of extremism. It agrees with the Chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) that multiculturalism is no longer a helpful word to the extent that it has come to mean cultural separateness.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.0/1">The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 Part 4 powers enable the Home Secretary to certify and detain foreign nationals who are suspected of involvement in international terrorism. These individuals have a right of appeal to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">SIAC has adopted the common law approach to evidence which may have been obtained elsewhere through the use of torture&mdash;save for the evidence that is obtained from a party (usually the defendant in a criminal trial), all evidence is admissible, however unlawfully obtained. However, where that evidence may have been obtained by torture, this will bear on the proper weight to be given to the information. The means by which information is obtained therefore goes to its reliability and weight and not to its admissibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/3">SIAC, in its open determination (<phrase class="date" code="2003-10-29">29 October 2003</phrase>), specifically considered Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture (CAT), which relates to statements which are established to have been made as a result of torture and concluded that their determination was compliant with this article.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/4">But we must take seriously our obligation to protect national security and the well-being of the citizens of the United Kingdom and we would be deficient in this duty if we did not properly assess all information involved in the war on terror.</p>

This means that each element of the pay package has to be considered separately and it is not sufficient to compare total pay. Any term which is less favourable (whether in the man's or the woman's contract) would need to be modified to be as favourable unless the employer can show that there is a genuine material factor for the difference which is not the difference of sex. bjc</p>

	<p pid="a.76.3/37">1. All figures are rounded individually to the nearest &pound;1,000. There may therefore be discrepancies between the totals of the rounded numbers and the column totals. The column totals are correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/38">2. Incentive regime payments and receipts are calculated in arrears, but the figures in this table refer to transactions actually made during the financial year.</p>
