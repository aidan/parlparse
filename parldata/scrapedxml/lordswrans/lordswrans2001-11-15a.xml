	<p pid="a.95.2/1">While it is an offence to incite another to commit an offence, &quot;religious hatred&quot; in itself, like &quot;racial hatred&quot;, is not an offence. That is why Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 contains specific incitement to racial hatred provisions. In this context &quot;racial hatred&quot; is defined as hatred against a group of persons in Great Britain defined by reference to colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. Under this definition the courts have ruled that Jews and Sikhs can be deemed &quot;racial groups&quot;, by virtue of a specific ethnic identity, but that Muslims and Christians, for example, cannot. As part of the Anti-Terrorist, Crime and Security Bill introduced earlier this week, we have proposed expanding incitement to racial hatred to cover religious hatred, to protect everyone from religious hatred and harassment.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.6/1">Air quality is monitored in different ways at a large number of sites across London.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.6/2">First, there are seven fully automated air quality monitoring sites in London which form part of the Government's Automatic Urban and Rural Air Quality Monitoring Network (AURN). This network is made up of over 100 automatic monitoring stations across the country which are situated at a mixture of roadside, background and suburban locations. Site details are available via the department's website <a href="http://www.defra.gsi.gov.uk">www.defra.gsi.gov.uk</a>. Information from them is available in real time on an hourly basis for most key pollutants. The results are incorporated into the Government's air quality information service and made available over the Internet and via teletext, as well as via a freephone service.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.6/3">The Government also have a large non-automatic air quality monitoring network. Non-automatic (or &quot;passive&quot;) air quality monitoring involves less frequent monitoring of pollutant concentrations and is used to calculate daily, weekly or monthly averages. Samples are collected by physical means (such as by diffusion tube or filter) and are then subjected to chemical analysis, with the final concentrations calculated from these results. This network includes over 1,000 non-automatic monitoring sites across the country, of which over 70 are in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.6/4">In addition to this, local authorities also have a key role to play in monitoring air quality in London and elsewhere. All local authorities are required to review and assess their air quality with a view to identifying possible pollution hotspots. As part of this process, most local authorities undertake both automatic and non-automatic monitoring of air quality at representative locations throughout their areas. The Government oversee this process and advise authorities on the technical aspects of monitoring, including on the appropriate siting of monitoring stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.6/5">Within London, each of the London boroughs carries out its own automatic and passive monitoring. The London Automatic Air Quality Monitoring Network (LAQMN) comprises about 66 urban, suburban and rural locations, of which 16 urban or suburban sites are affiliated to the national AURN. In addition to this, all of the London boroughs carry out their own non-automatic monitoring at a number of sites. Comprehensive details of these sites are not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.2/1">At this stage no decisions have been made about the detailed service patterns of a Crossrail link or which destinations would be served. The current position is that the London East West Study report, produced in December 2000 by the Strategic Rail Authority in consultation with Transport for London and other interested parties, identified a number of service options for a cross London rail link. The report was considered by the High-Level Group which was set up to develop a co-ordinated approach to London rail projects. My right honourable friend the Minister for Transport chairs this group, which also includes the Mayor of London, the Commissioner for Transport in London and the Chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority. In May, the group decided, following additional appraisal of the SRA report, that work should start immediately on project definition and design development of a central, cross-London rail link.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.2/2">The project definition work is being taken forward jointly by the Strategic Rail Authority and Transport for London through Cross London Rail Links Ltd (CLRL). It was recently announced that Sir Christopher Benson had been appointed Chairman of CLRL. All potential route options are being examined in this stage. The project definition exercise will include extensive consultation with local authorities, regional development agencies and other interested parties before any recommendations on service patterns and routes are made to the High-Level Group. We hope that CLRL will be in a position to put a short list of options to the High-Level Group next spring, with a specific recommendation next autumn.</p>

There are currently 84 registered learning providers about which the department has had a larger number of complaints and about which it has more serious concerns. Police are in the early stages of investigating suspected fraud by two of these and have expressed an initial interest in another nine providers. The department's Special Investigations Unit is undertaking investigative work on these nine cases prior to a possible formal police investigation.</p>
