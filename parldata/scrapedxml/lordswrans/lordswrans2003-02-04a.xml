The international coalition has no control over prisoners held by Afghan authorities or other Afghan elements, although Her Majesty's Government continue to underline to the Afghan authorities the importance of them fulfilling their obligations under the international human rights instruments to which Afghanistan is party.</p>

Information on DfID funding for HIV/AIDS is aggregated according to whether spend is primarily HIV/AIDS focused, contains a significant component of HIV/AIDS activity, and if it is a cross-cutting HIV/AIDS intervention.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.3/1">Policing methods such as interviewing techniques are the responsibility of individual member states of the European Union and are not the subject of approximation measures. Furthermore, the differing systems of policing in place within individual member states would make any such harmonisation difficult. Different approaches are however no bar to the effective police co-operation which is already in place across the European Union, including the exchange of information obtained during police investigations and exchange of best practice between police forces. Co-operation between police forces will be further enhanced by the provisions of the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill.</p>

To that end it establishes a process which will ensure that hunting is permitted only where it is to be undertaken for a specified pest control purpose and where no other method of achieving that purpose that would cause less suffering is reasonably available. However, the Bill is only about hunting. It does not seek to control all methods of pest control, and does not prevent people using any other method of pest control that is legal including the use of shotguns or other kinds of gun.</p>

There was a need for extensive consultation and review of the relevant published literature and reports. The review focused on clinical negligence. At present, compensation or other financial help to patients is only given when the NHS has been at fault. Ministers do not believe that an exception should be made to that general rule in the case of people with haemophilia infected with hepatitis C. The CMO is working up a comprehensive report for the Government outlining options for reforming the present system for handling clinical negligence claims, which aims to make the system fairer for all those who suffer injury through negligent National Health Service treatment. These proposals are under consideration by Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.9/1">The Ministry of Defence awarded the prime contract for Project SLAM to the Birmingham based Debut consortium, led by Bovis Lend Lease and Babcock Services Ltd, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-18">18 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.9/2">The contract for SLAM is the first five-year phase of a 10-year programme. It encompasses all ranks across each of the services and will deliver in the order of 16,000 upgraded bed spaces in around 100 projects on the basis of worst first. These will be predominantly single room en suite and will include utility areas, common areas and ancillary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.9/3">The SLAM prime contract covers the period 2003 until 2007 inclusive. There are 30 projects scheduled to start during the first year of the contract, with first wave programmed to start on site between May and August 2003 and completion from May 2004 onwards. Those projects commenced during 2007 are expected to be completed for occupation some 18 months to two years later.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.9/4">In addition, the prime contractor will be required to maintain each individual project following handover for occupation for a further seven years. This is to enable the prime contractor to prove the assumptions made at the design stage in the running of the facilities and to demonstrate value for money and innovation during the maintenance period. (The implication of this is that the last phase of projects completed and handed over for occupation in 2009 will be maintained by the prime contractor until 2016.)</p>

	<p pid="a.30.8/1">Public Bodies 2002 is the latest in a series of publications providing information on public bodies sponsored by government, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.8/2">In addition to giving details about the remit and expenditure of public bodies, the publication also gives information about the number of women, people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people with disabilities who sit on the boards of public bodies. I am pleased to announce that the proportion of those from minority ethnic backgrounds and those with disabilities holding public appointments have increased from 4.8 per cent to 6.2 per cent and from 1.5 per cent to 3.3 per cent respectively, although it is disappointing that the percentage of women holding such appointments, 34 per cent, has remained static. Departments will continue to work hard to encourage increased participation of women on the boards of public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.8/3">Additionally, this year's publication includes information about the Government's task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews. Previously these were reported on separately and to a different timetable. Including this data in one publication gives a more complete picture of the extended bodies and groups working to deliver government objectives.</p>
