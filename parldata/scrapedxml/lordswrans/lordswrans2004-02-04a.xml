	<p pid="a.103.2/1">The Government welcome the report from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics on The Use of GM Crops in Developing Countries. The report offers a constructive contribution to the on-going debate on genetic modification technologies. The Government share the report's conclusions that achieving food security and reducing poverty in developing countries are complex issues, that GM crops are unlikely to feed the world but that in some circumstances they could make a useful contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor people in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/2">The Department for International Development is currently preparing a new strategy to guide its future research investments. Under this, the department expects to maintain a substantial programme of agricultural research. In support of this intention, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development recently announced an additional &pound;30 million over the next three years for the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, a major part of the global effort to mobilise agricultural science to reduce poverty. Some of this funding may support research on genetic modification technologies provided that they have the potential to benefit poor farmers if used safely and responsibly and that developing countries themselves are able to make their own informed choices on whether to adopt these technologies. DfID seeks to ensure that all technologies that it promotes are safe, affordable, appropriate and respond to demand from poor people.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.5/1">Since 1999 the stability pact has worked to enhance the economic investment environment in south-east Europe by establishing an infrastructure steering group. This group includes the European Investment Bank, World Bank, European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, Council of Europe Bank and is chaired by the European Commission. Under the framework of the stability pact, 57 infrastructure projects in phase 1 have received a total of 3.68 billion euros in three sectors: regional transport, energy and environment. The next phase will also focus on infrastructure investment and is on-going. The stability pact has also encouraged foreign direct investment by helping to create free trade in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/2">Details are available at <a href="http://www.stabilitypact.org/investment/default.asp">http://www.stabilitypact.org/investment/default.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/3">The river Danube is open for navigation. All of the debris from the bridges destroyed in 1999 was cleared from the river by May 2003 and almost 7,000 vessels passed through Novi Sad in 2003. The Danube Commission is not responsible for rebuilding the bridges. However, one bridge has been replaced by a pontoon bridge (river traffic is allowed through every second night), one by a temporary bridge and one bridge is being rebuilt, with completion expected by the end of 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.2/1">None of the staff support associations, including the Black Police Association and the Gay Police Association, is formally recognised by the Metropolitan Police Service for collective bargaining purposes; nor do they have the representational or negotiating rights of the Police Federation, Superintendents' Association or the recognised constituent trade unions. The staff support associations are however consulted regarding policy changes, particularly with regard to diversity issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/2">The Government have a shared interest in working collaboratively with these and other staff associations, including the British Association for Women in Policing. They are represented on a number of Home Office groups and are consulted on a wide range of policy initiatives to improve diversity in the workplace and to ensure effective delivery of policing services to all communities. The National Black Police Association, for example, is represented on the Lawrence Steering Group, contributing to diversity issues and providing a vital perspective on the link between communities and police.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">The THC content of different cannabis products has varied and continues to vary widely. The Forensic Science Service (FSS) regularly analyses drug seizures and indicates that new growing techniques since the 1990s have led to some new products, such as skunk, coming onto the market with average THC levels two or three times greater than for other cannabis products.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">There is no accurate estimate available for the proportion of skunk available as a proportion of all cannabis used in the U.K. The FSS has little recorded information on the type of herbal cannabis encountered. However, anecdotal information from FSS scientists suggests that there has been an increase in &quot;skunk&quot; type cannabis in both police and customs seizures.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.8/1">Research suggests that cannabis, especially in high doses, can produce a &quot;toxic psychosis&quot; in individuals who have no history of severe mental illness, and that one constituent delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) itself has dose-related effects producing acute symptoms and signs.

An executive summary of the group's report and the Government's response was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-17">17 October 2002</phrase> and a copy was placed in the House of Lords Library. We have:</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/2" class="indent">created (in October 2002) a new swimming and water safety website which provides practical support for schools and swimming teachers;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/3" class="indent">carried out (during the summer term 2003) two pilot programmes to test out how best to support those children who reach the end of key stage 2 unable to swim 25 metres; an executive summary of this report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-21">21 January 2004</phrase>; and</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/4" class="indent">published a Swimming Charter in December 2003. The charter offers guidance, best practice case studies and provides practical support to help schools and local authorities overcome many of the challenges they face when planning and delivering school swimming.</p>

The programme will identify where there is most need and provide specific professional development and support to help ensure high quality swimming tuition in schools. The programme went live in 2003.</p>
