An existing allowance known as Longer Separated Service Allowance (LSSA), which is payable to Service personnel who have completed a qualifying period of service and are separated from their duty stations for periods of 10 continuous days or more (whether operationally or not), was enhanced to include a two-tier bonus scheme known as Accumulated Turbulence (AT) and Accumulated Turbulence Plus (AT+). These are taxable lump sums paid as compensation to personnel who experience an intensive level of separation (however occasioned) over a two-year period. LSSA (AT) of &pound;1,000.00 is paid once 280 accumulated days' paid separation has been accrued in a two-year period.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-07-25a.43.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="43"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000725/text/00725w04.htm#00725w04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.43.2/1">In July 1998, as part of the Strategic Defence Review, the Government concluded that the future for DERA could best be secured by harnessing the opportunities offered by a Public Private Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-17">17 April</phrase>, we announced a period of consultation on a document describing our current proposals (Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-17">17 April</phrase>, cols. 366-367W). This consultation exercise came to an end on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-09">9 June</phrase>. In their responses, stakeholders, including the Defence Select Committed, have acknowledged the improvements we have made over earlier proposals and have welcomed our willingness to listen to their views. The overall response has been positive, with the majority of stakeholders recognising the need for change and endorsing our proposals as a sensible way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/3">Consequently, we have concluded that we should proceed with the Core Competence model set out in the consultation document, separating those functions that are best performed within a private sector company, and those that are best performed wholly within government. Around three-quarters of the current DERA will be turned into a company, which will move to the private sector through a flotation which could be in 2001. The terms and conditions of staff will be protected by TUPE regulations. Just under 3,000 staff will be retained within the Ministry of Defence to provide a high level overview of defence science and technology, in-house impartial advice and management of international research collaboration. The retained elements would include sensitive programmes and sectors such as the Chemical and Biological Defence sector based at Porton Down, the majority of the Centre for Defence Analysis and the Defence Radiological Protection Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/4">The new company will have the freedom to flourish, to develop its business and to exploit the wealth of knowledge it has built over the years to the benefit of the wider UK economy. It will be capable of attracting and retaining staff with expertise in areas that are also in demand from other private sector companies. We will explore the potential for employees of the new company to benefit from the partnership. This might include the establishment of a share scheme linked to the organisation's future performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/5">The new company is likely to continue to provide the Ministry of Defence's largest source of independent scientific and technical capability into the foreseeable future. This does not imply that the relationship with the Ministry of Defence will, in principle, need to be different from that with other private sector organisations. To help ensure the smooth creation of the new company, we have begun the search for a suitable chairman.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/6">Retained DERA (RDERA) will perform a number of critical functions for the Ministry of Defence. It will be a world class organisation offering rewarding career opportunities within the Ministry of Defence and the wider civil service. We envisage that RDERA will continue under the existing Trading Fund arrangements, although we will wish to assure ourselves that this will be appropriate in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/7">We are confident that the principles behind Core Competence are right, but we recognise that there is much detailed work to be carried out during implementation. Our timetable envisages that we will achieve separation between the two parts by the end of this year. We will then conduct a rigorous period of shadow operation to demonstrate that both organisations and their supporting infrastucture are robust and will perform as expected. We expect this to last around three months but we retain the flexibility to extend the period if we feel that it is prudent to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/8">Thereafter we will vest the company with its assets, establish it as a separate government-owned plc, and complete the preparations necessary for its sale. As we identified in the consultation document, our preference is to seek a flotation on the stock market as soon as its potential is suitably developed and as soon as we can ensure best value for the taxpayer. We will keep open the option of seeking a strategic partner for the business as an intermediate step. It is likely that the Ministry of Defence will initially retain a financial stake in the new company to ensure that the taxpayer will benefit from the growth following the sale. We do not envisage that in the longer term we would continue to hold a financial stake in the company. However, we intend to retain a special share as a means of protecting UK defence interests, such as ensuring continuing access to strategic assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/9">DERA is also home to the Defence Diversification Agency (DDA), which was set up to help take forward our commitment to strengthening links between civil and military technology. We remain fully committed to ensuring that the objectives set for the DDA are met, and we are currently reviewing how best to take forward its role in the light of the PPP process.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/10">Throughout the PPP process we have remained committed to the objective of ensuring the best possible future for DERA and for defence science and technology. We have consulted widely, listening and responding to the views of our stakeholders. We now have a way forward that is workable and which is good for DERA, the Ministry of Defence and the wider UK economy. It will offer value for money to the taxpayer whilst ensuring that our Armed Forces retain access to leading edge technology. It will provide a stimulus for the exploitation of science within the wider UK economy and strengthen the links between civil and defence technology.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.2/1">Our analysis of operations in Kosovo identified a number of important equipment capability lessons. The highest priority of these is the need for improvements to our capability to attack static, mobile and armoured targets with precision in all weather conditions, and to improve the security of our communications.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">In March we announced trials of the integration of Maverick anti-armour missiles on Harrier GR7 and of enhanced security for air-to-air communications on key aircraft types.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/3">We have now decided that we will proceed with the procurement of Maverick missiles as soon as the integration trials are successfully completed, subject to satisfactory contract negotiations. Maverick is a proven, off-the-shelf precision guided missile that we can procure very quickly and it will give us a better capability to attack mobile and static targets by day and night. We expect the missiles to be available towards the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/4">On air-to-air communications, most of the trials have been completed and we will now go ahead with the fitting of the system to a number of aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/5">Furthermore, we have decided to procure as early as possible weapons that will provide the RAF with a new precision guided all-weather bombing capability. Use of Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology will allow us to overcome the problems caused by poor weather during Kosovo. Subject to a successful flight trial, the weapons should be available next year.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-07-25a.47.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100284" speakername="Baroness Hayman" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000725/text/00725w05.htm#00725w05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.47.3/1">The Government have decided to make a number of important changes to the way the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food operates in the regions in order to improve the services we offer to farmers and to strengthen the contribution we make to the wider rural economy. We will participate fully in the Government Offices for the Regions, strengthening MAFF's regional policy capability. We will set up new organisational structures to enhance the delivery of rural development polices. And we will invest up to &pound;130 million over the next spending period to modernise the way we administer CAP schemes, taking full advantage of the benefits of electronic service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/2">We have given careful consideration to the findings of a detailed study of methods of delivering CAP payments, submitted at the beginning of this year by PricewaterhouseCoopers. We have concluded that the interests of farmers, traders and taxpayers would best be served by the creation of a new CAP Payments Agency, merging the paying agency functions of MAFF's nine Regional Service Centres and the Intervention Board to provide top quality customer service using modern electronic systems. Farmers and traders will benefit from a reduction in &quot;red tape&quot; and more efficient and rapid processing of payments, with the achievement of 95 per cent electronic service delivery capability by March 2004. There will be significant benefits for taxpayers, with a 10 per cent cut by March 2004 in unit costs of administering payments and further savings in subsequent years after the new agency is fully established.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/3">We have written to the main organisations representing farmers and traders to explain how the agency will work, and to seek their views on the best ways of ensuring a smooth transition to the new arrangements. We will work very closely with our customers to help them reap the benefits which electronic service delivery offers. However, we recognise that many farmers are apprehensive about changes in the way their claims are handled and we will maintain arrangements for face-to-face local contacts with farmers, at least until the new IT systems are fully operational and everyone has easy local access to the Internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/4">The agency will be constituted as an executive agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and will therefore be answerable to its Minister. It will continue to administer the schemes currently operated by the Intervention Board in all parts of the UK, and the devolved administrations will therefore be represented on its Ownership Board. It will operate from five sites, with its headquarters at Reading and other sites at Carlisle, Exeter, Newcastle and Northallerton. The work that will transfer to the new agency currently accounts for some 80 per cent of the 2,000 staff in the Regional Service Centres and nearly all the Intervention Board's 1,350 staff. By the time the new systems are fully operational (2004), we estimate that the total number of staff required will fall to around 1,950. We will make every effort to find suitable alternative employment for staff who are no longer required as a result of the modernisation programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/5">We have also been reviewing other aspects of MAFF's organisation in the regions in the light of the Modernising Government initiative and the recent PIU reports Rural Economies and Reaching Out. It is now right to establish greater integration of MAFF's strategic and policy activities in the regions with Government Offices. We are therefore preparing to provide a senior member of MAFF staff, with appropriate support, to join each Government Office. This will help to strengthen the rural capability of the Government Offices and improve their links with the MAFF. And it will foster closer relationships with regional stakeholders, including the agriculture, fisheries and food industries, and their representatives, regional institutions such as the Regional Development Agencies, and representatives of rural and environmental interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/6">Parallel to the integration with Government Offices, we have decided to restructure the work currently carried out in the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency (FRCA) and the non-CAP payment functions of the Regional Service Centres. We will create a single, nationally managed but largely regionally based service to carry out this work. The service will be set up so that it relates effectively to Government Offices. Its staff will be located throughout England and will continue to provide a local service on the ERDP schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/7">We will build on the considerable skills of staff in FRCA and the Regional Service Centres to create the new service as a centre of excellence for the delivery of rural development policies and programmes, particularly one of MAFF's flagship policies--the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP). It will provide continuing employment opportunities for some staff at the RCSs which are not to be CAPPA sites (Bristol, Cambridge, Crewe, Nottingham and Worcester) as well as for FRCA staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/8">We would expect to review these organisational arrangements in 2003 at the end of the mid-point review of the ERDP, and to consider at that stage whether further integration with the Government Offices would be sensible.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/9">The decision to implement this comprehensive programme of changes is a further element in MAFF's commitment to delivering efficient and responsive modern public services. The new CAP Payments Agency will ensure that service standards to farmers and traders are second to none. And agriculture and the wider rural economy will benefit through the strengthening of MAFF's regional policy presence.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/10">We recognise that these decisions will create considerable uncertainty for staff in MAFF's Regional Service Centres and at the Intervention Board who have worked hard to provide good services to their customers. We have met the trade unions to discuss the position, and to assure them that we are committed to ensuring that everyone is treated fairly and sensitively as we take the change programme forward.</p>
