	<p pid="b.66.0/1">There are no special arrangements for private homes completed in the London Thames Gateway but all new homes must meet the energy efficiency standards set out in part L of the building regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-29">29 March 2007</phrase>, the Department for Communities and Local Government published a &quot;forward look&quot; paper setting out its intention to increase the energy efficiency standards of new homes above 2006 levels by 25 per cent in 2010, 44 per cent in 2013 and for all new homes to be zero carbon by 2016. The DCLG is also working with key stakeholders to bring forward regulations for minimum standards of water efficiency in new homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/3">Since April 2007, all new homes, both private and affordable, can be rated against the code for sustainable homes. The code is a voluntary sustainability assessment and rating system. Ratings range from one star (above building regulations) to six stars (a zero-carbon home). A code rating certificate provides valuable information to home buyers and offers developers a tool with which to market themselves in sustainability terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/4">The Housing Corporation sets the standards for affordable housing in England funded under the National Affordable Housing Programme (NAHP), and requires all new housing funded under the 2008-11 NAHP bid round to comply with level three of the code. Furthermore, during the bid assessment process for the 2008-11 NAHP competition, the Housing Corporation's grant index tool will enhance the value of bids which commit to achieving level four or above.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/5">All projects funded by English Partnerships must meet level three of the code for Sustainable Homes. English Partnership also has quality and price standards, which include a section on sustainability, which are mandatory for all projects that it funds. These standards are in the process of being revised and the new standards will be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.3/2">However, in recognition of the fact that regional recruitment and retention problems in the public sector are different, since April 2006, regional assemblies (formerly regional housing boards) have been able to recommend other priority groups for assistance through the Government's low-cost home-ownership scheme.

	<p pid="b.67.2/2">At 1015 hours Essex County Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that a 200-metre hazard zone had been established around the van that was on fire. The main rail line between London and Colchester was within this hazard zone, hence the necessity to close the railway line. A request was made to Network Rail by Essex County Fire and Rescue Service to close this line at 1010 hours on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">5 October 2007</phrase>. The railway line was reopened at 1829 hours on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">5 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.2/3">At 1829 hours on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">5 October 2007</phrase>, Essex Police in conjunction with Essex County Fire and Rescue Service agreed to reduce the hazard zone to allow the reopening of the main railway line and also the northbound carriageway of the A12 trunk road.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.2/4">Due to the unique properties of acetylene, even after a fire has been extinguished. acetylene may continue to self-heat; this poses a significant risk with a potential risk of a catastrophic explosion. With this in mind, the current national recognised safe system of work is for the inclusion of a 200-metre hazard zone at fires which involve acetylene cylinders. This is to ensure that the safety of emergency crews and members of the public is maintained as a priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.2/5">After 24 hours of water cooling to the affected cylinder, at 1022 hours on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-06">6 October 2007</phrase>, the vehicle was removed and the southbound carriageway of the A12 was reopened by Essex Police.</p>
