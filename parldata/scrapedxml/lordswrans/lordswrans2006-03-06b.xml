The report finds that much of the headline rise can be accounted for by changes in diagnostic practice and public awareness.

	<p pid="b.111.5/1">British Nationals (Overseas) in Hong Kong, who previously applied to register as British citizens under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) 1997 Act but were deemed not to have met the requirement to be solely British, can request to have their applications reconsidered. This is in the light of a clarification made by the Indian authorities on Indian nationality law. The British Consulate-General initially offered the standard advice that applications for registration as a British citizen may take up to 18 months for the process to be completed by the Home Office. Following negotiations between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office, that advice has been revised. Extra resources are being allocated to this work in April, after which the average processing time for the Home Office is expected to be in the region of five weeks. The British Consulate-General website will be amended to take into account Home Office reassessment times.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.2/1">Although the EU can encourage co-operation between member states, the content and organisation of education systems is the responsibility of member states. Pupils in England learn about Europe and the European Union at secondary school. They are taught about the history of Britain in its European and wider context within national curriculum history and about the world as a global community, the role of the European Union and the UK's relations in Europe, including the European Union in national curriculum citizenship. Teaching also reflects the underpinning values and principles of democratic life which are already covered in the European and United Nation's Human Rights conventions. The Government believe that these provide a robust basis for young people to learn about our shared values. The Government recognise the importance of pupils gaining an understanding of EU history, and that is reflected in the national curriculum.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.0/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a technology appraisal on the clinical and cost effectiveness of use of stents for the treatment of heart disease in October 2003. It was recommended that stents should normally be used when clinically appropriate in people with narrowing of their coronary arteries who have angina or have had a heart attack. This decision should be based on individual assessment. NICE is currently reviewing developments in newer types of stents and is due to publish and update on its earlier guidance in September 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.3/1">Passports are issued under the Royal prerogative at the discretion of the Secretary of State. Foreign passports sent to the United Kingdom Passport Service in support of passport applications are returned to the holder once all necessary checks have been completed. United Kingdom law allows British citizens to hold a second nationality. However, dual nationality is illegal in certain countries. In the majority of cases in these countries, British consular posts encourage dual nationals to return the passport of their second nationality to the appropriate authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.6/1">The Pension Service continues to develop its activity based information better to understand the cost of processing state pensions and other benefits. A modern resource management system is being rolled out across the department in 2006. This new system includes the costing functionality. Until this work is complete we cannot provide the cost of processing state pensions to acceptable levels of accuracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.118.3/1">The bases for the advice that wider conclusions could not be drawn from the study of nutritional supplements at HMYOI Aylesbury were that:</p>
	<p pid="b.118.3/2">The research took place in one prison; it is therefore not possible to demonstrate that findings from this study can be generalised to other environments.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.3/3">The study used adjudications in prison as the outcome measure; therefore it is not possible to demonstrate that the findings from this study can be generalised to other behaviours.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.3/4">The results, for a sample of 172 young adult prisoners, was a reduction in adjudications of 35 per cent. for those taking the active supplements. Statistically, however, this produces a wide range of possible reductions&mdash;from 16 per cent. to 54 per cent. A larger sample size would allow us to be more precise about the impact of the supplements.</p>
