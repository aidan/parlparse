	<p pid="a.397.2/1">The UK Border Agency (UKBA) complaints procedure (on the Agency's internet site at <a href="http://www">http://www</a>. ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/contact/makingacomplaint/) can be used to complain about the behaviour of a border force officer searching persons at UK international airports. The procedure applies whether the incident relates to a service the border force provided or was provided on the behalf of UKBA. It also applies where the matter relates to the conduct of border force staff or contractors working on the behalf of UKBA.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.2/2">The complaint may be made at the point of contact with a border force officer who will aim to resolve the complaint; this may include referring the matter to a senior officer if this is deemed appropriate. Alternatively the customer, regardless of nationality, may ask to speak to a senior officer in order to make their complaint or seek resolution. A customer may choose to make their complaint after the event; though a complaint must be made within three months of the incident to which it refers.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.2/3">The UK border force takes all complaints seriously. The receipt of all complaints is acknowledged in writing and the border force aims to provide a response to the customer within 20 days of receipt. If a customer does not think their complaint has been handled correctly they may ask for the handling to be reviewed. If the customer remains dissatisfied they can ask a UK MP to refer the matter to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. Additionally, customers in Scotland who remain dissatisfied can contact the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland. These escalation steps are &quot;signposted&quot; to customers in the letters they receive about their complaint. If the issue raised within the complaint is of a very serious nature the matter will be referred by UKBA to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for England &amp; Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.2/4">The UK border force wants to learn from complaints and improve its service to customers wherever possible. The border force considers the complaints not only within the business area that received it but also at the UKBA level so that lessons are learned and good practice shared. For example, the border force may consider making adjustments to the process that led to the complaint, giving their staff extra training or, in serious cases, taking disciplinary action.</p>

The Government recognise the risk to stability and the taxpayer presented by universal banks or systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) which have become too-systemic-to-fail. This can lead to excessive risk-taking and expose taxpayers to the cost of moral hazard. The G20 has charged the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop options for addressing the too-systemic-to-fail problem presented by SIFIs. The Government support the work of the FSB, which will report its conclusions in October 2010. In addition, the Government have asked the Independent Commission on Banking chaired by Sir Jon Vickers to consider options for reducing systemic risk in the banking sector and the complex issue of separating retail and investment banking as a potential mechanism.</p>

	<p pid="a.399.5/2">In business lending, LBG lent &#163;38 billion and RBS lent &#163;41 billion in gross lending facilities. For LBG, the active capital markets and high levels of repayments mean that their net lending to businesses was &#163;5.7 billion. For RBS, capital markets and revived high repayments of borrowing by businesses mean that net lending in particular was negative; RBS lending fell by &#163;6.2 billion across all business sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.5/3">The lending commitments are monitored by HM Treasury, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.429.5/1">The gazetting of the Elimination of Violence Against Women Law marked a major step forward for women's rights in Afghanistan. It has primacy over other laws and criminalises a range of violent acts against women for the first time in the country. These include the offences of &quot;baad&quot; (the exchange of women and girls as a form of dispute resolution), stalking, polygamy, and underage marriage. The challenge now is for the Afghan Government to implement the law and, alongside our international partners, we will offer technical help and expertise as required. The UK's wider efforts to help reform the criminal justice system and our support to non-governmental organisations working to address violence against women will also assist in the implementation of the law. We are supporting two of Afghanistan's first legal aid centres for female victims of violence where victims can access pro bono legal assistance and psychological support.</p>

It is not currently possible to assess the actual implications for industry of setting maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals.

	<p pid="a.449.5/1">European directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by the directive on traditional herbal medicinal products (directive 2004/24/EC), does not prevent acupuncturists, herbal practitioners and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners from continuing to practise after April 2011. However, the directive confirms that, following expiry of transitional protection in April 2011, manufactured herbal medicines placed on the market are required to have either a marketing authorisation or traditional herbal registration. This issue was explored in the Department of Health consultation on whether, and if so how, to regulate these practitioners. This consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-16">16 November 2009</phrase>, with 6,669 responses. The Government are now assessing the responses to that consultation before making a decision on the best way to take this matter forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.450.5/1">It is recommended in the <I>British Guideline on</I><I> the Management of Asthma</I> that all people with asthma have a regular review to ensure that their asthma is well controlled, that they know how to use their inhalers and have a personal asthma action plan which tells them what to do if their asthma worsens. The same national clinical guideline makes clear that proactive structured review is associated with a reduced exacerbation rate and days lost from normal activity. It is for general practitioners (GPs) to determine how they manage individual patients, in line with evidence-based clinical guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.450.5/2">The department encourages GPs to follow best-practice guidelines by creating financial incentives such as the quality and outcomes framework (QOF), which is part of the GP contract. Almost all GP practices report on the extent to which they are undertaking regular reviews of their patients since 2004 when reviews became an indicator in QOF. In 2008-09, 78.5 per cent of all patients received such a review at least once every 15 months for their asthma.</p>

	<p pid="a.452.3/2">We intend that consortia will be responsible for commissioning the great majority of National Health Service services.

	<p pid="a.452.3/3">We will expect consortia to involve relevant health and social care professionals from all sectors in helping design care pathways or care packages that achieve more integrated delivery of care, higher quality, and more efficient use of NHS resources. We will be working with the NHS and professional bodies in the transition to the new arrangements to promote multi-professional involvement.</p>

There is no reason to think that the effects of exposure to traffic-generated air pollutants on health in London would be qualitatively different from those in Birmingham. However, a wealth of advice is provided on the effects of air pollutants on health. The Department of Health takes advice on this subject from the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP). This committee's website provides access to detailed reports on the effects of air pollutants on health. Emphasis has been placed on the effects of long-term exposure to particles (traffic is a key source) on the development of cardiovascular disease: a detailed report is available on the COMEAP website. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is the lead department on air quality and provides advice via the Defra banding system for air quality. This system relates levels of pollution (indicated by a series of bands from 1 to 10) to effects on health. Such information is available on the Defra website. This advice applies to people living in areas affected by traffic congestion and to those living in less busy areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.0/1">Schools with a budget deficit that wish to convert to academy status may still do so, although if they have a significant deficit their application may be postponed until they have managed this down to a reasonable level. When a school with a deficit is approved to convert, the department will pay the local authority an amount equivalent to the deficit. The Young People's Learning Agency, the agency responsible for funding academies, will recoup the amount through a reduction in the recurrent funding paid to the academy. Detailed guidance will be provided on the procedure to be followed by the local authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.3/1">Academy trusts, like maintained schools, are not required to make off-site provision for permanently excluded pupils. From the sixth school day of a permanent exclusion, the local authority is statutorily responsible for ensuring that suitable full-time education is provided to pupils of compulsory school age regardless of whether they are excluded from an academy or maintained school.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.3/2">Academy trusts are responsible, however, for providing education during a fixed period exclusion. Where a pupil is given a fixed period exclusion of a duration of six school days or longer, the academy has a duty to arrange suitable full-time educational provision from and including the sixth school day of the exclusion. This does not apply to pupils of non-compulsory school age.</p>

Some schools believed that accidents to pupils during organised sports lessons did not have to be reported under RIDDOR.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.8/2">In 2005, the Health and Safety Executive published an education information sheet, <I>Incident-r</I><I>eporting in Schools (</I><I>Accidents, D</I><I>iseases and </I><I>Dangerous O</I><I>ccurrences)</I>, which can be found at <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/edis1.pdf">http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/edis1.pdf</a>.

	<p pid="a.475.6/1">The Bank of England's Annual Report for 2009 reported that counterfeits accounted for just 0.0046 per cent of the 12 billion banknotes sorted in high-speed note sorting machines by members of the note circulation scheme. About 85 per cent of counterfeit notes are taken out of circulation by this method. For the calendar year 2009 there were 566,000 counterfeit banknotes removed from circulation, with a face value of &#163;11.1 million: this marked a 20 per cent fall on 2008. Ninety-five per cent of these were &#163;20 notes.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.6/2">For coins, the most recent survey conducted by the Royal Mint found that its sample contained a &#163;1 coin counterfeit rate of 2.81 per cent. This would give an approximate total value of &#163;41 million for counterfeit &#163;1 coins in circulation. The Royal Mint does not currently undertake regular surveys for other denominations. It is widely believed (by the Royal Mint, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and industry partners) that there is not a significant counterfeit issue with any other denominations.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.6/3">There are a number of elements to the prevention of counterfeit notes and coins. Issuing authorities are responsible for designing banknotes and coins with appropriate security features, educating the public and retailers about the security features, and working with the cash supply industry to ensure that there are robust systems for the removal of counterfeits from circulation. Local police authorities and the National Central Office for the Suppression of Counterfeit Currency within the Serious Organised Crime Agency are responsible for finding and stopping the criminals involved in the production, distribution and passing of counterfeit notes and coins.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.6/4">Counterfeit banknotes and coins are worthless, with the face-value loss being borne by the individual or company deemed to be in possession of the counterfeit at the time of discovery. Issuing authorities do not replace counterfeit notes and coins with genuine notes and therefore do not suffer any face-value loss or replacement costs for their discovery.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.2/1">The Government have set out their proposed approach in <I>Policing in the 21st Century: Reconnecting police and the people</I>. We will replace bureaucratic accountability with democratic accountability. Police officers should be crime fighters, not form writers, so we will take action to allow the police to concentrate on dealing with the public's priorities rather than those set by those in Whitehall. The introduction of police and crime commissioners will make the police accountable to the right people-local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/2">Our specific measures include:</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/3">reforming the performance management framework for policing by dismantling the key performance indicators that burden police forces; supporting police officers in using their discretion in how crimes and incidents are dealt with by amending health and safety practices that prevent police officers from intervening and protecting the public and returning charging decisions to officers for more minor offences from November 2010; andscrapping the stop and account form in its entirety and reducing the burden of the stop and search procedures. We will also be looking at how we can maximise the use of technology to further reduce the paperwork in policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/4">Finally, we will ask the service to examine its own processes and doctrine, which can lead to unnecessary bureaucracy. Police and crime commissioners will be ultimately responsible for getting the balance right between preserving the information needed to focus on the public's priorities and removing what is inefficient or unnecessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.501.8/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced in her Oral Statement to the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-27">Tuesday 27 July</phrase> that the Government have opted in to the European Investigation Order (EIO).</p>
	<p pid="a.501.8/2">The decision was taken to opt in to the EIO because it offers practical help for the British police and prosecutors by speeding up the time it takes for other member states to respond to our requests for assistance. The Government are determined to do everything they can to help police and prosecutors cut crime and deliver justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.8/3">As people have become more mobile, so too has crime, and that has serious consequences for our ability to bring criminals to justice. To deal with cross-border crime, countries enter into mutual legal assistance (MLA) agreements. These agreements provide a framework through which states can obtain evidence from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.8/4">MLA has therefore been an important tool in the fight against international crime and terrorism. It has been crucial in a number of high-profile cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.8/5">But MLA has not been without its faults. The process is fragmented and confusing for the police and prosecutors. And it is often too slow, taking in some cases many months to obtain vital evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.8/6">The EIO seeks to address these problems within the EU by simplifying the system with a standardised request form and providing formal deadlines for the recognition and execution of requests. The EIO will also impose obligations on the United Kingdom to meet formal deadlines for the recognition and execution of requests received from other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.8/7">The EIO is intended to replace many of the current instruments in this field in order to create a comprehensive instrument covering the vast majority of MLA between EU member states. Consequently, the EIO, once operational, would be the mechanism through which the UK made MLA requests to, and received MLA requests from, other participating member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.8/8">The Government believe that by opting in to the European Investigation Order at this stage there will be the opportunity to influence its precise content. In particular, the Government will seek to ensure that there is a proportionality test so police forces are not asked to do work in relation to trivial offences and also to ensure that appropriate legal safeguards are in place. I have already had discussions with my German counterpart about these issues and I am confident that we will shape the draft directive so that it helps fight crime and deliver justice, while protecting civil liberties and avoiding unduly burdening the police.</p>

	<p pid="a.505.3/1">It has become customary for each country hosting the Olympic Games to table a resolution in the UN General Assembly, in advance of the Games, which urges member states to observe the Olympic Truce for the duration of the competition. The UK has co-sponsored these resolutions in advance of recent Games. There are currently two years until the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games and, as the host country, we will therefore consider this custom in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.506.5/1">These are matters for Ofsted. The deputy for HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the noble Baroness and a copy of her response has been placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/2"><I>Letter from Lorraine Langham, Director, Corporate Services</I><I>,</I> Ofsted, to Baroness Williams of Crosby, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-09">9 August 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/3">Your recent parliamentary questions have been passed to Her Majesty's Chief Inspector for response. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector is currently on leave and I am deputising for her in her absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/4">The latest period for which published figures about maintained school section 5 inspection outcomes are available is the spring term of 2009-10. This answer, therefore, takes into account those primary and secondary schools (including academies and city technology colleges) which were open on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-21">21 April 2010</phrase> and had received an inspection on or before <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/5">Under the school inspection frameworks used between January 2000 and August 2005 (commonly known as section 10), the school's overall effectiveness judgement was made using a seven point scale: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;very good&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;satisfactory&quot;, &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;very poor&quot;. Since September 2005, the overall effectiveness judgement has been made under the current school inspection framework (commonly known as section 5) using a four point scale: &quot;outstanding&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;satisfactory&quot; and &quot;inadequate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/6">Given the differences in the measurement of overall effectiveness between the frameworks, it is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach between section 10 and section 5 inspection frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/7">As the question refers to those schools which were found to be &quot;outstanding&quot;, this answer only looks at those inspections that took place under section 5 (from September 2005). It does not include those schools currently &quot;outstanding&quot; under section 5, with consecutive inspections under the previous section 10 framework. Scheduling of inspections now places emphasis on inspecting those with previous overall effectiveness judgements of &quot;inadequate&quot; or &quot;satisfactory&quot; to a greater degree, so there is a deliberate bias in the way we schedule inspection. Therefore the number of inspections scheduled under section 5 and found to be consecutively &quot;outstanding&quot; on three occasions or more are likely to be negligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/8">Information on which schools were open on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-21">21 April 2010</phrase> has been taken from the Department for Education's Edubase system. Information regarding section 5 inspections was taken from archived information on Ofsted's systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/9">Of the 1,611 secondary schools inspected more than once under section 5, there were 110 secondary schools rated &quot;outstanding&quot; where their previous section 5 inspection was also rated &quot;outstanding&quot;. Of the 7,545 primary schools inspected more than once under section 5, there were 359 primary schools rated &quot;outstanding&quot; where their previous section 5 inspection was also rated &quot;outstanding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/10">Of the 370 secondary and primary schools that have been inspected three times under section 5, none have had three consecutive &quot;outstanding&quot; judgements.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.5/11">Tables 1 and 2 below contain the information requested.</p>

	<p pid="a.521.2/1">There has been ongoing work since 2006 to relocate some of the existing force elements from Germany to the UK under the BORONA programme. BORONA is responsible for the moves of three major formations: HQ ARRC which completed its move to Gloucester in August 2010; 1 Signal Brigade (7 &amp; 16 Regiments), which is planned to move to Stafford in 2015; and 102 Logistic Brigade which is planned to move to Cosford in 2018. Completion of the moves will result in 3,600 military personnel and their families relocating to the UK, leading to the closure of Rhine Garrison by 2016 and Muster Station by 2019. These moves are dependent on endorsement by the department's Investment Approvals Board which considers all significant financial investment proposals to ensure value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.2/2">Post-BORONA, some 15,000 military personnel will continue to be based in Germany in the three remaining Garrisons of Gutersloh, Hohne and Paderbom.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.2/3">The relocation of these remaining troops from Germany is being considered as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), which is considering a variety of issues, including personnel. The SDSR is running in parallel with the spending review and together they will ensure decisions are resourced. This work is not yet complete and no mature cost estimates therefore exist.</p>

The EU report focuses on EU activity to promote human rights internationally. The FCO report focuses on situations of particular interest or concern to the UK and on issues where we believe we can take action and make a difference.

	<p pid="a.543.2/2">The DWP policy is that all calls should be free to our 0800 numbers to claim for benefits and emergency payments.

	<p pid="a.547.5/1">The department announced the launch of a nationally consistent, voluntary resignation scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-02">2 September 2010</phrase>. The scheme is called mutually agreed resignation (MAR). A MAR scheme is not a redundancy or a voluntary redundancy scheme. It is an additional option, designed to let people who are not at risk of redundancy apply to leave in return for a severance payment. This will help provide strategic health authorities and primary care trusts with an additional way of maintaining a stable and flexible workforce, given the requirement for them to significantly reduce management costs. It is ultimately for organisations to decide locally whether to implement the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.5/2">The payment rate is set at half a month's pay for each year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 12 months' pay. The maximum amount payable under the scheme is half that of National Health Service redundancy terms. The scheme contains a minimum payment of three months' pay for staff with one to six years' service. Entitlement is, therefore, dependent on length of service and salary and can be offered to all groups of staff in participating NHS organisations depending on the local criteria employed for selection.</p>

These redundancy terms are also applicable to employed doctors. Chief executives, executive directors and executive level staff employed by strategic health authorities and primary care trusts fall within the Very Senior Managers (VSM) pay framework. Redundancy terms of managers on the VSM pay framework will depend on their contract of employment.

	<p pid="a.554.2/1">We are concerned about significant corruption in Southern Sudan and the impact this has on the lives of many poor South Sudanese. We have repeatedly made clear to the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) the importance of tackling corruption and promoting good governance, and the importance of implementing the 2009 Juba compact between donors and GoSS, which contains key provisions to protect against corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.554.2/2">GoSS launched its five-year anti-corruption strategy in December 2009. The Southern Sudan Anti-Corruption Commission is tasked to implement this strategy. The Joint Donor Office in Juba, of which the UK is a member, has supported capacity building events for the Anti-Corruption Commission. The UN Development Programme, which the UK also supports, is currently developing a proposal to support the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.554.2/3">Some initiatives have been undertaken by the commission. The introduction of asset, income and liabilities declaration forms for all constitutional post holders earlier this year is a step forward. Another key issue will be to ensure that prosecutions can be pursued without political interference. The commission does not currently have a mandate to prosecute cases and can only investigate allegations and pass them to a prosecutor. There are still significant steps to take in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.554.2/4">We will continue to urge further progress and that activity undertaken by the commission is made public for scrutiny purposes.</p>

HM Government continue to support work to develop the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, and in addition are supporting the National Skills Academy for Nuclear in its work to co-ordinate skills and training provision across the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.6/3">HMG are also working closely with prospective new nuclear developers to assist them in their supply chain development activity. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-13">13 September 2010</phrase> the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Minister of State for Energy spoke at a nuclear suppliers event held by EDF Energy which was attended by around 600 delegates, many of whom were representing UK companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.561.6/4">HMG have supported the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) since it was established in July 2008. HMG have encouraged the NNL to build its operations, resulting in access to the NNL's facilities for six universities being expanded, and its staff increasing by 52 including 19 graduates in science, engineering and maths. Currently HMG are supporting the NNL in its planned additional &#163;42 million investment to bring phase 2 of its central laboratory into active use and to improve the operation of its unique shielded facilities in B13 at Sellafield. The NNL, working with universities and UK industry, will provide the technology foundation for the UK to meet, safely and economically, its domestic needs and to compete internationally.</p>
