	<p pid="b.118.0/1">Complaints about solicitors are a matter for the Law Society rather than Government, since the legal profession is independent. However the Government believe that it is important that miners who complain to the Law Society about their claims under the coal health compensation scheme get the level of service and compensation that they deserve. The Government therefore seek regular updates from the Law Society to ensure that progress is being made in continually improving the service, and are awaiting a detailed response from the Law Society to the Legal Services Complaints Commission Special Report.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/2">The Government take a close interest in this issue. Bridget Prentice and Malcolm Wicks sent a joint letter to all the solicitors involved in the scheme to remind them again of their obligations to pay back money to claimants where this was taken without their consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/3">The Government plan to provide details of claimants under the Coal Health Compensation Scheme to enable the Law Society to further raise awareness among retired miners following the success of the Rother Valley pilot. This will be on a phased basis over the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/4">Last summer's Rother Valley pilot was a joint initiative between the LCS, Rother Valley MP Kevin Barron, and the DBERR. Former miners in the Rother Valley constituency received written invitations to information sessions in the constituency that were hosted by Mr Barron and attended by LCS caseworkers. This resulted in over 330 new complaints to the Legal Complaints Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/5">The Government have legislated in the Legal Services Act 2007 to create an independent Office for Legal Complaints, which will remove complaints handling from the legal professional bodies. It will also enable approved regulators to deal more effectively with cases of widespread wrongdoing in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.120.2/1">Section 4(1)(c) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 prohibits the mixing of human and animal gametes without a licence. Under paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) can, under a treatment licence, permit the mixing of human sperm with animal eggs. Such a licence must specify that the activity is permitted.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.5/2">A number of categories of licence application are automatically referred to the Animal Procedures Committee for advice. These include applications of any kind raising contentious issues, or giving rise to serious societal concerns (for example involving the creation of embryos through tetraploid complementation using human material).</p>
	<p pid="b.121.5/3">Advice is sought from independent assessors in cases involving highly specialised science, and where there are significant animal welfare concerns or concern as to the likelihood of success or about the approach being taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.5/4">Section 5 of ASPA allows the Secretary of State discretion when reaching licensing decisions. It is not sufficient that an application satisfies the requirements of the Act for it to be granted. Using this discretion, the Secretary of State can adopt policies that certain categories of work will not be licensed. There are several examples of this such as the use of great apes and the testing of alcohol and tobacco products.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.0/1">We are not aware of any risk to overall health associated with the use of fluoridated water to reconstitute infant formula milk. Should they wish, parents can obtain data on the fluoride content of their local water supply from their local water service providers. A list of these and contact numbers can be found on the National Fluoride Information Centre (NFIC) website at <a href="http://www.fluorideinformation.com/default1.aspx">www.fluorideinformation.com/default1.aspx</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.0/2">If parents living in fluoridated areas are concerned about reconstituting infant formula milk with optimally fluoridated water they could use bottled water with low fluoride content for making up the milk. Alternatively, ready-made milk formula is available from all supermarkets.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.0/3">We have established the National Fluoride Information Centre at the University of Manchester to provide independent and unbiased objective information on all aspects of fluoride and fluoridation, which it makes available through its website.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.0/4">Evidence to date shows that dental fluorosis remains the only effect which the fluoridation of water has besides protecting against tooth decay. We are supporting the research into the assessment of fluorosis using intra-oral cameras. If, as we expect it shows that the measurement of dental fluorosis can be standardised, we will undertake a further study of its prevalence and aesthetic impact. We would review the one part per million concentration used in fluoridation schemes if the study showed there was a significant level of aesthetically unacceptable fluorosis.</p>

In this light and taking account of our view that fluoride in urine is mostly determined by recent fluoride intake and is not therefore a good index of long-term intake, we concluded that the results of the analysis did not merit publication.

	<p pid="b.127.3/1">We share the concerns of the international community over the conduct of the presidential election. Concerns were highlighted in independent election observer mission reports, including those from the Commonwealth, the East African Community, domestic observers, as well as in the initial findings of the European Union's mission.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.3/2">The Government recognise states, not Governments. Given that none of the independent international observers to the elections believes the tallying met international standards it is difficult to have any confidence in the announced result. Against that background, we are supporting the mediation efforts of Kofi Annan and his African colleagues to ensure an agreement between the two sides in Kenya on a Government that will enjoy Kenyan and international confidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.136.0/1">At the end of November 2007 in prison establishments in England and Wales there were (a) 1,805 sentenced 15-17 year-olds of which 4 per cent were serving sentences for drug offences; and (b) 546 15-17 year-olds being held on remand, of which 8 per cent were for drug offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/2">At the end of December 2007, there were 220 young people in secure children's homes, of whom none were in for drug-related offences. There were 246 young people in secure training centres, of whom two were in custody for drug-related offences, making the proportion in custody 0.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/3">These numbers relate to specific drugs offences only (including the possession and supply of drugs) and not to other offences (such as those involving acquisitive crime) which may be related to drugs issues of the offender.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/4">These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems, which, as with any large-scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.</p>

	<p pid="b.136.3/1">Information about access to services is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.3/2">In the study Mental Health Needs and Effectiveness of Provision for Young Offenders in Custody and in the Community (Professor Richard Harrington and Professor Sue Bailey, Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, 2005), 31 per cent of young people were identified as having a mental health problem. A copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.3/3">Mental health services for prisoners, including young people, have been a key part of the Government's recent reforms of prison health services and the Department of Health is now investing nearly &pound;20 million a year in NHS mental health in-reach services for prisoners. In 2007-08, an extra &pound;4 million has been invested in the further development of mental health services within local HM Prison Service establishments, of which &pound;1.5 million is to support the implementation of tier 3 child and adolescent mental health services within the HMPS young people estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.3/4">These are 102 community mental health teams working within prisons, with some 360 extra staff employed. Every prison in England and Wales has access to these services.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.3/5">All young people are assessed at the point of reception into custody and those who are at risk of having a mental health problem, or vulnerable to suicide, are referred for a mental health assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.3/6">In 2001, the Department of Health published <I>Promoting Mental Health for children held in secure sittings: A Framework for Commissioning Services</I> to support primary care tests with custodial units in their area to plan, commission and deliver requirements as per the Children's National Service Framework.
