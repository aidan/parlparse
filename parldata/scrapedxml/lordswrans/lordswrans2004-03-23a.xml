They are controlled as class C drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. In 2003, Customs and Excise seized just over 300,000 steroid tablets. The Talk to Frank website highlights the risks of using steroids. The use and misuse of all drugs, including steroids, is covered under substance misuse programmes in schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.5/1">Specialist physical education (PE) teachers have a crucial role to play in the delivery of high quality PE and school sport for our young people. The Government's PE, school sport and club links strategy complements and runs alongside the school workforce reform agenda. The Department for Education and Skills has secured 300 additional initial teacher training places in PE for the three years from 2003&ndash;04. This, along with healthy levels of PE teacher recruitment and retention, will ensure that sufficient trained specialist PE teachers are available to help deliver the Government's commitment to increase access to high quality PE and school sport.</p>

The currently available source of information on pension schemes is the Pension Schemes Registry, which is administered by the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra).

	<p pid="a.92.3/1">I understand from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that a decision to apply to become a passport-issuing organisation is a commercial and operational matter for the organisation making the application. VAT registration was not specifically considered during the consultation exercise carried out regarding the proposal to extend passports to all horses, nor was it raised in any of the responses to that consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/2">In respect of VAT there are two issues: the supplier of the passports and the horse owner. For the supplier, Customs and Excise's Public Notice 700 paragraph 4.4 explains what is meant by a supply of goods for VAT purposes. Paragraph 4.5 of that notice explains what is meant by a supply of services. Issuing a horse passport is regarded as a supply of services for VAT purposes. Long-standing formal agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our zero rates as they currently stand but do not allow us to extend them or introduce new ones. Article 13 of the sixth VAT Directive lays down mandatory exemptions and does not permit exemption for this type of supply. We are therefore unable to introduce any new VAT relief either for the issuing of horse passports or for the materials used in their production.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/3">For horse owners these European agreements also mean that VAT incurred on purchases can only be reclaimed when it relates to taxable business activities. Private owners will therefore be unable to reclaim any VAT incurred in purchasing a horse passport.</p>
