	<p pid="a.77.1/2" qnum="HL2908">What is their response to the recent report of the Agency Co-ordinating Body for Afghan Relief which states that Afghanistan has not yet received $10 billion of promised aid, and that 40 per cent of the money that has been delivered has been spent on corporate profits and consultancy fees; and what representations they are making to allies to deliver promised aid, in a way which brings the greatest benefit to Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">The UK Government support many of the findings of the ACBAR/Oxfam report. The UK is on course to fully deliver on its aid pledges to Afghanistan, and urges other donors to do the same. The figures outlined in the ACBAR report are not totally correct; none the less the general points about failure to deliver pledges and poor aid effectiveness are well made. Improving aid effectiveness is a central part of the UK development effort in Afghanistan. Effective development assistance is essential to support military gains and weaken the insurgency and narcotics trade, especially in the south.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2">The UK actively lobbies other donors in Kabul to put more aid through the Government's budget and to have the international community engage in more local procurement. The UK will actively lobby for improved aid effectiveness at forthcoming donor co-ordination conferences.</p>

The deployed command will normally allocate force protection duties for a TLZ to the unit which has responsibility for the area in which the TLZ is located. This may be a unit from the RAF regiment, but could be a suitably trained Army or Royal Marine unit.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">The Overseas Territories Environment Programme (OTEP), jointly operated by the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), is dedicated to supporting environmental sustainability in the UK Overseas Territories (OTs). It provides small grants to assist the territories with the implementation of their environment charters and with environmental management more generally. The DfID component of OTEP has supported 36 projects in six less advantaged territories and 10 multi-territory projects. The programme has successfully supported ecotourism development, environmental education programmes, monitoring and management of protected areas and conservation programmes for endangered species. An independent review of this programme in 2006 praised its leadership in supporting sustainable development in the OTs, particularly in conserving their rich biodiversity. The programme as currently approved will continue to support environmental projects to 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">DfID is supporting the five UK territories in the Caribbean to develop and implement national climate change adaptation strategies and build capacity to assess and reduce vulnerability to climate change. This programme will continue to 2010.</p>

The Bill prohibits the implantation of human admixed embryos into a woman or an animal. Successful hybridisation is dependent on the extent of chromosomal rearrangement. In very closely related species, differences in the number of chromosomes does not always prevent successful hybridisation.</p>

The results of the independent links evaluation will help determine how best to use this money&mdash;and the draft report has recently been shared with DH and DfID.

	<p pid="a.84.3/1">Section 233 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 amends Section 242 (public involvement and consultation) of the National Health Service Act 2006. Section 233 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 is not yet in force. The current duty to &quot;involve and consult&quot; arises under the existing Section 242 of the NHS Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2">Section 242 of the National Health Service Act 2006 requires certain NHS bodies, including primary care trusts (PCTs), to make arrangements to secure, whether directly or through representatives, users' involvement in and consultation on:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/3">the planning and provision of services;development and consideration of proposals for change in the way those services are provided; anddecisions made by that body which affect the operation of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/4">Decisions about allowing general practitioners to dispense medicines may give rise to a change in the provision of services and may involve development and consideration of proposals for change by the PCT in the way those services are provided. That would give rise to the duty to involve and consult under Section 242. Where there is no material change to the way in which services are provided, the Section 242 duty would not be triggered.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/5">The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 amendments to Section 242 do not change the way in which it applies to decisions about allowing doctors to dispense medicines&mdash;these may still fall within the meaning of Section 242. The amendment supports the view that the duty to involve and consult under Section 242 should only be triggered where there is a material change to the way in which services are provided, by clarifying that it applies where changes have an &quot;impact on the manner in which services are delivered or the range of services provided&quot;. This would mean that, where changes are made to lists of dispensing doctors, involvement or consultation would be required where those changes do impact on the manner in which pharmaceutical services are delivered or the range of services provided. However, this would not cover, for example, a change of personnel only.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.2/1">The World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and other humanitarian agencies are able to deliver essential food aid into Gaza through the crossings from Israel. An airlift into Gaza, which does not have a functioning airport, is not an option. Our focus should be on increasing the humanitarian and commercial items imported into Gaza and working towards the reopening of the crossings on a permanent basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">The UK continues to fund humanitarian assistance through UNRWA, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the European Commission's PEGASE mechanism. Despite ongoing constraints to their operations due to the violence, the access restrictions and the recent fuel crisis, humanitarian agencies continue to meet emergency needs on the ground. Together UNRWA and WFP provide food aid to over 1 million people in Gaza.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.0/2">The Palestinian Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) reports that up to 60 million litres of raw and partially treated sewage is discharged into the Mediterranean every day and that 90 per cent of mains water is polluted. The World Health Organisation reports that sea water in several areas of the Gaza coastline is polluted. CMWU works closely with the United Nations Children's Fund to address the sewage situation and minimise risks to public health. Some drugs and essential medical items are in short supply in Gaza and up to 76 per cent of the population is partly dependent on food aid, most of which is provided by the UN.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">The Government committed in last year's rail White Paper, <I>Delivering a Sustainable Railway,</I> to keep the case for electrification under review. Since then, the Secretary of State for Transport has invited Network Rail to lead work on the development of our understanding of the complex options that may be needed in the future, in the context of the Department for Transport's wider strategic planning process. The department also continues to work closely with the rail industry to explore how to improve the affordability of electrification schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">The Government's immediate priority is to tackle congestion, and &pound;10 billion has been committed for this purpose in the period to 2014. Should the case for further electrification be proven, it is likely to feature as part of the Government's specification for the next control period, between 2014 and 2019.</p>
