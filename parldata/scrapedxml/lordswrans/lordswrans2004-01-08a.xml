	<p pid="a.53.5/1">The current Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 have evolved from a requirement to protect persons holding the unique position of police officers. They are not employees, but are office holders and are exempt from most employment law, including being able to form unions, and to go on strike. Much of the system is therefore designed to protect officers from unfair dismissal. Officers require protection due to their particular status as they do not have access to employment tribunals (except in very limited circumstances) and are not covered by most employment law. Officers may also be subject to malicious and unsubstantiated allegations that require a thorough investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/2">Racially discriminatory behaviour is a serious breach of the code of conduct governing a police officer's behaviour and, as with any other alleged breach of the code, any disciplinary action follows the procedures set out in those regulations.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-01-08a.54.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="54"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040108/text/40108w01.htm#40108w01_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.54.6/1">The Education Act 1996 places duties on local education authorities (LEAs) and all LEA-maintained schools to identify, assess and make suitable provision to meet children's special educational needs (SEN), including the SEN of those with autism and dyslexia. In doing do, maintained schools and LEAs must have regard to the SEN code of practice, which gives practical guidance on identifying and meeting children's SEN, including difficulties in communication and interaction and cognition and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.6/2">Provision for children with SEN has greatly improved over the years. Ofsted and the Audit Commission have reported that LEAs have &quot;improved their SEN work significantly&quot; in recent years (Local education authorities and school improvement 1996&ndash;2001. Ofsted 2002.) However, two reports from the Audit Commission in 2002 have pointed to continuing challenges in relation to the inequitable distribution of resources to meet children's SEN, the uneven quality of SEN provision across the country, the bureaucracy involved and the need for earlier intervention, among other concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.6/3">The Government's forthcoming SEN strategy will address these issues, building on the improvements to the SEN framework brought about by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 and the revised SEN code of practice (2001). The strategy's implementation will be helped by the new requirements on schools and LEAs to collect data by types of need, including autistic spectrum disorder and specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia. These data will assist schools and LEAs in identifying children with autism and planning provision to meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.6/4">Education providers, in the statutory, voluntary and independent sectors, have responded to the increasing numbers of children being identified with autism, in part by opening specialist provision&mdash;the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Autism, for instance, noted that several LEAs had set up autism-specific units attached to moderate learning difficulty schools (The Rising Challenge. APPGA. 2001). The new SEN strategy will help all schools to meet these children's needs by promoting effective approaches to teaching and learning for children with autism as well as other types of need, such as dyslexia. It will seek to develop the role of special schools so that they work more closely with mainstream schools and specialist services to provide for children with SEN. For those with autism, action under the strategy will be consistent with the good practice guidance the Departments of Education and Skills and Health published in 2002 and the autism exemplar under the forthcoming National Service Framework for Children. The department continues to work closely with the National Autistic Society and other relevant groups to improve provision for children with autism.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.6/5">A range of guidance materials for teachers on dyslexia and dyscalculia has been produced as part of the national literacy and numeracy strategies to help to promote inclusion of pupils with specific learning difficulties. The guidance has been well received and other material is currently in preparation. The department continues to work closely with the British Dyslexia Association and the Dyslexia Institute to help to raise awareness and develop new resources that will be of practical assistance to teachers and other staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.0/1">The Government want physical education (PE) and school sport to be fun and attractive to all children. All children should spend at least two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport, within and beyond the curriculum. An ambitious but realistic public service agreement target&mdash;shared with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport&mdash;has been set to increase the percentage of 5 to 16 year-olds who do this to 75 per cent by 2006. The Departments for Education and Skills and for Culture, Media and Sport are working in partnership to implement a national PE, school sport and club links strategy to help to deliver the target. Over &pound;1 billion is being invested by the Government to transform PE and school sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/2">The table below sets out the Department for Education and Skills' PE and school sport budget between 1996&ndash;97 and 2002&ndash;03 and the projected budget between 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">The provision of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and storage of gametes (eggs and sperm) and embryos in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). No clinic can provide such services without a licence from the HFEA. Before any new treatment technique is permitted, the HFEA looks at evidence either from animal studies or clinical data from the technique where used in other countries. The HFEA would not issue a licence for a new treatment unless it was fully satisfied about the safety and efficacy of the treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.2/1">Cattle may be imported into Great Britain from other regions of the European Union in accordance with harmonised EU rules for testing and certification. Animals coming from brucellosis-infected regions are tested for the disease before export to GB using blood tests precribed under the EU legislation. However it is known that the development of a serological response to brucella abortus can occasionally be delayed, particularly in heifers infected prior to their first calving. For this reason additional post import checks including a post calving test, are carried out on imported cattle as part of our national brucellosis surveillance programme. As an additional safeguard against the disease, farmers and importers are also required to notify all premature calvings and abortions in order for brucella investigations to be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/2">We consider that the current combination of EU rules and national rules to prevent the spread of brucellosis within the EU is sufficient to identify and control outbreaks of the disease but we are not complacent and are keeping the situation under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/3">Defra is also supporting a brucellosis research programme which includes research into the development of a more sensitive test to identify the presence of so-called &quot;latent infection&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/1">In response to the increasing number of findings of Phytophthora ramorum, the Forestry Commission has redirected about 23 staff onto a woodland survey in England and Wales, to be completed by April 2004, which will help us to assess whether Phytophthora ramorum is present in the wider environment. Resource has also been redirected within the Forest Research Agency into projects that are designed to help us better understand the disease and the effect it might have.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/2">Defra's 75 Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors (PHSI) are already employed for around 20 per cent of their time on inspection and surveillance duties related to this disease. The plant health service will require just over 20 additional staff to cover the increased rate of inspections at production nurseries, wild planting areas and ports of entry, which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase>. This is currently estimated to cost over &pound;650,000 to the end of 2004&ndash;05. It is proposed that, wherever possible, suitably qualified field staff are transferred from elsewhere in the department. These will be supplemented by recruitment of a small number of staff with appropriate experience and qualifications (for example ex-PHSI staff). Transfer and recruitment will start in January.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/3">Defra is also funding a substantial increase in sample diagnoses undertaken by the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) which is estimated to cost in excess of &pound;750,000 to the end of 2004&ndash;05.
