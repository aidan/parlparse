The section sets out the circumstances in which a refugee has a defence (based on Article 31 of the convention) to a charge for certain specified offences.

	<p pid="b.19.8/1">The carbon abatement technologies (CAT) strategy for fossil fuel power generation, which we plan to publish in the next few weeks, aims to encourage the development of carbon reduction technologies. The strategy does not identify specific technologies for reducing carbon emissions as industry is best placed to select these to meet environmental requirements and the needs of the market. Pressurised fluidised bed combustion (PFBC) is seen as a high efficiency power generation technology that offers significant environmental benefits and the capability to burn a wide range of fuels including coal/waste and coal/biomass mixtures. PFBC is therefore considered to be a feasible technology among other technologies for contributing to the objectives of the CAT strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.21.0/1">Sophisticated and expensive techniques are required to protect apparatus against the intensity of a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) created by a nuclear explosion. Such techniques are only required for apparatus that has to function during and after an NEMP. The techniques are not relevant for apparatus intended to be used in residential, commercial and industrial environments. Accordingly, requirements for apparatus to be immune to a NEMP are excluded from the Electromagnetic Regulations 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.21.3/1">Through the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) the Department of Health is delivering systems to revolutionise the way the National Health Service delivers care, and the experience of patients. NPfIT is being implemented by national application service providers, responsible for purchasing and integrating IT systems common to all users nationally; and by local service providers, responsible for supplying and integrating services and systems, such as patient administration systems, to perform functions in the local setting and to interface with the national system.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/2">While much has already been put in place, we are now seeing considerable acceleration in the scale of deployment of technology across the service. During 2005 increasing numbers of patients will be able to book their hospital appointments electronically. The first electronic prescriptions were issued in February 2005, with numbers set to rise significantly over the coming months. More than 6,000 NHS sites have been connected to the new national network (N3), giving fast and reliable broadband access to over 300,000 users. The first NPfIT-delivered picture archiving and communications systems went live earlier this year, and over 120,000 users are now registered with &quot;contact&quot;, the secure e-mail and directory service for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/3">The national programme has also delivered the quality management and analysis system (QMAS), which supports the quality and outcomes framework (QOF) of the new general medical services contract for general practitioners. One hundred per cent of GP practices are now using the QMAS system, which provides GP practices with evidence and feedback on the quality of care they deliver. In addition, the delivery of new software to support payment by results is on schedule to be implemented in June 2005. The secondary uses service that will hold anonymised and pseudonymised patient information for research, trend analysis and public health monitoring will be started by the payment by results software, but will be added to in October 2005. All this represents very encouraging progress towards the target of completion of full integration of health and social care systems in England by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/4">There have been some delays to deployments, but these are not significant in the context of a 10-year programme and the delays are more than displaced by the additional projects such as QMAS, QOF, &quot;Contact&quot; and N3 which have been delivered. We have always said that NPfIT deployment plans are subject to regular update and revision, and will always need to take account of the NHS's readiness to receive new systems. While the task is not without challenges, these are being overcome through increasing NHS managerial and clinical involvement backed up by active performance management.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.5/2">However, the Government are concerned about National Health Service patients affected by adverse events, including instances in the NHS where the wrong limb has been amputated instead of the limb intended.

This system is now in place across the NHS. The reporting and learning system will, in time, enable us to understand the nature and extent of adverse incidents, including instances in the NHS where the wrong limb has been amputated instead of the limb intended, and take further action to prevent them being repeated where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-02">2 March 2005</phrase>, the NPSA and the Royal College of Surgeons of England jointly launched new advice to the NHS to help make surgery safer in the form of a patient safety alert.
