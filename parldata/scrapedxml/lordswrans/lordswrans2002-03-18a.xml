It is HMG policy to encourage all governments to co-operate with UN mechanisms.

The UK, with EU partners, has also submitted a number of cases to the Algerian authorities. The Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has offered information on some of these cases, but both we and our EU partners will continue to press for full answers.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">As part of the Government's commitment to place human rights at the heart of foreign policy, the UK has frequent dialogue on human rights issues with a large number of other countries. We regularly share the information from these exchanges with EU partners and non-governmental organisations, and we draw on reports from these sources and from the Special Procedures when preparing our dialogues. If requested, we also share information with UN Special Procedures. However, in the interests of observing their independence, the UK does not contribute unsolicited briefing on any country or subject. It is not possible to compile a list of requests made by the Special Procedures for invitations to visit particular territories since not all requests are made public and the status of requests is not always clear; nor does the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) keep a list of requests. The UK has made a public commitment to accept any request for a visit by the Special Procedures, and we encourage all states to cooperate with UN mechanisms.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.8/1">The film highlighted the extent to which imprisonment places strains on family relationships. That is why the Prison Service provides special facilities for family visiting. These include financial support for travel costs to enable low-income families to visit prisoners, play areas in some visiting halls and family days in prisons. Many prisons provide visitors' centres outside the prison which, in particular, cater for the needs of families. The Social Exclusion Unit has recently conducted research on reducing reoffending by ex-prisoners. During its work, the unit has looked at the role of families in the rehabilitation of prisoners. It is in the process of finalising the report and this will provide the direction for future policies and strategies to help alleviate the effects on the family. A copy of the report will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.0/1">As my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton said, the answer to this question is largely a matter for speculation. We know that Britain is perceived as a stable and attractive place in which to live. This view arises partly because of our buoyant and successful economy, and the employment opportunities it has brought, but also because of the universality of the English language and global communication that mean that millions of people hear about the United Kingdom and aspire to come here.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/2">However the perception that we receive a disproportionate number of illegal immigrants is not entirely accurate. The United Kingdom ranks 10th out of 16 European countries in 2001 for applications as a percentage of population. None the less we are also doing all we can at a European level to create a level playing field. In many ways the laws governing the treatment of asylum seekers in France and other European Union countries are not dissimilar to those currently in force in the United Kingdom. However, some real and perceived differences do exist, which may in some cases influence where an asylum seeker chooses to lodge a claim. This is one of the reasons why France and the United Kingdom, along with other European Union countries, are in the process of agreeing a range of measures governing the treatment of asylum seekers in order to achieve a higher degree of harmonisation across the European Union. These measures will include procedures setting out how an asylum seeker is treated on arrival in a European country, a uniform criteria on who exactly qualifies for refugee status and what rights and benefits they are entitled to during and after consideration of their asylum application. Such harmonisation is expected to greatly reduce unwarranted movements of asylum seekers between European countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/3">As well as working with our European partners we are also determined to clamp down on the abuse of the current system while continuing to meet our international obligations. The White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain sets out the key challenges in nationality, immigration and asylum policy and the measures we have taken and are taking to produce a coherent strategy. We are determined to reform the asylum system based on the principle that we should have a humanitarian process which honours our obligations to those fleeing persecution while deterring those who have no right to asylum from travelling here. claire</p>

	<p pid="a.125.0/1">Our records indicate that to date, ash has been removed from 160 pyre sites in England and Wales. In many cases, ash has been removed from the surface of sites. At some locations, the removal operation has involved removing the soil originally placed on top of the trenches to stabilise the sites, followed by the excavation of ash from the pyre trench itself. While this may appear to involve &quot;digging up&quot; the ash, we are not aware of any ash being dug up from sites where ash has been buried in accordance with DEFRA guidelines. A further 11 sites are currently either programmed for removal or are undergoing site specific risk assessments. Risk assessments have been undertaken at all sites where ash removal has taken place.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.0/1">Records of incinerator gas temperatures are not gathered centrally. However, there are some 180 authorised incinerators in the UK. Combustion gas temperatures will reach 850 degrees centigrade in nearly all of these, and the majority will be capable of achieving 1,000 degrees centigrade.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/2">Five plants are currently incinerating meat and bone meal (MBM), from rendered cattle carcasses from the Over Thirty Months Slaughter Scheme (OTMS). Four of these five plants recover energy from the incineration process and all maintain temperatures of over 850 degrees centigrade in line with SEAC recommendations. They have a combined contracted disposal capacity to incinerate 225,000 tonnes of MBM per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/3">There are no carcasses in long-term storage awaiting disposal. However, some 276,000 tonnes of MBM generated from the OTMS are currently held in secure storage pending destruction, compared with over 460,000 tonnes two years ago.</p>
