	<p pid="a.67.5/1">The requirement for fingerprints to be taken from the age of six comes from EU Regulation 380/2008. The requirement for this age group to give their fingerprints is applied across the whole of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/2">The UKBA has many years of experience of taking fingerprints from children aged five and upwards, effectively and without difficulty, and the benefits have been wide ranging from helping to abate child trafficking to being able to reduce the number of fraudulent claims made for public funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/3">As children grow, although the size of the area of the fingerprint will grow with age, the actual characteristics (and pattern) that make the fingerprint unique to the child and are used as a part of the identification process remain constant throughout life and do not change or alter with age. If superficial damage occurs the skin will grow back in exactly the same arrangement as at birth.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/4">No issues have been identified concerning the co-operation of children with the process of fingerprinting. Many of the children will have already have given their fingerprints and photographs on earlier occasions in connection with a visa application for the UK or other countries. When evaluating the pilot scheme for the identity cards for foreign nationals, children followed the same quick, easy and clean (ink-free) process that they saw their parents follow and there was no evidence to suggest that children were adversely affected by the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.5/1">The short-term decrease in global average temperature that occurred between 2001 and 2008 resulted from natural, internal processes in the climate system. These cause temperatures to fluctuate from year to year and from decade to decade. Temperatures were lower in 2007 and 2008 than in previous years, for example, due to a La Nina event in the Pacific Ocean, which caused cold water at depth to rise to the surface. Over short periods, this natural variability is larger than the changes expected due to global warming, so it can easily result in the temperature trend being constant or negative over a period of a decade or so, as has happened on occasion during the 20th century.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/2">The effect of greenhouse gases on the climate system is evident in the long-term temperature trend, which is upward (as demonstrated by the fact that the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred in the past 12 years). As long as greenhouse gas emissions continue, global average temperatures will continue to rise in the long-term, with potentially dramatic implications for food and water supplies, human health, national security and the global economy. For this reason, the slight decline in global average temperature since 2001 will not affect the UK Government's policy on climate change mitigation. Rather, this policy will continue to be based on the latest scientific evidence regarding the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the climate system.</p>

This will allow us to ensure implementation of aid effectiveness principles in fragile and conflict-affected countries.

	<p pid="a.84.6/1">The Government understand that Open Europe aggregated cost estimates of recommended options in impact assessments on new regulatory proposals, using a mid-point when a range was given. The report ignores the benefits of regulation which usually outweigh the costs. In cases where regulation exists to correct market failures to ensure open markets and competition, those who initially experience costs will often reap the benefits. Simply aggregating estimated costs can therefore be misleading.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.6/2">The Government recognise that the cost of regulation is a concern and so has changed the way it thinks about regulation. For example, the administrative burden reduction programme has delivered around &pound;1.9 billion in net annual savings for business since 2006. The programme is on track to deliver more than &pound;3 billion in net annual savings to businesses by 2010. Moreover, international studies, eg the World Bank's Doing Business Report, show that the UK has a highly competitive regulatory environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.6/3">The report does not break down costs by sector and, over the period analysed, government impact assessments do not systematically allocate costs between sectors.</p>
