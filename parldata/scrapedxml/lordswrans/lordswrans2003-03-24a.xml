	<p pid="a.47.8/1">The Attorney-General of the Cayman Islands, Mr David Ballantyne, decided to leave office on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase>, by mutual agreement with the Cayman Islands Government. Mr Ballantyne had come under criticism in the Cayman Islands following the collapse of the Eurobank money-laundering trial. He took the view that this made it impossible for him to carry out his role there effectively. Press allegations that Mr Ballantyne had prior nowledge of, or had approved, the destruction of evidence which led to the collapse of the Eurobank trial are inaccurate. He acted to ensure the disclosure of all relevant information to the defence in order to secure a fair trial and acted properly in bringing the trial to an end when he concluded that a fair trial could not be ensured. In doing so, he carried out the independent role the Cayman Islands constitution assigns to the Attorney-General. Her Majesty's Government are satisfied that Mr Ballantyne has throughout acted with professional integrity and in the best interests of the administration of justice in the Cayman Islands.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/2">Press reports suggesting that I agreed, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, to the dismissal from office of Mr Ballantyne are also incorrect. The independence and security of tenure of the Attorney-General is constitutionally protected in the Cayman Islands.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/2" qnum="HL2263">When the draft Corruption Bill will be published.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-03-24a.51.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="51"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030324/text/30324w02.htm#30324w02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.51.2/1">I am publishing today a draft Corruption Bill as a command paper (Cm 5777). The Bill will modernise the law and make it more effective, replacing the existing patchwork of overlapping offences&mdash;which date from 1889&mdash;with a single statute. The Bill's reforms give effect to a Law Commission report of 1998 and to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege to enable evidence of proceedings in Parliament to be led in corruption cases. They will also ensure that the UK is up to date in its international obligations and enable it to ratify the Council of Europe Civil Law Convention on Corruption. We recognise that corruption is an intricate and sensitive issue and the Bill will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny before being introduced to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">These reforms are part of the Government's overall anti-corruption strategy. This country is relatively free from corruption, but it remains an insidious threat, to which we need to be constantly alert. We have already made important changes to the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 extended UK jurisdiction to corruption offences committed abroad by UK nationals and incorporated bodies. Many UK companies have adjusted their policies in the light of this legal change, which is specifically identified in the National Policing Plan 2003&ndash;06 as an important issue for forces, though we hope the number of cases will be small.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/4">Part 3 of the same Act gave wide powers of disclosure to tax authorities and others to assist all criminal investigations and proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/5">The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 introduced new provisions to strengthen the framework, both for tackling money laundering and for assisting others to access the UK legal system to detect, freeze and recover funds and assets of illicit origin.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/6">The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 charged the Financial Services Authority (FSA) with reducing the extent to which financial institutions are used in connection with financial crime. The Act gave the FSA a range of powers, including the power to make rules on money laundering and the ability to prosecute firms for breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/7">The Police Reform Act 2002 set up a new system for handling complaints against the police, under the guardianship of a new body, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which will come into existence as a shadow body next month. Under the new system, which will start next year, police forces will be required to refer all serious cases of corruption involving police officers to the IPCC, whether or not a complaint has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/8">We will continue to ensure that the UK maintains high standards in its domestic law and practice on corruption. The Committee on Standards in Public Life, now chaired by Sir Nigel Wicks, provides independent oversight: its remit is to examine current concerns about standards of conduct of public office holders and to make recommendations &quot;to ensure the highest standards of propriety in public life&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/9">However, the international dimension is crucial in this inter-connected world, so the Cabinet Office has set up a committee to co-ordinate the work of the departments and agencies most involved. The following action has been taken:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/10">The UK has strongly supported GRECO (the Council of Europe's anti-corruption body), whose membership incudes all the 10 states which will join the EU next year. GRECO subjects its member states' anti-corruption systems to peer review and its reports have been made public.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/11">The Home Office, in partnership with the anti-corruption command of the Metropolitan Police, is leading a twinning project in Bulgaria. The project will implement an anti-corruption strategy, involving the development of an integrated system for countering corruption within the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/12">The UK has continued to participate actively in the peer review process set up by the OECD Bribery Working Group, which addresses the supply side of bribery&mdash;that is, bribes paid by businesses to foreign public officials. The UK also is playing a key role in ensuring that preventive measures against corruption are included in the draft UN Convention against Corruption, to address the demand side of bribery&mdash;that is, corrupt behaviour by foreign officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/13">The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has enhanced its procedures to prevent those engaging in corrupt practices from receiving support. Due-diligence checks are now made on lenders, guarantors and borrowers, as well as exporters and buyers, and information is sought from exporters on the contract award process to assist ECGD in identifying contracts which may potentially give rise to problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/14">ECGD has also given special consideration to its procedures relating to agents' commission. Ultimately, if ECGD is not satisfied with the arrangements for payment of the level of commission in any case, it may decline to provide any support for that case.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/15">The UK has supported work by the IMF and World Bank, in collaboration with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to tackle money laundering and the financing of terrorism, including adding the FATF recommendations to the list of areas assessed by the fund and bank and endorsing a 12-month pilot programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/16">FCO and DFID are jointly supporting the development of the East and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group, a regional body of the global FATF anti-money laundering system. In partnership with the EU, DFID is also supporting an anti-money laundering programme under the auspices of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/17">DFID supports programmes on public expenditure management and good governance throughout the developing world that help to put in place key preventive measures against corruption. DFID also supports anti-corruption commissions in Honduras, Malawi, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zambia and is developing support for the commission in Nigeria.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/18">In May 2002, DFID and the Home Office organised a seminar on mutual legal assistance for practitioners from 16 key African and Asian countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/19">The Department for International Development (DFID) worked closely with the National Audit Office on how its own internal planning and management systems address corruption risks. DFID will be working to strengthen its own internal systems and improve awareness of corruption risks in the management of its programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/20">The UK has led the development of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, announced by the Prime Minister at the Durban World Summit in September 2002, which seeks to encourage company and government transparency over payments and revenues arising from the exploitation of natural resources. The initiative aims to reduce the risk of misappropriation of these revenues and increase the likelihood of their contributing towards sustainable growth and poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/2">As part of its anti-fraud programme, the UK Passport Service is developing a database for passports reported lost, stolen or recovered.

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">The OGC Chief Executive's Advisory Group (CEAG) provides strategic advice on OGC activities from key departments, executive agencies and NDPBs. Each member organisation is represented by a member of staff best placed to carry out the role, typically their head of procurement. Therefore, while departmental representatives may have qualifications or experience of design, this is not a factor in their appointment to the group.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">The executive board provides strategic and operational direction to OGC. Its members are all OGC executive directors, with the exception of a non-executive director, with a background in human resources. There are no plans to appoint a designer as an additional member.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">OGC promotes the importance of excellent design in terms of functionality, build quality, efficiency and sustainability, respect for context and aesthetic quality in achieving whole-life value for money. For example, OGC collaborated closely with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) to produce and publish guidance in October 2002 Improving the Standards of Design in Public Buildings, which is available on the OGC website (<a href="http://www.ogc.gov.uk">www.ogc.gov.uk</a>). OGC is now engaged in a programme of work with CABE to support departments in their implementation of the recommendations.</p>

This covers around two-thirds of all occupational pension scheme members and potentially covers the remaining third if they change employment. Current estimates suggest that about 10 per cent of the pre-1989 group move out of this group each year. Therefore the number shown with pensions over &pound;70,000 may not be a good indicator for future levels of tax-approved pension income.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.0/13">* Note that as the expected value of the income stream to be paid out by the annuity provider depends on the life expectancy of joint lives; the annuity rate depends upon their age differential. If the joint lives are of the same age and the man purchases, the annuity rate is higher than if the woman bought the annuity. This is because he is not expected to live as long as a woman purchaser and therefore a full annuity income is expected to be paid out for a shorter period than if the woman had purchased. Annuity rates are rounded to one decimal place.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/14">However, the maximum tax-approved pension available to those who have joined their scheme since 1989, approximately two-thirds of all occupational scheme members, is two-thirds of the earnings cap, currently &pound;97,200. The maximum benefits under the 1989 tax regime for occupational pensions are also dependent on annuity rates. So, for example, a man retiring at a scheme's normal retirement age of 65, on a salary of at least &pound;97,200 and sufficient service to give a pension of two-thirds of capped final remuneration, could have a pension of no more than &pound;64,800 if no lump sum were taken. If the maximum lump sum of &pound;145,800 is taken, his actual pension income would then be reduced to &pound;58,239, assuming an annuity rate of 4.5 per cent is used to calculate the necessary reduction to the pension in respect of the lump sum.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.3/1">I wish to inform the House that we will not be able to publish the updated Indices of Deprivation on the original timescale of July this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/2">The Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID 2000) combine statistical indicators on economic, social and housing issues into a single score for each ward in England. This enables all wards to be ranked relative to one another according to their level of deprivation. The indices are used by government and other agencies to identify areas where there are concentrations of deprived people. They are, for example, used in the allocation of substantial resources aimed at renewing deprived neighbourhoods. For all these reasons it is therefore important for the indices to remain a robust way of identifying the most deprived areas. They were last revised in 2000; more recent and detailed data have now become available and last year we began consulting across and outside government for views on how best to strengthen and update the ID 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/3">The two-stage consultation period began in November 2002 and was due to be completed by the spring to allow publication in July 2003. We received over 200 responses to the recently concluded consultation on the stage one report, with many useful suggestions, including confirmation of the need for data on crime to form part of the revised indices.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/4">The timing has been affected by the lack of crime data to form this crime domain. The required data are unlikely to be available until later this year. Additional research is also needed on how to move away from using wards as the basic geography of the indices, to one based on geographic units that are more consistent over time and in terms of size. This will allow us to identify areas where very small pockets of deprivation exist and to track change over time. There is more work to do on other aspects such as take-up of means-tested benefits and affordability of housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/5">To investigate these issues in full will involve additional research and analysis so we have decided to delay the second stage of the consultation. We hope to complete this during the autumn with a view to publishing the revised Indices of Deprivation in the winter.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">Ministers can act only within the law. It follows that an extension of ministerial power will always require legislation (or, conceivably, a change in the common law). Legislation will also be necessary where what is proposed requires not only the exercise of powers but also, for example, the imposition of legal obligations, the creation of offences, or the raising of taxes.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">If, however, it is proposed that Ministers exercise powers that are already available at common law to private individuals, or to the Crown by virtue of the prerogative, there is no legal requirement for legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">The case for putting existing powers onto a statutory footing will therefore depend not on strict law but on the matters of convention, good governance and practicality discussed in the previous Answer. These include the considerations of propriety addressed by the Public Accounts Committee Concordat mentioned in that Answer. They include also the principles of legal certainty, accessibility and clarity, which the Government regard as important in their own right, quite apart from human rights considerations.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.0/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Malcolm Wicks) represented the UK at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (ESPHCA) Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-06">6 March 2003</phrase>, together with the Minister for Employment Relations and the Regions, my honourable friend the Member for Hull West and Hessle, Alan Johnson.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/2">The main business of this Council was a discussion on the proposed directive on working conditions for temporary workers and the preparation of the spring European Council, to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/3">On the former, following lunchtime discussion, the Presidency concluded that the dossier was not ready for agreement at this point. The UK declared its readiness to reach agreement on a directive, but one with considerably more flexibility than the current draft, and joined the consensus for aiming for political agreement in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/4">On the latter, the Council adopted without amendment the Joint Employment Report 2002 and its contribution to the spring Council, Key messages on the future of the Employment Strategy. In a public debate member states were in broad agreement on the priorities for the revised employment guidelines outlined in the paper: the guidelines should be fewer in number, focused on outputs rather than inputs and linked closely to the Lisbon employment rate targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/5">The debate also revealed broad support for the idea of an employment task force, as proposed by the UK, France and Germany. The Council agreed that the task force should be a one-off, independent analysis of the measures required to improve Europe's employment performance in the short term. The task force should complement the revised employment strategy, without creating any new processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/6">Council approved joint reports from the Commission and the Council on adequate and sustainable pensions and on the future of healthcare and care for the elderly. It noted the opinion of the Social Protection Committee on the Commission's synthesis report and agreed a key issues paper on social protection to be sent to the spring Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/7">The Commission reassured the Council that its forthcoming communication on streamlining of social protection would acknowledge that different methods and time-scales were appropriate for different areas of work. It would also respect subsidiarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/8">The Council noted the work programmes for 2003 of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/9">The Council adopted a decision establishing a tripartite social summit for growth and employment, noting the declaration from Denmark and the UK that the agreement was on the understanding that it did not set a precedent for the use of Article 202 as a treaty base for such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/10">The Council heard without comment presentations by the Commission on initiatives following the Commission action plan for skills and mobility: European health insurance card, legal basis of the European Employment Services (EURES) and free movement of workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/11">Following an orientation debate, the Council agreed on a joint Presidency and Commission proposal for the Council to send an annual report on gender mainstreaming to the spring Council. The Commission agreed with the UK that this would not involve the establishment of a new process.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/12">The Commission reported on progress under the European Year of People with Disabilities and outlined its forthcoming report on the social situation in Europe focusing on health.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/13">No consumer affairs items were on the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.0/14">No votes were taken at this Council.</p>

The Government are taking advantage of these provisions and have no plans to seek a further amendment to the directive.

	<p pid="a.65.0/1">The actual rates of levy payable to the Livestock and Meat Commission for Northern Ireland (LMC) were last revised in October 1988 when they rose from 45p to 80p per bovine (ie cattle) and from 4p to 8p per ovine (ie sheep). These amounts fell within the ceilings of &pound;1 per bovine and 10p per sheep detailed in the Livestock Marketing Commission (Maximum Levy) Regulations (NI) 1976 (SR 184).</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/2">In the late 1980s and early 1990s, finance surpluses were built up in the LMC from both levy income and the activities the commission carried out on behalf of the then Intervention Board (now Rural Payments Agency). This revenue was used to avoid the need for levy increases and to fund additional LMC activities necessary, post the 1996 BSE crisis, to support and communicate with consumers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, given the critical need to expand beef sales in those marketplaces. However, it was considered that these surpluses would become exhausted by the end of March 2002 and consequently an increase in levy income was necessary in order for the LMC to maintain its activities at anything approaching existing levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/3">Formal consultation with the industry was completed in March 2002, with general acceptance of proposals to increase the existing producer levies for cattle and sheep and to make statutory the voluntary processor slaughter levies for cattle and sheep. New legislation to give effect to these proposals came into operation at the end of February this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/4">The Livestock and Meat Commission (Maximum Levy) Regulations (NI) 2003 (SR No. 20), which came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-27">27 February 2003</phrase>, set new ceiling amounts for each levy rate (ie &pound;6 per bovine and &pound;1 per ovine) which are well above the new combined actual rates of levy payable detailed within the Livestock and Meat Commission (Levy) (No. 2) Regulations (NI) 2003 (SR No. 104), which came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February 2003</phrase>, ie &pound;2 per bovine (&pound;1 from producer and &pound;1 from processor) and 30p per ovine (20p from producer and 10p from processor). The LMC had, however, also initially sought to introduce a transaction levy, to be payable on every animal movement, in order to spread the payment of levy across the industry rather than just on the finishers. The ceiling amounts in the maximum levy regulations were set sufficiently high to collect transaction levy and also to ensure that any future increases could be introduced with the minimum of legislative change. It should be noted, however, that the proposal for a transaction levy has not yet been progressed as lawyers considered that the powers within the primary legislation, the Livestock Marketing Commission Act (NI) 1967, as amended, were not sufficient to enable the introduction of such a levy. The proposal for a transaction levy is being considered further by the department.</p>
