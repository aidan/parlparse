The Government fully accept that the level of fraud in war pensions is minimal. Nonetheless they take the view that the war pensions scheme should be given the same level of protection from the threat posed by persistent benefit cheats as the mainstream social security system.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.6/4">As the measures in question are aimed solely at the small minority who abuse the benefit system, the Government took the view that consultation with bodies such as the War Widows Association which represent benefit recipients would not be appropriate.</p>

These obligations include the obligation to take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event minimising, civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects. The UK has never used depleted uranium during NATO military operations, but our assessments indicate that the health risks from exposure to DU are minimal.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.5/1">Day-to-day operation of the Jubilee Line is a matter for London Underground (LUL). LUL informs me that during the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March</phrase> an unusual number of problems occurred almost simultaneously, with the cumulative result that around 45 per cent of normal service unfortunately could not be run.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/2">First, in the course of LUL's nightly out-of-service hours programme of safety checks on the system, a broken rail was discovered north of Finchley Road on the north-bound Jubilee Line track. Engineering work to repair the track was started immediately but was not complete before the start of morning services. As a result some Jubilee Line services had to be suspended and a temporary speed restriction had to be imposed, to enable the necessary safety work to be completed. This led to the cancellation of several trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/3">These problems were exacerbated by two other unrelated incidents: a signal failure near the site of the broken rail and a SPAD (signal passed at red) farther down the line. These incidents caused further delays, leaving many trains out of scheduled position, severely delayed or cancelled.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/4">LUL has in place official standard procedures, kept constantly under review, both for scheduled maintenance work and for following up and recovering from incidents such as these when they arise. LUL regrets that on this occasion the combination of difficulties arising together led to exceptional delays.</p>
