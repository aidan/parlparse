	<p pid="a.174.5/1">The information requested is not centrally collected. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) allocates resources to institutions not to specific subject departments within them. It is up to higher education institutions, as autonomous bodies, to manage the resources they receive from the funding council, and other stakeholders, and to decide how the funding is distributed internally to meet central overheads and to support individual departments and schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">Single payment scheme (SPS) entitlements will be allocated on the basis of eligible land, which excludes orchards unless they are also grazed within the terms we are discussing with the European Commission. Where orchards are subsequently grubbed up, no additional SPS entitlements will be allocated, but the land could be used in support of a claim for payment against an existing entitlement as long as it remained an agricultural area of the farmer's holding taken up by arable land or permanent pasture and was kept in good agricultural and environmental condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.3/1">To date, discussions with the European Commission have focussed on the introduction of the single payment scheme in 2005. Discussions on the 2007 review of the horticultural &quot;authorisations&quot; system are likely to take place once experience has been gained in running the scheme. That review may cover the future eligibility of land under orchards to attract single payment entitlements but this can not be guaranteed at this stage.</p>
