	<p pid="b.174.11/1">Since 2001, the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), based at the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), has been the main receiving unit for military casualties evacuated from operational theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Military patients benefit from the concentration of five specialist hospitals in the Birmingham area, and receive first-class clinical care appropriate to their injuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.11/2">Military patients have benefited enormously from the advances in medicine, including the treatment of serious wounds, over recent years. Selly Oak Hospital, part of UHBFT, is at the leading edge in the UK in the care of the most common types of injuries (such as polytrauma) that our casualties sustain. Working together, UHBFT and RCDM strive to improve on the very high standards of care already provided to military patients. A military-managed ward was created at Selly Oak at the end of 2006. Military patients are nursed together on this ward when clinically appropriate. Some 39 military nurses and healthcare assistants now work there alongside NHS civilian colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.11/3">We shall carry this concept forward into the Birmingham New Hospitals project that is planned to start admitting patients in 2010. We are working closely with the NHS hospital authorities to create a military ward occupying one floor of the new hospital. The new hospital's layout offers increased opportunities for nursing military patients together on such a ward when clinically appropriate, with a nursing team that will be predominantly military. The military ward is therefore planned to offer a distinct military environment, including dedicated space for the reception of family members and other visitors to the ward, while benefiting from the clinical facilities and skills of what will be Europe's largest and most modern critical care teaching hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.11/4">The UK has field hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan which provide deployed hospitalisation and associated support elements, including consultant-led emergency medicine, general, trauma and orthopaedic surgery, intensive care, medium and low dependency nursing care beds and diagnostic support (including computerised tomography), as well as relevant clinical subspecialties. Specific recent or planned measures include the introduction of novel procedures and equipment for improving protocols for haemorrhage, transfusion and resuscitation; improved methods of tracking and managing wounds and associated infections, and improving telemedicine support. These improvements have been developed in conjunction with continuing research in the UK and with allied nations.</p>

Following the MoD welfare conference in April 2007 it was agreed that there should be regular monitoring of the welfare needs of seriously injured personnel, regular and reservist, and veterans by designated service welfare staff and the Veterans Welfare Service. This would begin in service and continue to service termination and for at least two years after discharge, with an option to carry on beyond that date as required. Protocols to support seamless transition from service to civilian life setting out actions, time course and lead welfare service have been developed and agreed and the aftercare service has now been implemented.

These include 2,215 power stations and substations, 737 sewage and water treatment works, 680 health centres and surgeries and 401 schools. However, it does not follow that each site is at this level of risk as the agency list does not take account of, for example, the ground elevation of individual sites or construction details including site-specific flood resilience measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.182.5/1">The Government support the International Code for Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and the subsequent amending World Health Assembly resolutions. The World Health Organisation (WHO) code is a set of recommendations and, as such, countries are expected to adopt the principles of the code but may do so in ways other than those specifically set out in the code. The European Union (EU) Directive 2006/141/EC on Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula is the mechanism by which the EU has reflected the provisions on labelling and advertising as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.5/2">The WHO recommendations are very wide-ranging in their scope, with some relating to detailed labelling provisions, others to the functioning of the health care system and others still to the corporate responsibilities of manufacturers. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is acting in relation to the recommendations as they relate to the composition, labelling and advertising of formula. In addition, the department has implemented various initiatives including a national network of breastfeeding co-ordinators, and an Infant Feeding Best Practice Manager to work with the strategic health authorities to help primary care trusts and local strategic partnerships to deliver improved breastfeeding rates across England.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.5/3">The FSA has consulted stakeholders on both the new draft regulations which will implement EU Directive 2006/141/EC, and the accompanying draft regulatory impact assessment. The regulations will lay down rules about the composition, labelling and advertising of formulae. In total 1,341 responses from formula manufacturers, non-governmental organisations, enforcement bodies, parliamentarians and individuals were received from stakeholders. The comments are now being collated and evaluated by the FSA to inform the final decision. These include comments on the statement referred to in HL5691. The FSA also intends to consult in the near future on accompanying draft guidance notes which will advise on the interpretation of the regulations. The directive requires that regulations come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.184.0/2">In a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-26">26 September</phrase>, Professor Hooper indicated that he felt there had been prevarication over the implementation of individual appeals that had been determined by the Pensions Appeal Tribunal. He suggested, too, that the use of &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; as an umbrella term to cover any recognised medical condition caused by service and connected to the 1990-91 Gulf conflict was an attempt to evade our responsibility to Gulf veterans described as suffering signs and symptoms of ill-defined conditions (SSIDC).</p>
	<p pid="b.184.0/3">The Government do not accept these points. The Ministry of Defence provides compensation for all accepted injuries or illnesses due to service. The department acts in good faith to give effect to the individual decisions of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal. As has been made clear on many previous occasions, the Government accept that some people are ill due to their service in the Gulf and compensate wherever there is disablement attributed to or aggravated by service, and this may include SSIDC. Our responsibility for Gulf veterans whose SSIDC is accepted as due to service is recognised by the award of a war pension; this is unaffected by any specific use of the term &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.0/4">Professor Hooper also suggested that MoD-sponsored research into cancers among Gulf veterans was flawed because it would not have picked up early diagnosis. This is incorrect; the study*, which found no excess of cancer among veterans, employed the records of the NHS central register and analysed data from <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-01">1 April 1991</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.0/5">In a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-24">24 September</phrase>, Professor Hooper referred to my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>222</I>) on motor neurone disease.

The term &quot;Gulf War syndrome&quot; can be applied as an umbrella term to conditions that are connected with an individual's service in the 1990-91 Gulf conflict. This is the Government's general policy on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.0/3">The Government do accept, however, that once a decision of the Ministry of Defence has properly been referred to the Pensions Appeal Tribunal and the tribunal has decided that case, the decision in that case is final and conclusive and must be implemented, unless the Secretary of State for Defence has appealed it. Recent decisions by the tribunal regarding the use of the term &quot;Gulf War syndrome&quot; have therefore either been, or are being, implemented accordingly.</p>

In the particular assessment identified, the PAT merely upheld an assessment made by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency under the War Pensions Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.3/2">In a previous entitlement appeal in the same case, where the PAT had the power to allow or disallow an appeal in respect of a condition rejected for war pensions purposes, the tribunal made clear that it approached the issue of Gulf War syndrome on the basis of a formal written concession made by the MoD in the case of Martin.

These include scrutiny within each Administration and with the relevant legislature holding the Executive to account.</p>

	<p pid="b.194.5/1">The latest available information is shown in the accompanying table. This shows the proportion of UK-domiciled young (aged under 21) entrants to full-time first degree courses at each higher education institution, who are from state schools. The figures cover the period 2000-01 to 2005-06 inclusive. Figures for 2006-07 will become available in 2008. This information is taken from the annual performance indicators in higher education, which are published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.5/2">For each institution, the state school proportion is shown against a benchmark. This is a sector average which is adjusted for each institution to take into account the following factors: subject of study, qualifications on entry and age on entry. The benchmarks can be used to show how a university is performing compared to the sector as a whole, and also help to determine whether a meaningful comparison can be drawn between two or more universities.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.5/3">The majority of entrants to each of these institutions come from the state sector, although in some cases the proportion is not at the benchmark. The Government remain committed to widening participation in higher education and that within that people are encouraged and are able to attend the institutions or courses which best suit their merit and potential. The Government therefore support interventions such as Gifted and Talented Education, which seeks to enable young people from a wide range of backgrounds to access higher education at the more selective institutions.</p>
