</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-10-17b.107.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="107"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51017w01.htm#51017w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.107.2/1">Following her speech on social mobility of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-26">26 July 2005</phrase> the Secretary of State has received two pieces of correspondence from Reverend Paul Nicolson of the Zacchaeus Trust 2000. These representations highlighted the effects of child poverty, stated the reverend's support for the Government's commitment to tackling poverty and emphasised the need for work to take place across government.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.2/2">In her reply the Secretary of State said that the Government are clear that poverty can and does blight the lives of children and families. That is why the Government are committed to tackling both the causes and effects of poverty; halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. To this end, the Department for Education and Skills is investing in affordable childcare to allow parents to work, high quality early years provision and parenting support to provide children with the best possible start in life, and is committed to raising standards in education and reducing the number of young people not in education, employment or training, to ensure that everyone can achieve their full potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.2/3">However, the Government recognise that the problem of child poverty cannot be tackled by one department alone. That is why in July 2004 we published the <i>Cross-government Child Poverty Review</i>; setting out the steps we will take across government to eradicate child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.2/4">Cross-government action to improve outcomes for children, young people and families, is also being taken forward through the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme, which focuses on improving five outcomes for children: staying safe; being healthy, making a positive contribution; enjoying and achieving; and achieving economic well being. As a result, local authorities and their partners are working, through local change programmes, to create better integrated children's services which are more responsive to the needs of all children, young people and families.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.5/2">A regulatory impact assessment concluded that most of the requirements in the proposed regulations were already covered by central guidance and best practice standards in the UK&mdash;thus the costs were being, or would be, incurred anyway. The Department of Health has made &pound;200,000 available to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to meet the set up cost of developing a reporting system for serious adverse events and reactions. Any additional cost incurred by an individual hospital will depend on how far it is compliant with current requirements and best practice.</p>

The conditions that will permit the transfer of security responsibility to the Iraqi security forces have been defined by the Joint Committee to Transfer Security Responsibility, and are based on four broad categories: an assessment of the insurgents' threat level; Iraqi security forces' ability to take on the security task; the capacity of provincial bodies to cope with the changed security environment; and the posture and support available from coalition forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/2">We expect the committee's recommendations to be confirmed soon. Thereafter, assessments will be made to determine which areas of Iraq are ready to transfer to Iraqi control. While we do not want to be in Iraq any longer than is necessary, we will not be deflected from our task. We have made a commitment to the Iraqi people and it is important that we honour that commitment and see our task through.</p>
