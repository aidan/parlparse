Later the same day the Italian Ambassador was expelled. We and our EU partners protested to the Eritreans. EU heads of mission to Asmara were subsequently recalled.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3">At the EU's Africa Working Group Meeting in October partners agreed that the heads of mission would only return to Asmara once President Issayas had agreed to meet them to discuss the EU's concerns. However, with no movement from the Eritreans, the EU presidency subsequently proposed the return of heads of missions in an attempt to secure a call locally. The heads of mission returned to Asmara in the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-05">5 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-23">23 November</phrase> EU heads of mission met Issayas to discuss the internal situation and prospects for EU/Eritrea relations. Issayas was unrepentant and resisted any discussion of Eritrea's internal situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.5/2">The UK Government have been supporting the development of this protocol indirectly through the funding they provide to the British Non-Governmental Organisation Saferworld. Support for Saferworld dates back to 1998 when we provided funds for a meeting of officials from the EU and SADC which led to the agreement of the Southern Africa Action Programme on Light Arms and Illicit Trafficking. The UK has since provided support to Saferworld for research into the small arms problem in Southern Africa and for the facilitation of meetings of officials from SADC countries to assist in the development of the protocol.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.5/3">Once the protocol is signed by all SADC countries the UK will consider ways that we might support its implementation, at both the bilateral and multilateral level, through the joint DfID, FCO and MoD Global Conflict Prevention Pool Small Arms and Light Weapons Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.2/2">Garden waste is included in the calculation of the recycling/composting target if it is composted at a central or community composting facility.

	<p pid="a.178.2/1">We do not hold information centrally on the number of Ministers and officials who have taken lessons in foreign languages. However, from data collected by the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research we know that 35 cross-party MPs signed up to the Language Challenge as part of the European Year of Languages. The purpose of the Language Challenge was to demonstrate a positive attitude towards language learning and cultural awareness rather than to gain formal qualifications. Each person was free to set his or her own goal, with the emphasis being on participation, rather than assessed results.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.2/2">Staff within the DfES are encouraged to learn languages, both for their personal development and to support work-related need. A series of themed events were held within the department during the European Year of Languages.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.4/2" qnum="HL2215">Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Privy Seal on 17 December (WA 32), whether they consider that a qualifying registered party, within the meaning of Part II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, is a body certain of whose functions are of a public nature, within the meaning of Section 6(3) of the Human Rights Act 1998, in selecting and nominating persons to stand for election in the name of that party in that the function is &quot;quasi-governmental in nature&quot; and &quot;seeks to achieve some collective benefit for the public&quot;; and, if not, why not.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.5/1">The Government have previously expressed their view that the selection of candidates for election by political parties is not a public function within the meaning of Section 6(3) of the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/2">The requirement for political parties to register in order to take part in certain elections by virtue of Part II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 does not make the function of selecting candidates by those parties a public one.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/3">The Government do not consider the selection of candidates to be a function that is quasi-governmental in nature. A political party no doubt regards itself as acting in the public interest by selecting a candidate for election. Activities which are motivated by the public interest, however, are not necessarily public functions seeking to achieve some collective benefit for the public. As the Court of Appeal has recently made clear, the fact that an organisation is motivated in performing its activities by what it perceives to be the public interest does not point to the body being a public authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/4">The Government's view is that the selection of a candidate to stand for election is internal to the party. Even if the party is motivated by the public interest in undertaking this function, this does not alter its character from a function that is political in nature into one that is public in nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.5/5">There is, however, no binding authority from the court on the point. Until there is, the Government must take a view on the matter based on their interpretation of the law, but this does not mean that there is no room for differing views.</p>
