In support of this objective, the FCO, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development share the following joint public service agreement target: &quot;By 2007&ndash;08, improve effectiveness of UK and international support for conflict prevention, through addressing long-term structural causes of conflict, managing regional and national tension and violence, and supporting post-conflict reconstruction, where the UK can make a significant difference, in particular Africa, Asia, the Balkans and the Middle East&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/2">Effort to prevent and resolve conflict is fundamental to the Government's multilateral and bilateral security activity. The Government are actively engaged around the world in conflict resolution, for example in Afghanistan, west Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans. The Government are also working hard to improve multilateral institutions' willingness and ability to act effectively in preventing and resolving conflicts, including in the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and through the development of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and European Union security and defence capabilities. The Government will use their G8 presidency in 2005 to reinforce efforts to improve security and stability in Africa. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has welcomed the report of the UN Secretary General's High-Level Panel, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>, which makes a wide range of recommendations aimed at improving the international response to threats to global peace and security.

	<p pid="a.33.2/1">The 1965 Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities (&quot;the 1965 Protocol&quot;) conferred on the European Communities a range of privileges and immunities considered necessary for the performance by the Communities of their tasks and functions. These privileges and immunities are similar to those conferred on other international organisations and include immunity from jurisdiction, exemption from taxation, exemption from customs duties and prohibitions and restrictions on importation and exportation of articles for official use. The provisions of the 1965 protocol apply to the Communities; to their institutions (ie the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors); to the European Central Bank, the European Monetary Institute and the European Investment Bank; and in accordance with the protocol, to certain representatives of member states and certain officials and servants of the Communities. The provisions of the protocol have also been applied to bodies created under the Community and to certain officials and staff engaged in the work of such bodies. The 1965 protocol, and the privileges and immunities flowing from it, are given effect in UK law by the European Communities Act 1972. The International Organisations Bill will not alter that situation.</p>

At present three bodies exist on which privileges and immunities will be conferred pursuant to Clause 5 of the International Organisations Bill.

	<p pid="a.38.2/1">While every effort is made to ensure that interviews are conducted in a manner that is appropriate and professional, it would not be possible to guarantee that female legal representation is available. Where individuals are arrested during the course of police or immigration operations, they are taken to the police station to be interviewed. They have the right to speak to an independent solicitor, free of charge, via the Duty Solicitor scheme. This is an independent scheme and the Immigration Service has no control over who is sent to represent the victim. Alternatively, the victim may request that a solicitor of her choice is called to represent her.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/2">Where a victim of trafficking is supported under the Poppy Project, interviews are conducted at the properties of Eaves Housing. It is open to the individual to have a legal representative present, and this would be organised by the victim, or representatives from the project, and would be of their choosing. In addition the Immigration Service will, wherever possible, provide female interpreters to assist with the interview.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/1">Asylum applications from victims of trafficking are, as with all such applications, considered on their individual merits. Caseworkers will decide whether the applicant has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution in their country for the reasons set out in the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. If the applicant does not qualify for refugee status consideration will be given to whether they qualify for humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.

	<p pid="a.40.3/1">All applications from Congolese nationals are considered on their individual merits and we will grant asylum or other forms of leave where appropriate. Where applicants have their asylum claims refused and have any appeal dismissed they can in our view return safely to the DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.3/2">All returns of DRC nationals are made to Kinshasa Airport, which is open to international flights. Returns are not made to any other part of the country due to the poor security situation that exists in large parts of the country and the poor transport infrastructure. The question of whether to return unsuccessful applicants who originate from outside Kinshasa is considered in the light of the individual circumstances in each case.</p>

Of these, 30 were held at Oakington Reception Centre and five at Tinsley House.

	<p pid="a.43.8/1">Courts do not collect this information.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.8/2">ASBO hearings may take place in the absence of the defendant if the defendant fails to turn up for the court hearing. The normal rules of the magistrates' court will apply in this situation. Section 55 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 sets out what may happen in the case of non-appearance of a defendant at any court hearing. The hearing may go ahead in the absence of the defendant, or it may be adjourned. There are provisions for issuing a warrant for the arrest of the defendant to ensure his or her attendance at the hearing. We are confident the practice is compatible with the ECHR.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.8/3">Applications for interim anti-social behaviour orders may be made without notice to the defendant. The jurisprudence of the European Convention on Human Rights recognises that victims and witnesses, as well as defendants, have rights and need protection. In deciding whether to grant an interim anti-social behavour order without notice to the defendant the courts must balance the rights of the defendant against those other rights. Furthermore an interim order made without notice has no effect until the defendant receives a copy; he or she can then apply to have the order varied or discharged. An interim order will only remain in force until the court decides whether or not to make a full order, where the defendant will have the opportunity to defend himself or herself. We have included provisions in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill which give courts the power to require a defendant to return to court for consideration of an order on conviction if the order is not made when the sentence is passed.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.2/1">We are addressing population pressures by a range of measures. First, we are increasing capacity in the prisons estate. A number of projects are underway including building around 2,400 additional public sector prison places at existing prisons by 2006. A new private sector prison, HMP Peterborough is due to open in March 2005. Following the spending review, funding has now been announced for the start of a new building programme commencing in 2005&ndash;06 to create an additional 1,300 prison places.</p>

We will also ensure that better targeted, more effective and demanding community penalities and properly enforced fines are available for other serious offenders. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 supports this approach by providing for community orders and improved frameworks for suspended and short sentences via custody plus and custody minus and through intermittent custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.5/1">Currently, the only data relating to injuries to and illness of members of the Armed Forces collated and held centrally is on the medical downgrading of Service personnel. The Defence Medical Services are working hard to ensure easier access to healthcare records through the introduction of a new information management system, the Defence Medical Information Capability Programme (DMICP).</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/2">DMICP is designed to provide the DMS with a modern and efficient information system that is coherent across primary, secondary and dental healthcare boundaries, and is useable both in peacetime and on operations.</p>

The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can addresss their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/3">Modern, high quality mobile or demountable classrooms provide a good environment for teaching and learning where there is short-term need. They might, for instance, be needed to cope with a short-term increase in pupil numbers, or where extensive remodelling or rebuilding of permanent accommodation means providing temporary accommodation on the school site, rather than transporting children elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.5/1">The recent changes to the national curriculum for 14 to 16 year-olds, with modern foreign languages and design and technology becoming entitlement areas as opposed to compulsory requirements, were undertaken to provide greater flexibility, allowing schools to offer programmes that better meet their students' individual needs and strengths. We recognise the importance of modern foreign languages. That is why all students have a statutory entitlement to follow a languages course should they wish to do so and schools can of course retain compulsion if they so wish.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">The changes to the statutory curriculum at key stage 4 were introduced to enable schools to offer more choice and flexibility to their pupils, facilitating the introduction of new types of learning&mdash;in particular more vocational approaches. This was proving difficult within the constraints of the previous requirements. The flexibility in the new curriculum creates space for students to pursue learning programmes that reflect their aspirations and needs as well as maintaining a strong grasp of the basics. In this new flexibility students have an entitlement to follow a course in modern foreign languages.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/2">The changes at key stage 4 should not impact on our able and enthusiastic linguists, who we expect will continue to study languages at GCSE, A-level and beyond. Our ambition for key stage 2 learning is that we engage pupils when we know that they are more receptive, so that we maximise their potential for language learning. Our National Languages Strategy puts forward a vision of high-quality language learning for all, regardless of gender, supported by a new national recognition scheme&mdash;the Languages Ladder. In doing so it is in fact seeking to reconfigure the existing curriculum, extending pupils' language learning experience into key stage 2 and supporting a more flexible and personalised curriculum for the 14 to 19 phase.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/3">Provision of a varied and personalised range of courses is being supported by new arrangements in relation to accreditation. It is now possible for students in all maintained schools and of both genders to be assessed through a wide range of non-traditional schemes, which have been given numerical equivalences by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. This includes a number of level 1 and level 2 qualifications. It also underpins the proposed reforms of the 14 to 19 agenda as set out in Mike Tomlinson's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/4">There are currently 62 specialist language colleges in the north-east, north-west and York and Humber regions with more interest from schools in applying for this specialism in the current round.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/5">There are also a number of innovative MFL-related projects taking place in the north. For example, the Sheffield-based VIPs pilot scheme aims to equip students with language skills directly transferable to the world of work. Students are allocated to an international company and visit the company during the academic year. They have a &quot;mentor&quot; within the company who will offer face-to-face and e-mail support. All students follow a language course leading to NVQ qualifications.</p>

This research highlighted that 44 per cent of all schools teaching key stage 2 pupils in England were offering language learning programmes in some form, with 35 per cent using curriculum time to do so. Approximately 3 per cent of schools were making a 20-minute per week provision for foreign language learning for their key stage 2 pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.3/2">The 44 per cent figure represents a significant increase since the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and University of Warwick published research in 2000 that stated that 20 per cent of primary schools were teaching foreign languages.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">There has been considerable progress on the development of language learning in primary schools, underpinned by the launch in December 2002 of the Government's National Languages Strategy for England. The strategy recognises the importance of developing a workforce to implement primary language learning, and much of our work to date has focussed on this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">In developing a school workforce, we are building up a cadre of both specialist teachers and non-teacher specialists to support primary language learning. 580 places have been allocated this year for primary initial teacher training with a specialism in French, German, Spanish or Italian, and we intend to expand this programme further next year. This means that over 1,200 teacher trainees will have been trained by the end of this year. In addition we have allocated 50 primary MFL places a year to the Graduate Teacher Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">For existing teachers, we have funded primary MFL advanced skills teacher posts and are working with the TTA to develop and pilot CPD courses for existing primary teachers to enhance language skills and MFL pedagogy.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/4">For non-teacher specialists, we are working with the British Council to extend the foreign language assistants programme into primary schools, and are developing training for teaching assistants to support primary language learning.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">Many of the provisions in the Disability Discrimination Bill were the subject of proposals in the Government's 2001 consultation document <i>Towards Inclusion&mdash;civil rights for disabled people </i>(Department for Education and Employment, March 2001). That document was mailed to around 6,000 interested bodies and organisations including organisations of and for disabled people, employers, service providers, trade and employer representative bodies, trade unions, public authorities and voluntary organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">In December 2003, we published the draft Disability Discrimination Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny. The draft Bill was considered by a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament in early 2004 and attracted around 125 written and oral submissions to the committee, including a submission from Macmillan Cancer Relief. A revised Bill, covering further measures that the Government accepted following the Joint Committee's report (Joint Committee on the Draft Disability Discrimination Bill, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-27">27 May</phrase>, HC 352-I, HL Paper 82-I), was introduced into Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">In July 2004 and December 2004, we published two further consultation documents which included proposals for using regulation-making powers contained in the Bill. The first document <i>Delivering Equality for disabled people </i>(Department for Work and Pensions, July 2004, Cm 6255) focused on the regulation-making powers in Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill, and nearly 5,000 copies were issued to interested bodies. Eight regional consultation events were attended by around 700 participants, and a targeted event for people with learning disabilities was also held.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">The second document, <i>Consultation on private clubs; premises; the definition of disability and the questions procedure </i>(Department for Work and Pensions, December 2004, Cm 6402) included, among others, proposals for using regulation-making powers to exclude certain cancers from the scope of the extended definition of disability. A direct mailing exercise was carried out to a range of representative bodies, including employers, landlords, organisations representing private clubs and specialist bodies dealing with cancer including Macmillan Cancer Relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/5">The Department for Transport has consulted separately on lifting the Part 3 exemption for transport services in the DDA (an initial consultation in 2002 and detailed consultation on draft regulations launched in November 2004) and on the proposals to amend the rail provisions of Part 5 of the DDA (in November 2003). Those consulted included organisations of and for disabled people, transport industries, public authorities and trade unions.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/6">Copies of the named consultation documents, which were also published in a wide range of accessible formats, are available from the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/1">The Office for Government Contracts Buying Services (OGCBS) draws up framework contracts for government departments to purchase telephony services. These do not stipulate what kinds of services individual departments should choose, and so there is no centrally held information on which government departments and agencies currently use 0870 numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">The independent regulator the Office of Communications (Ofcom) allocates 0870 numbers to eligible network communications providers in units of 10,000 numbers. Those providers then allocate individual numbers to end-users either directly or through resellers. Although Ofcom knows who is reponsible for all number blocks it has no record of individual 0870 number end-users, including government departments and agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.2/1">Badgers are known to predate on ground nesting birds, although such predation is likely to be largely opportunistic. The impact of badger predation on bird populations has not been specifically quantified, but is not thought significantly to affect populations nationally. Locally, however, the situation may be different.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/2">Bird remains are typically found in about 7.5 per cent of badger dung in the UK, and diet studies confirm that badgers eat eggs, nestlings and adult birds. These studies are unable to distinguish between scavenged and killed birds, and do not quantify the importance of birds in the badger diet.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.2/3">Defra is currently funding research aimed at providing a scientifically vigorous assessment of the importance of badger predation for ground nesting birds. The project involves a review of current knowledge and intensive field investigations to assess the extent of predation by badgers. The project, which is being undertaken by the Central Science Laboratory, will report its findings in March 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.8/1">In future, greater weight will be given to past performance at the pre-qualification stage. The InterCity East Coast (ICEC) competition was launched in advance of this decision. The ICEC franchise bids will be evaluated using the standard Stratetic Rail Authority (SRA) method, a full copy of which is available on the SRA website at <a href="http://www.sra.gov.uk">www.sra.gov.uk</a>. This weights the various factors important for delivering a successful franchise. Performance (punctuality and reliability) of the train services and the robustness of the bidders' plans to deliver it are highly weighted in the evaluation.</p>
