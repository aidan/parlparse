	<p pid="a.51.5/1">People throughout the country, including in London, benefit from the substantial resources which the Government make available to support children and adults with particular learning needs, including dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/2">Local authorities in England estimate that expenditure on the education of school-age children with special educational needs (SEN) has increased from &pound;2.8 billion in 2001&ndash;02 (when data were first available) to &pound;4.1 billion in 2005&ndash;06. This is about 13 per cent. of all education spending. It is estimated that almost &pound;750,000 was spent last year in London. In addition, the Government provide funding to schools through the School Development Grant (SDG), which can be used for activities in support of children with SEN. The SEN element of the SDG in 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;84 million (it is not ring-fenced; schools decide how it should be used). The total SDG for 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;674 million. This will increase by 3.4 per cent. per pupil in 2006&ndash;07 and 3.7 per cent. in 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/3">In respect of learners in further education, my department does not allocate separate budgets at local or regional level to meet particular learning difficulties and/or disabilities. Young people and adults with dyslexia in England can access mainstream programmes where their needs are met through core funding, with additional funding support where required. In 2004&ndash;05, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) supported 641,000 learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities at a cost of around &pound;1.5 billion. The figures for 2005&ndash;06 are not yet available. There is a separate budget for specialist colleges for learners with the most severe needs. We are providing &pound;158 million for this purpose in 2006&ndash;07. Support for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities is a key priority identified in our grant letter to the LSC and is in turn reflected in the LSC's annual statement of priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/4">In addition, in 2004 my department's Skills for Life Unit has produced a publication, <i>A Framework for Understanding Dyslexia</i>, as part of the Government's national strategy for improving adult literacy skills. This framework provides general information on the nature of dyslexia, a review of theories about dyslexia, and an overview of approaches and programmes used by specialists who support dyslexic learners. This work has been followed up by a second project, Supporting Dyslexic Learners in Different Contexts.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/5">Disabled students' allowances (DSAs) can help pay the extra costs students may incur to attend a course of higher education, as a direct result of a disability or specific learning difficulty such as dyslexia. The allowances can help pay the cost of major items of specialist equipment, a non-medical personal helper, travel and other course-related costs. DSAs are paid in addition to the existing standard support package. They are not means tested and do not have to be repaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/6">The Government remain committed to increasing resources for the education of people with learning difficulties at all levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">Iceland and Denmark (in respect of Greenland and the Faroe Islands) are parties to the NASCO convention, as is the EU. UK officials play an active role in the EU delegation to NASCO, to promote the conservation, restoration, enhancement and rational management of salmon stocks. These activities have included annual negotiations with Denmark (in respect of Greenland and the Faroe Islands), which have secured a reduction in the fishery at west Greenland to the current subsistence level (with a zero quota) and the current cessation of long-line fishing in Faroes waters. The Faroe Islands have never operated a drift-net fishery for salmon, and Iceland has no salmon fisheries in its marine waters.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">The National Salmon Commission in Ireland has recently been determining the management regime for its fishery, based on the advice of its scientific committee. We have provided assistance to the commission as regards the way in which we and the North Atlantic Salmon Fund (UK) organised the buyout of the majority of the North-East Coast Salmon Driftnet Fishery. We are also prepared to offer help to the working group which the Irish Marine Minister has set up to consider the implications for the net fishery of reducing the total allowable catch (TAC) to a level which would enable conservation limits to be respected.</p>

We have concerns that some of the provisions it contains, such as the granting of automatic reflections periods, may serve to make it attractive for people to claim to have been trafficked. This would make it even harder to identify genuine victims. A consultation period with UK stakeholders on our response to human trafficking has recently ended: its results are being collated and will help inform the eventual decision. It is worth noting that while 26 member states have signed the convention, none has actually ratified it.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/1">The report entitled <i>Tax on the Boardroom Agenda&mdash;The Views of Business</i> was published on the HMRC website on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-11">11 April 2006</phrase>, and is available in the Library. The report concluded that chairmen of UK-based large corporates are willing to engage with HMRC at a senior level, on a number of key strategic issues. These issues will be addressed as part of the following initiatives:</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/2">The publication of HMRC's large business service operating model on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-18">18 April 2006</phrase>, <i>Working with Large Business, Process 1&mdash;Working with Customers</i>, describes how HMRC aims to work in an open, collaborative relationship with its large business customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/3">On Budget day 2006, the Chancellor announced a review of HMRC's links with large business, to be led by Sir David Varney. The outline plans published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April 2006</phrase> demonstrate that the review will meet business's desire for further dialogue and demonstrate HMRC's responsiveness and willingness to engage on key strategic issues. The new forum will provide an excellent opportunity for HMRC and business to take stock of their relationship and to review how they can work better together to ensure that the UK has a modern, responsive tax administration which meets the needs of both the authorities and business.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/4">HMRC has created a new Large Business and Employers Customer Unit whose remit is to develop a better understanding of the needs of large business, across a range of strategic and operational issues, and to use this understanding to inform, challenge and influence behaviour across HMRC and HM Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.1/2" qnum="HL5221">Further to the Written Answer by the Lord McKenzie of Luton on 18 April (<i>WA 220</i>), whether they (a) have accepted the recommendation in the report <i>HMRC Online Services</i> that the XBRL computer language should be used for the filing of company tax returns; (b) have considered the degree to which XBRL is currently used by businesses of all sizes; (c) have considered the additional costs to businesses of all sizes of being required to use XBRL; (d) have compared the relative costs and merits of XBRL with alternative methods of company tax return filing from the perspective of the companies which will be affected; and (e) consider that the partial regulatory impact assessment issued by HM Revenue and Customs on 22 March adequately deals with the costs and burdens associated with the compulsory use of XBRL.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.2/1">(a) The Government announced on Budget day that they accepted Lord Carter's recommendations and that, subject to the right systems being in place, companies would be required to file online using XBRL from April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">(b) XBRL is being developed by an international non-profit consortium of approximately 450 major companies, organisations and government agencies. XBRL is already being put to practical use in a number of countries and its use is growing rapidly around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/3">(c) XBRL is a technical coding system which would be largely invisible to the product user. The majority of company accounts and computations are already prepared using software packages. HMRC does not expect the cost of software packages to be significantly increased by the incorporation of XBRL because of market pressures and because this is functionality that software providers are already developing. Lord Carter's recommendation will help to drive that development.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/4">(d) HMRC does not anticipate that use of XBRL will involve additional cost or burden for companies. XBRL is designed to streamline financial reporting at all stages, from the point where individual financial transactions take place and are recorded by a company's business software systems, through to audit and accounts preparation processes, and on to tax and regulatory reporting. There is no competing standard for financial reporting. The potential benefits of XBRL to small businesses were recognised by the ACCA in 2004 in its paper <i>Using information and communication technologies to reduce the compliance burdens faced by small businesses&mdash;A Proposal by ACCA</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/5">(e) HMRC will be working with representative bodies on the detailed implementation of Lord Carter's recommendations, and comments have been invited on the estimated costs and benefits identified in the partial RIA.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.0/1">South Yorkshire secured Objective 1 status in 1999 for a seven-year programme (2000&ndash;06) which would invest a total of &pound;1.8 billion in the economy, including &pound;750 million of European funds.
