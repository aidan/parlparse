	<p pid="b.103.2/1">Tackling the narcotics industry is at the heart of UK efforts in Afghanistan. We are supporting the Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control Strategy, which is based on approaches that have worked in Thailand and Pakistan. Over the period 2005-08, we will spend in excess of &pound;290 million to support counter-narcotics, including &pound;130 million to promote the development of alternative livelihoods for Afghan farmers. There has been some success: improvements in security and governance in the north, centre and east of Afghanistan have led to a dramatic reduction in poppy cultivation. The Afghan Government are aiming for at least half of provinces to become poppy-free in 2008 (from 13 in 2007 to 17 in 2008). We are working to sustain these gains and are focusing our efforts on the south where poppy cultivation is becoming increasingly linked with insecurity and the insurgency.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.2/2">UK support includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.103.2/3">enhancing interdiction efforts to disrupt the operations of drugs networks and to weaken their links to the insurgency;assistance to Afghanistan's Poppy Eradication Force, including incentives to governors to undertake eradication of poppy cultivation;expertise to strengthen the criminal justice system, which has processed over 500 narcotics cases;providing 59 policing experts to Afghanistan to help train the Afghan National Police and the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan;funding drug treatment centres in six provinces, which have treated over 5,450 addicts; andfunding the National Solidarity Programme, which has financed over 34,816 projects including: water supply and sanitation; transport; irrigation; power; agriculture; education; rural development; public building; and health and emergency response.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.6/2">Within the British Nationality Act 1981, the current nationality legislation, the term &quot;British subject&quot; applies only to two groups: (a) persons who derive the status by reason of a connection with the Republic of Ireland before 1949 and who have claimed the right to remain British subjects; (b) certain persons closely connected with the former British India who have not acquired any alternative citizenship.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.2/1">The provisions for the acquisition of British citizenship are contained in the British Nationality Act 1981.

	<p pid="b.107.0/2">We support the efforts for reform in Cameroon, especially reform of the electoral system, the fight against corruption and the improvement of the climate for business and investment.

	<p pid="b.108.2/1">Government data for the levy cannot be broken down by company size. However, the climate change levy package provides a range of measures that can help SMEs to improve their energy efficiency. For example, the Carbon Trust provides technical advice and support to businesses. The Energy Efficiency Loan scheme (aimed at SMEs) provides a cost-effective way for SMEs to upgrade existing equipment by providing access to interest-free loans for qualifying energy products.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/2">SMEs are also eligible for enhanced capital allowances on their investment in energy-saving technologies. Over 1,400 products now qualify for Enhanced Capital Allowances, and SMEs can further apply for research grants to help them develop new low-carbon technologies.</p>

	<p pid="b.112.6/1">Decommissioning conditions are applied to onshore wind farm planning permissions to ensure restoration of the site to the satisfaction of the local authority once the planning permission lifetime has expired. It is common practice for developers to enter into agreements pursuant to Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to ensure funds are available for such decommissioning work.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.6/2">The depth to which concrete bases should be dismantled and whether access roads should be included in the decommissioning will depend on such factors as the environmental conditions at the site and the utility of retaining access roads following decommissioning of the wind farm.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.6/3">Decommissioning of offshore renewable energy installations (OREIs), including offshore wind farms, is governed by the regime set out under the Energy Act 2004 (EA 2004) which gives the Secretary of State the power to impose decommissioning requirements on any person who is party to a proposal to construct, extend or operate an OREI. This person must then provide the Secretary of State with information on decommissioning, including how they intend to remove the installation when it comes to the end of its useful life, and how they intend to pay for it. All OREIs consented after June 2006 are subject to these requirements. A small number of installations were consented prior to June 2006 and are not covered by the scope of the EA 2004 provisions. However these developments have decommissioning requirements contained within their lease from the Crown Estate, one of the necessary requirements for construction.</p>

Ovenstone are planning to process the next season's quota aboard its vessel, the <I>Kelso</I>, rather than on-island. Therefore, we do not expect any reduction of the income Tristan derives from lobster fishing. Some casual staff employed at the facility will be unemployed until the facility is rebuilt, but regular employees will continue to be paid by Ovenstone.</p>
