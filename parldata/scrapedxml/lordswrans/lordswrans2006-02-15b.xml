	<p pid="b.184.6/1">A country's terms of trade are determined by the prices of its exports relative to those of imports. This is not something that in practice can be directly influenced through economic policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.6/2">The existence of a trade deficit for the UK does not imply negative effects for the economy. It is only part of the UK's overall balance of payments, and what matters is how it is funded. The current account deficit is financed by surpluses on the second part of the balance of payments&mdash;the financial and capital account&mdash;so the deficit is sustainable and has no negative long-term consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.6/3">The UK's interests are best served by being a full and active member of the European Union (EU). This has brought significant benefits to the UK in terms of prosperity, jobs, peace and security. More than half our trade is with Europe, and 3 million British jobs are linked to exports to the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.184.9/1">The introduction of regional fuel duty rates would represent a departure from the principle of uniform duty rates across the UK. Furthermore, it would also create a new control problem of ensuring that Northern Ireland duty paid fuel was not used in Great Britain.</p>
