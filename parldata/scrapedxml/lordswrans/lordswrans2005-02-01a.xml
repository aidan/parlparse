	<p pid="a.29.5/1">Following the referendum on both sides of the island on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-24">24 April 2004</phrase>, European Union Foreign Ministers expressed their determination to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-26">26 April 2004</phrase>. In July, the European Commission drew up proposals for two regulations on financial aid and direct trade to help achieve this. The Government support these proposals.

	<p pid="a.31.2/1">We do not believe that teachers accused of offences such as assault should be given anonymity until after trial. We consider that it is vital to uphold the principles of open justice which are necessary for the maintenance of public confidence in the criminal justice system and that informed and strengthened guidance to the police and media is preferable to legislation. Revised guidance issued by the Press Complaints Commission provides safeguards against the publication of inaccurate or misleading information. In addition, the Association of Chief Police Officers' advice to police forces makes it clear that anyone under investigation, but not charged, should not be named, and their details should not be provided to the press.</p>

The contribution does not meet the full costs of provision. The shortfall in provision is met from the General Lighthouse Fund.</p>
