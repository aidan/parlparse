<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-06-22b.95.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="95"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60622w01.htm#60622w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.95.2/1">DfID uses international data showing progress towards the millennium development goals (MDGs) to monitor these public service agreement (PSA) sub-targets. These are obtained from the World Bank and agencies of the United Nations, which have in turn obtained data from the countries in question, evaluated its quality and in some cases made adjustments to ensure international consistency.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/2">Most of our 2005&ndash;08 PSA targets for Africa are based on progress in 16 PSA countries. The exception to this is the poverty indicator, for which an internationally produced estimate of overall poverty in the region is used.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/3">Our view that Africa will meet PSA targets for poverty reduction, primary school enrolment and child mortality by 2008 is based on the difference between the baseline and most recent data, together with an assessment of longer-term trends since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/4">For the overall poverty sub-target, although 2002 data show little or no change from the 2000 baseline and there are enormous challenges, there are also grounds for optimism. For example, according to the World Bank, economic performance in Africa in 2004 was the best since 1997. Our entire aid programme in Africa is targeted at reducing poverty. Our bilateral aid to Africa exceeded &pound;1 billion during 2005&ndash;06 and we are on track to double aid to Africa between 2004&ndash;05 and 2010&ndash;11. We have also followed up on commitments made at Gleneagles on specific support to economic growth, such as providing $20 million to the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa, $30 million to the Investment Climate Facility and $20 million to the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/5">The trend for primary school enrolment is upwards. Latest figures show 77 per cent. enrolment; up from 70 per cent. in 2000. We will continue to prioritise education. In April 2006, the Chancellor and Secretary of State for International Development pledged &pound;8.5 billion over the next 10 years to finance 10-year education plans in African countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/6">Child mortality is falling in many countries (though countries such as Sierra Leone and Democratic Republic of Congo still have very high rates). The 2000 baseline child mortality rate across our 16 PSA countries was 157, on current trends we predict it will fall to 147 by 2008. We are continuing to increase our support for building sustainable, basic health services in Africa and tackling important childhood diseases by expanding access to insecticide-treated bed-nets and immunisation. Access to clean water and sanitation is also critical for child health and we are doubling our expenditure on this up to &pound;95 million by 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.8/1">Veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict and of the current Iraq deployment (Operation TELIC) who believe their health has suffered as a result of their service in the Gulf may seek a referral to the Medical Assessment Programme (MAP). Those concerned should seek a referral having first seen their Service Medical Officer if still serving or General Practitioner if ex-Service. The MAP is an independent programme: medical confidentiality is observed and all patients are extensively investigated even if not clinically indicated. As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June 2006</phrase>, 3,286 veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict and 34 of the current operation in the Gulf had been seen by MAP physicians.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.3/1">The principal issue raised by veterans claiming Gulf War syndrome before the Daniel Martin decision was that it should be recognised as a discrete medical condition. There was, and remains, no scientific basis for doing this, and this was confirmed by the Pensions Appeal Tribunal decision of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>. We have recognised the need to bring an element of closure for those who have sought some acknowledgement that their ill-health is connected to their Gulf service. For this reason we welcomed the tribunal's decision that Gulf War syndrome should be used as an umbrella term covering any recognised medical condition caused by service and connected to service in the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf War. We have repeatedly made clear, that the application of the umbrella term does not, in itself, affect the amount of an award, as compensation is already paid to veterans based on their level of disablement due to service in the Armed Forces, regardless of where it was caused.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.8/1">The Government's last assessment of the live music scene in England and Wales was made in 2004. This was based on findings from a survey by MORI, commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) that year, about live music performances in a wide range of smaller venues, including bars and restaurants, in the preceding 12 months. The survey findings are available on the DCMS website (<a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a>), and copies were deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.8/2">The DCMS intends to commission research this year to assess the take up of new licences permitting live music performances in England and Wales. A repeat of the 2004 baseline study will take place in 2007, when the Licensing Act 2003 will have been fully operational for more than a year, to measure its impact on live music.</p>

	<p pid="b.107.5/2">Permanent transfer can be effected in two ways. Employees of a department who carried out functions which were transferred to a north/south body under the terms of the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 were transferred permanently to the employ of that body. No promotion to a higher grade was involved.

	<p pid="b.107.5/3">Temporary transfer may also be effected in two ways. Departments are encouraged to facilitate secondments to north/south bodies, where civil servants have been successful in an open competition but wish to remain in the NICS and the body is content to fill the position on these terms. If the seconded post involves a promotion, then officers revert to their existing NICS grade on return from secondment. Secondly, at the bodies' request, staff may be transferred on loan at their existing grade to meet an urgent need, such as cover until open recruitment can take place.</p>

This is one of the 30 priority projects of the Trans-European Network (Transport) which were adopted in the 2004 guidelines. There are currently four priority projects in the UK: the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, the west coast main line modernisation, the Ireland-UK-Benelux road link and the road/rail axis between Ireland and mainland Europe. Funding for the Trans-European Network (both priority projects and other schemes) is allocated by the European Commission and the Government aim to achieve a fair level of funding for projects in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.111.5/1">In line with our Rural Strategy 2004, Defra has devolved decision-making on delivery of economic and social regeneration policies to regional and local levels. This includes areas of activity such as those formerly covered by the Countryside Agency's vital villages and market towns programmes, and builds on the RDAs' current responsibility for economic regeneration and sustainable development across England.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.5/2">We have increased Defra's contribution to the Regional Development Agency Single Pot by &pound;21 million to &pound;73 million to reflect these additional responsibilities to deliver improvements in rural productivity and access to services. This additional funding of &pound;21 million, running for three years (from 05&ndash;06 to 07&ndash;08), will ensure RDAs target resources at those rural areas and communities that need it most.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.5/3">RDAs, working in partnership, will decide how to use their resources to meet national targets and address regional needs. By devolving responsibilities to the RDAs and increasing their resources, rural delivery will become more responsive to local priorities and better focused on areas and people that need it most.</p>
