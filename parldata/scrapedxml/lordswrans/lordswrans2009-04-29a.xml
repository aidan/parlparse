	<p pid="a.40.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-08">8 April</phrase> the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration announced that the UK Government would retain the Worker Registration Scheme for a further two years. This decision was taken following receipt of advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee. A copy of their report has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.3/2">Retaining WRS will help protect our labour market at this difficult time. It will also mean that the UK can continue to collect A8 data to determine whether further steps may be needed over the next two years to prevent disruption of the UK labour market. The Government will review this decision in 12 months' time.</p>
