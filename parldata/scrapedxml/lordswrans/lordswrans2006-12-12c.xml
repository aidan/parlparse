	<p pid="c.179.5/1">Large studies in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America have shown improved outcomes for clients who have undergone residential rehabilitation. The American <I>Drug Abuse Treatment Outcomes Study (DA T05) </I>showed good outcomes at one year for people who had been treated in residential rehabilitation programmes, with cocaine and heroin use reduced by two-thirds from intake levels. The <I>British National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS) </I>showed that about half of the clients were abstinent from heroin and other opiates for three months after residential treatment. Injecting was halved and needle sharing reduced by more than two-thirds.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.5/2">NTORS also showed that clients with more complex drug use make better gains in residential rehabilitation than in community treatment. Improved outcomes were most likely to be found among clients who spent longer in residential rehabilitation, with those staying in treatment for at least three months more likely to have positive outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.5/3">There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of structured day programmes for drug misuse. Hence, currently there is little evidence concerning the relative effectiveness of the two settings in successful drug rehabilitation.</p>

	<p pid="c.181.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December</phrase>, the European Union (EU) Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health voted to extend a complete ban on the import of wild birds until <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>. The extension was justified in terms of allowing time for the Community to introduce proposals dealing with concerns outlined in the European Food Safety Authority's report on <I>Animal health and welfare risks associated with the import of wild birds other than poultry into the European Union</I>.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.0/2">As the Prime Minister wrote in his letter to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December</phrase>, the UK intends to press other member states and the European Commission to extend indefinitely the ban on the commercial import of wild birds from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, with exceptions for recognised international conservation programmes. This would protect both human and animal health, while benefiting the welfare of wild birds.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.0/3">Draft proposals circulated by the Commission detail an extremely strict import regime, with only a small number of countries (Australia, Bulgaria, some states of Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, Chile, Croatia, Israel, New Zealand, Romania, Tunisia and the USA) able to export to the EU. The proposals also contain a requirement that birds come from authorised breeding colonies and strict rules about permissible transportation time. We expect very low levels of imports as a result of these high standards, which are necessary to safeguard bird health.</p>
	<p pid="c.181.0/4">On welfare, veterinary officers (VO) from the State Veterinary Service will use their professional judgment to enforce welfare law. Under quarantine regulations, the death of any bird during the quarantine period should be reported to the VO supervising the quarantine as soon as is reasonably practical. It is illegal for a person to remove or dispose of a carcase of a captive bird which dies in quarantine, unless a veterinary inspector has authorised its removal or disposal. Quarantine approval will be revoked if requirements are not met.</p>

	<p pid="c.183.3/4">Diversity statistics are published annually in the Civil Service Statistics report on the Cabinet Office website.

For example, in April 2005, the disability status of 26 per cent of staff was unknown. Non-response particularly affects those moving between departments. Therefore, the statistics on disability should be interpreted with some caution, particularly year-on-year changes.</p>
