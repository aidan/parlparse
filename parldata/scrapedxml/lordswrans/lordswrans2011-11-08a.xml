The Government are putting this into action through the joint Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and HM Treasury consumer credit and personal insolvency review. In July 2011, the Government published a summary of responses to the call for evidence to the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/2">The call for evidence found that there have been significant developments in the market in recent years. As part of the Office of Fair Trading's work, banks have committed to introduce measures to improve the transparency of unarranged overdraft charges and many have also revised their charging structures in the past two years. This has already led to some reductions-the average unpaid item charge has fallen by more than half from &#163;35 in 2007 to &#163;14 in 2010. However, responses to the call for evidence showed that there are still serious concerns about how charges-including the new charging structures-affect consumers, particularly where charges may be not be clear or transparent enough.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.5/1">Ultimately it is for industry to propose what type of fuel to use in any future nuclear reactors, the designs of which would be subject to independent regulatory assessment and acceptance. To date, no potential operator has put forward proposals for a thorium-fuelled plant in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/2">That said, the department is aware of the potential of thorium-fuelled nuclear reactor designs and is in the process of assessing claims regarding its suitability as an alternative to uranium based reactors in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/3">The current view of thorium reactor technologies from the nuclear industry is that, whilst the science is reasonably sound, developing reactors based on a thorium fuel cycle would carry major technological and commercial risks. The resources required to develop these technologies to the point at which they might be deployed successfully at a commercial scale are also very significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/4">To date, both in the UK and elsewhere in the world, this has prevented private industry and government from investing significantly in the development of the technology. No thorium reactor design has been implemented beyond relatively small, experimental systems, whilst many either only exist on paper or have only had specific subsystems demonstrated.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/5">As an indicator of the challenge of taking this technology further, the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates that a development period of at least 20 years will be required before a demonstration thorium molten-salt breeder reactor might be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.5/6">While thorium does not appear to have a part to play in the UK's near to mid-term energy market, we do maintain an interest in its development. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has asked the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) to look further into the wider benefits of next-generation reactor designs and to compare the use of thorium and uranium fuels in them. We are expecting the findings to be available in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/1">The House of Lords EU Economic and Financial Affairs and International Trade Sub-Committee's published a report in July entitled <I>Sovereign Credit Ratings: Shooting the Messenger?</I>. The report concluded that the proposal of credit ratings being suspended for countries receiving international financial assistance was inappropriate and impractical and implied censorship.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/2">Further details can be found on the following website: <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-economic-and-financial-affairs-and-international-trade-sub-committee-a/inquiries/credit-rating-agencies-and-eu-sovereign-debt/">http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-economic-and-financial-affairs-and-international-trade-sub-committee-a/inquiries/credit-rating-agencies-and-eu-sovereign-debt/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/3">The Government agreed with the report's assessment. In particular, temporarily suspending ratings for certain sovereigns would only reduce information in financial markets, exacerbate uncertainty and possibly lead to further contagion. In the absence of such ratings, it is likely that unregulated shadow ratings of these countries would emerge in any case.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/4">More generally, the Government support additional international reform initiatives of the credit rating agency industry and has set out its priorities in the response to the Commission's consultation, which can be found online at this link: https://circabc.europa.eu/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/0d1ea101-b6d0-470b-b8b3-e28e4c1cba30/BoE-FSA-Treasury_EN.pdf.</p>

The delivery plans were developed following consultations with a broad range of stakeholders, including business and senior academics, and agreed with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).

Council membership is drawn from the council's academic, business and user communities. Membership is balanced to provide expertise across a range of research disciplines and commercial and user interests. In addition, research councils have their own structure of advisory boards and groups to identify opportunities for research, training and knowledge transfer and to provide external advice on the development of strategies and policies.</p>
