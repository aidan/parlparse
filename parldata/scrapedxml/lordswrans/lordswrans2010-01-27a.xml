	<p pid="a.324.5/1">Changes in the number of farmers and dairy cows are just two elements of the structural changes that have taken place in the sector. The long-term trend in dairy production is towards fewer, larger and more productive herds. The table below provides the fuller picture on the structural changes in the sector and shows how the decline in the number of dairy farms and farmers has been offset by an increase in average herd size and milk yields.</p>

This reflects a rise in the average number of farmers per farm over the period as the average farm size has increased.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.5/1">Under the EU banking consolidation directive, firms with permission in their home EEA states to perform deposit-taking activities may establish branches in the UK. However, in order to exercise this passport right, a firm must have satisfied the conditions set out in Schedule 3 to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. These conditions include the requirement for the FSA to have received a consent notice from the firm's home regulator that it has given consent for the firm to establish a branch in the UK. Landsbanki satisfied these conditions and exercised its passport right to establish a branch in the UK, where it carried on deposit-taking business.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/2">The EC deposit guarantee schemes directive (94/19/EC) sets the minimum terms on which depositors are protected throughout the European Union and European Economic Area (EEA). All EEA member states are required to ensure that the deposit guarantee schemes directive is adequately implemented in their territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/3">Under the directive, depositors at branches in a host state are covered by the guarantee scheme of the home state. Depositors with the UK branch of Landsbanki were therefore eligible for compensation (for deposits up to &#8364;20,887) from Iceland's Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund (DIGF).</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/4">Where a bank's home state scheme provides a lower limit of compensation than the UK FSCS, or the scope of protection is less than the FSCS's, the bank may choose to join the FSCS to top up the level of protection offered by the home state scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/5">Landsbanki chose to exercise this top-up option, meaning that depositors with the UK branch are protected to the FSCS limit per depositor and therefore may claim from the FSCS for the amount of their deposits above the DIGF limit to &#163;50,000 (the FSCS limit).</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/6">Landsbanki, the Icelandic bank, is authorised and regulated by the financial services regulator in Iceland. Landsbanki's UK branch is subject to limited regulation by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA).</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October 2008</phrase> the FSA announced that the UK branch of Landsbanki was in default for the purposes of the FSCS. The Chancellor announced that all retail depositors with the UK branch of Landsbanki would receive their money in full. The Government's objectives in taking action in relation to the UK branch of Landsbanki were to maintain financial stability and to minimise the exposure of, and costs to, taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/8">In total, around &#163;4.5 billion has been paid. It is estimated that this includes &#163;2.35 billion compensation that the UK Government paid out to depositors on behalf of the Iceland Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund (DIGF), &#163;1.4 billion paid out by the FSCS for deposits above &#8364;20,887 and below &#163;50,000, and &#163;800 million paid out by the UK Government in respect of deposits above &#163;50,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/9">In guaranteeing UK retail depositors of the Icelandic banks, the Treasury acted under its common law powers. The statutory authority for the Treasury to incur this expenditure was provided by Section 228 of the Banking Act 2009 (retrospectively).</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/10">We expect that the FSCS and HM Treasury will make significant recoveries of the compensation paid to depositors through the winding up of Landsbanki. In relation to the compensation paid out on behalf of the DIGF, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-05">5 June 2009</phrase>, the UK Government reached agreement with the Icelandic authorities on a process to ensure the UK is refunded. The terms of the loan arrangements are set out in my letter to the House of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-13">13 January</phrase> (<I>WA 154</I>). They include a state guarantee which, under Icelandic law, must be authorised by the Icelandic Parliament in order to take effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.5/11">A Bill was passed in August to this effect but with a number of conditions introduced by the Icelandic Parliament. Following further negotiations, the loan agreement was amended to take account of these conditions. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-30">30 December</phrase>, the Parliament in Iceland endorsed the loan arrangement and agreed a state guarantee. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-05">5 January 2010</phrase> the Icelandic President announced that he would not sign the Bill that the Parliament had approved, and instead proposed a referendum.

	<p pid="a.332.3/1">All suspicious activity reports received by the Serious Organised Crime Agency are recorded on the Elmer database. SOCA does not take steps to establish whether an unknown or anonymous reporter's suspicions are unfounded before the information is recorded on Elmer. A SAR can be used in combination with other sources of intelligence to contribute towards a particular law enforcement investigation. If a SAR had been submitted maliciously, this fact would become apparent in the course of an investigation, when the information was cross-checked with other forms of intelligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.3/2">In these circumstances, and where a SAR is submitted electronically, the relevant local enforcement agency can attach an appropriate flag to the SAR to indicate no further action. Procedures on the handling of SARs may be revised depending on the outcome and recommendations of the forthcoming Information Commissioner's review.</p>

	<p pid="a.335.0/1">The Government have taken decisive steps to strengthen existing provision and put in place new support to reduce the proportion of young people who are not in education, employment or training. In December 2009, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions jointly published <I>Investing in Potential</I>, our strategy to increase the proportion of 16-24 year-olds in education, employment or training.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/2">Through the September guarantee, we offer all 16 and 17 year-olds a suitable place in learning. In 2009, almost 96 per cent of 16 year-olds and almost 90 per cent of 17 year-olds said that they wanted to continue in learning and received a suitable offer through the guarantee. We are building on this with a January guarantee in 2010, which will offer all 16 and 17 year- olds who are not in education, employment or training this month a place in entry-to-employment provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/3">We will invest a total of &#163;8.2 billion in 2010-11 to fund learning for 1.6 million young people, the highest ever number of young people participating in education and training in our country's history, and we will increase 16-19 funding by 0.9 per cent in real terms in 2011-12 and 2012-13 to continue our commitment to the September guarantee. We are also investing more than &#163;650 million in 2009-10 in financial support for 16-18 year-olds, including education maintenance allowance, care to learn and discretionary learner support funds, to help young people overcome financial barriers to participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/4">Through our 14-19 reform programme, we are transforming the range of qualifications on offer to ensure that there are options available to suit every young person's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/5">Apprenticeships are one of these key routes and we are creating an additional 35,000 apprenticeship places in 2009-10, including 21,000 in the public sector. By March 2010, the National Apprenticeship Service will provide 5,000 subsidies to employers to support them to take on 16 and 17 year-olds as apprentices.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/6">The young person's guarantee will ensure that 18-24 year-olds still unemployed after six months will be guaranteed access to a job, training or work experience. This will be supported by more time with their personal adviser.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/7">We are widening participation in higher education to ensure that all those with the potential and merit to benefit are able and willing to do so. We have created the Graduate Talent Pool, which has offered over 12,000 vacancies for graduate internships since its launch at the end of July 2009. For those new graduates who cannot find work, the graduate guarantee ensures that those still unemployed at six months will have access to an internship, training or help to become self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/8">Together, these measures represent a clear and substantial offer of support that will continue to prevent young people becoming NEETs and help those who are not in education, employment or training to re-engage.</p>

The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) recommends that trans fats should contribute no more than 2 per cent. of food energy.

	<p pid="a.343.3/18">1. Government accounting policy changed in 2000-01; as a result, figures prior to 2000-01 are not strictly comparable to figures thereafter. Expenditure prior to 2000-01 represents the amounts paid between April to March for medicines and appliances and relate to prescriptions dispensed between March and February. This is due to the delay in prescription processing and payment calculations. From 2000-01, figures represent the actual cost of the prescriptions for medicines and appliances dispensed in the period April to March.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.3/19">2. Year-to-date primary care figures have been provided for 2009-10. We do not have HCHS figures, which are sourced from accounts information available at year-end only. Primary care drugs expenditure is approximately 70 per cent of total NHS drugs expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.3/20">3. Real-term calculation uses GDP deflator series at January 2010, 2008-09 = 100.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.3/21">Additionally, the department provides centrally purchased vaccines for the NHS routine childhood immunisation programme and catch up programmes, vaccines against anthrax, rabies, smallpox, and the swine influenza vaccination programme 2009-10. The department is not able to divulge expenditure on swine influenza vaccine as it would violate confidentiality clauses in the contracts with the manufacturers. The available information about the department's expenditure on vaccines for England (not including swine influenza vaccine) is given in Table 2 in cash and real terms (2008-09 base year).</p>

	<p pid="a.343.3/35">1. Where relevant, figures for England have been calculated as 84 per cent. of expenditure on vaccines for the United Kingdom. Childhood vaccines and smallpox vaccine are purchased for the UK. Anthrax and rabies vaccines are purchased for England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.3/36">2. Year-to-date figures to December 2009 have been supplied for 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.3/38">The vaccines provided for NHS programmes have changed over the period of time shown in the table. For example, the higher level of expenditure in 2008-09 partly reflects the addition of human papillomavirus vaccination against cervical cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.3/39">Information about vaccine expenditure in 1996-97 is not available. It has not been possible to confirm whether or not records of vaccine expenditure for 1996-97 have been retained centrally by the department and there is no obligation for such records of this age to be retained.</p>

	<p pid="a.344.2/50">1. Figures may not sum due to rounding</p>
	<p pid="a.344.2/51">2. Refers to expenditure from the central budget, data available only for 2006-07</p>
	<p pid="a.344.2/52">The expenditure on pharmaceuticals is included as its primary aim is prevention. Nevertheless, strictly, expenditure on pharmaceuticals is not included in the OECD prevention and public health category. Hence, for comparison with other countries using OECD data, these medication figures should be excluded. Excluding pharmaceuticals in line with OECD methodology gives a total expenditure on public health and prevention of &#163;3.7 billion. If pharmaceuticals were included, the overall total for 2006-07 would be &#163;5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.2/53">Total health expenditure for England for the same period was approximately &#163;93.5 billion. This suggests that about 4 per cent of health expenditure is directed towards prevention (using the figure without pharmaceuticals and without health-related expenditure, so that this can be compared with other OECD countries). This share indicates that England is above the average of other OECD countries, where prevention was only 2.8 per cent of total health spending in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.2/54">A decade ago, the share of total health spending going to prevention and public health stood at only 1.8 per cent in the United Kingdom, which was below the OECD average at that time.</p>

As well as their generalist teaching duties, mathematics specialist teachers work with colleagues to improve mathematics teaching across the school and increase pupil engagement, confidence and achievement in mathematics.

	<p pid="a.358.3/4">It was published in 2007 and set out a number of assumptions for planning purposes which gave a range of possible scenarios. These assumptions were for an influenza pandemic of any kind, including the potential for a human virus evolved from current avian flu.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/5">The department and Cabinet Office issued revised guidance to planners as information about the characteristics of swine flu became available. The assumptions were revised as more information became available and regular updates were issued to ensure United Kingdom planners were equipped with the most up-to-date information. We have been clear that the planning assumptions have never been a prediction of what would happen; they simply set out the reasonable worst-case scenario for planning purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/6">The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) was not involved in drawing up the figures given in the planning assumptions, which were based on the advice of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/7">The CMO has carried out a confidential investigation of swine flu-related deaths since the pandemic began. As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-21">21 January 2010</phrase>, there had been 279 swine flu-related deaths in England. Of these, approximately 20 per cent had no pre-existing diseases or underlying medical conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.359.2/1">The Department for International Development's (fID's) new three-year institutional strategy with UNICEF supports the implementation of UNICEF's own medium-term strategic plan. We want to support UNICEF's work for all vulnerable children including street children. UNICEF's plan includes work on the protection of children from violence, exploitation and abuse. This includes collecting and analysing data to improve understanding of the conditions of marginalised and vulnerable groups, and also work to ensure the views of children are captured in the policies and programmes that affect their lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.360.0/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) is committed to reducing child poverty and reaching particularly vulnerable groups of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/2">In developing our new institutional strategy with UNICEF, our concern was to support UNICEF's work for all vulnerable children, including street children. DfID does not have a specific policy focus on street children above other vulnerable children. Children usually live on the streets because of poverty in their communities and therefore our priority is reducing child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/3">Our approach is to draw on UN agencies' own targets and commitments wherever possible. UNICEF does not have a specific target in its strategic plan on street children. However, our UNICEF strategy target on vulnerable children provides an opportunity to raise street children in our policy discussions with UNICEF.</p>

	<p pid="a.360.3/1">Loss of the individual's right to opt-out of the 48-hour maximum working week (as set out in the working time directive) would cost billions in terms of lost pay to individuals, which is one reason why this Government would not support the end of the opt-out. Over 3 million employees choose to make use of this flexibility and we believe that it is right that they should be able to do so if they wish, provided the choice is voluntary.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.3/2">There is no Commission proposal to remove the opt-out.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.3/3">We have always accepted, however, that other issues on the directive remain since the negotiations failed, in particular the need to address two ECJ judgments on treatment of residential on-call time and compensatory rest that continue to cause problems for many member states. We would be happy to engage with new Commission ideas on those issues but our view on the opt-out has not changed.</p>
