	<p pid="b.109.2/1">Our understanding of people's need for independent advice draws on several areas of research. In 2006, the Legal Services Research Centre, the independent research arm of the Legal Services Commission (LSC), published the second edition of <I>Causes of Action: Civil Law and Social Justice</I>, which was the most in-depth study ever made of client experiences of civil law, including of the availability and value of advice . The study was funded by the LSC and the then Department for Constitutional Affairs, and followed on from earlier studies. A copy is available in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.2/2">The Government believe that although the successful application of their policies has acted to address the need for some types of advice, substantial need remains. <I>Causes of Action</I> demonstrates that people experiencing a cluster of inter-related problems are at particular risk of social exclusion, and the LSC and other public bodies are developing their strategies for advice provision to tackle this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.2/3">The Public Legal Education and Support Task Force also considered how to help people recognise when they may need support, what sort of advice is available, and how to go about getting it. The task force published its report <I>Developing Capable Citizens: the </I><I>R</I><I>ole of Public Legal Education</I> in July 2007. A copy has been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

The Department for Transport has led this work and has continued to draw on the airport operator's technical and operational expertise in regular meetings over the period.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.3/1">Spectrum management is a matter for Ofcom, subject to power of direction from Ministers. The Government have a clear policy of using market mechanisms to allocate spectrum as this is the best way of identifying the most valuable use to which it can be put, and Ofcom's proposal to auction the Digital Dividend spectrum accords with this. If a use of spectrum is deemed to have particularly high social value, it is in principle a matter for relevant stakeholders and their funding bodies to raise the necessary funds in order to access spectrum, if this is what they believe to be the best use of their resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.3/2">The threshold for government intervention in order to secure spectrum for any potential use is extremely high, as it would preclude other, potentially more valuable users from gaining access to valuable capacity.</p>

	<p pid="b.111.8/1">In July 2007, the Electoral Commission issued guidance to electoral registration officers about the 2007 annual canvass in which they recommended procedures to be followed should any type of election be called during this period, to ensure that all eligible electors are registered to vote. This guidance combined with the fact that eligible electors can now personally choose to register up to 11 days before polling day provides opportunities for all electors whose details have changed to be effectively registered. The Government are discussing with stakeholders whether it is necessary to simplify the administrative process of registering electors in the event of any election being called during the annual canvass period and before publication of the revised electoral register on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> each year.</p>

In this project, biomass waste such as sewage sludge is converted directly to bioethanol via gasification, producing (together with waste gases) hydrogen and syngas which, after cleaning, can be used as chemical building blocks of larger molecules such as ammonia, ethanol and methanol.

	<p pid="b.116.2/1">The initial stage of protecting development of new housing in areas prone to flooding is through the planning system and requires that planning applications are supported by a flood risk assessment. This assessment will need to show that the development is safe; that it does not increase flood risk elsewhere; and where possible that it reduces flood risk overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/2">Where the planning process determines that it is reasonable for the development to proceed there may be a case for using modified forms of construction to mitigate the effects of flooding. Information on this type of construction was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government in May this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/3">Infrastructure, particularly electrical substations, is classed as essential infrastructure in planning guidance; this is a key factor in developing risk assessments. At a local level drainage systems should also not increase the flood risk to the buildings they serve.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/4">Sir Michael Pitt is currently investigating the effects of the summer floods and any lessons that emerge from that review will be carefully considered and responded to appropriately. This will include consideration of the need to review building regulations to take greater account of flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/5">We continue to have constructive discussions with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) at both ministerial and official level to understand and monitor how the insurance industry is dealing with policyholders who have been hit by the floods. Ministers from Communities and Local Government, Treasury, Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform most recently met representatives from the ABI on <phrase class="date" code="">2 October</phrase> to discuss recovery from the summer floods.

	<p pid="b.121.5/1">The independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), announced on <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase> that it would carry out a full review of communications providers' additional charges.

	<p pid="b.121.5/2">The review covers charges for non-direct debit payments as well as other additional charges including late payment, restoration of service and early termination fees. It also covers fixed and mobile operators and pay TV services. Ofcom is looking at the nature and level of charges levied by communications providers and how well signposted and transparent such charges are. It is investigating how far consumers are aware of additional charges, whether they are able and willing to shop around on the basis of core prices and additional charges rather than just core prices, and whether there are certain groups of consumers who are unable to do this and therefore may be disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.5/3">On investigating this issue it became clear that it would be wrong to look at BT in isolation. More than 40 per cent of homes are provided with telephony services by operators other than BT, and the differentials for payment by non-direct debit range from no extra charge to &pound;15 a quarter.
