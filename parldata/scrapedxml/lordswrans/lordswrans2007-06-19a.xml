As the White Paper noted, ILO 169 was essentially an update of the 1957 ILO Convention 107. The White Paper explained that Convention 107 could not be applied in the UK as there were no indigenous, tribal or semi-tribal people there, and so had not been ratified by the UK. Copies of the 1989 White Paper are available in the Library of the House. We have therefore made no assessment of the role of British companies in Botswana in relation to Convention 169.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.5/1">Between 1976 and the early 1990s, the UK carried out a major geothermal research programme at a cost in excess of &pound;50 million. The key conclusions from the programme were that the UK is unlikely to see major developments based on geothermal aquifers or the hot dry rock (HDR) method due to a limited resource, poor economics and limited scope for their application. Unless the technical, practical and economic constraints identified under the previous geothermal programme can be addressed, the prospects for geothermal power in the UK would appear to be limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/2">More recently, interest has been growing in the use of ground source heat pumps. This technology can be applied to buildings of virtually any scale, including domestic dwellings. It relies on heat exchange with the ground immediately beneath or close to buildings. This technology is now increasing its profile in a growing microgeneration market.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/3">Both Defra and the DTI, in collaboration with the Heat Pump Association, have helped to establish the UK Heat Pump Network to develop a partnership between manufacturers, specialist advisers and user groups. This network will ensure that independent and authoritative advice is available on the application and use of heat pumps.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/4">The DTI's low-carbon buildings programme, with a &pound;86 million budget over three years, provides support for a range of microgeneration technologies, including ground source heat pumps.

	<p pid="a.39.2/4">The draft Bill introduces a regulation-making power in new Section 3ZA(5) of the amended Act, which, if exercised, will allow an embryo that has had applied to it a process in circumstances prescribed by regulations designed to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial disease to be included within the category of &quot;permitted&quot; embryos. Regulations to allow this would be subject to affirmative resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/5">While retaining the ban on reproductive cloning by specifying only those embryos that can be placed in a woman, the draft Bill removes the prohibition on replacing the nucleus of a cell of an embryo with a nucleus of any person or embryo, or subsequent development of an embryo for research purposes only. Licences for the purposes of a project of research involving human embryos cannot authorise any activity unless it appears to the regulator to be necessary or desirable for one or more of the purposes specified in the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/6">In 2005, the department undertook a public consultation on the review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. Responses were received from stakeholders including members of the scientific community and professional bodies. Among those that supported the removal of the prohibition on &quot;replacing the cell of an embryo with the nucleus from a cell of any person&quot; for research purposes only were the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Association of Clinical Embryologists. These groups are not directly involved in cell nuclear replacement research but members represented by those groups could be.</p>

In parallel, the draft regulation was put before the scrutiny committees of both Houses and was subsequently cleared by both.

	<p pid="a.43.2/2">The origins of the international roaming mobile phone prices regulation are a sector inquiry carried out by the European Commission in 2000, which found that prices were unreasonably high. Despite a series of warnings by the Commission, the mobile network operators did not address the issue. The European telecommunications regulators group, of which Ofcom is a member, asked the European Commission to address this matter on a European level, as it felt that national Administrations would not be able to do so effectively as a result of the trans-border nature of the roaming market. As a result, after two rounds of consultation with stakeholders, including HMG, the Commission issued a draft regulation. The regulation, which was based on Article 95 of the treaty, was granted political approval last week at the Telecoms Council (at which the UK was represented by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Industry and the Regions) and is expected to come into effect by the end of June.</p>
