The ABI was preceded (prior to 1998) by the annual employment survey (AES) but this survey was carried out on a different basis and so comparisons are very difficult to make. Therefore the earliest year for which comparable data is available is 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.5/2">The publication of these monitors is the first stage in publishing accessible information on police performance. They will evolve to reflect the Policing Performance Assessment Framework (PPAF) currently under development. This is intended to capture the breadth and scope of police activity. The development of PPAF has the support of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/3">The initial monitors omit some key areas of activity such as serious crime and some violent crime and so provide a limited basis on which to compare the overall performance of forces. Nonetheless, they represent a significant improvement in the accessibility of police performance data. They will enable the public to compare the performance of their force with that of those forces most similar to it. The monitors cannot, however, be used to construct national league tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.8/1">A &pound;441 million contract has been placed with BAE Systems Electronics Ltd, Underwater Systems Division, for the manufacture of the modified Sting Ray lightweight torpedo, which will enhance the capability provided by the existing weapon system. The in-service variant of Sting Ray has been the main anti-submarine weapon carried by our surface ships and aircraft since 1983. While it continues to meet its design aims, the threat of a new generation of more advanced submarines, operating in both deep and coastal waters with ever more sophisticated counter-measures, requires an enhanced capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.8/2">The modified Sting Ray torpedo will make best use of advancing technologies and will significantly enhance the capability and maintainability of the weapon system. It will combine the essential attributes of high speed and manoeuvrability, deep diving, low radiated noise, advance computer based intelligence and high warhead lethality. It will provide the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force with the world's most advanced lightweight torpedo from its planned in-service date of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.8/3">The award of this contract to BAE Systems is excellent news for both our Armed Forces and the defence industry. It will sustain approximately 300 jobs across the UK. This is the culmination of work conducted by both the MoD and industry and is a good example of the principles of smart acquisition being put into practice to give our Armed Forces the equipment they need at an affordable price.</p>

An automatic condition of all registrations is that reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that any wild mammal which is shot during the course of registered hunting must be shot by a competent marksman. Competence is a matter to be determined on the facts of each individual case and will reflect the appropriateness of the experience, skill and qualifications of the marksman to the difficulty of the shooting being carried out. As that difficulty will vary depending on which species is being hunted and as a result of local factors, the Bill does not prescribe a single standard or provide a definition of what is competent.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.5/2">The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews holds a unique position in the world game. Over the last two centuries it has evolved as the leading authority in the world game, and golf clubs throughout Britain have looked to it for guidance. The club currently has responsibility for the administration of the rules of golf in conjuction with the United States Golf Association; the running of the Open Championships; the development of the game in existing and emerging golfing nations and the operation of a private club with almost 2,400 members.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.2/1">As part of its consideration of the Licensing Bill, the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform recommended that a mechanism be devised to enable Parliament to debate the guidance which it is intended would be issued to licensing authorities under Clause 177 of the Licensing Bill. The guidance is a crucial mechanism for enabling the Government to promote consistency and best practice and to respond to developments which may arise from time to time in connection with the sale of alcohol or the provision of regulated entertainment and late night refreshment. The Bill is scheduled to begin its Report stage in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-24">24 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/2">At Committee stage in the House of Lords, the Government undertook to provide an opportunity for an early draft of the guidance to be available in time for the Bill's Report stage in the House of Lords. To meet our undertaking, I am today publishing a rough draft of the guidance, which has been placed in the Library of the House. This has involved advancing the timetable for producing the draft guidance considerably and the production of a rough draft in quicker time than we would have preferred.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/3">I wish to make it clear that the draft's current form is subject to change and further development following continuing consultation with stakeholders and other government departments and agencies; to take account of any further undertakings given by Ministers during the Bill's forthcoming parliamentary stages; and of course, to reflect any amendments made to the Bill itself. There will also be a further opportunity for each House to debate the guidance when it is in its completed form later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/4">The text of the guidance document can also be found at <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/new-responsibilities/guidance-section177-licensing.pdf">http://www.culture.gov.uk/new&ndash;responsibilities/guidance&ndash;section177&ndash;licensing.pdf</a></p>
