	<p pid="a.67.8/1">We have already made significant progress in reducing domestic burglary.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/2">The British Crime Survey gives the best available measure of the amount of crime actually affecting the public, regardless of changes in reporting or recording levels. According to the latest figures, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-09">9 January</phrase>, burglary is down 39 per cent compared to 1997 and has reduced slightly over the past 18 months (though the level of reduction is not statistically significant).</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/3">We have a comprehensive strategy to drive burglary down further. In addition to several programmes of work that will affect a range of crimes&mdash;including Narrowing the Justice Gap, reducing re-offending and our anti-drugs strategy&mdash;we have a number of initiatives targeted more specifically at domestic burglary.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/4">Minimum sentences for third time burglary convictions were introduced in December 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/5">All police authorities have agreed targets for reducing domestic burglary by 2005. Performance against these targets will be assessed under the performance monitoring arrangements set out in the National Policing Plan. These arrangements will inform the work of our Police Standards Unit, which is working with police forces to help them meet these targets, through, for example, developing and sharing best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/6">Under the Reducing Burglary Initiative (part of our Crime Reduction Programme) which ran from 1999 to 2002, we funded 250 local anti-burglary projects. The overall impact of this initiative is still being evaluated, but some lessons about what worked most cost-effectively have already been learnt and are being disseminated to the crime and disorder reduction partnerships. These will inform plans for further local projects funded from other funding streams, including our Safer Communities Initiative, Communities Against Drugs, the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund and New Deal for Communities (we estimate that around 20 per cent of the funding available under these last two schemes is used to tackle crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/7">Over 80 per cent of the latest strategies developed by the crime and disorder reduction partnerships include burglary; and many of the local public service agreements being negotiated between central government and local authorities include a target for burglary reduction that stretches performance beyond what would be expected anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/8">We are pursuing a number of options for providing home security advice to the public, especially those at greatest risk of being victimised&mdash;for example, we will be launching later this month a website containing crime prevention advice tailored specifically for students.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/9">Those living in rented accomodation and houses in multiple occupancy are also at high risk and we are discussing with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister what more can be done to improve security standards in such properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.8/10">We are also considering with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) what can be done to ensure adequate standards of security in new homes and those formed by conversion of other buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.2/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary and I recognise the detrimental impact that theft from shops has on the retail industry and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">The Home Office continues to support the development of retail crime partnerships, helping them build on the good work they have already done in combating shop theft. These partnerships share information on known offenders, are normally linked by communication systems and typically run schemes to exclude known shop thieves from their stores. The Home Office employed a consultant for a period of two years to work with the British Retail Consortium, helping it set up retail crime partnerships and providing a comprehensive guide about how to set up and run such a partnership. We are encouraging retail crime partnerships to work with local crime and disorder reduction partnerships and to involve other businesses in the locality so as to maximise their impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">We are also aware that theft from shops can have a particularly detrimental impact on the communities and small retail businesses in our most deprived areas. That is why the Government have allocated &pound;15 million over the financial years 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 to improve the security of small retail businesses in deprived areas. The funding can be used for a wide variety of security measures such as CCTV, locks and alarms for individual businesses; or to pay for measures which will improve the security of a group of shops, such as a radio link scheme; or to improve the immediate environment of a shopping area in order to reduce the opportunities for crime. Nearly 3,000 shops benefited from the first year's funding and a further 4,500 individual shops and businesses will benefit directly from the &pound;6 million made available in this the second year of the scheme. A further &pound;6 million will be available next year to enable more shopkeepers to benefit from extra security.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/4">The Home Office has also produced a user friendly guide to help retailers combat theft and other crime problems they encounter. This guide was prepared in conjunction with the main retail trade organisations and has been widely circulated to retailers. The guide is available on the crime reduction website at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/business22.htm">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/business22.htm</a> and through police community safety officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/5">Many of the Government's crime reduction initiatives, such as the CCTV initiative, focus on town centres and community shopping areas.The nearly 700 schemes approved under the CCTV initiative will have a beneficial impact on theft from shops in the areas they cover.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/6">Theft from shops is one important element of crime problems that affect the business community, and crimes against business contribute significantly to the crime problems which face society. That is why my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety launched a consultation process in December 2002 to seek the views of all business organisations, including those operating in the retail sector, on the best means of creating and maintaining effective partnerships to reduce the opportunities for crime against business and to enhance the contribution that business can make to crime reduction overall. A dedicated team is also being set up within the Home Office specifically to act as a focus for efforts to tackle business-related crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">The Prison Service has appointed heads of learning and skills in young offender institutions (YOI) holding juvenile prisoners with funding from the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales. The heads are responsible for implementing the board's national specification for learning and skills and for planning and managing learning and skills provision for juveniles held in YOIs.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/2">We are increasing investment in prison education and training, raising core funding to &pound;85 million in 2003&ndash;04, &pound;110 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;125 million in 2005&ndash;06. Prisoners aged 18 to 21 are an early priority for this additional investment which aims to deliver a programme of learning from their induction through to their resettlement. We are currently considering the potential for extending heads of learning and skills posts across the prison estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/3">The Government are also investing an additional &pound;14.5 million a year from April 2003 in the Prison Service Custody to Work initiative to increase the number of prisoners getting jobs or education or training places after release.

	<p pid="a.71.3/1">The Government have today published their reply to the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on animals in scientific procedures published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-24">24 July 2002</phrase>. Copies of the Government's response (Cm 5729) have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/2">The Government welcome the Select Committee's report, which deals with important and sensitive issues concerning the use of animals in scientific procedures. The Select Committee's report is comprehensive, makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate and provides a credible basis for all concerned to consider where we should be going from here.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/3">The Government note in particular, and endorse the Select Committee's finding, that animal experiments are currently necessary to develop human and veterinary medicines and to protect humans and the environment. We also welcome the Select Committee's recognition of the progress that has been made since 1987 in reducing the number of animals used in scientific procedures and in establishing a culture of care in establishments designated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which is widely regarded as the most rigorous piece of legislation of its type in the world. The Government also accept that more needs to be done and we reconfirm our commitment to the fullest possible application of the 3Rs&mdash;the refinement of scientific procedures, the reduction in numbers of animals used and their replacement wherever possible. We also agree that the case put forward by the Select Committee for a United Kingdom centre for the 3Rs focused largely, but not exclusively, on toxicity testing, as a complement to other initiatives in this area, is worth exploring further. At the same time, we remain firmly of the view that the development of the 3Rs must continue to be an integral part of mainstream research programmes and toxicity work and should not be seen as a separate activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/4">The Government also note the Select Committee's view that the United Kingdom should aim to have the best regulation of animal procedures, properly enforced, rather than the tightest regulation. The Government already strive for the most efficient and effective regulation. However, we believe that it is right that the 1986 Act imposes stringent criteria to be satisfied before licence authorities are granted. We further believe that this approach is essential to generate and maintain public confidence in the regulatory system. At the same time, we accept that the administrative burden must be kept to a minimum, without compromising the welfare of the animals used. We will revisit this matter with the research community, with a view to the production of a revised application form/licence that all concerned accept is as simple and short as it can possibly be to meet statutory requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/5">The Government also share the Select Committee's view that there is a need for more open and better informed debate about the use of animals in scientific procedures. Government departments, industry, the scientific community and funders of such research all have an important role in explaining their legitimate use. We also believe that more good quality information should be made available to the public explaining the scientific work that is done using animals and the reasons for it. Subject to safeguards for personal and confidential information, we are, therefore, proposing to publish summaries of project licences as part of the Home Office publication scheme. However, we are conscious that there remains a significant level of concern in the scientific community about the implications of repealing Section 24 of the 1986 Act, as the Select Committee recommends. We, therefore, intend to consult further with the scientific community before reaching final decisions on its future.</p>

Over 50 nations and representatives of international organisations and NGOs attended. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development addressed the delegates.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/2">The meeting was an initiative of the Government's Global Conflict Prevention Pool. The Government's objective was to build on and develop consensus between small arms exporting nations, whether producers or stock-holders, on the need for effective export controls and controls on arms brokers. These were sensitive issues that the Government considered would benefit from further work following the UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/3">Recognising the central role for the UN, the meeting discussed ways of taking forward work on international agreement to control the activities of arms brokers. There was also general agreement on the need for effective export controls on small arms.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/4">The UK will report the outcome of the meeting to the United Nations biennial review meeting in July 2003 and follow up on the common ground established at Lancaster House.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/5">The meeting demonstrates the strength of the international consensus to implement more effective controls on small arms exports and brokers. All who attended saw the meeting as a useful initiative to take forward key elements in the international effort to control the spread of small arms, a major factor in instability and conflict, particularly in Africa and in human rights abuses and crime world-wide.</p>

The review team has considered the responses to the public consultation exercise which concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-18">18 November</phrase> and produced an addendum to its report which has been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.6/3">The Government broadly accept the general tenor of the review team's analysis and recommendations. There is a clear need for skilled and strategic horticultural science to underpin our policies and industry needs. HRI is a substantial asset of horticultural science excellence.

	<p pid="a.75.6/4">Defra will now enter into detailed discussions with HRI and other parties, in particular the University of Warwick and the East Malling Trust for Horticultural Research, to establish whether the scenarios recommended by the review team are achievable and affordable and whether any further government investment is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.6/5">We hope to reach detailed decisions in principle about the future of HRI by the end of March 2003. Matters for consideration will include the remit and research capacity of the successor arrangements; ownership of land and buildings; staffing and pension matters; and income sources. Subject to satisfactory negotiations, the plan would be to put in place the new arrangements for HRI's future by <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.6/6">In the meantime, HRI will continue as currently constituted.

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">The Green Paper Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement (Cm 5677) sets out a number of proposals that are designed to make the voluntary system of pensions provision in the UK work effectively. It is important that progress is closely and independently monitored so that we can be sure that employers and individuals are rising to the challenge. We will need good information so that we can assess if sufficient progress is being made and whether the Government need to take action. That is why an independent commission has been established.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2">The terms of reference for the commission, as set out in the Green Paper, are:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/3" class="indent">To keep under review the regime for UK private pensions and long-term savings, taking into account the proposals in the Green Paper, assessing the information needed to monitor progress and looking in particular at current and projected trends in:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/4">the level of occupational pension provision:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/5">trends in employer and employee contributions;</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/6">trends in coverage of occupational pensions;</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/9">contributions to stakeholder and personal pensions; and the level of other saving;</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/10">financial assets, for example Individual Savings Accounts, housing, businesses, savings, and other assets of partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/11">On the basis of this assessment of how effectively the current voluntarist approach is developing over time, to make recommendations to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on whether there is a case for moving beyond the current voluntarist approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/12">Adair Turner has been appointed as chair of the commission. The other two members are Jeannie Drake and Professor John Hills.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/13">Adair Turner is currently vice-chairman of Merrill Lynch Holdings Ltd, a director of United Business Media plc and chair of the Low Pay Commission. Jeannie Drake is the deputy general secretary for the Communications Workers Union and is also a commissioner of the Equal Opportunities Commission. Professor John Hills is director of the Economic and Social Research Council Research Centre for Social Exclusion at the London School of Economics.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/14">The commission is being established as an ad-hoc advisory group and a formal appointments process is therefore not necessary. However, the members of the commission have the high calibre expertise and breadth of experience which are vital to its independent role.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/15">We are in the process of finalising arrangements in consultation with the members of the commission and will announce further details, including the timescale on which the commission will report, in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.5/2">It is estimated that smoking causes 120,000 deaths in the UK each year. (Source: The UK Smoking Epidemic: Deaths in 1995, Health Education Authority). Comparable figures are not available for other years.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.5/3">The Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) in its 1998 report concluded that, &quot;exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of lung cancer and, in those with long term exposure, the increased risk is in the order of 20-30 per cent&quot;. The committee repeated the explanation of this risk set out in the Fourth Report of the Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health, ie, &quot;a 20-30 per cent increased risk in exposed non-smokers would be a rate of 12-13 per 100,000 per year. Thus we would expect an additional two to three lung cancer cases a year per 100,000 non-smokers regularly exposed to ETS. The numbers of people so exposed are not known precisely but an estimate would suggest about several hundred extra lung cancer deaths a year are caused by exposure to passive smoking.</p>

Irradiation can cause serious physical deterioration of materials, particularly those subjected to a previous sterilization process. Advice received from the Microbiological Advisory Committee is that, because of issues around the validation of the process and the routine monitoring required for small batches of product, as well as the effect of radiation on the materials concerned, irradiation is not suited to health service use.</p>
