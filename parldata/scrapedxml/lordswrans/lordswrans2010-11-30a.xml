	<p pid="a.427.2/1">The UK's instrument of ratification of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety has not been extended to the Cayman Islands. As such, the provisions of the protocol regarding the transboundary movement of genetically modified (GM) organisms are not applicable to the shipment of GM mosquitoes from the UK to the Cayman Islands, a non-party. Overseas territories are encouraged to become party to the UK's ratification of multilateral environmental agreements, but ultimately this is a matter for them to decide.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.2/2">However, the shipment of the GM mosquito eggs from the UK was subject to the requirements of Regulation (EC) 1946/2003, chapter II of which imposes an obligation on exporters to notify their first intended transboundary movement of a GM organism to the relevant authority in the importing country, whether that country is a party or a non-party to the protocol, and to await its consent to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.427.2/3">The decision to allow the GM mosquito field trials in the Cayman Islands was not subject to the EU legislation on the deliberate release of GM organisms, because it does not apply to UK overseas territories. And the Cartagena Protocol does not govern the release of GM organisms into the environment, only their transboundary movement. The Cayman Islands have their own legislation which required the Mosquito Control and Research Unit to obtain a permit from the local Department of Agriculture to carry out the trials, and as part of this process a risk analysis and an environmental impact assessment were carried out.</p>

	<p pid="a.428.5/1">We estimate that in 2008 UK forest land removed from the atmosphere the equivalent of about 15.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide compared with about 13.8 million tonnes in 1990. These numbers include carbon stored in wood products from harvest, and are equivalent respectively to about 2.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in the same years.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.5/2">The Read report commissioned by the Forestry Commission GB suggests that if woodland cover was to increase from 12 per cent to 16 per cent of land cover, abatement from woodlands planted since 1990 would, potentially, amount to 15Mt CO2 per year by the 2050s; this would be equivalent to 10 per cent of the UK's total GHGs emissions at that time, if current reduction targets are met. The abatement that could be achieved is highly sensitive to the level and timing of woodland creation and would be delivered through a combination of sequestration in forest biomass and wood products, renewable energy production and wood products displacing more carbon-intensive materials such as brick, steel and concrete.</p>

	<p pid="a.430.2/1">Of the 52 political prisoners the Cuban Government undertook to release in their announcement in July, 40 have now been released. The most recent prisoner released, Arnaldo Ramos Lauzurique, was the first to be able to remain in Cuba on parole (licencia extrapenal) without conditions. We understand that another of the group, Luis Enrique Ferrer, is due to be released in the coming days and to travel to Spain. The remaining 11 awaiting release want to stay in Cuba. In addition to these, 14 other prisoners not included in the list of 52 have been released and travelled to Spain, including the only other Cuban prisoner recognised by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience, Rolando Jimenez Posada.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/2">The UK and our EU partners continue to monitor the situation closely and remain in touch with the Cuban Government, the Cuban Catholic Church and the families of the prisoners. We will continue to encourage Cuba to fulfil its commitment to release these individuals and to allow released prisoners to remain in Cuba if they so wish.</p>

	<p pid="a.440.8/1">Rail demand has risen broadly in line with economic growth for the past 40 years or more. The current forecasting method, which has been developed by the industry since privatisation, takes data from ticket sales and evidence on the drivers of demand to provide projections of growth for individual routes. There is no evidence in these forecasts of saturation of demand. The forecasts for the London-West Midlands corridor show that crowding is likely to become increasingly acute over the next 20 to 30 years. High Speed Two would meet that demand by providing a significant uplift in capacity and by releasing capacity on existing lines for more commuter and regional services. At the same time it would generate new journeys and attract trips from other modes due in large part to the faster journey times it would provide.</p>

	<p pid="a.441.8/1">The Government have not made such a forecast. The Government recognise that some generalised property blight has been generated by the publication in March of this year of HS2 Ltd's proposed line of route, but the fluctuating nature of the property market and other influences on property values make the effects of blight very difficult to quantify accurately. Any forecast of the overall effect on property values in the vicinity of the proposed route could be inaccurate and potentially misleading, particularly as blighting effects often lessen over time as more certainty about a proposal and its impacts develops.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.8/2">However the Government are monitoring the effects of blight and have introduced the Exceptional Hardship Scheme to assist those most severely affected who urgently need to sell their property. The Government have also asked HS2 Ltd to do further work on both the effects of blight and the options for mitigating such effects, and intend to introduce additional support arrangements once a final decision on the route is made. This would help people whose property would not be covered by the statutory blight regime but may nevertheless suffer a significant diminution in value as a result of proximity of the line.</p>

	<p pid="a.445.0/1">Good access to appropriate toilet facilities and drinking water in schools is essential for the health and well-being of children and young people. A lack of either, or both, is likely to have an adverse impact on their learning, but we do not have good enough evidence to enable us to estimate that impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.0/2">Currently, requirements for toilets and drinking water for pupils and visitors in schools are contained in the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999. Those for teachers and other school staff are set out in the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992. The responsibility for ensuring that schools conform to the school premises regulations generally rests with local authorities, while responsibility for ensuring compliance with the workplace regulations sits with the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.0/3">Working closely with Partnerships for Schools, we are reviewing both sets of requirements, together with earlier recommendations to update the Education (School Premises) Regulations, so that we can establish a single set of standards applicable to all users of school buildings. We are also looking at how compliance will be ensured in the future, when there is one set of standards, and intend that the responsibility for this will be much clearer than it is now.</p>

	<p pid="a.447.6/2">In both cases we have encouraged the Ugandan authorities to ensure that any new legislation strikes an appropriate and legitimate balance between regulation and protection of the rights to freedom of expression and assembly.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-11-30a.448.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100308" speakername="Lord Howell of Guildford" colon=":" colnum="448"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101130w0001.htm#10113060000484">
	<p pid="a.448.5/1">The United Nations Security Council's open debate on women, peace and security provided an encouraging sign of broad support for UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325; over 90 member states spoke. Working with like-minded states, we secured a number of important outcomes. These included: a strong statement of support for UNSCR 1325 from the Security Council; commitment to action by many member states; and agreement to take forward the implementation of indicators to better measure global efforts to protect and empower women in conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.5/2">The key challenge following the debate is to ensure that the commitments made are now delivered. We intend to follow developments at the UN closely and to maintain the council's focus on this agenda, starting with the Secretary-General's report on sexual violence in armed conflict in December.</p>
