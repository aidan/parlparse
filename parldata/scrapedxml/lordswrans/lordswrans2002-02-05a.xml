	<p pid="a.77.2/1">At the Brussels Process ministerial meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-04">4 February</phrase> my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary and Spanish Foreign Minister, Josep Pique, continued to make good progress in our discussions about Gibraltar in the atmosphere of friendship and understanding which links the UK and Spain, reaffirming the full range of commitments that we assumed at our previous meetings in London and Barcelona.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2">Our common aim remains to conclude a comprehensive agreement before the summer, covering all outstanding issues, including co-operation and sovereignty.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/3">Both governments confirmed that their shared objective is to overcome their differences over Gibraltar and to ensure a secure future for Gibraltar in which Gibraltar can preserve its way of life and traditions, enjoy greater internal self-government, sustain and enhance its prosperity and reap the full benefits of a harmonious and mutually beneficial co-operation in all fields together with the wider region.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/4">We reiterate our invitation to the Chief Minister of Gibraltar to attend future Brussels Process meetings so that he, and through him the Gibraltarians, can join the current dialogue and contribute to it to the benefit of Gibraltar. We confirmed that the Chief Minister is warmly invited to participate on the basis of the Two Flags, Three Voices formula, having his own and distinct voice as part of the British delegation.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/5">Our intention is that the comprehensive agreement we seek will offer the best framework for a secure, stable and prosperous future for Gibraltar. In that framework, our objective is that Gibraltar can enjoy enhanced powers of internal self-government, allowing its government and population to have a greater say in their lives. We will invite the Government of Gibraltar to develop together with us the relevant ideas on this objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/6">We also took forward our work on all possible ways of enhancing co-operation to improve the quality of the daily lives of people in Gibraltar and the Campo region. The UK and Spain reaffirmed that the aim of the arrangements they seek is to promote the highest level of fruitful co-operation within the wider region, favouring better standards of living and working conditions in Gibraltar and the Campo and fluid communications with the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/7">The Spanish Government recalled the arrangements they had made to allocate a further 70,000 telephone numbers for Gibraltar and reaffirmed that, as regards the technical responsibilities of the Spanish side, they are operational. They expressed their commitment to ensure that no obstacles prevent their immediate use for the benefit of all Gibraltarians. To that end, the UK and Spain agreed to engage in immediate talks to assess the situation and attain their objective. Both Governments also tackled the issue of pensions, a problem on which they will intensify their efforts to find a prompt solution consistent with the responsibilities of the public authorities involved.</p>

For example, within a broadly &quot;rural&quot; county or district, not all parishes would be properly described as &quot;rural&quot;. However, we recognise that there is a need for a more co-ordinated and consistent approach to the categorisation and use of definitions of urban and rural areas. It is for that reason that Defra, DTLR, the Countryside Agency and the Office for National Statistics are working towards a better set of definitions for urban and rural areas. In the short term we plan to use for statistical purposes the definitions presently used by the Countryside Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">The Department of Health records how much the National Health Service spends on agency nurses but does not record how many agency nurses are employed or the amount that individual agency nurses are paid. The salaries of nurses working in the NHS are paid on a number of scales and are made up of an hourly rate and various allowances. The department has not made any assessment of days worked and cost per day of either category.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/2">In the year 1999&ndash;2000 the NHS spent &pound;361,656,683 on agency nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff. In the same period the NHS spent &pound;7,330,271,609 on directly employed nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/3">At <phrase class="date" code="1999-09-30">30 September 1999</phrase>, the whole time equivalent number of nurses working in the NHS was 338,582. Given that this figure is a snapshot and not an average across the whole year, it is not possible to derive a cost per day for nursing staff directly employed by the NHS.</p>
