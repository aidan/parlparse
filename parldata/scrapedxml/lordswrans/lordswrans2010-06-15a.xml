Before making any proposal, the Commission will need to satisfy itself that such a change would be consistent with the objectives of the food hygiene legislation and may require further information or ask the European Food Safety Authority to provide a risk assessment. Any proposal would then need to be approved by a committee of the member states before it could be adopted into law. The entire process of securing the necessary change may take one to two years. The FSA will do whatever it can to assist progress on this matter.</p>
