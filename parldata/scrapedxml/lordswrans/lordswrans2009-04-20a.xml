<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-04-20a.316.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100797" speakername="Baroness Morgan of Drefelin" colon=":" colnum="316"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90420w0004.htm#09042043000542">
	<p pid="a.316.2/1">The law provides that a child or young person who has the capacity to understand and make their own decisions may give (or refuse) consent to information sharing. This is presumed for young people to be aged 16 years and older unless there is evidence to the contrary. However, children aged 12 years or over may generally be expected to have sufficient understanding. Children under 12 years old may also be considered to have sufficient understanding. Where a practitioner has judged that a child does not have sufficient understanding to give or refuse consent, a person with parental responsibility should be asked to consent on behalf of the child. Practitioners use their professional judgment to determine whose consent should be sought. <I>Information Sharing: Guidance for Practitioners and Managers</I> sets out clearly the considerations that should be made when determining whose consent should be sought.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/2">All children in England will have a record on ContactPoint containing basic information until they reach the age of 18. When a child or young person accesses a sensitive service (services relating to sexual health, mental health and substance abuse) their explicit, informed consent (or that of a parent/carer if acting on their behalf) will be required to record contact details for this sensitive service on ContactPoint. A lack of consent to place sensitive service practitioner details on ContactPoint may be overridden in circumstances where there are genuine child protection concerns. Informed, explicit consent will be required for care leavers or those with learning difficulties to have their record remain on ContactPoint beyond the age of 18, up to the age of 25, to help facilitate the transition to adult services.</p>

	<p pid="a.317.2/1">Onset is an assessment and referral framework designed by the Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford, and was launched in August 2006. It identifies whether a child would benefit from early intervention in order to help prevent him or her offending. Onset also helps to ensure the effectiveness of the intervention in any given case by determining the risk factors that should be reduced and the protective factors that should be enhanced.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.2/2">In 2007-08, the first year for which complete data are available, local authorities' youth offending teams reported to the Youth Justice Board that 22,535 children started on diversion programmes, 12,168 of whom then had an Onset assessment. Data on the numbers of children who had an Onset assessment and who subsequently received a custodial sentence are not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.317.5/1">Onset profiles are stored on the electronic and paper record systems used by local authorities' youth offending teams. These systems can be accessed by the multi-agency staff working for youth offending teams, such as health workers, police officers, social workers, probation officers and housing officers. Access to and sharing of such information is subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998. The Youth Justice Board has issued guidance to youth offending teams on compliance with the Act and on effective record-keeping and information-sharing practice. The guidance also advises on the periods for which certain data should be retained. The length of time Onset data might be retained will depend on local authorities' own data retention policies and on issues such as whether the young person goes on to offend, the nature of the offence and the disposal applied.</p>

	<p pid="a.326.8/1">Clonazepam belongs to the class of medicines known as benzodiazepines. When benzodiazepines were introduced into the market in the United Kingdom there was not a formal system of medicines regulation. In 1971 after implementation of the Medicines Act 1968, all medicines were given a licence of right, and these licences were reviewed over time by the Committee on Review of Medicines (CRM) and granted a reviewed licence if they met the requirements of safety, efficacy and quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.8/2">Clonazepam, which is used for the treatment of epilepsy in infants, children and adults, was granted a product licence of right on <phrase class="date" code="1974-06-13">13 June 1974</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.8/3">As with all medicines authorised in the UK, the safety of clonazepam has been kept under close and continuous scrutiny by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using a wide variety of data sources. These include spontaneous adverse drug data from the UK and worldwide, clinical trials and epidemiological studies, worldwide published medical literature, data from the manufacturer and information from worldwide regulatory authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.8/4">The MHRA captures data on potential side effects associated with medicines through its Yellow Card scheme. Doctors, dentists, coroners, pharmacists, nurses and patients can report suspected side effects to the MHRA through the Yellow Card scheme. A total of 174 spontaneous case reports have been received detailing 382 reactions suspected to be associated with the use of clonazepam in the UK. The most commonly reported suspected adverse reactions include aggression (14 reports), somnolence (12), mania (9), ataxia (8) and epilepsy (8). All of these adverse reactions, or the symptoms commonly used to describe these conditions, are included in the product information for clonazepam.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.8/5">Information to aid the safe use of clonazepam is provided in the product information which consists of the summary of product characteristics for healthcare professionals and the patient information leaflet. These are available on the internet at emc.medicines.org.uk/searchresults.aspx?term=clonazepam&amp;searchtype=QuickSearch.</p>

However, should it be confirmed that the netsuke item is from elephant ivory, it will be seized by UKBA, and if appropriate, the case may be referred to the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office to consider prosecution action.</p>

We also support initiatives like the FTSE 100 cross company mentoring programme which is backed by 33 chairmen and CEOs who are crucial in getting women into directorships. We established the Ethnic Minority Employment Task Force, which is working to improve employment outcomes for ethnic minorities. It is working with employers, via representative bodies such as the CBI, to encourage greater diversity at senior levels in business. We are also taking measures in the Equality Bill to broaden the range of positive action measures that can be taken by employers or service providers to the full extent allowed by European law. In addition, the EHRC is conducting formal inquiries into the financial services sector and construction sector, as there is evidence that women and ethnic minorities are not fairly represented within these sectors. We will consider the results of these reviews carefully to see if further government action is needed.</p>

The offer did not mean that there was any new money being offered by the EC. It was simply an offer of more time for those projects that had slipped against the previously planned schedule or those that had capacity to continue spending to produce additional outputs. There was little additional flexibility and it would have been unlikely that any new projects could be commissioned that met the requirements of the programmes and delivered in the timeframe available. The European Commission recently offered us the opportunity to review this decision. We have done so carefully but there remains no advantage in England accepting this.</p>

	<p pid="a.337.3/1">The telephone survey conducted on behalf of South Central Strategic Health Authority (SHA) found 32 per cent of respondents in support, 38 per cent opposed and 19 per cent neither in support nor opposed. 23 per cent of respondents thought that fluoride was already added to their drinking water, while 69 per cent of respondents had little or no knowledge of fluoridation.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.3/2">Under Regulation 5 of the Water Fluoridation (Consultation) (England) Regulations 2005, SHAs are required to take account of the cogency of the arguments made during a consultation. In this context, South Central SHA sought an independent review of claims made during the consultation that fluoridation reduced the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children. The review concluded that &quot;the lack of a thorough consideration of confounding as a source of bias means that, from these studies alone, it is uncertain how far fluoride is responsible for any impairment in intellectual development seen. The amount of naturally occurring fluoride in drinking water and from other sources and the socioeconomic characteristics in the areas studied is different from the UK and so these studies do not have direct application to the local population of Southampton&quot;.</p>

Challenges under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Data Protection Act 1998 can arise under a wide range of causes of action including judicial reviews and applications to the Information Commissioner. It is, therefore, often not possible to distinguish cases based on the Data Protection Act or Human Rights Act without examining the case papers in detail. Each government department would be required to consider whether any challenge referred to one of the 46 databases and if either the Human Rights Act or Data Protection Act had allegedly been breached. Further, some of the databases listed in the report are not controlled by a government department so Her Majesty's Government may not be a respondent to proceedings about a particular database.</p>

	<p pid="a.353.3/1">The table shows the number of subject profiles held on the national DNA database (NDNAD) by forces in England and Wales as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>. The forces have been grouped by Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) region and a total figure has been given for each region.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.3/2">Information on the NDNAD is recorded and held on the basis of the police force which took the DNA sample. As address details are not recorded on the NDNAD, it is not possible to say how many people resident in any one area have profiles on the NDNAD. Profiles held by any one police force will include people who have been sampled by that force but are not resident within the force area, and will exclude people who are resident in that force area but have had their sample taken by another force.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.3/3">The number of subject profiles held on the NDNAD is not the same as the number of individuals with a profile on the database. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are a replicata. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded. The replication rate for the NDNAD as a whole is currently estimated at 13.5 per cent although the rate may vary between police forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.359.2/4">Additionally, the ODA works with the five host boroughs, local grass roots and business support organisations, such as East London Business Place and Supply London, to target minority ethnic owned businesses to tell them how they can get involved in Games-related business opportunities, including details of business support services available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/5">The Department for Business and Regulatory Reform (BERR) has run a series of 2012 business workshops across the country targeting BAME-owned businesses. In September 2008, representatives from 250 diverse businesses attended an event in London, which was aimed at dispelling the myth that only large businesses can benefit from 2012 opportunities. The workshop showed BAME-owned businesses how they can bid for Games-related contracts including signposting them to business support through Business Link. BERR is looking to run a similar event in late autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.2/6">There is also ongoing work by the ODA and its partners to ensure that local people benefit in terms of jobs and training. The London 2012 &quot;Jobs, Skills, Futures&quot; brokerage works in partnership with the contractors on the Olympic Park to identify all job vacancies that can be made available to local people. These are offered exclusively and equally to each of the five host borough (Newham, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Greenwich and Hackney) employment brokerages for a period of two days (48 hours). If no suitable candidates are put forward by the local employment brokerages, all vacancies are then made available throughout London (through Relay London jobs) for a further two days and after this time they are advertised nationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.8/45">Ethnicity and religious faith figures are based on self-reported information provided by prisoners. Annual numbers of self-inflicted deaths in custody are subject to random and cyclical swings. Falls or rises from one year to the next are not good indicators of underlying trends. This is particularly true with those ethnic groups and religious faiths where overall numbers are relatively small. A more reliable measure is the three-year rolling average. The three-year rate to the end of 2007 fell to 102 per 100,000 from a peak of about 136 per 100,000, (for the years ending September 2004).</p>

	<p pid="a.367.6/1">Postcomm, the postal market regulator, looks at Royal Mail's costs compared with other European universal service providers (USP) to inform ad hoc and periodical reviews of Royal Mail's operations&mdash;for example, for setting price controls. The reviews use commercially confidential cost data from Royal Mail Group and Letters and publicly available cost data from the annual reports of other USPs. The comparisons are usually not published due to their commercially sensitive nature for Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.6/2">Compared to some other European USPs, Royal Mail's operations model employs low capital and high labour resources. For instance, Royal Mail has labour costs of around 66 per cent of its revenues. This compares to the USPs of Germany and Italy with around 28 per cent and around 34 per cent labour costs respectively. In contrast, the operational models used by the USPs in France and Spain are more similar to Royal Mail with labour costs at around 65 per cent and 69 per cent respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.368.2/1">Charges for the use of radio spectrum are a matter for the Office of Communications (Ofcom) rather than government.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.2/2">The RNLI, like all other users of spectrum, already pays fees for its spectrum licences. As a charity with a &quot;safety of life in an emergency&quot; objective, the RNLI enjoys a 50 per cent discount on spectrum fees which it pays. It is liable to pay about &pound;40,000 per year (after discount).</p>
	<p pid="a.368.2/3">Ofcom has proposed that in future, fees for these maritime VHF channels should vary according to the type of use: for example, how powerful the transmission is and how much demand there is for radio channels in the particular locality, instead of being based only on administrative cost. This is the same approach as has been used for many years to charge for the use of spectrum by the Ministry of Defence, emergency services and commercial users. It is intended to help ensure that spectrum is used efficiently. Under these proposals, some current users (who use low power transmitters and/or are in areas of low demand) would pay less than they currently do now. Others (with high power transmitters and/or in areas of high demand) would pay more. Ofcom's initial proposals were for fees which would range from &pound;75 to &pound;1,480 per year for a radio channel at a transmitter site.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.2/4">However, Ofcom will also offer organisations that have a large number of transmitters around the country the option of taking out a licence that allows them to operate any number of transmitters across the UK. This arrangement acts effectively like a volume discount. It already operates well with spectrum licences granted in other sectors, and Ofcom believes it would be logical to apply the same rules to maritime licences. Ofcom expects that for widespread organisations like the RNLI this would be much cheaper than paying separate fees for each channel at each location, and could lead to a reduction in fees compared to now. Ofcom estimates that, based on the RNLI's usage, its fee under the new arrangements would be less than &pound;20,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.2/5">Ofcom expects to publish a second more detailed consultation on these proposals later this spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.369.2/3">The first generation shoreline management plan was completed in 1998. Since then, the coast has been carefully monitored to assess the amount of change taking place and any changes in the risk of coastal flooding. The policies for this stretch of coastline are currently under review in light of the latest climate change information, as part of the second generation of shoreline management plan development. This will help determine the longer term options for the coast in that location covering the next 100 years. The second generation plan is due to go out to consultation in the autumn this year.</p>

They will also have met the criteria by which we judge qualifications to meet priorities for public funding. It is right that the Tables should reflect these priorities.

	<p pid="a.377.2/1">Devolved Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) powers for wheel clamping, removal and disposal of unlicensed vehicles are available to police forces and local authorities under the Vehicle Excise Duty (Immobilisation, Removal and Disposal of Vehicles) Regulations 1997 (as amended). These enforcement powers are available, on application to DVLA, to police forces in both Northern Ireland and England.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.2/2">There are no powers in either Northern Ireland or England for the police to seize and dispose of a vehicle which has no valid MoT certificate.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.2/3">For vehicles being driven by a person without a valid driving licence in England, powers under the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) are available. Specifically, Section 165 of the Act provides powers for the police to wheel clamp, seize and dispose of vehicles being driven by an unlicensed driver. No such powers currently exist for police in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.3/1">The Environment Agency is currently consulting on the draft river basin management plans for England and Wales. In preparing the draft plans for consultation, the Environment Agency worked with many organisations, including environmental stakeholders, to ensure the consultation documents met the requirements of a wide range of audiences. The draft plans are designed to be relatively high-level strategic documents, but some audiences have sought much greater detail, particularly at the local level. While the draft plans have weighty annexes holding information more relevant to a technical audience, the draft plans themselves are limited to around 50 pages, and contain the information considered necessary to respond to the consultation questions. The Environment Agency has also made much of the information in the draft plans available on the part of their website called &quot;What's in Your Back Yard&quot;, which allows the public to view information in the draft plans as a set of interactive maps and tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.3/2">The Environment Agency continues to work with environmental stakeholders and others to improve the presentation and accessibility of the final river basin management plans. It is producing a series of short documents summarising the plans.

	<p pid="a.382.0/1">It is the long-standing position of the Government that Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories are unlawful under international law, as they contravene Article 49(6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. This position has also been taken by UN bodies, such as the UN Security Council, for example in UN Security Council Resolution 446 (1979), and by the International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of the Wall.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.0/2">We regularly discuss our concerns over illegal Israeli settlements with the US and our EU partners. We will continue to press the Israeli authorities to freeze settlement expansion and to negotiate a peace deal to bring the occupation to an end.</p>

	<p pid="a.382.3/1">One prisoner serving an indeterminate sentence for public protection at Aylesbury young offender institution has been assessed as suitable for the enhanced thinking skills course and is awaiting a place. He has not exceeded his tariff. Eight are awaiting assessment for the course, one of whom has exceeded his tariff. Nine have been set the course as an objective and will complete it at another establishment, one of whom has exceeded his tariff. Sixteen are awaiting places on the family and man relationship skills course, eight of whom have exceeded their tariff. Eighteen are awaiting places on the assertiveness course, nine of whom have exceeded their tariff. Victim awareness and victim empathy courses are not available at Aylesbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.3/2">The National Offender Management Service has implemented a range of measures to improve the position of indeterminate sentence prisoners, and further work is being undertaken to match delivery. The benefits of moving prisoners through the system are fully recognised: Action is being taken to prioritise indeterminate sentence prisoners particularly with short tariffs, and if necessary move them as quickly as possible to establishments where their offending behaviour needs can be addressed.</p>
