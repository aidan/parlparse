<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-20b.241.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="241"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51220w01.htm#51220w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.241.2/1">There are over 140 licensed aerodromes in the United Kingdom, and the information about their operating policies requested in a number of these questions is not collected or held by the Department for Transport. It is therefore not possible to give comprehensive information about UK airports' policies in response to these questions. However, some illustrative examples of practices at larger UK airports are given at the end of this answer.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/2">Ambient air quality is monitored in the vicinity of all larger airports in the UK. Continuous monitoring of a number of different pollutants, which are controlled though the UK air quality objectives, is carried out near airports either through the Defra monitoring network, by local authorities or by the airports themselves. The prime pollutants are nitrogen dioxide (NO) and particulate matter (PM10) though a number of other pollutants are monitored at different locations. Data acquired are used both for compliance monitoring against limit values and in support of modelling of pollutant concentrations. Monitors are sited at various locations that relate either to the main sources or to residential areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/3">Aircraft emissions are not identified separately from other sources in monitoring work though some sites will be exposed to higher levels of aircraft emissions whilst at others it will be roads that predominate. For modelling of airport area emissions, the aircraft source emissions, like other sources, will be calculated using inventory techniques related to technical and operational performance. Inevitably, this will be an approximation given the variation in numerous factors that affect the actual level of emissions for a particular movement.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/4">Moreover, it is not possible to ascribe a particular operational level of emissions to an individual aircraft. The Civil Aviation Bill does not, therefore, make provision for the establishment of emissions control schemes at airports.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/5">There are currently no penalty schemes in operation at UK airports for emissions, and no current statutory powers to airport operators to impose such penalties.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/6">Clause 1 of the Civil Aviation Bill would give airport operators clear powers to fix their charges by reference to aircraft emissions. BAA currently makes a charge, or offers a rebate, dependent upon the ascertained NOx emission of aircraft types using Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Given that some airport operators would like explicit clear powers to make such charges, it is not unexpected that there should be so few charging on this basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/7">Clauses 3 and 4 of the Civil Aviation Bill would give airport operators the power to levy financial penalties on the operators of aircraft which breach noise control requirements set by the Secretary of State (in the case of airports designated for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982) or the airport operator itself (for other airports). There is no current statutory basis for charging such penalties.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/8">At present a number of airports impose penalties for breach of their noise limits for departing aircraft, using their terms and conditions of use; some examples of these are given at the end of this Answer, along with details of the limits in question and the penalties imposed. The Government are aware of one airport&mdash;Stansted&mdash;that levies penalties for flagrant or persistent deviation from flight path as part of its terms and conditions of use.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/9">Noise and track-keeping systems are required to assess breaches of departure noise limits and deviation from noise preferential routes. These systems are potentially costly to install and run and it may therefore not be appropriate for smaller airports to impose noise controls that require this apparatus.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/10">There are a variety of ways in which airport operators may manage the noise impact of their operations, which should be selected and used in response to local circumstances. These may include curfews, restrictions on the number or type of aircraft permitted to fly at night, or overall limits on the number of aircraft movements at an airport; the Government also expect operators of larger airports voluntarily to offer noise insulation for residential and community buildings subject to certain levels of noise. The operation of noise penalty schemes needs to be seen in the context of these other measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/11">As noted above, the Government do not collect or hold information about the funds raised by airports that impose penalties for breach of their departure noise limits, or the purposes to which those funds are put. However, examples of such information are given at the end of this Answer.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/12">Nor does the Government collect information about how all penalty schemes are administered. However, it can be seen from the examples provided that a community trust fund is frequently established to administer grants, with local authorities and representatives of the airport's consultative committee generally included as trustees. It is also common practice for the consultative committee to be informed about the operation of the scheme. Those funds which are registered charities will receive independent regulation from the Charity Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/13">The Secretary of State has set departure noise limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. These are 94dBA in daytime (0700-2300); 89dBA between 2300-2330 and 0600-0700; and 87dBA in the night quota period, 2330-0600. BAA, the operator of these three airports, charges aircraft operators &pound;500 for an exceedance of the relevant noise limit, or &pound;1,000 if the aircraft breaches the limit by 3dBA or more.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/14">The Secretary of State has also set noise preferential routes for aircraft departing from these airports. Each airport has a noise and track-keeping (NTK) system in place to monitor breaches of the departure noise limits and deviations from the noise preferential routes. As noted above, Stansted Airport imposes a surcharge of &pound;500 for each flagrant failure to adhere to a noise preferential route.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/15">At Heathrow Airport, the BAA Heathrow noise fines fund has used the income generated from fines for breaching the departure noise limits to provide noise insulation for local schools and community halls; the fund is being reviewed, given that the needs of schools and other noise-sensitive buildings should be met by the airport's new community buildings noise insulation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/16">At Gatwick Airport, the Gatwick Airport Community Trust is a registered charity set up in 2001. The trust receives the money raised from fining for breaches of the departure noise limits, in addition to an annual donation of &pound;100,000 per year (index-linked) until 2008 from BAA Gatwick. It grants money to projects that benefit the area around the airport, including environmental or conservation schemes and projects that benefit community life or improve community facilities. In 2004 the trust made grants for a wide range of purposes, including tree planting, play facilities in a rural community and music in residential homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/17">At Stansted Airport, until this year the consultative committee has advised the airport on the distribution of funds raised from noise and track-keeping infringements. The Stansted Airport Community Trust Fund, a registered charity, has now been set up to deal with this. The trust is also being funded through a donation of &pound;100,000 per year from the Airport until 2012. The trust is managed by independent trustees representing local authorities in the area of the airport, and makes grants to projects that protect and enhance the social, economic and environmental well-being of the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/18">Manchester Airport sets departure noise limits of 92dBA/105PNdB in the day and 85dBA/98 PNdB at night (2300-0659). The minimum penalty for exceeding the limit is &pound;500, and a further &pound;150 is applied for each PNdB in excess of the noise limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/19">Manchester Airport has a NTK system to monitor aircraft noise, and has set up preferred noise routes to minimise the impact of noise from departing aircraft. It has lobbied for many years for the power to charge penalties for failure to observe these preferred noise route corridors. Clause 4 of the Bill will give operators of non-designated airports this power.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/20">The Manchester Airport Community Trust Fund is a registered charity set up by the airport. It has a board of trustees including representatives of the local authorities whose areas are eligible for grants from the fund (the &quot;area of benefit&quot;). It considers applications from not-for-profit groups that aim to improve the environment or social welfare within that area, and specifies that projects should be open to all and demonstrate wide, lasting benefit to all members of the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/21">Since the fund was set up in 1997 it has donated &pound;1.7 million to over 500 projects. The airport donates &pound;150,000 per year to the fund in addition to donating the money it levies for breaches of the departure noise limits.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/22">Birmingham International Airport sets departure noise limits of 92dBA in the day and 87dBA at night (2330-0600). The penalty for breaches of the daytime limit is &pound;500 plus &pound;150 for each full decibel over 92dBA; the penalty for night-time breaches is a surcharge of the full runway charge payable for that aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/23">The airport has set up noise preferential routes for departing aircraft and has an NTK system in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/24">Birmingham International Airport has set up a community trust fund. A registered charity, it receives &pound;55,000 from the airport each year in addition to the penalties levied for breaches of its departure noise limits. The fund invests in projects that directly benefit areas affected by the airport, and are aimed at improving quality of life through heritage conservation, environment improvement and education, encouraging and protecting wildlife or social and leisure activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/25">It is operated by nine trustees who are nominees of Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council, Birmingham City Council, the airport consultative committee and the airport company. Since the trust was launched in January 1998 around 250 grants totalling over &pound;530,000 have been awarded to local community projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/26">Nottingham East Midlands Airport sets departure noise limits at night and fines operators of aircraft that breach those limits. It also has an NTK system in place and has noise preferential routes for departing aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/27">The Nottingham East Midlands Airport Community Fund was set up in April 2002 and has donated over &pound;130,000 to community initiatives since then. This includes &pound;79,550 raised through fining airlines for breaches of the night-time noise limits. The fund is administered by a committee including members of the airport's consultative committee and representatives of the airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.2/28">London Luton Airport sets departure noise limits of 94dBA in the day and 87dBA at night (2330-0600 Monday to Saturday, 2330-0700 Sunday). The penalties are a surcharge based on the combined landing and air navigation charges for the aircraft concerned. For a daytime breach this is 400 per cent of that combined charge; for night-time breaches the operator is charged a 300 per cent surcharge for a breach at 88-91dBA, a 500 per cent surcharge for a breach at 92-95dBA, and a 600 per cent surcharge for a breach of 95dBA and above.</p>

Unfortunately, it has not been possible to arrange a final call on the president, not least due to the recent presidential elections.

	<p pid="b.260.6/2">Lord Jenkin has received several letters from the department and met with the chief executive on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-13">13 April 2005</phrase>. In addition, he visited the department on two occasions to inspect files dating back to his period in office. A number of papers were released at his request. However, we acknowledged early on in Lord Jenkin's enquiries that a number of papers from the 1970s and 1980s have been destroyed in error.</p>

	<p pid="b.261.8/1">The NHS Litigation Authority was established on <phrase class="date" code="1995-11-20">20 November 1995</phrase> by the Secretary of State for Health to perform such functions in connection with the establishment of a scheme under Section 21 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 (scheme for meeting liabilities of health bodies), and such other functions as the Secretary of State may direct the authority to perform on his behalf. Five schemes were established (the existing liabilities scheme, the ex-regional health authority scheme, the clinical negligence scheme for trusts, the liabilities for third parties scheme and the property expenses scheme) and the NHSLA were required to administer these schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.8/2">The Government have not placed any duty upon the NHSLA to reduce the level of claims sought against the NHS for clinical negligence and performance of the authority is not assessed in this area. However, the NHSLA promotes good practice in the NHS by risk assessing all scheme members once every two years against a set of risk management targets. Trusts are incentivised in two ways: first, the level of risk management is assessed against three levels of attainment, achieving a discount of contributions into the clinical negligence scheme for trusts as attainment increases. Secondly, the risk management systems assist NHS scheme members to drive down the levels of incidents, which in turn reduces the levels of compensation claims.</p>

	<p pid="b.277.3/1">The board of the Pension Protection Fund is required by legislation to consult widely on the pension protection levies. There has already been a 12-week consultation on initial proposals for the pension protection levies, which ran from July to October and in which opinion was sought from a wide variety of interested parties, including employers' organisations, pension fund trustees, lawyers, actuaries and other interested professionals. In October they published an interim report addressing several key concerns that had arisen during response to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.3/2">Since then they have been considering the additional responses they received during the consultation. In a recent statement, the board announced that it will report on a revised set of proposals on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase> and close the following consultation on these findings on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>. This gives a further five weeks for consultation on the pension protection levies proposals. Concerns raised by industry have been represented in the board's interim report and November statement and further details will be available in the December 16 publication.</p>

	<p pid="b.280.2/1">I refer the noble Lord to the Answer given by my noble Friend the Minister of State at the Home Office on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November 2005</phrase> at cols. WA 218&ndash;19.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/2">For the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency:</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/3">The Medicines Act 1968 regulates medicines on the United Kingdom market and makes provision for its enforcement. Section 108 of the Act places a statutory duty on Health Ministers to enforce the provisions of the Act in England. This function is undertaken by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The Act confers specified powers, detailed in Sections 111 and 112, which include rights of entry. Section 111(1), specifically, deals with right of entry and allows duly authorised officers to enter any premises, in connection with suspected breaches, at any time. Section 111(5) additionally provides the authority of forced entry under magistrates warrant.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/4">For the Healthcare Commission:</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/5">In respect of independent and voluntary healthcare establishments, the Care Standards Act 2000, Sections 31 and 32, provide a right to enter premises for persons authorised to do so by the Healthcare Commission. The right extends to the right to ask for information, inspect and take copies of documents, and/or interview people in connection with their enquiries.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/6">In respect of the National Health Service sector, the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, Sections 66 and 67, provide a right of entry by persons authorised by the Healthcare Commission to any premises owned or operated by an NHS body, and any other premises used for any purpose connected with the provision of healthcare by or for such a body. The right extends to inspecting or copying any records, removing items, and/or interviewing persons.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/7">For the Commission for Social Care Inspection:</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/8">Under Section 31(2) of the Care Standards Act 2000, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is given powers as the regulator of social care in England to enter and inspect premises:</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/9" class="indent">&quot;(2) A person authorised by the registration authority may at any time enter and inspect premises which are used, or which he has reasonable cause to believe to be used, as an establishment or for the purposes of an agency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/10">Therefore, CSCI may enter premises used in connection with registrable social care provision or which it reasonably believes is being so used which may be someone's home or business premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/11">As for the power to &quot;search&quot;, by virtue of Section 32(1) of the Care Standards Act, CSCI is given powers of inspection which may or may not be regarded as akin to search in that it can, in specified circumstances, seize and remove material:</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/12" class="indent">&quot;(1) A person authorised by virtue of Section 31 to enter and inspect any premises may seize and remove any document or other material or thing found there which he has reasonable grounds to believe may be evidence of a failure to comply with any condition or requirement imposed by or under this Part.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.282.0/1">I refer the noble Lord to the answer given to him on <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase> by my noble friend the Minister of State at the Home Office (Baroness Scotland of Asthal), <i>(Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November 2005</phrase>; col. <i>WA 218</i>).</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/2">The position in respect of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and those public bodies answerable to the Secretary of State is set out below. For completeness I have also provided further information on the Football Licensing Authority and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/3" class="italic">DCMS</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/4">Regulation 5(1) of the Return of Cultural Objects Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/501)&mdash;which were made under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972&mdash;provides that the Secretary of State may apply to a competent court for an order to authorise an officer of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to enter and search premises, where the court is satisfied: that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a cultural object has been unlawfully removed from the territory of a member state of the European Union and that the object in question is on the premises specified on the application to the court; and that admission to the premises has been refused, or that the case is one of urgency, or that an application for admission to the premises would defeat the object of the entry.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/5" class="italic">English Heritage</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/6">Sections 5, 6, 6A, 26, 40, 43 and 44 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, Section 36 of the National Heritage Act 1983 and Sections 88, 88A and 88B of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 contain powers for DCMS officials or English Heritage officials to enter land in England. Such entry would be in connection with other provisions of the Acts; for example, for a proposal to list or de-list a historic building, to ensure a scheduled ancient monument or historic building is properly maintained, or to record any matters of archaeological or historic interest that the land may contain.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/7" class="italic">Gambling Commission</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/8">Under existing legislation, Section 43 of the Gaming Act 1968 allows the Gambling Commission to appoint inspectors who are given powers to inspect premises in order to find out whether there has been a contravention of the 1968 Act or any regulations made under it.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/9">Under Part 15 of the Gambling Act 2005 (to be enacted under secondary legislation), enforcement officers appointed by the Gambling Commission will have the power to enter and inspect premises in a variety of situations. These are mainly concerned with enabling enforcement officers to check whether facilities for gambling are being provided in accordance with the Act (including where they suspect the commission of an offence); or for enabling them to inspect premises where an application has been made for the premises to be used in providing facilities for gambling. In relation to a dwelling, the power of entry under Part 15 can only be exercised where it is authorised by a warrant issued by a justice of the peace (or a sheriff in Scotland).</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/10" class="italic">Royal Parks</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/11">Under the 1872 Parks Regulation Act, as amended by the 1926 Parks Regulation (Amendment) Act, Royal Parks Constabulary (RPC) police officers have the same powers of search and entry inside the royal parks as a police constable would have outside the parks. Policing in the royal parks is now carried out by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), who carry out the role jointly with the RPC until a date to be designated under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (which will not be before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>). After the designated day, all policing will be carried out by the MPS and no officials of DCMS will have any powers of search and entry and no officials will have any powers of entry and search.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/12" class="italic">Further information:</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/13">Under the Football Spectators Act 1989, the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) has power of entry to football grounds at which designated football matches are played and a power to inspect both the grounds and their safety certificates. However, their inspection powers should not be equated to powers to &quot;search&quot;; rather they can best be described as &quot;entry and inspection&quot; powers. The FLA has never had to enforce its inspection powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/14">In addition to the information above, although the BBC is not answerable to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport because it is independent of government, the Secretary of State has responsibility for the broadcasting provisions of the Communications Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/15">Section 366 of the Communications Act 2003 contains a power of entry for a person or persons authorised by the BBC, for the purposes of enforcing the television licensing requirements. The power is exercisable only with a warrant issued by a justice of the peace (or a sheriff in Scotland or a lay magistrate in Northern Ireland), who must be satisfied by information provided under oath that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting (i) that an offence of unlicensed installation or use of a television receiver has been or is being committed; (ii) that evidence related to such an offence is likely to be on premises or in any vehicle specified in the warrant; and (iii) that one or more of the conditions set out in subsection (3) are satisfied. These conditions are: that it is impracticable to communicate with any person who may grant entry; that it is impracticable to communicate with any person who may grant access to the evidence; that entry will not be granted unless a warrant is produced; or that the purpose of the search may be frustrated or seriously prejudiced unless carried out immediately on arrival at the premises or vehicle. A warrant is valid for one month after the day it is granted, and may grant powers to enter and search a specified set of premises or vehicle and to examine and test any television receiver found there. Persons acting under a warrant may use reasonable force in the exercise of these powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.284.8/1">The Secretary of State has issued statutory guidance to England's Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in relation to the preparation of the regional economic strategies which set out a shared vision for the development of each region's economy. The statutory guidance highlights the importance of partnership working; and while it will be for each RDA to consider how best to foster and maintain regional and national partnership and co-operation in public, private, voluntary and community sectors, developing an approach which best suits the needs and characteristics of the region, consultation should include working with the regional assembly and other regional and sub-regional partners and stakeholders. This guidance has not been issued under Section 8(3) of the RDA Act since that section states that the Secretary of State may give a regional development agency for which there is no regional chamber such guidance and directions as he thinks fit for the purpose of securing that it carries out appropriate consultation in relation to the exercise of its functions and all English regions do have regional chambers or assemblies.</p>

	<p pid="b.286.5/19">Source: The information has been taken from the DWP Expenditure Tables.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.5/20">Notes: Expenditure figures are for Great Britain. Expenditure has been rounded to the nearest million pounds. Figures are estimates of the amount of benefit paid to claimants in respect of their children. Average amounts of child elements or increases, and numbers of claimants in receipt of these (both of which are obtainable from the Department's administrative benefit system data), are used to arrive at an estimate of the proportion of total benefit spending directed at children. The exact method of calculating this varies from benefit to benefit. Departmental expenditure directed at children does not necessarily equate to actual spending on children by benefit recipients. Additional spending on children through child benefit and child tax credit is a matter for HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.5/21">All figures are consistent with the 2005 Pre-Budget Report, and with expenditure information which is published on the department's Internet website at the following address: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp">www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp</a>.
