	<p pid="a.3.6/2">Since the entry into force of Protocol 11 on <phrase class="date" code="1998-11-01">1 November 1998</phrase>, the Grand Chamber has issued judgments in two cases to which the United Kingdom was a party following a request by the Government under Article 43 (Hatton v United Kingdom and Ezeh and Connors v United Kingdom) and in one case following a request by the applicant (Kingsley v United Kingdom). The Grand Chamber found there to have been violations of the Convention in Kingsley and Ezeh and Connors; in Hatton it found a violation of Article 13 but no violation of Article 8. There is one further case to which the United Kingdom is a party pending before the Grand Chamber following a request by the Government under Article 43 (Edwards and Lewis v United Kingdom). In addition to referrals under Article 43 and cases considered under transitional arrangements provided for in Protocol 11, the Grand Chamber has issued judgments in seven cases to which the United Kingdom was a party in which jurisdiction was relinquished by a Chamber of the Court under Article 30 of the Convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.6/3">The Government consider the possibility of settling applications brought against them in the European Court of Human Rights on a case-by-case basis and against the background of the Lord Chancellor's announcement of March 2001 concerning the Government's pledge to consider and use alternative dispute resolution in all suitable cases wherever the other party accepts it. The pledge acknowledges that there will be disputes where, for example, a legal precedent is needed to clarify the law, or where it would be contrary to the public interest to settle.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.5/4">The Act allows the Home Secretary to detain suspected international terrorists who pose a threat to our national security for an undefined period. However, under the terms of the Act, the legislation needs to be renewed annually by Parliament and has a sunset clause of November 2006, meaning that further legislation would be required if the Government were to detain any individual under these powers beyond that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/5">In addition, the SIAC is charged with reviewing individual cases six months after determining the appeal and every three months thereafter. It is open to the detainees to make a voluntary departure from the United Kingdom at any time. In addition, the detainees may apply for bail at any time. In the first 10 cases so far reviewed by the commission, SIAC has upheld the Home Secretary's certification in every case.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/6">It should also be noted that under the terms of the derogation, the powers applied by the Government should be no more than is strictly necessary.

	<p pid="a.14.2/4" class="indent">(3) the performance of the UK's micro and small businesses to be up with the best in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/5">The first target of 1.5 million SMEs going online was reached in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/6">The second target of 1 million SMEs trading online was missed, with a total of 490,000 businesses meeting the target in 2002. Since the target was set, it has become clear that many SMEs have not seen trading online as the best way for them to use ICT most effectively. Businesses have found that they can achieve real benefits through the use of technologies that allow them, for example, to manage internal processes, communicate more effectively with customers and suppliers, and work collaboratively with partners. This fact has been reflected in the aims of the UK Online for Business programme, which now seeks to encourage more integrated, sophisticated use of ICT by business.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/7">The third target for the UK to be a world leader in e-business is one that we are still striving to reach. The DTI's international benchmarking study 2003 shows that while businesses in other countries are making a more sophisticated use of ICT than UK businesses, the gap between the leaders and the UK is not great. Other recent surveys have shown positive signs, for example, the Economist Intelligence Unit's e-readiness survey 2003 placed the UK third in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.2/8">Rather than being disbanded, UK Online for Businesses will be integrated into the new offer on business support, to be unveiled in April. This is part of the restructuring of the existing system of support, to provide a smaller number of schemes and a simpler way for businesses to access them. The support and promotion of ICT usage by business will continue to be a key focus for DTI.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.0/1">In 1991 the Department of Health issued revised guidelines on the establishment, role and functions of local research ethics committees (LRECs) in the National Health Service. These guidelines imposed strict criteria on how LRECs conduct their business and provided clear lines of accountability. The guidelines were replaced in 2001 by the Governance arrangements for NHS research ethics committees. Both the 1991 guidelines and the 2001 governance arrangements state that LRECs should submit to the appointing health authority an annual report that should also be available for public inspection. Departmental guidance on LRECs provides a model of good practice for research ethics committees outside the NHS. It is not the responsibility of the department to monitor such committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/2">The United Kingdom's draft implementing regulations to transpose the Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) into domestic law were published in February 2003 for consultation. The regulations make provisions concerning the establishment and operation of research ethics committees convened to review clinical trials of medicines.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.2/2" qnum="HL894">How they are ensuring that all general practitioners meet the target of carrying out annual and six-monthly reviews of medication for people aged over 75; and what is their estimate of the percentage of general practitioners that meet this target.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-01-26a.19.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="19"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040126/text/40126w05.htm#40126w05_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.19.3/1">The National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People requires medication reviews to be carried out for all people over 75 years at least once a year and those taking more than four or more medicines to have a review every six months. It is for strategic health authorities to monitor progress against delivery of the NSF milestones. The Department of Health does not collect data centrally on the percentage of general practitioners meeting the NSF target.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/2">However, the National Medicines Management collaborative hosted by the National Prescribing Centre has demonstrated significant progress on medication reviews. Currently they have three waves in operation. For the first wave, the overall percentage of patients with a documented review for patients 65 years and over on four or more medicines rose from 9 per cent to 32 per cent. For the second wave, which covers 200 GP practices in 40 primary care trusts (PCTs), this figure increased from 28 per cent in June 2002 to 47 per cent by September 2003. For Wave 3, for the same number of practices, the number of reviews increased from 29 per cent in January 2003 to 50 per cent in September 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/3">Many PCTs that are not part of the collaborative have also implemented the national service framework milestone on medication reviews by supporting community pharmacists in delivering medicines management to older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/4">The Medicines Partnership Taskforce funded by Department of Health will be surveying PCTs to explore the extent to which medication reviews are being carried out early in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/5">The quality indicators for the new GP contract will require them to carry out medication reviews for patients being prescribed four or more repeat medicines every 15 months which will be recorded in the patients' notes from next April.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/6">In the government statement of <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-17">17 July 2003</phrase> on the proposed framework for a new community pharmacy contract, it was highlighted that medicines use review was expected to form one of the enhanced services normally provided by accredited pharmacists from April 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/7">All of the above initiatives should help to ensure that medication reviews for older people are carried out as required by the NSF for Older People.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.0/1">The UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP), funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), published a report and set of climate change scenarios, referred to as the UKCIP02 scenarios, in April 2002. The report concludes that it is likely that relative sea level will continue to rise around most of the UK's shoreline, with the predicted rate of increase depending on the climate models and emission scenarios used, and the rate of vertical land movements due to natural geological causes or human influences. By the 2080s, sea level may be between 26 cm and 86 cm above the current level in south-east England.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/2">The report also concludes that extreme sea levels will be experienced more frequently. For some east coast locations, extreme sea levels could occur between 10 and 20 times more frequently by the 2080s than they do now, under the medium-high emissions scenario.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/3">In predicting sea level change it is important to make allowance for the natural inter-annual variability of sea level due to a number of meteorological and oceanic factors. The change of annual-mean UK sea level from year to year is approximately 5-10 cm. The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, with funding from Defra, is the national centre for monitoring sea level. Its records suggest that the underlying increase in mean sea level over the past few decades has been some 2 mm per year for south-east England.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/4">The Defra publication Flood and Coastal Defence Project Appraisal Guidance 3: Economic Appraisal, advises operating authorities on the appropriate allowances for climate change when considering flood and coastal defence investments. Updated supplementary guidance was issued in the light of the UKCIP 2002 scenarios in 2003. These include recommended allowances for increases in sea level of between 4 mm and 6 mm per year, where the higher level applies to the south and east of England. Similar allowances have been built into FM measures since the mid 1980s.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/5">In dealing with development proposals, planning policy guidance 25 issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister advises planning authorities to &quot;consult and take into account advice from the Environment Agency, which should incorporate the latest information on climate change.&quot;</p>
