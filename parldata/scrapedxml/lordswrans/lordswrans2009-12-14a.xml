The number of people, notably civilians, which continue to be caught in the conflicts in eastern and northern DRC, is unacceptably high and it is a regrettable reality of war that it is often the most vulnerable that get hit the hardest. However, those responsible for the atrocities should be held to account. We continue to actively support the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo in their peacekeeping efforts in the region and encourage states in the region to implement effective long-term action towards regional stability.</p>

Political parties meeting registration criteria should of course be able to stand in the local elections, due end of 2010/early 2011. The overriding desire of the Kivus population is for long-term peace and security, and we judge that this agreement offers the best chance of achieving this. Through the EU Security Sector Reform mission in Congo, we are supporting army integration; we also regularly encourage progress on the political aspects of the agreement. In these circumstances a plebiscite is not appropriate.</p>

At that stage, the UK supported the then criteria, which included the need for a constitutional link with an existing Commonwealth member. As such, Rwanda would not have been eligible to join.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.2/2">The 2007 CHOGM in Kampala saw a review of the membership criteria and the condition of a constitutional link was replaced by a close link to an existing Commonwealth member state. The UK has supported Rwanda's bid to join the Commonwealth from this time onwards. This matter has been discussed publicly since time. However, it is not the practice to ratify such decisions made by the Commonwealth or member states in national parliaments-including that of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.3/1">The one-year extension awarded to the University of Newcastle for the project &quot;Improving the efficiency of human somatic cell nuclear transfer&quot; involves no additional costs. The Medical Research Council (MRC) sometimes grants extensions to the duration of research projects, at no additional cost to the MRC, to allow the completion of the planned research. Such a time-only extension is the standard mechanism employed by the MRC for allowing grants to fulfil their original objectives. An extension to the duration of a project allows the host institution to reallocate the original funding awarded by the MRC over the extended time period agreed. Formal approval is required for all proposed changes to the duration of an MRC award.</p>

Over 500 such awards have been granted since 2004-05. The purpose of these time-only extensions is to allow the research investigators to fulfil the objectives of the original grant award.

In Mr Amin's case the judge examined his allegations and found that there was no evidence to suggest that the UK authorities were complicit in the unlawful detention or ill-treatment of Amin in Pakistan.

An important part of this work is to identify ways of freeing up researchers' time so that they can concentrate more on their research. Research councils have a range of fellowship schemes that support excellent researchers for extended periods of time.

	<p pid="a.188.3/1">The Al north of Newcastle multimodal study was completed in 2002. This assessed the benefits for the economy of the north east and for access to markets of creating a dual carriageway on the Al north of Morpeth to the border with Scotland, as well as the impact on safety. A copy of the final report is in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.3/2">This section of the Al forms part of the regional trunk road network. The north west authorities are responsible for promoting schemes as part of the regional funding allocation (RFA) process. The regional authorities have not prioritised the dualling of the Al north of Morpeth within their RFA advice and the Department for Transport has therefore made no further assessment of any benefits of a dualling scheme on the Al north of Morpeth to the Scottish border.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.3/3">Notwithstanding this, over the past 10 years, the Highways Agency has invested in 41 projects to improve the Al in Northumbria, and will this year invest a further &#163;4 million.</p>
