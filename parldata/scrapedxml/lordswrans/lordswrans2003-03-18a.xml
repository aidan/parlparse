	<p pid="a.15.5/1">The Government continue actively to encourage the Internet industry to support the work of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which represents an effective way for the industry to deal with illegal on-line content.

This campaign has now been run on two occasions and is aimed at providing information for parents in supervising their children online and for children in highlighting the risks of giving out their personal details online. Analysis of the first campaign has shown that, in targeting parents and young people themselves it significantly improved awareness of key safety messages amongst target groups;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/6" class="indent">developing training for police officers;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/7" class="indent">developing a unique set of models of good practice for service providers relating to chat, instant messaging and web services;</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/10">The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has established the School Internet Safety Strategy Board to advise the DfES on all Internet safety issues, including the use of latest technology.

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) performs a unique and valuable role in Internet self-regulation through administering its hotline, which enables users and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report suspected child pornography and obscene or racist material on the net. The IWF's take-down procedures enable the Internet industry to remove illegal content from their systems, while relevant information is passed on to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/2">The Government support the work of the IWF and the development of a broader funding base for its work as set out in its recent review of governance. We believe self-regulation is the appropriate framework for the UK Internet industry and that the IWF should continue to be industry funded. We fully support moves to encourage the wider Internet industry to play as full a part as possible in terms of financial assistance and in other ways, to ensure the continuing effectiveness of the IWF.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.5/1">My right honourable friend John Denham commissioned an independent review into the provision of forensic pathology services and the Government have accepted the key recommendations of that independent review. There is clearly a need to establish a unified forensic pathology service to deliver the needs of the police service, coroners and the wider criminal justice system. The Government intends to enable a standard high quality service to be offered across England and Wales; ensure availability of service by providing the framework of a career structure to retain existing practitioners and to attract new entrants to the field; facilitate the provision of specialist regional service delivery centres; and introduce improved management and budgetary controls for the provision of forensic pathology services.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">Officials have been instructed to implement the key recommendations of the review as quickly as possible, with the intention that:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/3" class="indent">By autumn 2003 we will move to new accreditation and disciplinary procedures based on model competencies; and have two centres prepared to deliver a training programme against the improved standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/4" class="indent">By summer 2004 we will aim to have more newly trained, and operational forensic pathologists; an agreed career structure for the future national forensic pathology service; and developed contracts of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/5">John Denham will continue to take a close interest in progress and will receive regular reports on progress from the programme delivery board established to take this work forward. The delivery board will include representatives of both users and providers of forensic pathology services.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/6">A copy of the review has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.5/1">A new fast-track pilot scheme to be introduced in April will radically reduce the time taken to process asylum claims from arrival to removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/2">The pilot will operate at the Harmondsworth Removal Centre and will build upon the reforms in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the success of the Oakington fast-track process. This new pilot will enable us to deal rapidly with straightforward asylum claimants and to remove those with unfounded claims within four weeks of their arrival.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/3">The new fast-track procedure rules, to be laid before Parliament later this week, will enable us to pilot fast-track decisions and appeals based upon colocation of key elements of the asylum process. For this to work effectively, we will be detaining at Harmondsworth Removal Centre asylum seekers whose clams appear to be straightforward, pending a decision on their claim. Detention will initially be for about two to five days to enable claimants to be interviewed and an initial decision made. This new process will have bulletin access to legal advice. Detention of asylum seekers for a short period of time for the purposes of making a speedy decision on their claim was upheld last October as lawful by the House of Lords. If the claim is refused or for any reason cannot be dealt with in accordance with the pilot timescales, a decision about further detention will be made in accordance with existing detention criteria. Detention in this category of cases will therefore normally be where it has become apparent that the person would be likely to fail to keep in contact with the Immigration Service or to effect removal.</p>

It will consider schemes currently available to potential homeowners on low or modest incomes and identify the most effective ways of promoting home ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">The terms of reference for the task force are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">Sustainable Communities: building for the future marks a step-change in housing. Resources have been increased substantially to deliver sustainable communities but more needs to be done to help tenants and those on waiting lists to move into home ownership, without the loss of social housing. New ideas and a new approach are vital in helping people on low or modest incomes into home ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/4">The task force is to examine the routes and methods by which those in housing need can be helped to meet their home ownership aspirations in a way that ensures the sustainability of that ownership and is cost-effective. It will examine who is being helped through current initiatives, to what extent those initiatives free up social tenancies for other occupants and the scope for better targeting and design. It will also take account of the work being undertaken by government departments and others to review issues in relation to existing homeowners.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/5">The task force will develop a more rational and straightforward suite of programmes to allow social tenants and those on waiting lists to purchase either their own home or another home, while recognising the many different circumstances of aspiring home owners.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/6">The task force will build on Evaluation of the low cost home ownership programme and other recent ODPM research, consider a wide range of innovative funding proposals and take into account proposals on single tenure, commonhold, flexible tenure, equity shares and new forms of public and private low-cost home ownership schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/7">Throughout its work the task force will take into account the difficulties faced by traditionally disadvantaged groups such as disabled people and BME communities in accessing home ownership and look at the different problems faced by people wishing to access home ownership in areas of low demand and the growth areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/8">The existing programmes that will be considered are right to buy; rent to mortgage; right to acquire; cash incentive scheme; voluntary purchase grant; shared ownership; do-it-yourself shared ownership; homebuy; and self build.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/9">The task force will report with recommendations on how the above home ownership objectives can be most effectively delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/10">The Home Ownership Task Force is due to report in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/11">We are also publishing today the report, Equity Shares for Social Housing, in fulfilment of our 2001 manifesto commitment to consider equity shares. Equity shares are one way to deliver our objectives to promote home ownership, increase asset ownership and improve the image of social housing. The report concludes that the costs of introducing equity shares are likely to be substantial, while the scale of benefits is highly uncertain. We will continue to keep this issue under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.5/1">Northern Ireland Railways has no plans to expand rail freight over the next two years but will continue to appraise new opportunities as and when they arise. However, given the relatively short journeys involved within Northern Ireland, rail freight struggles to compete with road freight.</p>

My noble and learned friend Lord Falconer said that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency was informed by police of 228 driving incidents in the year 2001 in which defective eyesight may have been a factor. These statistics do not constitute evidence of accidents that can be attributed to defective eyesight. They are notifications of incidents which, in the view of the policeman attending, may have been contributed to by an eyesight problem. As well as accidents, the figures include incidents such as where a motorist has been stopped for erratic driving.</p>
