	<p pid="a.183.2/1">The likely effects of the reclassification of cannabis to a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, alongside the associated enforcement response, were evaluated in the regulatory impact assessment (IA) produced to accompany the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/2">The IA focused on potential additional liabilities for the police and the criminal justice system (CJS). It also identified potential benefits of the policy change in terms of the change in the estimated population of serious cannabis users, reflecting the gradual desistance through contact with the CJS and consistent with current trends as measured by the British Crime Survey. It did not specifically address the overall benefit to the community of reclassifying cannabis as a class B drug. The full IA can be found at: <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/em/uksiem_20083130_en.pdf">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/em/uksiem_20083130_en.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/3">The Home Office has consulted and worked closely with the police to implement the changes to the enforcement approach to cannabis possession by adults as well as actions to tackle commercial cultivation. It has provided funding for a series of measures to support this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/4">The Home Office conducted an assessment of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on levels of crime and disorder. A report, <I>The </I><I>I</I><I>mpact of the Licensing Act 2003 on </I><I>L</I><I>evels of </I><I>Cr</I><I>ime and </I><I>D</I><I>isorder: An Evaluation </I>(2008), by Hough et al was published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport earlier this year. The main conclusion to be drawn from the evaluation is that licensing regimes may be one factor in effecting change to the country's drinking culture and its impact on crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.2/5">The Government have made no formal comparative assessment of the relative effects on communities of 24-hour alcohol licensing and cannabis remaining a class C drug and there has been no specific or formal assessment of how cannabis reclassification will impact on late-night behaviour in public and early-hours crime.</p>

No formal assistance was offered by the then Admiralty, War Office or Air Ministry, and over the succeeding years only a limited number of such graves have been maintained by the Ministry of Defence. These are usually in a military cemetery funded by the Ministry of Defence, where failure to maintain all the graves to the same standard would detract from the overall appearance of the cemetery.</p>

This work has focused on ensuring continued delivery on operations, increasing the percentage of our future fleet that can operate effectively in the harsh conditions that we are experiencing in Afghanistan, and reducing the through-life cost of owning and operating our fleets, including by minimising the number of types operated and the variation of build-standard within each type.

	<p pid="a.191.3/1">The Defence Medical Services (DMS) provide an extensive range of medical treatment and wider welfare support for wounded service personnel. This starts in the operational theatre, with life-saving medical treatment on the frontline and in our field hospitals. Those who need further specialist care back in the UK are normally returned to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at Birmingham's Selly Oak Hospital, which is at the leading edge in the treatment of multiple trauma injuries as commonly sustained by our battle casualties, and has a military-managed ward.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.3/2">If patients require further rehabilitation care they may be referred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court in Surrey, or for outpatient treatment at one of the MoD's 15 military regional rehabilitation units. We also provide mental health care for those who need it, primarily through our 15 military out-patient Departments of Community Mental Health across the UK plus centres overseas; in-patient care is arranged for those who need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.3/3">Wider support to those who are injured is overseen by a Welfare Coordinator, who will work with appropriate specialists to offer support and advice in such areas as housing, access to services and counselling if required, as well as providing support through key transition points, such as a move to or from Headley Court. If injured personnel are discharged from the services, the responsibility for overseeing welfare provision switches to the Veterans Welfare Service, run by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency. We also provide compensation to those injured in the line of duty through the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS).</p>
	<p pid="a.191.3/4">All medical and welfare provision is regularly reviewed internally to ensure it remains fit for purpose. In addition, an independent external review of the Defence Medical Services was carried out in 2008-09 by the Healthcare Commission; a new Defence Medical Inspector General post was created in 2008, whose remit includes following the commission's review with a wider internal review across the whole DMS and other appropriate defence process owners. Lord Boyce, former Chief of the Defence Staff, is also currently chairing a review of the AFCS to assess its effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.3/1">The recapitalisation of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and RBS's participation in the asset protection scheme are both subject to state aid approval from the European Commission. The Treasury has reached an in-principle agreement with Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes as to the pricing and consequent disposals that RBS must make as a result of receiving state aid, including the disposal of RBS's insurance business, including brands such as Churchill and Direct Line. RBS has been closely involved throughout the negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/2">The Government welcome the in-principle agreement and strongly support the EU's state aid and competition framework.

	<p pid="a.200.2/2">Ensuring that the mutually supportive elements of the two strands are complementary and do not undermine one another requires effective information sharing. We expect the police and their partners to act on the risk they assess from the information available to them. This will determine whether a &quot;prevent&quot; or &quot;pursue&quot; response is more appropriate and which partner or agency should act to protect the public from harm. It is for the police to decide, on a case-by-case basis, if an identified risk should be considered for &quot;pursue&quot; action.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.8/1">The information requested is not collected centrally. The police-recorded data supplied to the Home office are in aggregated form and it is not possible to determine the time at which individual offences occur. In addition, it is not possible to determine centrally the location of recorded offences of violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.8/2">Latest findings from the 2008-09 British Crime Survey show that the overall number of violent incidents decreased by 10 per cent between 2005-06 and 2008-09 from 2,349,000 to 2,114,000. However, the proportion of violent incidents that occurred at night (between midnight and six am) has increased from 12 per cent in 2005-06 to 19 per cent in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.8/3">Evidence from Home Office research in specific locations such as an evaluation of the impact of the licensing Act of 2004 and an evaluation of Tackling Alcohol-Related Street Crime in Cardiff and Cardiff Bay in 2003 indicate that incidences of violent crime and disorder are more prevalent between 11 pm and 3 am. The evaluation of the licensing Act found that some crime was displaced into the small hours of the morning, but overall levels of crime associated with the night-time economy remained largely unchanged, and there was a small fall in serious crimes of violence.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.5/1">In the year following the onset of the crisis last September, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) made new commitments of $3.4 billion to 26 low-income countries. This is nearly six times the average level of IMF lending to low-income countries in the three years before the crisis. The IMF expects to lend a total of $8 billion to low-income countries in 2009 and 2010. The sharp increase in the IMF's assistance to the poorest countries follows the London Summit commitments to double the level of finance available from the IMF for each low-income country and to double the total capacity of the IMF to lend to all low-income countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/2">In order to help poor countries tackle the effects of the economic downturn, the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank has agreed measures to fast-track and frontload funds. Fast-tracking refers to using streamlined processes that allow new funding to be approved more quickly. Frontloading means allowing countries to anticipate funding from next year to allow more investment in the current year. In response to the crisis, IDA members agreed to increase the amount of funding that could be frontloaded from 30 to 50 per cent. These measures resulted in IDA commitments reaching $14 billion in the IDA's financial year 2008-09, which ended in June 2009. This is a record, and 25 per cent higher than the previous year. However, there has not been a similar increase in the spending of these funds, and we continue to press for reforms that will improve the Bank's performance in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/3">At the London Summit, G20 leaders asked the Prime Minister to review the adaptability and responsiveness of the IFIs. His report was submitted to G20 leaders in September and has been placed in the Library of the House. One of its key findings was that the World Bank lacked the means to provide additional funding to the poorest countries when shocks occurred, and the Prime Minister proposed a new crisis response facility within the IDA. Shareholders have agreed to ask the Bank to bring forward proposals on establishing such a facility.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">The FSS has recently announced a transformation programme, which the Government fully support. As part of this, the FSS will move to a new national structure based around four primary sites at Birmingham, Huntingdon, London and Wetherby. A number of factors were carefully considered when selecting the sites to support this structure. One of the main considerations was the co-location of body fluid examination with DNA analytical facilities to meet customers' needs. DNA analytical facilities are currently based at Huntingdon, London, Trident Court (Birmingham) and Wetherby.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">The services currently provided by the Chorley laboratory will become part of the new national structure, operated from the four sites listed above. It is worth highlighting that proximity to a forensic science laboratory does not appear to be a key consideration for forces when selecting a forensic science provider. For example, north-west police forces awarded approximately 10 per cent of their main casework to the FSS in the recent tender incorporating the 14 police forces from the north-west, the south-west and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.2/1">The prehistoric footprints on Formby beach provide important insights into how animals and humans were moving about in the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. We have taken the advice of specialists in this period. The human and animal footprints have been exposed in soft tidal silts through coastal erosion, and therefore cannot be preserved &quot;in situ&quot;, since they are constantly eroded by the tide, but they can be recorded as they appear.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.2/2">The Heritage Lottery Fund has earmarked funding of &pound;1,174,000 towards proposals for a Landscape Partnership Scheme on the Sefton coast, which covers the area with the footprints. The earmarked funding includes funding of &pound;57,200 to further develop the bid. Landscape Partnerships is an HLF grant programme to support schemes of between &pound;250,000 and &pound;2 million led by partnerships of local, regional and national interests, which aim to conserve areas of distinctive landscape character throughout the United Kingdom. This scheme includes a project which involves training volunteers to record the footprints, and helping to make information available to the public about them.</p>

Israel is a state party to both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989 and the UN Convention against Torture of 1984. Israel has also stated it takes seriously its periodic reports before the treaty bodies, using them as an opportunity for in-depth self-examination.

Whilst it is appropriate for some universities to build on their own research expertise in their teaching, a healthy university system will have a diversity of missions and diversity of approaches to teaching. The choice on whether to provide research opportunities should be for individual universities to take as autonomous institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.0/1">Claims for higher payments for legal aid work do not usually involve dishonesty and can arise from misunderstandings of the fee schemes, or failure to obtain sufficient evidence of clients' means. In these cases, the Legal Services Commission (LSC) recovers the monies due from future payments or by immediate payment of the full amount by the provider concerned. Contract sanctions or a formal warning may also be given if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/2">Where deliberate overclaiming or misclaiming is identified, the LSC can terminate the provider's contract and seek reimbursement of monies which have been overpaid. The LSC has a dedicated counter fraud team that investigates allegations of fraud against legal aid providers in accordance with relevant legislation and approved internal procedures. However if the provider refuses to co-operate with the investigation, the LSC terminates the contract and refers the matter to the police or other law enforcement body when there are sufficient grounds to do so. It is then for the police to decide how to take these matters forward and the LSC counter fraud team provides them with any assistance that may be requested.</p>

We did this in 2004, 2006, 2007 and most recently in February 2009.

From 8 Sept the FCO-based Libya/Northern Ireland Reconciliation Unit was established to provide logistical support and advice to the campaign. The British Government themselves are not negotiating directly with Libya.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.3/15" class="indent">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.227.3/16" class="indent">8. Baseline published projections of expenditure on pensioner benefits assume that the basic state pension is increased by earnings from 2012. Prior to 2012, projections assume that the basic state pension is uprated by the greater of RPI or 2.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.3/17" class="indent">9. Estimates given show the gross additional basic state pension spend due to increasing the basic state pension by earnings from 2010 and implementing all of the other 2007 Pensions Act reforms to the basic state pension from April 2010 relative to uprating by RPI or 2.5 per cent. They also reflect the estimated savings from reduced income-related benefit payments (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit). During the next Parliament, we will re-link the uprating of the basic state pension to average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012, but in any event by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. We will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.3/18" class="indent">10. In the financial years up to and including 2014-15 Treasury economic assumptions consistent with Table C1 of the Budget Report 2009 have been used to model earnings uprating. Economic assumptions for uprating beyond 2014-15 are beyond the Budget 2009 forecast.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.3/19" class="indent">11. The costs and savings estimates provided are based on future projections of earnings and price inflation&mdash;which are inherently uncertain and subject to change, particularly in light of the current economic uncertainty. This is underlined by the fact that the estimated cost of earnings uprating has changed significantly from estimates based on Treasury economic assumptions consistent with Table 131 of the Pre-Budget Report 08.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.3/20" class="indent">12. Generally earnings rise faster than prices resulting in a greater cost from earnings uprating that would build over time&mdash;this would still be expected to hold over the medium and long term. Therefore despite the initial savings produced under current inflation forecasts, the introduction of earnings uprating would still be expected to increase expenditure on the basic state pension significantly as the cumulative costs of this policy grow over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.3/21" class="indent">13. If the restoration of the earnings link to the basic state pension were brought forward to 2010, the weekly value of the basic state pension to pensioners would be below the 2.5 per cent increase committed to by the Chancellor at Budget 09.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.3/22" class="indent">14. Estimates are in 2009-10 prices, have been rounded to the nearest &pound;100 million and include UK and overseas claimants.</p>

Ministers are already accountable to Parliament for the exercise of all executive prerogative powers. The Government consider that there is nevertheless a case to be made for reform of some individual powers in order to increase the level of parliamentary scrutiny and control. For example, the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill would place management of most of the Civil Service on to a statutory footing and would increase the level of parliamentary scrutiny of treaty-making.

	<p pid="a.235.5/1">The development challenges in southern Sudan are enormous, and the key obstacles to delivering development assistance to address those challenges are weak capacity and instability. At present neither the Government of Southern Sudan and its state governments, nor the United Nations, nor local or international non-governmental organisations have adequate capacity to respond to these challenges. Severe instability and insecurity have plagued southern Sudan in recent months with some 300,000 people displaced by localised insecurity, largely tribal in nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.5/2">Between now and the elections these obstacles will be reinforced as government is likely to become more focused on the political process than on achieving long-term development objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.5/3">The UK Government are supporting a number of measures to address insecurity including:</p>
	<p pid="a.235.5/4">a &pound;50 million contribution to the Sudan Recovery Fund, supporting stabilisation activities in Jonglei and Lakes states through interventions that will build communities' confidence in the Government's ability to provide security;a &pound;5.6 million contribution to the Southern Sudan Peacebuilding Fund, strengthening both the Government's and NGOs' support for peace and reconciliation activities; and working with the UN to provide grants to local and international non-governmental organisations to increase understanding of the electoral process and support electoral conflict mitigation activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.3/1">Jobcentre Plus has recruited additional staff nationally to deal with the rising number of customers claiming jobseeker's allowance and to support these customers back into work as quickly as possible. Specifically in the West Midlands we have recruited over 1,100 staff, in Yorkshire and the Humber we have recruited over 1,500 staff and in Scotland we have recruited over 1,500 staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.3/2">The strengthened rapid response service provides help for people about to be made redundant. Funding nationally was doubled from &pound;3 million to &pound;6 million in 2008-09 and was doubled again to &pound;12 million from April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.3/3">Other measures include the day-one offer, which provides additional support from the first day of claim; the six-month offer, which introduces additional options for the longer-term unemployed, including a recruitment subsidy of &pound;,1000, work-focused, pre-employment and in-work training and more support for those considering self-employment; the local employment partnerships extension, which extends this help to all newly unemployed customers and strengthens the links with participating employers; and the young person's guarantee and associated future jobs fund, which will guarantee the offer of a job, work-focused training or meaningful activity for all 18 to 24 year-olds before they have reached the 12-month stage of their claim to jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.3/4">The Government also direct substantial financial support to disadvantaged areas through the working neighbourhoods fund in England and the deprived areas fund in Scotland and Wales. These flexible funds enable areas to develop local solutions to help overcome problems of worklessness, complementing the Government's broader national welfare-to-work programmes. Many of the areas receiving this financial support correspond to the same areas that have seen large rises in unemployment as a result of the recession. The funding provided through these programmes is worth approximately &pound;0.5 billion per year in the current CSR period.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.3/5">The 15 city strategy pathfinders supported by DWP include Birmingham City Region, South Yorkshire, Glasgow, Dundee and Edinburgh. City strategy pathfinders bring together local stakeholders, including Jobcentre Plus, in partnership to tackle worklessness, child poverty and social exclusion through aligning services behind shared priorities. Each pathfinder has responded to the recession by revising their business plans to reflect activity to tackle the high level of newly unemployed whilst retaining focus on the most disadvantaged areas.</p>
