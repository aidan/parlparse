	<p pid="a.147.0/1">If the Government's proposed legislation on same-sex civil partnerships is enacted, couples who have ended their marriage to allow one partner to gain legal recognition in the acquired gender will be able to register a civil partnership and hence regain a legal status for their relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/2">The Government are sensitive to the difficult financial and practical choices that may be faced by married transsexual people who wish to end their marriage and enter a civil partnership. We are determined to make the transition process between the end of a marriage and start of a civil partnership as quick and orderly as possible. Indeed, we believe it will be possible to dissolve a marriage and begin a civil partnership on the same day.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/3">Should there be a gap, as is likely, between the implementation date of the Gender Recognition Bill and future legislation on civil partnership, then transsexual people will be able to decide whether to delay an application for a full gender recognition certificate until it is possible to move from a marriage to a civil partnership. To assist applicants under the fast-track process, it will now operate for two years from implementation enabling applications to be delayed until arrangements are in place for civil partnerships.</p>

The Gender Recognition Bill will enable transsexual people who have gained legal recognition in their acquired gender to marry someone of the opposite legal gender. Such marriages will not be same-sex marriages.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.2/1">We consulted 61 organisations including the British Veterinary Association (BVA) and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS). We received 31 replies. We are grateful for the views of the professional veterinary associations and other comments received during consultation which help to inform detailed discussions of the draft proposal in Brussels. We shall consult further as the EU proposals develop.</p>
