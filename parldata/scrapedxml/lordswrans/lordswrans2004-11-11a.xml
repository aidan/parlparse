	<p pid="a.96.2/2">DDA is not prescriptive as to what a reasonable adjustment might be.

	<p pid="a.97.8/1">Defra has recently received the final report of a study carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In accordance with Defra standard practice, it is currently seeking the opinions of peers on the information contained in the report and as soon as this process is completed the report will be published. As a part of this study, some volunteer subjects took part in a clinical assessment of neuropathy. However, following concerns raised by the Organophosphate Information Network (OPIN) that the study had misrepresented one of the volunteer's symptoms of ill health, Defra sought an independent clinical audit of the neuropathy study. Professor Kerry Mills of King's College Hospital, London, kindly agreed to carry out the audit. Defra currently awaits Professor Mills' advice on the validity of the neuropathy study.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.8/2">Additionally, Defra has recently commissioned with University College, London, the recruitment phase of an epidemiological study of retired sheep farmers exposed to organophosphate pesticides. This is due to be completed by late summer 2005. If the recruitment exercise is successful and the required number of volunteers is identified, the analytical phase of the work will be commissioned. The second part of the study will determine the nature and severity of physical, neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms of the retired farmers and compare these with a control group. This is expected to take a further two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.5/1">The Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters (CERRIE) was set up jointly by the Department of Health and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), under the auspices of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE), which is the Government's independent expert advisory committee in this area. CERRIE published its report on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-20">20 October 2004</phrase>, and on the same day, COMARE published its own report endorsing CERRIE's conclusions. The department and DEFRA are currently reviewing and discussing with COMARE, the National Radiological Protection Board and the Environment Agency how CERRIE's conclusions should be accounted for in future decisions on radiological protection.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/2" qnum="HL4736">Further to the Answer by the Lord Triesman on 28 October (HL Deb, col. 1398), what are the &quot;international requirements&quot; to which reference is made; what was the timetable for agreeing and implementing the Merchant Shipping (Vessel Traffic Monitoring and Reporting Requirements) Regulations 2004; and why there was no time to consult those affected by the regulations.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-11-11a.99.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="99"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo041111/text/41111w05.htm#41111w05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.99.2/1">The international requirements referred to in Lord Triesman's Answer are Protocol 1 to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and Chapter VII Regulation 6 (formerly 7.1) of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The provisions in MARPOL and SOLAS relate to reports of incidents that certain ships are to make in specified circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/2">Member states were required to comply with the European Directive 2002/59/EC, establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system by February 2004, which was the timetable set in the directive. This is the timetable to which the Government were working.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/3">Drafting of the Merchant Shipping (Vessel Traffic Monitoring and Reporting Requirements) Regulations 2004 proved to be a lengthy and complex process and had still not been completed by the February 2004 date. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-18">18 February 2004</phrase>, the Government received a letter of formal notice of infringement from the European Commission. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-09">9 July 2004</phrase>, the Government received a further communication from the European Commission, a reasoned opinion in relation to the UK's failure to implement. This reasoned opinion required the adoption of appropriate laws by <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-08">8 September 2004</phrase> (within two months of receipt of the reasoned opinion).</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/4">There was extensive consultation, both formal and informal, on the original draft of the regulations. This process was not finally completed until June 2004. After this consultation was completed, it came to light that amendments would have to be made to the draft of the regulations, as prepared at the date of consultation, so as to continue to give effect to the MARPOL and SOLAS reporting requirements. Amendments were therefore made to the draft regulations to keep in force in an amended form the Merchant Shipping (Reporting Requirements for Ships Carrying Dangerous or Polluting Goods) Regulations 1995 (the &quot;1995 Regulations&quot;) so as to continue to give effect to the MARPOL and SOLAS provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.2/5">Unfortunately, the deadline set by the Commission (and the risk of infraction proceedings against the UK in the European Court of Justice) left no time for further consultation on the regulations. As the noble Earl is aware, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has now undertaken to consult with interested bodies and persons on whether further changes are appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">The Government support the Baywatch campaign and have provided funding for the research which underpins it. Officials have worked closely with representatives of the campaign on their recent initiatives to raise awareness of disabled persons' parking bays in supermarket car parks. A report on the initiative has recently been submitted to the department which will be discussing with the campaign organisers how best to take it forward.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-11-11a.100.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="100"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo041111/text/41111w05.htm#41111w05_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.100.5/1">Recent international research into aircraft air quality, incuding an extension specifically commissioned by the Government, provided no grounds for concluding that an improvement was needed. Environmental systems on modern aircraft are such that the amounts of oxygen and the oxides of carbon are maintained at levels which do not pose a threat to the health of air passengers and crew. Similarly, the high efficiency particulate air filters used in most modern aircraft are very effective in removing infectious microbiolgical particles. Cabin temperature is controlled from the flight deck and is normally maintained in the range of 22 to 24C. Low humidity is a characteristic of aircraft cabin air and although not harmful, some passengers find it uncomfortable. Drinking water is always available on aircraft.</p>
