	<p pid="a.155.2/1">UK Border Agency officials were first made aware of the Independent Monitoring Board's difficulties in acquiring airside passes for Liverpool John Lennon Airport in February 2009. Officials pursued the matter with the IMB Secretariat, who could not confirm that the clearance application forms had been progressed since the appointments were made in July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/2">New forms were submitted in February 2009. Security clearance ordinarily takes a minimum of eight weeks to process due to the range of agencies approached and can take considerably longer. The IMB Secretariat confirmed successful clearance for each member in May 2009, July 2009 and August 2009. Board members were then able to apply for airside passes to the Peel Group, responsible for John Lennon Airport. The airport's pass office has advised that passes were issued on the same day as they received the applications in two cases and within 10 days in the third.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/3">There are no plans to introduce cooking facilities for the provision of hot meals within the airport holding room. The UK Border Agency has reviewed the logistics and the use of the accommodation and is satisfied that the existing provision is adequate. Individuals are routinely offered food, which includes a hot and cold choice, in the short time they may be detained in the holding room. Where detention is likely to continue beyond 24 hours, an individual is transferred to either a short-term holding facility or an immigration removal centre, both of which have cooking facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/4">Detention custody officers, who operate the holding rooms on behalf of the UK Border Agency, have access to an all-hours medical advice line. In the event of an emergency, paramedics are called. This provision of medical care is consistent across the agency's holding rooms and there are no plans to change the current arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.2/1">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) derives its main public source of income from Home Office funding. In addition to an annual grant-in-aid payment (&#163;836, 232 in 2009-10), the Home Office makes regular payments to ACPO to fund a number of specific projects or initiatives (totalling at least &#163;41 million in 2009-10) and these grants are prescribed for the purposes specified and the use is closely monitored. Police authorities contributed &#163;829,510 to ACPO in 2009-10. Some &#163;30,000 was contributed from non-Home Office police authorities (such as British Transport Police and Ministry of Defence Police) in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.8/1">To reduce the number of care and supervision cases awaiting hearing, Her Majesty's Court Service (HMCS) provided funding for an additional 4,000 sitting days that have been allocated to HMCS regions for use since April 2010 in the current financial year. The extra days have been allocated to the county courts, where the more complex and lengthy cases are currently heard, and according to local demand and needs. These additional days are ring-fenced and must only be used for public law family work. The effect of these additional sitting days is being reported on a quarterly basis to the HMCS director of operations and performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.8/2">In the family proceedings courts, a lead justices clerk has been identified in each HMCS region to raise the profile of family work, and a lead legal advisor has been appointed at a senior management level, to support the justices clerk and area director, and also to be the day-to-day performance manager for family cases. The volume and age of outstanding cases in the family courts is regularly monitored by the HMCS board through its monthly meetings, and resources are allocated appropriately to allow courts to deal with the volume of work awaiting resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.8/3">The Government are also working with the judiciary to tackle delay in care and supervision cases. The president's interim guidance, which aims to assist with backlogs in the allocation of children's guardians, has been extended until September 2010 to help the family justice system in managing the current high volume of cases. In London, where high volumes are particularly acute, the designated family judge has last month issued a supplement to his earlier published arrangements for the implementation of the interim guidance. This makes provision for the review by CAFCASS of long-standing cases, with the results of that work being reported via children's solicitors to the other parties and the court. It also provides for the appointment of children's guardians to new cases, thus preventing unnecessary delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.8/4">The Government are committed to reducing unnecessary delay in care proceedings, and further steps to achieve this goal are under consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.2/1">Family courts deal with a broad range of cases concerning the welfare of children and families, in both public and private law. During 2008 and 2009 the most significant rise in outstanding case volumes was seen in applications for care and supervision orders. This was observed in both the family proceedings courts, and in the county courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/2">This rise is attributed to the publicity in November 2008 surrounding the tragic death of Peter Connelly, which led to an unprecedented level of care order applications being submitted to the family courts from local authorities. The increased level of applications has put pressure on all agencies involved in family proceedings, including the courts, CAFCASS and local authorities, and has also affected the progress of older cases in the system. This is regarded as the principal reason for the increase in the number of outstanding cases in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/3">Following the introduction of the Public Law Outline in April 2008 which was intended to tackle delay by moving more work into the pre-proceedings phase, the level of care and supervision applications received by the family courts during May 2008 stood at 702, which was a low number compared to previous years. The publicity surrounding the Baby Peter case in November 2008 and other subsequent high profile cases, reversed the decline in application volumes and the level of applications for care and supervision orders subsequently rose to record levels. In December 2008 the level of applications had risen to 1,495, an increase of over 100 per cent from the May 2008 figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/4">The Government are committed to reducing unnecessary delay in proceedings, and in care and supervision cases particularly, considering what further work can be done to reduce the backlog of outstanding cases in the family courts.</p>
