	<p pid="a.31.6/1">Pacer units operate on rail services on the Northern, Wales and Great Western franchises. The expected life span of these units is dependent on the engineering and refurbishment carried out on these vehicles, as well as requirements under the Disability Discrimination Act. The longest current lease for these vehicles is to 2018.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.6/2">The Government have committed to electrify the Great Western Main Line and the Liverpool-Manchester route via Chat Moss. This means that it will be possible to run electric units on these routes instead of pacers. The electrification programme radically affects the requirements for rolling stock over the next decade. There will be far less need for diesel trains and a greater requirement for electric trains. A new rolling stock plan will be published in the autumn, taking account of the changed circumstances.</p>
