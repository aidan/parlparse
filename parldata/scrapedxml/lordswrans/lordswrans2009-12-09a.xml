	<p pid="a.123.2/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) uses a number of processes to identify alcohol that has not had duty paid on it. These include: use of risk and intelligence information; targeted assurance testing of businesses' systems and procedures; credibility testing of alcohol supply chains; physical checks at revenue traders' premises, including warehouses, wholesalers and retailers; and the use of criminal and civil investigation techniques against the highest risk individuals and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/2">Specifically in relation to spirits, all bottles and other retail containers of a specific size and alcohol content held for retail sale in the UK must bear a duty stamp.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/3">HMRC works in partnership with the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) to detect illicit alcohol entering the UK. This includes risk-based targeting and challenging of both commercial freight consignments and individual travellers arriving from other EU member states and non-EU countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/4">At Budget 2009 the Government announced the renewal of HMRC's and UKBA's tackling alcohol fraud strategy. This includes a number of further measures aimed at helping HMRC identify alcohol that has not had duty paid on it. These changes are being progressed alongside the wider HMRC powers review which will ensure that HMRC has effective powers to protect alcohol revenue duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/5">HMRC publishes details of alcohol seizures on a financial year basis in its annual autumn performance report. Figures for 2005-06 to 2008-09 are provided below:</p>

	<p pid="a.124.2/1">The health of animals is central to Defra's work of protecting livestock and controlling and eradicating disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/2">The Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes it an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal, or for an owner or keeper to fail to provide for an animal's welfare needs. This includes the need for a suitable environment (place to live); for a suitable diet; to exhibit normal behaviour patterns; to be housed with, or apart from, other animals (if applicable); and to be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/3">The Animal Health and Welfare Strategy, published in 2004, aimed continuously to improve the health and welfare of kept animals while protecting society, the economy, and the environment from the effect of animal disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/4">The Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO), in his annual report on Animal Health for 2008, summarised progress and developments in UK animal health and welfare. Recent successes include:</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/5">the successful implementation of a voluntary bluetongue vaccination campaign in England and Wales, delivered in partnership with the veterinary profession and livestock industries;the effective control of two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in England, due to a co-ordinated response from Defra, Animal Health, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, the Health Protection Agency, the Environment Agency and local authorities;major progress towards the elimination of BSE in cattle;continued progress on the control of salmonella in poultry and the launch of an industry-led zoonoses control programme for pigs; andgood progress in Northern Ireland on the control of bovine brucellosis and Aujeszky's disease in pigs.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.2/6">Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) continues to be a challenge. In 2009 the EU approved the UK bTB Eradication Plan which reflected the control strategies being pursued in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Defra continues to work on developing a bTB vaccine for both badgers and cattle in order to provide a new tool to help control the spread of the disease from wildlife.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.0/1">The Ministry of Defence periodically receives approaches from individuals and commercial bodies offering services, including the provision of aircraft for use on the airbridge to Afghanistan. Many of these discussions are informal and provide a method of seeking advice on the bidding process as well as determining levels of interest. The department does not routinely record informal discussions. However, since November 2007, six formal proposals have been received and were examined in line with departmental guidelines. Recently, defence equipment and support has set up the Defence Suppliers' Service and issued direction and guidance to all Ministry of Defence directorates on how to handle inquiries of interest and unsolicited bids from commercial suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.3/1">The airbridge to Afghanistan is absolutely critical for the success of current operations. We use two air transport solutions for the movement of service personnel: direct flights from the UK into Afghanistan, using military air transport aircraft; and commercial chartered flights to a Middle East hub followed by military flights into Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.3/2">Since November 2007, six unsolicited bids for air transport direct to Afghanistan have been received from Kellogg Brown and Root Limited, Fortis Aviation Services and Solutions, Omega Air, BAe Systems, Crown Aviation Consulting and Government Affairs (Services) Limited. Each of these proposals was formally examined in line with departmental guidelines. The companies were informed that at the time we did not wish to progress further with their offers but that should the situation change and a requirement emerge, the Ministry of Defence would consider a competition and, therefore, advertise the need for such services in accordance with departmental guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.6/1">There are no current plans to reduce the numbers of either Tornado or Harrier aircraft numbers prior to 2015. However, the MoD routinely reviews its forward plans to deliver defence capability to ensure they are sound and that resources are allocated in line with defence priorities. Top priority is given to achieving success on operations in Afghanistan and tough decisions will have to be taken to ensure that this is the case. Planning round 10 (PR10) is currently underway.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.6/2">As is usual a wide range of options are being considered in PR10. No final decisions have yet been taken. As nothing definite has been agreed, it is premature to speculate about specific measures.</p>

Despite whole life buys of spares made in support of the AFV430 MkII drive trains, it was judged that these spares would be exhausted by the revised out of service date of 2015. This, combined with the increasing obsolescence of the power pack components was one of the main reasons for initiating the Bulldog project, for which the contract was signed in November 2005, and these issues have now been resolved.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">Former General Musharraf was Chief of Army Staff from October 1998 to November 2007. From consular records we are aware of 11 British nationals who have alleged that they were either tortured or mistreated while in Pakistani custody during that period. However, there are constraints on our ability to search records of past consular cases, and this figure should not therefore be taken as definitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">When appropriate and with the permission of the individual involved we can raise, and have raised, reports of mistreatment of British nationals in detention in Pakistan at a senior level with the Pakistani authorities, as, for example, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary did in September. As part of our bilateral relationship, the UK and Pakistan conduct a Joint Judicial Co-operation Working Group. This group aims to establish a formal mechanism committing both parties to facilitate promptly requests for access to their own nationals who are being held by the other country's authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.8/1">The Government do not prescribe proportions of time to be spent on individual activities within initial teacher training (ITT). The Secretary of State has laid down the qualified teacher status (QTS) standards against which training providers must develop the design and delivery of their courses to enable trainees to demonstrate that they can meet the standards. The Secretary of State's ITT requirements (R2.4) expect that training provision will be designed and delivered to take account of individual training needs. This means that programmes will be adapted and tailored to take account of the skills, experiences and needs of all trainee teachers. The requirements also expect (R2.3) that providers will make available to trainee teachers a range of suitable resources to support them in meeting the QTS standards throughout course provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.8/2">School leadership has a strong focus on helping teachers with value for money considerations in the selection and deployment of resources. This is typically devolved to departmental level in secondary schools, and within curriculum areas in the primary phase where middle leaders are expected to monitor value for money closely. There is a wide range of high quality resource material currently freely available to schools, including through the Teacher Training Resource Bank, Behaviour4learning, Multiverse, the Special Educational Needs portal and the subject resource networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.8/3">Resources are also available through the national strategies, Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA), specialist schools and academies trust, the exam boards and all of the curriculum and subject associations.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.8/4">In addition, there is a vast range of commercially available print and online materials available to schools. Through their subject training in ITT teachers will be taught how to discriminate and to make effective use of resources to support their teaching.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.8/5">The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) makes available to trainers and teachers a wide range of resources to support their professional development and their classroom practice through subject resource networks, links with the QCDA and the national strategies. The agency has developed a web-based database of professional development opportunities for the whole children's workforce in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.8/6">This contains nearly 5,000 development opportunities which are delivered by a range of organisations including schools, universities, subject associations, and private companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.8/7">The TDA also provides online guidance to schools to support the effective impact evaluation of professional development. A review of the guidance is currently underway and the TDA is working closely with interested bodies on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.8/2">The UK National Inventory of War Memorials, a registered charity, is currently working to compile a record of all war memorials in the UK. Its website <a href="http://www.ukniwm.org.uk/">http://www.ukniwm.org.uk/</a> lists all those memorials that have so far been registered with it. Several of these are dedicated to the Indian Army including a memorial to the 17th Dogra Regiment of the Indian Army located at the National Arboretum, Alrewas, Staffordshire, and an Indian Army Memorial Organ and Screen located in the Royal Memorial Chapel at Sandhurst.</p>
