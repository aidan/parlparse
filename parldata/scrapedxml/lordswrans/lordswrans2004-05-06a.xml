	<p pid="a.130.8/1">The Licensing Act 1964 does not provide for any automatic review by the licensing justices of special hours certificates issued under Section 77 of that Act and the judgment of the Court of Appeal on <phrase class="date" code="">7 April</phrase> does not require one. Once issued, a special hours certifcate remains in force for the lifetime of the associated justices' on-licence, subject to its revocation. If the justices' on-licence for the premises is not renewed or is itself revoked, the special hours certificate would cease to have effect. If at any time while a special hours certificate is in force the premises ceases to hold a music and dancing licence issued by the local authority or a casino licence issued under the Gaming Act 1968, the Section 77 certificate is revoked automatically. At any time, it is also open to the chief officer of police to apply to the licensing justices for the revocation of a certificate, if:</p>
	<p pid="a.130.8/2" class="indent">the premises have not been used as mentioned in Section 77 of the 1964 Act; or</p>

	<p pid="a.130.8/5" class="indent">it is expedient by reason of the occurrence of disorderly or indecent conduct in the premises or any part of it to which the certificate relates.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.8/6">Before revoking a certificate, the licensing justices must be satisfied that one of these grounds is made out. For the purposes of the Act and in relation to premises which are not casino or gaming premises, appropriate purposes include dancing and the obtaining of refreshments. Any consideration of such an application to revoke a certificate would need to take account of the Court of Appeal's judgment on <phrase class="date" code="">7 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.8/7">Under Schedule 8 to the Licensing Act 2003, where an applicant applies to convert an existing licence and is successful, the licence must be granted subject to conditions which reproduce the effect of any restriction imposed on the use of the premises for the existing licensable activities under the relevant existing licence or licences, which includes a special hours certificate. When a special hours certificate is included in such an application, the requirements to provide music and dancing and substantial refreshment (or to be licensed as a casino) would be reproduced as a condition of the new premises licence.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.8/1">Defra is currently reviewing the legislation relating to the welfare of captive and domestic animals with the intention of introducing an Animal Welfare Bill into Parliament in the fourth legislative session. It is intended that any new legislation should include a power for the Secretary of State to prohibit or restrict the sale and use of certain devices used on animals. Any proposal to prohibit or restrict the sale and use of any device should be based on sound unambiguous scientific evidence. As there is currently no such evidence available in respect of electronic training devices for animals it is not currently proposed that any restrictions should be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.3/1">The Government have removed the requirement for electrified grids for two main reasons. First, the threat of rabies being introduced via animals entering the Channel Tunnel from France has substantially receded since 1993 due to the successful measures taken by the French, Belgian and German Governments to reduce the incidence of rabies in wild foxes. Secondly, the electrified grids installed did not function satisfactorily without creating human health and safety hazards.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/2">The Government are satisfied that there are a number of other measures in place that would prevent the passage of animals through the tunnel.</p>
