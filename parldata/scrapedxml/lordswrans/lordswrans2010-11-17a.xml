We are in the process of negotiation with the US Government to amend this contract in light of the Strategic Defence and Security Review decision to switch to the carrier variant of JSF but there are no anticipated penalty clauses or charges for making the required changes. While the UK will no longer require the small amount of SRVL completed to date, the data produced will continue to be of benefit to the JSF programme as a whole in which the UK is the only level one partner.</p>

Given a donor base of tens of thousands of individuals and the broad range of factors beyond government policy that affect giving behaviour, we do not propose to establish targets in this area. Rather, we will introduce a range of measures to encourage charitable giving. Further details will be published later in the year.</p>

The contract is with Telereal Trillium whose catering services supplier is Eurest (part of the Compass Group UK and Ireland). Eurest does supply British produce where it is economically viable to do so. The Written Answer by Lord Henley referred to in the Question shows that 85 per cent of pork is procured from UK sources. British bacon is not procured by the supplier for use on its contract with the department, with price being the determining factor. While British products are encouraged, canteen customers are cost-conscious and the supplier's focus is on keeping prices at the point of sale as low as possible. Eurest recently trialled the use of British bacon, which attracted a price premium at some of the department's sites through a &quot;Best of British Bacon&quot; promotion, but sales were negligible.</p>

They will achieve this in three ways. First, by proactively developing ideas for achieving behavioural change using less bureaucratic methods across a wide range of government policy and activity. In this mode the team will actively seek out areas where behavioural science applications could be usefully applied. Secondly, by pursuing non-bureaucratic and non-coercive alternatives to regulation. And thirdly, by creating and facilitating alliances and partnerships between government, business, media and the third sector to deliver and activate the ideas developed above. The team reports through senior management to the Cabinet Office's Efficiency and Reform Group, and is accountable to a steering group chaired by the Cabinet Secretary.

	<p pid="a.212.6/1">The Government have set out plans to reform higher education student finance that will offer a more generous package of financial support for low income students wishing to attend university in 2012-13. No full-time student will need to contribute to their tuition costs up-front, and students from families with incomes of &#163;25,000 or less will be entitled to a more generous full maintenance grant of &#163;3,250 a year. Students starting part-time courses in 2012-13 will be entitled to an up-front loan to meet their tuition costs so long as they are studying at an intensity of at least 33 per cent of a full-time course.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.6/2">Universities or colleges wishing to charge students more than &#163;6,000 a year, up to a ceiling of &#163;9,000, will be expected to draw up an access agreement with the Office for Fair Access in order to widen participation in higher education. In addition, a new &#163;150 million National Scholarships programme will guarantee bright potential students from poor backgrounds extra grant to help them meet the costs of going to university.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.6/3">The Government are also introducing a more progressive repayment structure. Students will only be expected to contribute when they have completed their learning and are earning over &#163;21,000. Repayments will be 9 per cent of income above &#163;21,000 and all outstanding repayments will be written off after 30 years. The result will be that around a quarter of graduates on the lowest incomes will pay less than they do at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.0/1">There were no previous decisions made about public funding for tourism covering the financial years 2011-12 to 2014-15, prior to the Spending Review 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/2">The funding settlement for VisitBritain, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October</phrase>, includes nearly &#163;50 million exclusively for marketing over the next four years. We are challenging industry to match that to create a &#163;100 million marketing fund to generate a sustainable legacy from the 2012 Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/3">VisitEngland's budget for 2011-12 to 2014-15 of &#163;32.9 million will be for supporting and investing in destination management organisations and the local businesses and local authorities involved in tourism.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/4">Local authority investment in tourism is a discretionary matter for them and their level of planned spend is not yet known.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.3/1">Universal credit aims to make sure that work always pays and is seen to pay. In return, people can reasonably be expected to look for and prepare for work. Improving the incentives to take up mini-jobs will particularly help those who are not able to take up full-time employment and otherwise would remain fully dependent on welfare. Promoting a culture of employment will not only help those individuals but will also tackle the intergenerational cycles of worklessness and welfare dependency. We will require every claimant to sign a claimant commitment as a condition of entitlement, setting out clearly the work-related expectations and requirements placed upon them and the consequences for failing to meet these agreed standards. Financial support will remain unconditional for people who we do not expect to be able to work or prepare for work.</p>
