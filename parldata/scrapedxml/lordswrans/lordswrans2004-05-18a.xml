The membership would comprise people with relevant professional experience, but not less than half will be lay members. The Government believe that in this way the authority will be able to build confidence among both professionals and the public in the donation and use of human tissue. Paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 allows the chair and members of the authority to be paid such remuneration as the Secretary of State may determine. It is standard practice that members of executive bodies receive remuneration for the contribution that they make.</p>
