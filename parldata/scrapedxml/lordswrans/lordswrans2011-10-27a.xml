	<p pid="a.178.8/1">The Government welcomed the recent Foresight report on the Future of Food and Farming, which explores the pressures on the global food system between now and 2050. We recognise that in order to feed the predicted increase in population in the UK and the world by 2050, we will need to increase food production sustainably by improving productivity in the UK, EU and beyond. Defra has signed up to an action plan in order to respond to the challenges highlighted in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.8/2">These challenges could offer real opportunities for our farming and food sector. The Government are taking action to meet our objectives of supporting British farming, encouraging sustainable food production, and helping to enhance the competitiveness and resilience of the whole food chain. This will help ensure a secure, environmentally sustainable and healthy supply of food with improved standards of animal welfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.8/3">The publication of the Foresight report also gives us new emphasis to influence our domestic policy making. In the natural environment White Paper published by the Government in June this year, we committed to begin a project that would look at how we could reconcile our goals of increasing food production and enhancing the natural environment. We will use the outcome of this project to help us shape a more strategic framework for agri-food policy going forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.8/4">Food security cannot, however, be delivered from a narrow, self-interested, national protectionist stance, or by focusing on self-sufficiency. International trade has an important role in providing food security. We are a trading nation in a global market and the UK is a significant exporter of wheat, lamb, dairy products and breakfast cereals. We are seeking to support our industry in accessing and maximising opportunities within export markets.</p>

It commended the joint statement from the British Medical Association, Resuscitation Council (UK) and the Royal College of Nursing, Decisions Relating to Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, as an appropriate basis for a resuscitation policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/2">The joint statement, the latest version of which is dated October 2007, states that &quot;When a patient with capacity is at foreseeable risk of cardiac or respiratory arrest, and the healthcare team has doubts about whether the benefits of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would outweigh the burdens, or whether the level of recovery would be acceptable to the patient, there should be a sensitive exploration of the patient's wishes, feelings, beliefs and values&quot;. It goes on to say that any discussion with the patient about whether to attempt CPR should be documented, signed and dated in the patient's health record. If a DNAR decision is made and there has been no discussion with the patient-for example because the patient is unwilling to discuss the matter-this must be documented in the health record and the reasons recorded.</p>

Accordingly the UK Border Agency operates various assisted voluntary return (AVR) schemes administered by Refugee Action's Choices' service. Many of those returning who take advantage of the various schemes will receive reintegration assistance helping both individuals and families to return home with dignity and support.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.2/1">The coalition Government recognise that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles could have an important part to play in the decarbonisation of road transport. We also recognise that challenges remain to be overcome before these vehicles will become mainstream, for example the commercialisation of refuelling infrastructure and the vehicles themselves, and the production and distribution of hydrogen from low carbon sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/2">We are supporting hydrogen fuel cells and infrastructure in the UK by supporting the demonstration of fuel cell and hydrogen energy technologies, most recently under a &#163;7.5 million competition for collaborative research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) funding via the Technology Strategy Board (TSB). Funding of &#163;300,000 for two hydrogen refuelling stations was awarded earlier this year through the Department for Transport's Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Programme. In addition the UK has an excellent research base funded by the research councils with collaborative networks developed by UK universities to develop the UK's academic and industrial expertise in hydrogen related RD&amp;D.</p>
