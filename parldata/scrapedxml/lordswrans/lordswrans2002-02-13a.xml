	<p pid="a.147.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/2" qnum="HL2506">Whether they intend to reduce the size of the prison population in England and Wales; and, if so, by what means.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-02-13a.147.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="147"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020213/text/20213w01.htm#20213w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.147.2/1">We need to ensure that we can perform the basic duty to protect the public by punishing people for the crimes they have committed while ensuring we engage in rehabilitation to reduce reoffending and prevent crime. To this end we are committed to a radical rethink of the sentencing framework so as to give clarity and direction to the courts and avoid the damaging effects of prison overcrowding. Prison must be used as effectively as possible and targeted where it is most necessary. It should be used for incapacitating dangerous, violent and other serious offenders, but prison sentences should be as long as necessary for punishment and public protection and no longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">The reform of the probation service, with its central focus on reducing reoffending, means that rigorously enforced community sentences are a real and tough alternative to imprisonment. We want to build on this work to provide sentencers with more than two stark options, imprisonment or a community sentence. We are looking at intermediate disposals such as intermittent custody and a strengthened suspended sentence. On community sentences the courts need to be able to mix and match within a generic sentence so that we can get it right for the individual. As part of the work taking forward the recommendations of the Halliday report on the sentencing framework we are looking at new forms of community penalties that allow the sentencer this flexibility. We aim to encourage greater use of community penalties for some non-violent offenders such as those convicted of theft and handling or fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">Home detention curfew and a rigorous assessment process play an important role by enabling some prisoners to be released from prison while still subject to restrictions placed on their liberty. This facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into the community and helps offenders to secure employment as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/4">We are addressing the recent increase in the female prison population by taking forward the Government's strategy for female prisoners. A cross-government women's offenders reduction plan is currently being developed by a multi-agency team drawn from across the criminal justice system, which is based in the Home Office. The aim of the programme is to strengthen policy, programme, research and spending partnerships across government to reduce women's offending. This includes linking criminal justice work with broader government efforts to tackle social exclusion, particularly as it affects women at risk of offending.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.5/2">An immigration officer conducts a process of verification on each arrival, for example, to establish that the person is the rightful holder of the document. He will also check the personal details of an arriving passenger against the Immigration Service Warnings Index, a computer system which provides information for the purpose of immigration control, national security and the prevention of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.5/3">The immigration officer may also extend his examination for the purpose of establishing whether the entry clearance was obtained on the basis of false information, failure to disclose material facts, or because there has been a change of circumstances since it was issued. The entry clearance may be cancelled in such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.5/4">The entry clearance (visa) indicates on what basis and for how long entry has been granted and contains other information such as whether the holder is required to register with the police.

	<p pid="a.149.2/1">The arrangements reflect the different history and incidence of BSE between the UK and other EU member states. The over 30 month rule was introduced in the UK in 1996 to exclude beef from older cattle from the food chain and thereby reduce the risk of consumer exposure to BSE. The over 30 month scheme (OTMS) was also introduced in 1996 to provide an outlet for cattle which could no longer enter the food chain by virtue of the rule.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.2/2">The Food Standards Agency is responsible for assessing whether the OTM rule is still necessary, and the agency has indicated that it intends to undertake a review of the future of the rule. In the light of this review the Government will consider whether any changes should be made to the OTMS; any such changes would need to be agreed with the European Commission and the member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.2/1">We do not agree with the conclusions reached in the report by the Scottish Council on Bioethics. Levonelle-2 containing levonorgestrel 0.75mg (the morning-after pill) is authorised in the United Kingdom as a prescription only medicine for emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse or failure of a contraceptive method. This followed advice from the independent expert scientific advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), which was satisfied as to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product in this indication. Substantial independent evidence reviewed by CSM included two World Health Organisation sponsored pivotal studies. One study involving approximately 2,000 women in 14 countries, including the UK, has been published in the Lancet (1998). The other, published in Human Reproduction (1993), involved 880 women. CSM has also considered evidence from a study of the effects of self-administering emergency contraception (New England Journal of Medicine, 1998). Copies are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/2">There is considerable experience of worldwide use with levonorgestrel. It has been available in the UK in other contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy products for 30 years, although only more recently for emergency hormonal contraception. It has been used for emergency contraception in other parts of the world since the 1980s and between 9 million and 23 million women have taken it. No major safety issues have been identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/3">The safety of all newly licensed medicines in the UK is monitored closely by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and CSM through the yellow card scheme. This was extended to community pharmacists in November 1999 in order to improve safety monitoring of over the counter medicines. The MCA continues to monitor the safety of levonorgestrel 0.75mg and will review any potential safety issues in the light of any new evidence which may emerge.</p>
