	HIPCs: Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.147.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/2" qnum="HL3091">What progress has so far been made with the initiative by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to encourage impoverished states to produce Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-07-06a.147.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="147"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000706/text/00706w01.htm#00706w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.147.2/1">The enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, agreed in September 1999, made a direct link between debt relief and poverty reduction. As a result, all countries that are eligible for World Bank concessional lending are producing a national Poverty Reduction Strategy. These strategies will be presented as part of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) to the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF for endorsement as the basis for lending programmes. The UK will use PRSPs as the framework for our assistance and we encourage other donors to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">Good poverty reduction strategies take time to produce. To qualify for HIPC debt relief, which begins at Decision Point, countries need only produce an interim PRSP. Interim PRSPs should map out how a country will draw up a full PRSP, which should be in place, and being implemented, at Completion Point. The Joint Implementation Committee, which oversees progress on the HIPC Initiative, is also taking an interest in how the Bank and Fund are taking forward PRSPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">The World Bank and the IMF have undertaken a lot of work to develop their thinking on PRSPs through workshops and the production of guidance to staff. This new approach requires the acquisition of new skills and adoption of a more facilitative approach so that countries have ownership of their poverty reduction strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">All asylum caseworkers receive training and instructions in dealing with applicants who are victims of torture. Any evidence of torture will be taken very seriously and caseworkers are aware of the need for sensitivity when interviewing victims of torture, as well as the United Kingdom's obligations to protect victims of torture. If there are grounds to believe that a person will, if returned, be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, it would be inappropriate to remove them. In such cases, if the applicant does not qualify for asylum, a grant of exceptional leave would be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/2">Previous Medical Foundation reports have been referred to, and drawn upon, in the Home Office country assessment used by caseworkers since October 1998, and also in the latest assessment of April 2000. We are carefully considering the information provided in the latest Medical Foundation report, and will continue to engage in constructive discussions with all parties who have information on conditions in Sri Lanka.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.0/4">The table below shows seasonally adjusted estimates from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is the main source of labour market data on individuals. It gives the number of people who were in full-time employment in the three-month periods from November 1998 to January 1999 and February to April 2000 (the latest date for which data are available). The table also shows International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment rates for the same periods.</p>

People who do unpaid work in a family business and people on government-supported training and employment programmes are also included according to the International Labour Organisation convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/13">The measure of unemployment derived from the LFS is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the ILO.

	<p pid="a.156.5/1">Following reports in the French press last week that the French authorities had discovered low levels of GM presence in conventional maize seed imported into France, we contacted the French authorities, who confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-30">30 June</phrase> that they had indeed found some GM seed in conventional maize seed, which has been sown in south-west France. Further information now indicates that they have found three different modifications in a number of varieties of forage maize imported into France by the Company Golden Harvest. The French authorities have not yet confirmed which varieties of maize seed are involved, but have confirmed that sweetcorn varieties are not affected by their current investigations. We are seeking further information from them on the varieties concerned. However, as the varieties concerned are cultivated in southern France, it is possible that they would be unsuitable for cultivation in UK conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.5/2">The GMs found in maize samples by the French authorities are BT 176 and BT 11, and one further, as yet unidentified, modification. BT 176 is insect resistant and has Part C consent within the EU under Directive 90/220 for import, food and feed use, and for cultivation. BT 11 is insect resistant and has Part C consent for import and use in animal feed. Pending further information from the French authorities, my department, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and the Food Standards Agency are considering what the implications would be should further investigations indicate that affected seed may have been sown in the UK.</p>
