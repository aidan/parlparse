It concluded that there is no evidence that any meat has entered the UK food chain from the restricted zones in Hungary and that all food importing and processing activities undertaken were in line with EC law.

	<p pid="a.51.5/1">The micro-generation industry has consistently informed us that lack of certainty regarding future volumes is prohibiting the investments in the supply chain that are required to drive costs down. After consultation with industry representatives, we determined that to get the investment in the supply chain required to drive costs down and the micro-generation industry forward, greater certainty about future demand is required. A framework agreement was developed whereby customers would receive grants where installations were undertaken by specific suppliers. The aim is that investments made in the supply chain by those companies will benefit the industry as a whole and lower prices will filter across to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/2">Tenders from prospective framework suppliers were chosen on the basis of offering best value for money and we consider that the approach taken should ensure that the programme will lower the costs of micro-generation to the public sector in the short term, with those price reductions hopefully spreading to the wider market over the long term. DTI will be monitoring the price of installations undertaken throughout the programme.</p>

Iraqi security forces have been assisting in the detention of individuals since mid-December 2006. Their assistance has been predominantly in the provision of cordons and the securing of the area of operation. The Iraqis do not have the power to intern individuals, so are only able to conduct strike operations against criminals for prosecution in Iraqi courts. As they have no powers to intern, there is no scope for a joint internment facility.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.6/1">The projected growth in passenger numbers is still being evaluated as part of the preparation of the forthcoming high level output specification and longer term rail strategy. The evaluation looks more widely at the growth on long distance routes between major cities, rather than at the growth on the former British Rail InterCity network. The forecast demand varies considerably by route. An annual passenger km growth rate of between 2.3 per cent and 3.2 per cent is currently forecast across the long distance network over the next 10 years</p>
