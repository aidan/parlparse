	<p pid="a.47.5/1">There is no EU requirement for member states to charge operators for the permits they require under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive. Some EU member states have elected not to charge for IPPC permit applications and recover regulatory costs from general taxation revenue. Others, including the UK, have elected to recover varying proportions of the costs from the regulated industry. This is a political decision for each national government. The UK's position is in line with the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle and guidance from Her Majesty's Treasury. The differing practices which are in place make it difficult to make comparisons of the costs to producers across the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.5/1">The micro-generation industry has consistently informed us that lack of certainty regarding future volumes is prohibiting the investments in the supply chain that are required to drive costs down. After consultation with industry representatives, we determined that to get the investment in the supply chain required to drive costs down and the micro-generation industry forward, greater certainty about future demand is required. A framework agreement was developed whereby customers would receive grants where installations were undertaken by specific suppliers. The aim is that investments made in the supply chain by those companies will benefit the industry as a whole and lower prices will filter across to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.5/2">Tenders from prospective framework suppliers were chosen on the basis of offering best value for money and we consider that the approach taken should ensure that the programme will lower the costs of micro-generation to the public sector in the short term, with those price reductions hopefully spreading to the wider market over the long term. DTI will be monitoring the price of installations undertaken throughout the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.2/2">A key barrier to widespread uptake of micro-generation products is the upfront cost of installations. The industry has consistently informed us that lack of certainty regarding future volumes is prohibiting the investments in the supply chain that are required to drive costs down. After consultation with industry representatives, we determined that to get the investment in the supply chain required to drive costs down and the micro-generation industry forward, greater certainty about future demand is required.

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">When the divisional temporary detention facility (DTDF) at Shaibah logistics base closes it will be replaced by a divisional internment facility at basra air station. Iraqi security forces have been assisting in the detention of individuals since mid-December 2006. Their assistance has been predominantly in the provision of cordons and the securing of the area of operation. The Iraqis do not have the power to intern individuals, so are only able to conduct strike operations against criminals for prosecution in Iraqi courts. As they have no powers to intern, there is no scope for a joint internment facility.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.6/1">The projected growth in passenger numbers is still being evaluated as part of the preparation of the forthcoming high level output specification and longer term rail strategy. The evaluation looks more widely at the growth on long distance routes between major cities, rather than at the growth on the former British Rail InterCity network. The forecast demand varies considerably by route. An annual passenger km growth rate of between 2.3 per cent and 3.2 per cent is currently forecast across the long distance network over the next 10 years</p>
