	<p pid="a.71.5/1">The purpose of waste management controls is to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health. Section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 imposes a &quot;duty of care&quot; on everyone who has responsibility for waste and requires any person subject to it to take all measures that are reasonable in the circumstances:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/2" class="indent">to prevent any contravention by another person of waste management controls;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/3" class="indent">to prevent the escape of waste from his or her control or that of any other person; and</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/4" class="indent">on the transfer of waste to ensure that it is transferred only to an &quot;authorised person&quot; (e.g. a registered waste carrier or someone who holds a permit or licence to recover or dispose of waste).</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/5">Failure to comply with the duty of care is a criminal offence with a penalty, on conviction on indictment, of an unlimited fine. Further information about the duty of care is available on my department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.qov.uk/environment/waste/management/doc/index.htm">www.defra.qov.uk/environment/waste/management/doc/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/6">Article 5 of the Waste Oils Directive (as amended) requires that member states carry out public information and promotional campaigns to ensure that waste oils are stored appropriately and collected as far as possible. The Oil Care Campaign fulfils this requirement in the UK. The campaign is funded by the Environment Agency and further information about it is available on the agency's website at www.environment&ndash;agency.gov.uk/business/444251/444707/491098/?lang=&ndash; e.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.5/1">Schools must teach the statutory elements of the national curriculum on sex and relationships as well as drug, alcohol and tobacco education. We are encouraging schools to use the non-statutory framework for PSHE to deliver these statutory and other non-statutory elements of the curriculum. Guidance to schools on drug education and sex and relationship education makes clear the expectation that these statutory entitlements should be delivered through PSHE provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.5/2">We recognise there is a need for professional development opportunities for teachers of PSHE and to support teacher assessment in the subject. We have therefore introduced the PSHE certificate for teachers this year. Around 2,000 teachers in 2004&ndash;05 and a further 3,000 teachers in 2005&ndash;06 will benefit. We have also recently produced a new DVD resource for teachers, &quot;PSHE into Practice&quot;, which will support teachers' professional development in PSHE. We are working with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to develop end of key stage statements to help teachers assess pupil progress in PSHE. These measures will help to improve the quality of PSHE teaching.</p>
