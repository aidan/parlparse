	<p pid="a.37.2/1">The report of the Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) on the pay of governing governors and operational managers, prison officers and related grades in England and Wales in 2002 has been published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">The PSPRB has recommended a basic rise of 6 per cent over a 15-month period. This is a significant award which I have decided will be implemented in full. The locality allowances to Prison Service staff in eligible areas in London and the south east will be increased immediately by the full amount recommended, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase>. The general award will be paid in two steps, 3.5 per cent backdated to <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase>; the remainder in January 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/3">The key recommendations are set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/4">Headline increase:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/5">A 6 per cent increase to basic pay rates over the 15-month period covered by the report.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">The Review Conference of the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) was successful in establishing a way ahead for discussions on a number of important and complex issues. By agreeing mandates for a group of governmental experts (GGE) to discuss ways and means to address the issue of explosive remnants of war and to explore the issue of anti-vehicle mines, the CCW has the opportunity to address humanitarian and military considerations in detail. We hope that the work of the GGE will allow the meeting of states parties to the CCW in December 2002 to agree to pursue formal negotiations on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/2">Our policy towards explosive remnants of war will continue to seek to minimise the post-conflict risk to civilians at the same time as maintaining essential capability for our forces. To this end, we will play an active and positive role in the discussions of the GGE and any subsequent negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.5/1">In his statement in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-23">23 January 2002</phrase> (Official Report, col. 891&ndash;902) my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State estimated the total cost of refunding wrongly taxed Army pensioners at around &pound;30 million. The latest Inland Revenue estimate is that, to date, it has refunded in the order of &pound;6.5 million to eligible pensioners or their spouses. We believe that the majority of these pensioners or their spouses have already been identified but we recognise that there may be some beneficiaries eligible to claim where the pensioner is deceased. It is not easy to establish their number or the cost attached to such claims. Nonetheless, we would not expect the total to exceed &pound;30 million and based on the repayments that have been made to all of the cases that have been identified it is likely to be significantly less. Of those so far identified as having wrongly paid tax, only 14 have not yet had refunds.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/1">Data on the ethnicity of academic staff in higher education are collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 puts a new duty on each university and college to prepare and maintain a written statement of its race equality policy and assess the impact of its policy on students and staff of different racial groups. They must monitor, by reference to those racial groups, the admission and progression of students and the recruitment and career progress of staff, including senior staff, and publish the findings. The higher education funding councils have the statutory responsibility to monitor the ethnicity of all staff in their sectors and publish the results of their monitoring. The Equality Challenge Unit set up by the higher education funding councils and representative bodies will support higher education institutions and funding councils in carrying out their respective duties.</p>

The payment rates that we set within the scheme for annual management options, including field margins and arable reversion, are designed to reflect the average income foregone for these items on a national basis. As every farm is different, it is inevitable that the rates for any given option will be more attractive to some individuals than others, but of course applicants can choose whether or not to enter land into that particular option. I am pleased to say that demand for the scheme, including field margins and arable reversion, continues to be high.</p>
