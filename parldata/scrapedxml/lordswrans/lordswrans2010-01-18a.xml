	<p pid="a.205.3/1">Non-consolidated performance payments are an integral element of the reward package for staff. These payments are used to drive high performance and form part of the pay award for members of staff who demonstrate exceptional performance-for example, by exceeding targets set or meeting challenging objectives. They have to be re-earned each year and do not add to future pay bill costs-for example, pensions. A close and effective link between pay and performance and increased use of variable pay is a key element of the reward arrangements for the Civil Service and the Senior Civil Service (SCS) in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.3/2">Reward arrangements, including the criteria for non-consolidated performance pay, below the SCS, are delegated to individual departments and agencies. For the SCS, departments and agencies are responsible for their own reward arrangements within a framework set by Cabinet Office. The percentage of the pay bill set aside for performance-related awards for the SCS is based on recommendations from the independent Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.3/3">Tables covering the specific information requested have been deposited in the Library of the House. These tables give details of the number people who were eligible for and received a non-consolidated variable pay awards, and the average and maximum payment for a non-consolidated variable pay award, by civil service band, for the three most recent performance years for which the relevant payments have been published in the department's accounts.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.5/1">Since 1997, local authorities have gained significant powers, responsibilities and financial freedoms from central government to enable further devolution of decision-making to local communities. Actions we have taken to date include: increased financial freedom and stability to local government through the first ever three-year finance settlement, reduced ring-fencing, and devolved powers to local authorities, enabling them to create parish councils, make and enforce certain bylaws and increasing their choice in democratic processes such as electoral schemes and leadership style. We have promoted the transfer of assets from local government to local people where these could be better run for community benefits. We have also recently passed legislation that will give citizens greater power to hold local authorities to account and influence local services. This includes the extension of scrutiny arrangements, enabling local people, through their councillors, to influence decisions which affect their day to day lives and give them more say over what their council is doing for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.5/2">This Government's recent public consultation, <I>Strengthening Local Democracy</I>, on which we will respond in due course, affirms our commitment to principles of devolution. In addition, <I>Putting the Front-line first: Smarter Government</I> published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December</phrase> sets out how we will meet new challenges and deliver better public services for lower costs by: driving up standards through strengthening the roles of citizens and civic society; freeing up public services by recasting the relationship between the centre and the front-line and streamlining central government, saving money through sharper delivery. These actions all demonstrate our continuing commitment to devolution.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.5/1">Local authorities are independent bodies responsible for the decisions they make on spending priorities to meet their statutory commitments. Councils have benefited from significant investment since 1997 with a 39 per cent real terms increase in government grant in the first 10 years, and an additional &#163;8.6 billion over the period covered by the current spending review (2008-09 to 2010-11). We want to see local government at the heart of initiatives to provide innovative and better value public services. Councils have a good record on delivering the efficiency gains necessary to provide effective local services. We expect them to make &#163;5.5 billion available over the three years up to 2011 through efficiencies which can be reinvested in local services or used to keep council tax levels down.</p>

Between them, police forces contribute almost &#163;100,000 annually in direct support and additional amounts by way of support in kind. However, in recognition of concerns expressed by the Mountain Rescue Council about such matters, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the honourable Member for Gillingham, has offered to facilitate a meeting with Lord Dubs, interested parties and relevant government departments. As my noble friend also said, the efforts of those who give their time to the mountain rescue service during severe weather events of the kind we are experiencing merit only the highest praise and appreciation.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.3/1">The information requested is not collected centrally. Local planning authorities are required to exercise their powers under the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007 with regard to, among other things, amenity and public safety. This is set out in regulation 3. Factors relevant to public safety include the safety of persons using any highway; whether the advertisement is likely to obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of, any traffic sign; or whether the display of the advertisement is likely to hinder the operation of any device for measuring the speed of any vehicle. These principles are reflected in the standard conditions in Schedule 2 to the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.3/2">Highway safety would also be a material consideration in the determination of planning permissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.6/1">Highway authorities in England have a duty, under Section 41 of the Highways Act 1980, to maintain the roads in their charge. This duty includes maintenance of verges, where these form part of the highway.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.6/2">The Highways Agency provides guidance to its managing agents on the maintenance of highway verges and waysides in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges that specifically covers conservation of flora and wildlife; in the Network Management Manual in relation to people using these areas for walking and riding horses; and in the Routine and Winter Service Code for other amenity aspects. All the Highways Agency's guidance describes management requirements and techniques for maintenance for application across a range of situations on the trunk road network.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.6/3">It is for local authorities to decide on their maintenance strategy for verges. The Department for Transport has not issued specific guidance on this topic (although local authorities may follow the Highways Agency's guidance where appropriate). However, the department endorses the UK Roads Liaison Group's code of practice, &quot;Well-maintained Highways&quot; (available from the House Libraries or from <a href="http://www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org">www.ukroadsliaisongroup.org</a>), which provides advice to authorities on highway maintenance management. It encourages authorities to consider the entire range of road users, including pedestrians and horse riders, and it contains guidance on nature conservation and biodiversity and environmental management. Natural England also provides guidance on the management of quiet lanes and greenways, where a greater emphasis on the needs of pedestrians and horse riders may be appropriate.</p>
