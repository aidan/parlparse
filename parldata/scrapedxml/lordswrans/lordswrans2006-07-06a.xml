	<p pid="a.61.2/1">Localised attempts by the Taliban to test the resolve of the nations deploying military assets into the south of Afghanistan, the coalition's current high tempo of activities across southern Afghanistan and the increased amount of reporting of incidents as a result of the UK presence in Helmand collectively give the impression of a growing insurgency. Overall, however, the security situation is broadly stable, if fragile, in certain areas and the insurgency, which we assess accounts for no more than about one-fifth of all incidents in Helmand, does not pose a credible strategic threat to the stability of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">The UK provides a variety of types of assistance to the Afghan Government's efforts to exercise their authority and to extend the rule of law. Our Armed Forces are undertaking operations in Helmand to help to create an environment in which institutional capacity can be built and development programmes put into effect. This activity forms part of an integrated strategy, involving the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, designed to support Afghanistan's central and provincial institutions. We intend to accelerate this activity as the security situation improves. In addition, in Kabul, the UK supports the Afghan Government's Taliban reconciliation programme in its attempts to draw former Taliban and other insurgents into the accountable, democratic process.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/2">If the political conditions that were agreed by the General Affairs Council in November 2005 are met, negotiations could potentially be concluded by the end of 2006. However, there has been little progress towards the implementation of the agreement of police restructuring, due largely to the obstruction of politicians from the Republika Srpska. Furthermore, there has been little indication of progress towards full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. These two issues represent the greatest obstacles that BiH must overcome in order to conclude an SAA this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.5/1">Illegal manufacture of methamphetamine in so-called &quot;illicit laboratories&quot; carries with it risks of fire, explosion and chemical leakage. As such, implicit in the process are certain environmental hazards relating to exposure to toxic chemicals and exposure to fire or explosion. Anecdotal evidence from the USA suggests that the cost for law enforcement agencies of clearing up an illicit laboratory is high due to the requirement for protective clothing and decontamination equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.5/2">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which advises the Government on issues of drug misuse in the UK, has recently recommended that methamphetamine be reclassified as a class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. We have accepted the recommendation. Its status as a class A drug will enable law enforcement agencies to take a more proactive stance against this dangerous drug.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.5/1">(a)/(c) The purpose of this box is to allow the electoral registration officer to be satisfied that the form has been completed correctly.

	<p pid="a.67.0/1">In 2005-06, there were six programmes within the Global Opportunities Fund (GOF), each with its own priority countries. These are listed below, together with the amount spent in each of the priority countries. This does not include regional and multilateral initiatives that operated across a number of priority countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/2">For 2006-07, the GOF has expanded to 10 programmes with the addition of the Afghanistan counter-narcotics programme, the overseas territories programme, the drugs and crime programme and the migration programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/3">In many cases, there is no fixed allocation to priority countries at the beginning of the financial year. Decisions on allocation of programme funds are made by project selection boards, on the basis of project bids, which are assessed against programme strategies. Furthermore, initial allocations to projects within priority countries may change throughout the year for a range of reasons, such as activities being less expensive than anticipated. It is therefore not possible to give figures for allocations to priority countries at this stage in the financial year.</p>

These forums will allow for a diverse range of members of the British Muslim community, local law enforcement agencies and public service agencies to come together to discuss issues relating to tackling Islamophobia and extremism. They will also provide a safe space for discussion and sharing views, and allow for the channelling of ideas and new thinking in dealing with extremism. Three of these have now taken place.</p>

It will also examine the issues that raise tensions between different groups in different areas and which lead to segregation and conflict.
