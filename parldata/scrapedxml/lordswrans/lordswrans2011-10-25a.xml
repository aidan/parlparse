<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-10-25a.121.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100286" speakername="Lord Henley" colon=":" colnum="121"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/111025w0001.htm#11102553000003">
	<p pid="a.121.2/1">Written Answer WA 88 by Baroness Browning on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June</phrase> explains the reason for the decision to suspend the removal of asylum seekers from the UK to Greece under the Dublin regulation from <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-20">20 September 2010</phrase>. The decision was taken pending the outcome of the case of NS referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union by the Court of Appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">The hearing before the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice took place on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-28">28 June</phrase> and the Advocate General gave her opinion on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-22">22 September</phrase>. The case remains before the Court of Justice and we await its ruling, which will then need to be considered in turn by the Court of Appeal</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/3">In September 2010 there were over 1,000 persons awaiting transfer from the UK to Greece under the Dublin regulation whose applications fell to be considered by the UK Border Agency as a result of the decision to suspend transfers. Since September 2010 the UK Border Agency is aware of around 330 cases where the EURODAC fingerprinting system has notified matches between fingerprints sent by the UK and those already transmitted by Greece. This figure indicates the number of persons whose asylum claims could have fallen to Greece to consider under the Dublin regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/4">Written Answer WA 88 also referred to the impact of the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-21">21 January 2011</phrase> in the case of MSS v Belgium and Greece. That ruling prevents all European countries participating in the Dublin regulation (member states of the European Union. Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) from making such returns to Greece until the situation there has improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/5">Written Answer WA 206 detailed the assistance being provided by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) to facilitate implementation of the Greek Government's National Action Plan for Managed Migration and Asylum Reform (Greek Action Plan) Successful delivery of the Greek Action Plan will ensure that Greece meets its international obligations towards asylum seekers. We will monitor the situation and progress made. When it is clear to us that Greece is meeting its obligations in practice, and that as a result the criticisms detailed in the MSS ruling no longer apply, we will seek to resume Dublin regulation returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/6">Finally the decision not to return asylum seekers to Greece has no effect on the deportation of Greek nationals after criminal conviction in the United Kingdom.</p>

To help ensure that policies achieve their objectives cost effectively and affordably the Government introduced a framework to control levy funded spending by DECC at Budget 2011. This framework, covering FiTs and the renewables obligation, forms part of the Government's public spending framework which Treasury has responsibility for.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.9/1">Following the announcement by the Israeli Government of the creation of a new settlement at Givat Hamatos, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary issued the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.136.9/2">&quot;I am dismayed by the Israeli announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-14">14 October</phrase> of a new settlement at Givat Hamatos. This provocative step, which further encloses East Jerusalem, is particularly disappointing given the international condemnation of the expansion of the Mordot Gilo settlement just a few weeks ago. Settlements are not only illegal under international law, but also undermine the possibility of a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and those working for a sustainable peace. I call again for these announcements to be revoked. Together with our EU and other partners we will make very clear to the Israeli Government the strength of our concern&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.6/1">The UK's position on recognition of a Palestinian state is clear: a Palestinian state is a legitimate goal, and the best way of achieving this is through a comprehensive agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The UK has deliberately reserved its position on the question of recognition of Palestinian statehood while we continue to urge all parties back to talks. Withholding our position in this way, along with other European partners, maintains the pressure on both sides to show the flexibility needed to enable a return to negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.6/2">President Abbas submitted the Palestinian application for full membership of the UN on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-23">23 September</phrase>. No vote is imminent in the Security Council, while the membership committee considers its recommendation. So far we have not been presented with a detailed proposal on which to take a position. Whether the committee returns the issue to the Security Council, or whether President Abbas decides to turn to the General Assembly, the UK will use its vote in a way which increases the likelihood of a return to meaningful negotiations.</p>

It is for each local authority to decide what to charge for parking and the decision should reflect the objectives of their local transport plan. The revenue local authorities raise from on-street parking charges must be used in accordance with Section 55 (as amended) of the RTRA 1984, which limits the use of surplus funds to transport-related objectives or for environmental purposes.

	<p pid="a.146.2/1">Responsibility for tourism in Wales lies with the Welsh Government, with Visit Wales and VisitBritain working together to maximise the opportunities provided by London 2012. Through VisitBritain, the department has established a &#163;100 million overseas tourism marketing campaign, based on public and private sector support, which is aiming to deliver an additional 4 million visitors to the UK and &#163;2 billion extra expenditure over the next four years. We are currently examining options for a complementary tourism marketing effort, supporting the Prime Minister's &quot;GREAT&quot; initiative, to promote Britain abroad-allocations for this have not been finalised yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/2">It was decided in September 2011 that the department would make available up to &#163;4 million from the Public Sector Funding Package for the Olympic and Paralympic Games to support a domestic tourism campaign to maximise the economic benefits from the Torch Relay and the Cultural Olympiad across the UK. This is an investment in a key objective of the Olympic programme: to ensure that the benefits from the Games are felt throughout the UK. The devolved nations have been invited to participate in this campaign, which has been discussed with ministerial colleagues. VisitEngland is working with the tourist boards of the devolved nations to take this forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.3/1">The UK Government have provided significant financial support to the Education Transition Fund (ETF) and the Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM), nationwide programmes of support to school children managed by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). By early 2011 the ETF had distributed over 12 million books to all 5,000 registered primary schools and hundreds of satellite schools not fully registered by the Government of Zimbabwe. And in 2010 BEAM helped ensure that 500,000 vulnerable children attended school.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/2">However, inaccurate data on unregistered schools, some of which may actively avoid detection, present challenges to providing effective support and there are children evicted during Operation Murambatsvina who will not have benefited from these programmes. The UK Government are taking two main measures to address this. First, we will continue to work with local and international partners to maximise coverage during the textbook distribution to secondary schools which is due to start in November 2011. Second, we intend to provide financial support to the second phase of the ETF in 2012 which will specifically provide education and skills support to children and young people who have dropped out of formal education.</p>
