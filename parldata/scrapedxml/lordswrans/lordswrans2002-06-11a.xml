	<p pid="a.17.5/1">Land communications between the Black Sea and the Adriatic are being improved largely through the Corridor VIII road and rail project to link Burgas (Bulgaria) and Durres (Albania). Some work on the various elements of the corridor is under way but we understand that there are differences between some states of the region over rail routes and prioritisation of component projects. We hope that the parties involved will soon approve a memorandum of understanding to enable the work to accelerate.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">A number of projects involving oil pipelines which would bypass the Bosphorus are under consideration. The two most advanced proposals are (a) a pipeline from Burgas via Macedonia to Vlore (Albania) on the Adriatic coast and (b) a pipeline from Burgas with Alexandropoulis (Greece) on the Aegean Sea coast. We understand that no firm decision has been made with regard to construction of either.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.6/1">The Government are determined to tackle child pornography whether on or off line and the criminal law applies equally to both.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/2">The majority of child pornography is placed on servers outside the United Kingdom. However, there are effective measures to deal with it when it appears within our jurisdiction. Since its formation in 1996, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has operated a hotline to enable users to report the presence of child pornography in a newsgroup or website. If the IWF assesses the material as likely to be illegal and it is hosted on a UK server, the internet service provider (ISP) is notified by the IWF and must remove it or risk breaking the law. Over 40,000 items of child pornography have been removed in this way. Details of the site are sent to the police or, if the originator is abroad, to the enforcement agency of the country concerned via the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS).</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/3">In January 2001, we raised the maximum penalties for taking, making, distributing or showing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children to 10 years (from three years) and the maximum penalty for simple possession of such material to five years (from six months).</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/4">In November 2000 the then Home Secretary announced a &pound;25 million investment in the police over three years specifically to fight hi-tech crime and to enhance the capability of the police at national and local level to investigate computer based offences, including the possession and distribution of illegal pornography.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/5">In March 2001, the then Home Secretary established a Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet. The task force began work in May. It is a partnership of representatives from the Internet service and communication providers; the Internet Watch Foundation; PC and software retailers and manufacturers; child welfare organisations; the main Opposition parties; law enforcement agencies and academics.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/6">The task force is looking at proposals for legislation to tackle paedophile &quot;grooming&quot; activity on and off line and best practice models for providers of chat and other Internet services and computer awareness training for the police and child protection practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.6/7">Internationally, the Government are supporting efforts within the European Union and more widely to combat child pornography on the Internet. In November 2001, we signed the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime which will underpin co-operative action between signatory states in respect of computer-related crimes, including the making, distribution and possession of child pornography.</p>

	Prisons: Purposeful Activity

	<p pid="a.25.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2" qnum="HL4444">Whether they will provide a table showing how many hours each week are allocated to purposeful activity in each of HM prisons and young offender centres for (a) remand prisoners and (b) sentenced offenders; and what improvements are planned for the coming year.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-06-11a.25.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="25"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020611/text/20611w02.htm#20611w02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.25.2/1">The Prison Service does not collect centrally information to distinguish time spent in purposeful activity by sentenced prisoners and those on remand. The average weekly purposeful activity time for all prisoners in 2001&ndash;02 in each establishment in England and Wales is given in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/2">Targets agreed with establishments for 2002&ndash;03 aim to increase the overall average purposeful activity time. Additional investment in regimes is intended to increase the proportion of time spent in activities which contribute to reducing crime, such as education, drug and offending behaviour work and resettlement activity.</p>

We have kept this authorisation under close review in the light of intelligence assessments from the Immigration Service. After a year's experience of operating the authorisations, the Immigration Service has found it sufficient to rely on the authorisation made on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-27">27 March 2001</phrase> which permits it to prioritise certain passengers for additional examination on the basis of their nationality. We will keep under review the possible need for further authorisations permitting discrimination on grounds of ethnic or national origin where necessary in respect of specific targeted operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">The Government believe the answer to problems such as gazumping lies in increasing transparency, certainty and speed in the home buying and selling process. That is why we are committed to making it easier for people buying and selling homes through the introduction of the seller's pack. The seller's pack will provide at the very start of the transaction process key information required to enable the transaction to proceed smoothly and quickly. This should reduce significantly the period between offer acceptance to exchange of contracts, thereby reducing the window of opportunity during which problems like gazumping can occur. The necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.5/1">A recent survey of progress towards level 3 EPRs presents a variable picture At present six trusts have complete hospital-wide EPR systems that meet the functionality described under level 3. However many more have some applications in place, for example results reporting and order communications. In addition, some trusts have implemented elements of EPR beyond level 3 with functionality around decision support and knowledge management of picture archiving and communications systems to support improved patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/2">That is why we are taking action by introducing a new national programme and implementation plan for IT in the NHS. This will significantly step up the pace of getting modern IT in place to support frontline patient care and also ensure that IT both drives change and gets the best from the extra resources the NHS is now getting.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/3">The key points from the programme are: a new national IT programme director who will be responsible for the implementation of this programme; stringent national standards for data and IT in the NHS; an improved partnership with the IT industry and healthcare IT suppliers to increase the IT capacity for the NHS; a new procurement strategy to accelerate the impact of IT across the NHS; better central management which will include a ministerial task force chaired by Lord Hunt to ensure the advice and involvement of key healthcare professional and representative groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/4">The intention has always been to have a first generation of electronic records in use across the NHS from 2005. This will be the starting point from which the NHS can begin to apply electronic records as a clinical tool in diagnosis, treatment, interventions and healthcare. By 2008, as indicated in Delivering the NHS Plan, we will expect to see all the advanced applications and functionality of electronic patient records in all PCTs and trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">This information is not available. Central government revenue raised from sport includes receipts from VAT, PAYE and other income taxes, corporation tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty and national insurance contributions. Local government receipts are primarily in the form of business rates, reduced where appropriate by discretionary reliefs. Receipts from these sources would need to be reduced for tax and other reliefs accorded to sports organisations by the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise to arrive at meaningful estimates of net receipts. Detailed estimates of the annual totals of these receipts and reliefs in respect of sporting organisations are not maintained.</p>
