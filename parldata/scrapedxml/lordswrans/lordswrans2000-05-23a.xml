	<p pid="a.76.2/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today issued a consultation document containing the Government's proposals on how the law on involuntary manslaughter might be reformed. The paper accepts and builds on the Law Commission's proposals contained in its report No. 237 Legislating the Criminal Code: Involuntary Manslaughter.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/2">Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/3">This is an important document dealing with a complex area of the law but one which most commentators accept is in need of reform. The Government are deeply indebted to the Law Commission, not only for the detailed consideration it gave to this subject in its report No. 237 but also for its continuing help by participating in the inter-departmental working group we set up to consider its proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/4">The consultation document concentrates on those areas of the Law Commission's proposals which are more contentious or where, for the reasons set out in the document, we have taken a different view from the Law Commission. In a number of areas we have not come to any conclusion but are seeking comments on possible options.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/5">We wish to clarify and rationalise the existing law relating to individual involuntary homicide and we agree with the Law Commission that the law relating to corporate liability for involuntary manslaughter is in need of radical reform. Our proposals in this respect raise important and difficult issues of policy, principle and practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/6">I would urge all those who are concerned about the reform of the law on involuntary manslaughter to read this paper and respond to it.</p>

She is grateful to all those who responded to our consultation document. We have taken full account of their views, and of the many other representations made to us, in considering how the pilot study should run.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/2">The pilot study on financial bonds will begin in October at two posts overseas, Manila and Casablanca. It will run for six months, followed by a further six months to monitor departure from the United Kingdom, and a further, brief period for analysis of the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/3">The scheme is intended to enable more people to visit the United Kingdom by providing an additional facility to prospective visitors in borderline cases where their intention to return is in doubt. It will enable a British citizen or overseas national settled in the United Kingdom who is a family member to provide a financial bond in the form of a cash payment in advance as an additional guarantee that the visitor will leave the United Kingdom at the end of their stay. The scheme will be open to those seeking to visit close family members in the United Kingdom. The amount of the bond will be set at &pound;3,000. The bond will be returned when the visitor leaves the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/4">We shall monitor the scheme closely to ensure that it operates fairly, effectively and swiftly. We shall make available our analysis of the operation of the pilot study when it is complete.</p>

Regulatory decisions concerning the recognition of UK investment exchanges and the continuing compliance of such exchanges with the recognition criteria are matters for the FSA rather than the Government. The Financial Services Authority is accountable to Parliament through Treasury Ministers, and the Financial Services and Markets Bill provides that an annual report by the authority on the discharge of its functions must be laid by the Treasury before Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/2" qnum="HL2492">What is their definition of the present economic cycle and the last economic cycle; what has been the annual deficit or surplus as a percentage of gross domestic product each year of the present cycle; and what was the annual United Kingdom general government deficit or surplus in each year of the last economic cycle.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-05-23a.78.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100399" speakername="Lord McIntosh of Haringey" colon=":" colnum="78"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000523/text/00523w02.htm#00523w02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.78.2/1">As set out in paragraph 2.37 of the Budget 2000 Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report (HC346), present indications are that the economy may have completed a full economic cycle starting in the first half of 1997 and ending in the middle of 1999. This assessment would imply that the current cycle started in the middle of 1999. However, given the closeness to trend and possible measurement errors, this conclusion can only be provisional at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2">Over the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000, the current Budget, by which performance is measured against the golden rule, was in surplus by -0.7 per cent of GDP in 1997-98, 0.9 per cent in 1998-99 and 1.9 per cent in 1999-2000 (i.e. an average surplus of 0.7 per cent over the cycle, consistent with meeting the golden rule). For 2000-01 the projection is for a current surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP. General government net borrowing was 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1997-98, -0.6 per cent in 1998-99 and -1.3 per cent in 1999-2000, and is projected to be -0.6 per cent in 2000-01 (where a negative number implies a net repayment).</p>

The Post Office tells me that it does not hold records of special stamp issues which have been made on major events in the history of the United Kingdom, and this information could not be obtained without disproportionate cost. It tells me that the &quot;Great Britain Concise, 1999 Edition&quot;, by Stanley Gibbons, provides a definitive list of GB stamps since 1840. It has also pointed out that the Millennium Stamps programme last year covered over 1,000 years of British history and achievement.
