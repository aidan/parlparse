	<p pid="a.473.8/1">These data on outstanding debt published by the Bank of England are at nominal values (including securitisations) and already account for reductions through write-offs. They are prepared in line with international statistical standards rather than the accounting standards of the published accounts of banks, so this may still not reflect the written-down value on individual banks' balance sheets.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.8/2">As policies regarding depreciation/amortisation and provisioning for impairments vary by individual institution, we do not have access to sufficient information to provide a more accurate estimate of either written-down value or book value. Although the Bank of England does collect data on provisions for impairments, this is not yet publicly available. In addition, these data are only collected for aggregate household lending (ie, not credit card lending specifically).</p>
	<p pid="a.473.8/3">As part of their regular monitoring of the credit market, the Government track levels of both outstanding debt and write-offs for credit cards, as well as an annualised write-off rate on credit card lending.

	<p pid="a.474.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-01">1 November</phrase> we published our response to the consultation on business finance issues, <I>Financing </I><I>a</I><I> Private Sector Recovery</I><I>,</I> which is available at <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/businessfinance">http://www.bis.gov.uk/businessfinance</a>.

	<p pid="a.474.2/3">There are various measures in place to support access to finance for businesses and encourage banks to increase loans to small businesses. The Government aim to continue to support and improve the diversity of sources and access to finance for SMEs and businesses through:</p>
	<p pid="a.474.2/4">a four-year extension to the enterprise finance guarantee (EFG) making around &#163;2 billion available to viable SMEs without a credit history or lacking sufficient collateral; andwelcoming the banks' announcement of a new &#163;1.5 billion business growth fund, to provide equity funding of between &#163;2 million and &#163;10 million for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) with strong growth potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.2/5">The Government will also work with the British Bankers' Association's Business Finance Taskforce and the banks on a range of commitments set out in their response to the Green Paper and which will assist SMEs with access to finance issues, including their commitments on improving the way they deal with complaints from SME customers. The task force report <I>Supporting UK Business</I> is available at <a href="http://www.bba.org.uk/downloads/bba/Business_Finance_Taskforce_report.pdf">http://www.bba.org.uk/downloads/bba/Business_Finance_Taskforce_report.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.2/6">The Government continue to monitor performance against the legally binding lending commitments agreed with the Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Lloyds Banking Group. These will deliver &#163;50 billion and &#163;44 billion of business lending this year respectively, providing businesses with capital for investment and growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.2/7">Finally, we recognise the importance of robust competition in banking; therefore the Independent Commission on Banking will consider the structure of the UK banking sector, and look at structural and non-structural measures to reform the banking system and promote competition. The commission will produce a final report by the end of September 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.475.5/1">All new claims for income-replacement benefits on the grounds of a disability or health condition are for employment and support allowance. Claimants are assessed via the work capability assessment to see if they are fit for work or are entitled to benefit on the grounds of having limited capability for work. For all initial assessments completed to the end of June 2010, 65 per cent were found fit for work.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.5/2">We are currently beginning the process of reassessing around 1.5 million people in receipt of the old-style incapacity benefits to see whether they are entitled to employment and support allowance. We do anticipate that some of those people will be found fit for work when they are assessed, and will, therefore, not be entitled to employment and support allowance. The department's initial projection is that approximately 23 per cent of the 1.5 million are expected to be assessed as fit for work and move off incapacity benefits. These figures are early projections for reassessment outcomes-there are no targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.5/3">We recognise that some people genuinely cannot work because of disability or ill health, and have always been clear that the most vulnerable, including those with disabilities or health conditions, will be protected. There will always be a safety net of benefits to support those who have no means of supporting themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.5/4">However, with the right help many people currently receiving incapacity benefits could move into employment. It is not right that these people are effectively written off to a life on benefits. Our reforms are designed to ensure that more people with disabilities or health conditions are, where appropriate, helped to move into employment, which is positive for individuals, families and the state.</p>

These discussions reveal that, like the UK, Germany and France include re-export controls in their export control systems. The UK, and both Germany and France fully examine the risk of diversion of arms when deciding whether or not to grant an export licence. All countries are limited in their enforcement of re-export provisions by questions of national jurisdiction. The UK Government continue to support the UN negotiations towards a robust and effective international arms trade treaty, as the best way to ensure high, legally binding standards for the export of conventional arms globally; the UK continues to pursue this goal, including through consultations with other EU member states, the US, China and Russia.</p>

	<p pid="a.478.2/1">An export licence is required to export arms and other military equipment from the United Kingdom. All applications for export licences are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis by BIS's Export Control Organisation against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. The Government will not issue an export licence where to do so would be inconsistent with the criteria or other relevant announced commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.2/2">In particular, criterion 3 concerns the &quot;internal situation in the country of final destination, as a function of the existence of tensions or armed conflicts&quot;, and states that the Government will not issue licences for exports which would provoke or prolong armed conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflicts in the country of final destination. As part of our assessment against the criteria we take into account the risk that goods could be re-exported in undesirable conditions. Criterion 7 concerns the &quot;existence of a risk that the equipment will be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions&quot;, and if there is a clear risk of diversion or re-export to undesirable end-users a licence will not be issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.2/3">Aside from the criteria, and with regards to business and commercial considerations, Article 10 of Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP specifies that member states may where appropriate also take into account the effect of proposed exports on their economic, social, commercial and industrial interests, but that these factors will not affect the application of the criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.2/4">More information about the criteria, including a link to the full text, is available on the export control pages on the Business Link website at <a href="http://www">http://www</a>. businesslink.gov.uk/exportcontrol under &quot;Assessment of Export Licence Applications-criteria and policy&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.5/1">We understand that many of the estimated 20,000 refugees who crossed the border into Thailand earlier this month have now returned home. Non-governmental organisations and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) responded well to the crisis and although stretched, we understand that they were able to provide sufficient emergency food, water, shelter and medical assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.5/2">Our ambassador in Bangkok raised refugee issues with the Thai Government on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-18">18 November 2010</phrase>. The Thai Government assured us that they were helping to provide temporary assistance and that no forcible repatriations had taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.5/3">The Thai/Burma border remains unstable with ongoing tensions between the Burmese army and Karen militia in eastern Burma. There have been further reports of refugees fleeing across the border as fighting breaks out, with some returning home as fighting subsides. The situation remains in flux. We are in close touch with UNHCR and are monitoring developments closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.8/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills provides funding to support the Union Learning Fund (ULF) and unionlearn, the TUC's learning and skills organisation, which administers the fund on behalf of the department. The main purpose of this budget is to enable trade unions and union learning representatives (ULRs) to work with employers, employees and learning providers to encourage greater take-up of learning and raise skill levels in the workplace. All ULF projects are bound by contracts with defined learning targets and outcomes and are subject to independent audit. Annual expenditure in each of the past five financial years has been as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.488.8/2">2005-06-&#163;15.4 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.488.8/3">2006-07-&#163;16.9 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.488.8/4">2007-08-&#163;18.4 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.488.8/5">2008-09-&#163;21.4 million; and</p>
	<p pid="a.488.8/6">2009-10-&#163;21.5 million</p>
	<p pid="a.488.8/7">The total amount of funding provided for ULF since its inception in 1998 is &#163;142.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.8/8">Unions and their ULRs play a significant role in helping adults, particularly those who are poorly qualified and with no background in continuing their education, to become engaged and more confident with learning and improve their skills. In 2009-10 over 233,000 learners in workplaces across the country were helped back into learning by the Union Learning Fund and union learning representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.8/9">The total amount of funding received by all trade unions from the Union Learning Fund for the financial year 2009-10 is set out in the table below.</p>
