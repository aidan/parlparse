	<p pid="a.140.2/2">HSE already has arrangements in place to ensure the availability of information to consumers and others relating to gas safety issues and carbon monoxide. Information is provided via free printed material, HSE's website and its telephone advice infoline service. HSE also provides a specific gas safety advice freephone service, which it does not do for any other hazard. In past years, HSE has run both targeted and general gas safety and carbon monoxide awareness campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/3">The primary focus of HSE's work to reduce the incidence of carbon monoxide poisoning is to ensure that consumers use competent engineers to undertake work on their appliances.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/4">The gas safe register was established by HSE in 2009 to maintain a register of competent gas businesses and operatives, drive improvements to gas safety and add value for consumers and engineers. It also provides consumers with a clear route to locate competent engineers and works to promote better public awareness of gas safety risks and the dangers arising from carbon monoxide, through consumer awareness-raising campaigns in various media formats, including TV advertising.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/5">In 2009, HSE reconstituted the cross-government group on gas safety and carbon monoxide awareness. The objective of this group was to ensure a joined-up approach across departments, devolved Administrations and other government bodies to improve gas safety and tackle carbon monoxide risks from all fuels.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.5/2">The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 already requires employers to consider the risks to employees from their work and protect them appropriately. In applying this legislation, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) requires employers to use a proportionate and measured approach to assessing risks to their employees and to mitigate those risks accordingly, including the provision of suitable protective equipment. On this basis, the selection and use of specific personal monitoring equipment, is a matter for the employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.5/3">This is the same principle that applies to all industries for which HSE has enforcing authority responsibility and is a reflection of the goal-setting nature of health and safety legislation, which allows an employer to choose the most appropriate equipment for the task in hand. It also allows employers to update their protective equipment as new items become available, without requiring the Government to make legislative changes to reflect any technological or other advances.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.3/1">In recognition of the abnormal damage caused by the exceptional winter weather at the end of 2010, we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-23">23 February 2011</phrase> that we will be allocating at least &#163;100 million of extra resource funding to local highway authorities in England for repairing potholes.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/2">The Secretary of State for Transport has written to leaders of all local highway authorities setting out the conditions for this exceptional additional funding. For authorities that responded by <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-16">16 March 2011</phrase> confirming their acceptance to these conditions, we undertook to inform them of their allocations shortly after this date. As the damage caused by severe weather was widespread across the country, and in order to minimise administrative burdens for all concerned, we intend to distribute the funds formulaically based on the Department for Transport's existing highways maintenance capital funding formula, which takes into account road length and condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/3">The extra funding has been made possible because the department is expected to deliver a saving on its budget for 2010-11, as a result of our prudent financial management, including additional efficiencies made this financial year. It remains the responsibility of local highway authorities to prioritise their resources and build in appropriate resilience as part of their overall maintenance programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/4">Funding decisions for roads in Wales are a matter for the Welsh Assembly Government. However the Welsh Assembly Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-01">1 December 2010</phrase> an extra &#163;7 million and, in February 2011, a further &#163;15 million for local authorities in Wales to help them tackle the numerous potholes left by the recent snow storms. This funding, which is additional to the annual grant already allocated, will allow work to begin immediately.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.5/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport commissioned the Sport and Recreation Alliance to review regulatory burdens which affect sports clubs in the UK. The review will examine what prevents or hinders sports clubs and volunteers providing sport, and the department anticipates them coming forward with a range of policy recommendations with the objective of cutting red tape at grass-roots level. The review is due to conclude in March.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/2">The &#163;135 million sport legacy strategy, Places People Play, launched in November, will be funded by lottery money and has been developed in partnership with Sport England, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), the British Olympic Association (BOA) and the British Paralympic Association (BPA).</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/3">As part of the programme, the Inspired Facilities fund will see Sport England invest &#163;50 million in creating a tangible legacy by improving up to 1,000 local sports facilities. Applications for funding will be open in the summer for the first of five &#163;10 million funding rounds, with the final one in 2014-15. Community sports clubs will be eligible to apply for the fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/4">In addition, the Iconic Facilities fund will support innovative and sustainable large-scale multi-sport facilities projects that will become beacons for grass-roots sports. Thirty million pounds of capital National Lottery funding will be invested by Sport England over three years. Applications for the first &#163;10 million funding round were accepted until December 2010 with further funding rounds opening in autumn 2011 and 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.5/5">The department would also encourage every club to consider registering as a community amateur sports club (CASC). The scheme has provided valuable funding to sports clubs which allows them to benefit from certain tax reliefs, similar to those normally given to charities.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.5/1">We have made clear to the Government of Uganda on several occasions that we are opposed to actions that will have a negative effect on the human rights of Ugandans, including the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. This includes our opposition to the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, tabled by a private Member, which would further criminalise homosexuality if passed into law. We have also raised our concerns to the Ugandan Government over an article that appeared in a Ugandan tabloid newspaper late last year, which apparently incited violence against homosexuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.5/2">Our high commission in Kampala is in close touch with civil society groups that are campaigning for LGBT rights in Uganda, to which they have offered their support.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.8/1">My honourable friend Henry Bellingham noted in his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-22">22 February 2011</phrase> that we fully endorse the preliminary findings of the EU and Commonwealth observation missions to Uganda, which noted that while there have been improvements in the overall conduct and transparency of the elections, they were marred by avoidable shortcomings in their organisation. We share the observer mission's concern that the power of incumbency was exercised to such an extent as to compromise severely the level playing field between the competing candidates and political parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.8/2">We will encourage all those elected and all Uganda's political stakeholders, including Uganda's Government, political parties and the Electoral Commission, to reflect on the assessments of the independent observers, build on positive developments, and address the shortcomings identified in order to strengthen pluralistic, multi-party democracy in Uganda.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.2/1">Implementation of Section 19 of the UK Borders Act 2007 is currently being planned by the United Kingdom Border Agency. We expect to be in a position to commence implementation of Section 19 later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/2">Section 57: On introduction of a Bill into the House of Commons any provision which gives rise to a charge on public funds should be printed in italics, indicating that its inclusion in the Bill is provisional, pending approval of that expenditure by the House of Commons. Where expenditure is incurred across a number of provisions, each of which would normally require italicisation, the inclusion of a clause, such as Section 57 of the 2007 Act, is an alternative to italicising each section of a Bill which would attract expenditure. Once the Bill is enacted the clause is no longer relevant, as it will have been approved by the House of Commons, and does not require explicit commencement.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.5/1">The road safety aspects and potential infrastructure impacts of allowing longer lorries have been considered in two recent, related studies. The first, which reported in 2008 (reference: TRL Report PPR 285), included an assessment of the structural road pavement wear associated with longer and/or longer and heavier goods vehicles (LHVs) but did not consider the scrubbing effects that such vehicles might have on roundabouts. Copies are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.5/2">The second study has considered a range of potential impacts of allowing a small increment in the length of semi-trailers to permit articulated goods vehicles with a loading length up to 15.65 metres, which is the same as is already permitted for rigid truck/drawbar trailer combination lorries. This includes consideration of pavement wear caused by turning lorries. The Government are looking carefully at the economic, safety and environmental arguments for and against such an increase and hope to publish the results of the study shortly. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House when published.</p>

	<p pid="a.165.2/1">The coalition Government are committed to putting girls and women at the heart of our development assistance. All of the Department for International Development's (DfID's) education programmes will have a focus on girls and young women. We will particularly concentrate on enabling girls to progress through to secondary school, where the largest benefits for themselves, their families and society are achieved. DfID supports national priorities and where these include the provision of education services to adult women we will support that.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.2/2">We will increase the numbers of girls in primary and secondary school in all 23 country programmes where we give support to education, and will assist girls to stay in school beyond primary level to ensure they get the full benefits from education which will transform their lives and opportunities. Draft country plans identify measures which include: stipends, vouchers, cash transfers and transport for girls; increasing numbers of female teachers; improving facilities for girls (eg toilets); and programmes to reduce violence against girls. DfID will be supporting over 9 million children in primary school by 2014, of whom at least half will be girls. Our focus will be on girls completing primary education, with good learning achievement, so they have an opportunity to progress to secondary level. By 2014, we will be supporting 700,000 girls in secondary education. We are looking at what more we can do to support girls to get into school and improve their learning.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.2/1">The extension of droit de suite (artist's resale right) to the works of deceased artists is not a recent proposal by the European Union, but rather a requirement of directive 2001/84/EC (&quot;the directive&quot;), that entered into force in September 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/2">The UK took advantage of a derogation under the directive, which was available to member states who previously did not have resale right arrangements. This derogation enabled us delay the application of the resale right system to sales of in-copyright works by deceased artists. This derogation initially ran to January 2010, but the previous Government exercised an option under the directive to extend the derogation period for a further two years to January 2012. There are no further extension options available under the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.2/3">The most recent work done for Government to assess the impact of the directive on the art market in the UK is to be found in a report commissioned by the UK Intellectual Property Office from the Intellectual Property Institute and carried out by Professor Stefan Szymanski.
