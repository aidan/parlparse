However, capacity in the lines and nets segment of the fleet is already within the MAGP IV objectives for end 2001, and the tonnage of shellfish fixed gear vessels is close to the 2001 objectives. We do not therefore plan to hold a decommissioning scheme in present circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.3/1">There is no policy that would prevent the British Transport Police (BTP) from attending calls from freight train drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/2">As a port, Tyne Dock is outside the jurisdiction of the BTP and is policed by Northumbria Police. When the BTP control room received the report of the attack on the freight train they were advised that Northumbria Police were in attendance, that the culprits had fled and that no injuries or damage had occurred. At this time all BTP officers in the vicinity were attending other incidents of trespass and vandalism and it was decided that they should continue to attend their original calls. Had any BTP officers been available then they would have attended the incident at Tyne Dock.</p>

The Government agree with the HGAC that this is an issue which should be kept under close review in future. The Government accept the main findings of the HGAC's report. They have today asked the Human Genetics Commission, which is the successor to the HGAC, to take note of the HGAC's recommendations, have suggested ways of taking them forward and have drawn attention to the measures it has already taken in this area. The Government have also asked the HGC to consider the next steps by including this issue in the Commission's wider study of the uses of genetic information and to provide advice to Ministers in due course.

	<p pid="a.7.8/2" class="indent">the standard for single rooms in existing care homes will be 10 sq m from 2007;</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/3" class="indent">the standard for single rooms in new care homes will be 12 sq m from 2002;</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/4" class="indent">wheelchair users should have rooms of 12 sq m and door widths of 800mm for their own accommodation and communal rooms;</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/5" class="indent">each resident should, in addition to the above, have a minimum of 4.1 sq m of communal day space within the care home;</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/6" class="indent">shared rooms in existing homes may constitute no more than 20 per cent of overall resident places from 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/7">To ensure flexibility for existing provision that does not meet all these standards but is otherwise of good quality, specific criteria will be set out over the standard relating to room sizes to allow some rooms which do not currently meet the 10 sq m standard to remain in use. These criteria will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/8" class="indent">an expectation that no room should fall below 9.3 sq m (equivalent to 100 sq ft) provided compensatory space either in the form of en-suite facilities or additional communal day space which residents can use individually if they wish is made available;</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/9" class="indent">homes which provide spacious individual rooms but do not currently meet the standard of 4.1 sq m communal space per resident will be allowed to meet a lower minimum of 3.7 sq m.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/10" class="indent">The net result should be that a total space of 14.1 sq m per resident is provided, with some flexibility about how it is deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/11">The standards for nine out of the 11 topic areas that we consulted upon in Fit for the Future? received overwhelming support and these will form the basis for the full set of national minimum standards which the Government will publish later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.8/12">We have written to honourable and right honourable Members as well as to the residential and nursing home organisations and other relevant bodies which have made representations on these issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.3/1">The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) employed four content editors; Martin Newman, Tania Watson, Tim Gardom and Ben Evans. The Editors were employed on a consultancy basis on different daily rates of pay reflecting the prior relevant experience of each individual and the nature of the jobs undertaken. In each case these were individuals who were recommended to NMEC by leading design companies, board members and other advisors to NMEC. Under the terms of their contracts, NMEC is obliged to seek permission before disclosing information about terms of employment. NMEC has written to the individuals requesting permission and, once replies have been received, I will write to the noble Earl.</p>

His role developed as he became more involved in aspects of the Dome's content and he took on the role of content editor. In the early days of the project it was imperative to assemble a core management team quickly who could commit themselves to a unique, time-limited project. The post was therefore not advertised.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.9/1">The New Millennium Experience Company is a Non-Departmental Public Body which is in receipt of National Lottery funding and is accountable to Parliament via its shareholder. It is therefore important that adequate liaison exists between the company, the Millennium Commission, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and its shareholder. This function is carried out by NMEC's Government liaison team. When Ben Evans joined NMEC in the summer of 1997 he was, briefly, part of this team, before becoming one of a number of content editors in the autumn of that year.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.3/1">The UK has given full support to the ground-breaking work of Ambassador Robert Fowler, Chairman of the Angola Sanctions Committee, to ensure that UN sanctions against UNITA are made to bite. We financially supported the Angola Expert Panel to the tune of 200,000 US dollars. The panel investigated reports of sanctions breaking and reported to the UN Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase>. The Security Council welcomed the panel's report in UN Security Council Resolution 1295, adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-18">18 April 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/2">The report gave a detailed analysis of the problem of sanctions breaking. It reports the alleged involvement of a number of individuals. For example, it states that the central figure in UNITA's external procurement and diamond trade operations is Marcelo Moises Dachala, known as &quot;Karrica&quot;, based in Ougadougou, and that Imad Kabir &quot;has been purchasing weapons for Savimbi which were being delivered to Kinshasa. From 1995-1996 until the fall of Andulo in October 1999, Kabir is said to have served as UNITA's primary broker for importing arms and military equipment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/3">Security Council Resolution 1295 (2000) requested the UN Secretary-General to establish a monitoring mechanism to collect further information and investigate relevant leads relating to allegations of violations of UN sanctions against UNITA and report to the Security Council by <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-18">18 October 2000</phrase>. That mechanism has now been established. On <phrase class="date" code="">11 July</phrase> the Secretary-General appointed five experts to serve on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/4">We greatly welcome the fact that Ms Christine Gordon, a British national and independent writer, consultant and researcher, has been appointed to the monitoring mechanism, and wish her well in her important task.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/5">Sanctions breaking must be stopped. The expert panel's report, the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1295 (2000) and the establishment of the monitoring mechanism show that the international community will no longer tolerate sanctions breaking.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.4/2" qnum="HL3336">Whether the United Nations has introduced an embargo on the import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-07-24a.18.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="18"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000724/text/00724w05.htm#00724w05_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.18.5/1">The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1306(2000) on <phrase class="date" code="">5 July</phrase> which prohibits the direct or indirect import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to the territory of member states. The resolution also decides that rough diamonds controlled by the Government of Sierra Leone through a certificate of origin regime shall be exempt from the measures when the UN Sanctions Committee on Sierra Leone has reported to the council that an effective regime is fully in operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/2">Britain played a leading role in promoting Resolution 1306 in the UN Security Council. Diamonds are at the heart of the tragedy in Sierra Leone and this resolution sends a powerful signal about the need to end the trade in conflict diamonds from Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/3">The embargo on Sierra Leone rough diamonds is established for an initial period of 18 months. At the end of this period the Security Council will review the situation in Sierra Leone, including the extent of the Government's authority over the diamond-producing areas, in order to decide whether to extend the restrictions for a further period and, if necessary, to modify them or adopt further measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.5/4">The embargo is implemented in the UK by means of an amendment to the Open General Import Licence. It is implemented in a similar manner in the Isle of Man. Orders in Council under the United Nations Act 1946 have been made to implement the restrictions in the other Crown Dependencies and in the Overseas Territories.</p>

This date is key for delivering operational effectiveness gains, which would otherwise be lost or significantly delayed. Two critical ingredients of reform are changes in governance and leadership of the new service and it is in these areas that urgent expenditure would be incurred. The critical path for achieving the target date is dependent upon starting the process of selection to the 42 new probation boards and the recruitment of chief officers for the eight amalgamated services by July.</p>
