These are explained in simpler terms in a booklet issued for all serving personnel. Work is currently under way to complete guidance on the application of the rules for staff operating the scheme. The Ministry of Defence will also be revising details of the scheme to cover points that were not fully addressed in the original rules (such as the fact we would not expect there to be appeal rights for temporary awards). As with any new scheme, occasional amendments are likely to be needed, to reflect wider legislative changes or as practical experience reveals unforeseen circumstances which need to be addressed. Claimants will be advised of developments, in so far as they affect them. Where significant changes are proposed, the departments will provide key interested parties, including ex-service organisations, with an opportunity to comment. We have no plans for changes which would affect the basic principles of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.167.8/1">The EU does not have a defence budget. The majority of costs for EU-led military missions are met by the sending member state. However, member states have set up a mechanism to channel their national contributions towards a limited number of identified &quot;common costs&quot; for individual EU-led military missions. Under this mechanism, the UK, France and Germany combined pay 56.41 per cent of the total common costs. These are divided between member states according to a key based on each state's GNP. In monetary terms, the UK's contribution to the three military missions to date&mdash;CONCORDIA (Macedonia), ALTHEA (Bosnia) and ARTEMIS (Congo)&mdash;has been &pound;11.850 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.169.5/28">The Government are very concerned to tackle assaults on public sector workers which are particularly damaging to society. The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 makes it an offence to obstruct or interfere with an employee of a fire and rescue authority when they are carrying out their duties. In addition there is a hierarchy of offences against the person where injury results. Sentencing guidelines make it clear that any attack committed against anyone working in the public sector can be considered an aggravating factor that a court must take into account when considering the sentence to impose.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.5/29">Any assault on firefighters is unacceptable. It is important that such incidents are reported and that the fire and rescue authorities collaborate with the police so that offenders are prosecuted and punished appropriately.</p>

	<p pid="b.177.5/1">Responsibility for the telephone system in the Parliamentary Estate is divided between the Parliamentary Communications Directorate (PCD), which takes responsibility for the cable infrastructure and for arranging moves and changes, and a contractor, Siemens, which is responsible for telecoms maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.5/2">The performance of the telecoms maintainer is monitored on a monthly basis, with clearance targets of between two and six hours, depending on the type of fault and when the fault was reported.

	<p pid="b.177.5/3">In June this year this figure declined to 67.09 per cent This was due to an increase in the number of faults reported in the aftermath of the general election when a large number of moves and changes were required. A significant number of faults were reported to Siemens which were, in fact, the responsibility of PCD, but which were not passed on to PCD to resolve.</p>
	<p pid="b.177.5/4">PCD and Siemens have now reached an agreement to avoid a repeat of this confusion over responsibility, and to ensure that all faults are allocated and resolved promptly.</p>
