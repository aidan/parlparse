	<p pid="a.29.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-24">24 December 2002</phrase> (the nearest date to <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-25">25 December 2002</phrase> for which data are available), the total prison population was 70,320. There were no prisoners being held in police cells under Operation Safeguard on that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-24">24 January 2003</phrase> (the nearest date to <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-25">25 January 2003</phrase> for which data are available), the prison population was 70,505. There were no prisoners being held in police cells under Operation Safeguard on that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-25">25 February 2003</phrase> the prison population was 72,144. There were no prisoners being held in police cells under Operation Safeguard on that date. The total useable operational capacity of the Prison Service estate was 73,556: this is the maximum number of prisoners that the estate could normally expect to hold without recourse to police cells. There is a possibility that police cells may be required in some parts of the country before useable operational capacity is reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-25">25 February 2003</phrase> the total useable operational capacity of the open prison estate was 4,357. There were 887 vacancies in open prisons on that date. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-25">25 February 2003</phrase> there were 4,513 prisoners who can be reasonably trusted in open conditions. A significant number of these prisoners will not be placed in dedicated open prisons, the main reason being that they are more appropriately located in closed conditions, where their individual treatment, programme and or resettlement needs can be more effectively met. Some of these prisoners, such as fine defaulters, are serving short-term sentences whose length makes a move to open conditions impractical. Some may also need to be held in a closed prison while their specific healthcare needs are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/5">The Prison Service has population management procedures in place to monitor prison population levels. Should it be necessary, the Prison Service will activate Operation Safeguard so that police cells throughout the country can be used to hold those sentenced to a term of imprisonment for whom a Prison Service establishment place is not immediately available. The Prison Service last used police cells for this purpose on the night of <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-20">20 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/6">The information given above is for Prison Service establishments in England and Wales. As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-25">25 February 2003</phrase>, the Northern Ireland Prison Service has certified accommodation for 1,385 prisoners. Their prison population on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-24">24 December 2002</phrase> was 1,013. It was 1,091 on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-24">24 January 2003</phrase> and 1,101 on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-24">24 February 2003</phrase>. The Northern Ireland Prison Service does not, and has not, used police cells and its estate does not contain any open prisons.</p>

However, greater use of this type of data sharing was recommended by the Cabinet Office study on identity fraud and the UK Passport Service and the DVLA are planning to share information with the consent of individuals, which would be fully in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. In addition to helping to counter identity fraud, this link will provide customer benefits as people applying for photocard driving licences will no longer need to send in their passports to DVLA to confirm their identity.</p>

The majority of patients with reading difficulties as a result of vision loss will have access to optical low vision aids such as high-powered reading lenses, magnifiers and telescopes, on loan through the Hospital Eye Service.

	<p pid="a.36.5/1">A substantial body of research has indicated that the difference in the unemployment rates between Protestants and Catholics is due to a complex interaction over time of a number of factors. These factors include characteristics such as age, marital status, number of children, family experience of unemployment, housing tenure and educational qualifications; regional factors such as area of residence, sectoral performance and demographic factors such as labour force growth and migration and the unwillingness of some job seekers to consider employment in particular geographic areas (referred to as the chill factor). Discrimination has also been considered as a possible contributory factor but it is unclear the extent to which this has, or continues to be, an influence.</p>
