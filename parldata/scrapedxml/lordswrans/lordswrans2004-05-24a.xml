	<p pid="a.110.0/1">When a nuclear submarine leaves operational service, its reactor is defuelled at the earliest practicable opportunity and the highly radioactive used fuel in the core is removed for long-term storage at BNFL Sellafield. Certain reusable equipment is also removed and the submarine is stored safely afloat. Within a year of shutdown of the reactor, the majority or the submarine's radioactive fittings either can be classified as low-level waste, or will meet free release standards. The remaining radioactive material, which is mainly irradiated steel in the reactor pressure vessel, and which would be classified as intermediate level waste, is retained in the reactor compartment. The level of radioactivity in the reactor pressure vessel reduces by about a third of its original value over the subsequent 30 years. However, even at the start of the storage period the robust shielding of the submarine's hull ensures that radiation levels on the outside of the submarine are so low that it is barely measurable against normal background radiation: standing beside the hull of one of these defuelled submarines continuously for 20 days results in a similar dose to flying to California once. Moreover, the radiation level inside the reactor compartment is low enough to allow radiation workers entry, under standard control procedures, at any time. Leaving the irradiated steel within submarines is therefore very safe and presents no direct hazard to the workforce, general public or surrounding environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.3/1">This change was part of a broader restructuring of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, designed to improve its capacity to deliver its key objectives. Under the new structure, responsibility for fire precautions required in new buildings and those required for the use of buildings once completed have been brigaded together, and alongside policy and delivery relating to other aspects of the built environment, within the new Sustainable Communities Group. The lead responsibility for the fire and rescue service itself is located within the new Local Government and Fire Group, which leads on local services generally. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's board remains responsible, under ministerial oversight, for ensuring that the current strategic approach to fire prevention, fire protection and service reform will be maintained and where possible enhanced. The practitioners' forum and the business and community safety forum are currently being consulted on a proposal for the PSA target on fire, which the office plans to adopt in respect to this strategic approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.18/1">The red squirrel is the subject of one of 391 species action plans prepared as part of the UK biodiversity action plan. The UK Red Squirrel Group, a partnership of public private and voluntary organisations led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, is responsible for delivery of the red squirrel action plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.18/2">The UK Red Squirrel Group has consulted widely among scientists, woodland managers and conservation bodies on a prioritisation process for the UK's surviving red squirrel populations. This identified the areas where action to maintain red squirrels is most likely to be effective in the long term including the Isle of Wight, the Poole harbour islands and the north Tyne area. The continuing expansion of the grey squirrel is to be expected and red squirrel conservation is focused on limiting that expansion in areas where the two species overlap. Some significant progress has been made in developing more effective and targeted ways of defending healthy populations of red squirrels against replacement by the grey squirrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.18/3">In northern England, the priorities have now been translated into management plans for key forest areas, where we believe a combination of large-scale habitat management in forests and buffer areas allied to surveillance and targeted grey squirrel control gives the red squirrel the best chance of survival. These plans will form the basis of a bid for heritage lottery funding within the next few months by a consortium of government agencies, wildlife trusts and private landowners.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.18/4">The Isle of Wight Red Squirrel Forum, led by the Isle of Wight Council, has drawn up an action plan for the red squirrel population on the island. The plan, which is supported by the UK Red Squirrel Group, includes contingency arrangements that will trigger immediate actions in the event of grey squirrel incursions. The owners and managers of Poole harbour islands are working with the Forestry Commission and English Nature on a joint Poole harbour red squirrel management plan, including contingency arrangements in the event of a grey squirrel incursion.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.18/5">The Forestry Commission is currently engaged in the preparation of a policy statement on grey squirrels. This is one of the commitments made in the response to the recommendations contained in the <i>Sustaining England's Woodlands</i> review.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.21/1">The <i>Rabies Bulletin Europe</i>, produced by the World Health Organisation, is published every quarter and reports on the number of rabies cases in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.21/2">When the Channel Tunnel was built in 1993, there were 261 rabies cases in France, two in Belgium and 845 in Germany. Over the years mainland Europe has eradicated rabies by widespread oral vaccination programmes. In 2003 France and Belgium had no cases of rabies and Germany had 24. The nearest occurence of wildlife rabies (during the last quarter of 2003) to the Channel Tunnel was in the Hessen region of Germany.</p>
