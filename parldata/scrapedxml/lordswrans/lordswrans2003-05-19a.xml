	<p pid="a.57.8/2">Her Majesty's Government welcome the co-operation the Israeli Government have provided in investigating the death of Mr Hook and hope for similar co-operation into the incidents involving Mr Hurndall and Mr Miller also. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has asked the Israeli Government for full and transparent investigations into these incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.8/3">Her Majesty's Government are deeply concerned about the number of incidents in which civilians, both Palestinian and foreign, have been killed or injured as a result of encounters with the Israel defence forces. We have urged the Israeli Government to take steps to revise their tactics in the Occupied Territories in order to reduce the likelihood of such incidents happening again.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">I represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-08">8 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/2">The A points were approved as in document PTS A 21 (8922/03) (a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House). This included adoption of the protocol amending the convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes as regards the creation of a customs files identification database (known as FIDE) which Ministers subsequently signed in the margins of the Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">Ministers discussed the directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection with a view to resolving the outstanding reservations. However, one member state in particular maintained reservations on the text, including the definition of a refugee and on the rights and benefits to be accorded to those with subsidiary protection status. The presidency reiterated its intention to seek agreement to the directive at the June JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/4">The Council agreed to exclude refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection from the scope of the directive concerning the status of third country nationals who are long-term residents. This followed confirmation by the Commission that it would table by early 2004 a separate proposal for a directive addressing the needs of those groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/5">The presidency summarised progress on the follow-up to the Seville European Council in view of the report to be submitted to the Thessaloniki European Council. The Commission reported on the implementation of the Afghan Returns Programme and the feasibility study on the Visa Information System which would be discussed at the June JHA Council. The Commission also confirmed that a communication on international protection regimes would be prepared in time for that meeting. I urged member states to consider future priorities, asylum (including recent UK ideas); reduction in flows of illegal migrants into the EU; more effective co-operation with source countries on returns; and better financing for JHA external action, including proper integration of JHA needs into other EU programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/6">The presidency and Commission reported on the negotiations with Switzerland on participation in the Schengen acquis and asylum measures, noting that they would be remitted to the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) and then discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/7">The presidency reaffirmed its intention to seek adoption at the June JHA Council of the Council decision authorising signature of the agreements between the EU and USA on extradition and mutual legal assistance, with signature to take place at the EU-US Summit on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-25">25 June</phrase>. However, it noted that domestic parliamentary scrutiny was ongoing for several member states, including the UK. A number of member states, including the UK, also indicated that they were considering the need to make constitutional statements in accordance with Article 24 TEU. One member state sought further amendments to the Extradition Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/8">The Council reached a general approach on the framework decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. The presidency said that the European Parliament would need to be re-consulted on the text and further discussions were required on the recitals and accompanying certificate. Five member states, including the UK, maintained parliamentary scrutiny reservations.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/9">The Council agreed the appointment of two Europol deputy directors, including a UK candidate.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/10">Under any other business, Ministers also took note of the Commission's proposals for a common position on notifying the Council of Europe of the forthcoming application of the framework decision establishing the European arrest warrant between the member states. The Council received an update on recent discussions in the G8 which had reviewed progress made in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. Finally, the Netherlands drew the Council's attention to its contribution to the discussions on judicial co-operation in the Future of Europe Convention.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-05-19a.61.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="61"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030519/text/30519w02.htm#30519w02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.61.8/1">Subsections (6) and (13) of Section 124A, which is inserted in the Patents Act 1977 by paragraph 2 of Order S.I. 2003 No. 512, deal with electronic communications respectively incoming to and outgoing from the Patent Office. There are several considerations which require these two classes of communication to be treated differently in this order.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.8/2">For communications coming into the Patent Office, it is frequently the case that their time and date of receipt is critical to the establishment and maintenance of patent rights or to the compliance with time-critical requirements of the patents legislation. This justifies a level of technical precision whereby senders can be assured that the Patent Office electronic receiving system has operated satisfactorily, and they gain this assurance if they receive an acknowledgement from that system. The Patent Office intends to provide such acknowledgement, and may wish to rely on it to the extent that a delivery cannot be treated as made if the acknowledgement has not been issued. The purpose of Section 124A(6) is specifically to give legal powers to the Comptroller of the Patent Office to make a future direction which places such importance on the acknowledgement, and will thereby provide a safeguard to senders that Patent Office systems are working to the customary high standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.8/3">For outgoing electronic communications from the Patent Office the same criteria do not apply. In striving for legal certainty as to whether such outgoing delivery can be deemed to be effected, the view was taken that the obligations on the office must be limited to properly addressing and transmitting the electronic communication. Satisfactory receipt of these outgoing communications depends, among other things, on the functionality of the various electronic systems installed in different users' offices. It may be that users' systems will provide an acknowledgement of receipt to the Patent Office, but the Patent Office should make no assumptions and should not be entitled to rely on it. Section 124A(13) presents this approach as the default situation, but also allows the comptroller to override that default situation by specifying &quot;contrary intention&quot;, should that be appropriate. This wording is based upon the established drafting used in Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 in connection with service by post. This &quot;intention&quot; would be applicable only in the context of outgoing communications from the Patent Office and has no application to the provisions for communications coming into it.</p>

Thiomersal has not been newly regulated under the 2003 regulations; it has been regulated since 1982. However, I understand that the use of thiomersal in decorative cosmetic products is very limited.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">The Statutory Instrument S.I. 2002/3129 makes provision for the amendment to the Meters (Certification) Regulations 1998 and the Meters (Approval of Pattern or Construction and Manner of Installation) Regulations 1998.

	<p pid="a.63.2/2">For the examination, testing and certification of meters, the &pound;45 hourly rate does not necessarily represent the entirety of the fee that may be incurred. The Meters (Certification) Regulation 1998 provides that the fee payable to the authority for examination testing and certification of meters by a meter examiner (who is a member of the authority's staff) or by a meter examiner instructed by the authority (but not a member of the authority's staff) can include &pound;45 per hour for time spent examining or testing or procuring the testing of a meter; any reasonable expenses (including incidental expenses) in accordance with the provisions of the SI; a sum equal to the costs incurred by the authority (other than the cost of employing the meter examiner, referred to above) attributable to procuring from any person the provision of premises, equipment, or personnel (including a meter examiner) for the purpose of examining or carrying out any test on the meter.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/117">(5) The performance reflects problems in early part of 2002. DEFRA has taken steps to improve performance. Currently answering 74 per cent. correspondence within targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/118">(6) Poor performance was partly due to problems with a new internal tracking system and problems interfacing with the Agencies. Robust action is now taking place to address these problems including the setting up of a new Customer Service Centre to ensure that problems that occurred in 2002 do not happen again. Also includes figures for the Food Standards Agency as such correspondence is replied to by Department of Health Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/119">(7) The large increase in letters received relating to immigration matters has affected the overall performance. Home Office has made the improvement of performance a high priority with more robust systems being put in place to monitor the progress of correspondence and provide early indications of any outstanding or newly emerging problems, this includes the introduction of a new IT tracking system.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/120">(8) Figures for 2002 are not currently available.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/121">(9) A major restructuring programme has led to a large backlog of correspondence. There has also been a substantial increase in complaints to Ministers. A major recovery programme was launched to deal with this. 89 per cent. of Ministerial correspondence was answered within target by the end of 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/122">(10) Due to problems in meeting the 10 working days target, DTI have raised their target for reply from 10 to 15 working days (in line with majority of other government departments) for correspondence received in 2003. Raising the level to 15 working days will help improve performance to a more acceptable level.</p>

Before beginning to draft an order, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will write to the Radio Authority, the Commercial Radio Companies Association and the Community Media Association so that they have an opportunity to express their views at this stage.

	<p pid="a.70.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health is responding on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to the 32nd report of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) which is published today. Copies of the report are available in the Library. The report covers career grade hospital doctors and dentists (including doctors in public health and the community health service), doctors and dentists in training (excluding general practice registrars) and ophthalmic medical practitioners. The DDRB will report later on general dental practitioners and those in the salaried primary dental care services and is awaiting further developments on the proposed new contract for general medical practitioners. We are grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their hard work and for the action they have taken to deal with each of their remit groups with the least possible delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/2">The review body has recommended general increases in remuneration of 3.225 per cent for career grade hospital doctors and dentists, and doctors and dentists in training with effect from April 2003. In addition, the DDRB has recommended adjustments to the pay scales for associate specialists and staff grade practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/3">The review body's pay recommendations are being accepted in full by the Government and without staging.</p>
