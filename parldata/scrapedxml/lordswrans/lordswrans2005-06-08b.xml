We believe that the Botswana Government's removal of all references to ethnicity in the constitution has been handled through parliamentary procedures in line with constitutional proprieties and as such does not need to be taken forward by the Secretary-General.</p>

	<p pid="b.70.5/1">We are concerned by reports that Christians are suffering discrimination in parts of Iraq. We have joined Christian and Muslim leaders in rigorously condemning attacks on Christian churches. This is clearly the work of those seeking to divide Iraq's diverse communities and undermine the political process. We do not believe that such acts are supported by the wider Iraqi population.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.5/2">We have also received reports of violent attacks against Iraqi Christians. Often the victims were merchants who had their shops burnt down because they sold alcohol. Such attacks are thought in the main to be the work of Islamic extremists, aiming to enforce their vision of a strict Islamic code, including an outright ban on alcohol.

	<p pid="b.71.2/1">This is not an option we are considering. Our ambassador in Tashkent, David Moran, is playing a key role in registering our deep concern at reports of indiscriminate killings by government forces in central Andijan on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-13">13 May</phrase>, which left a still unknown number dead. He is also playing a key role in maintaining the pressure for an independent international enquiry to find out why the killings happened and who was responsible. Persistent lobbying by our ambassador for greater access for the international community was instrumental in prompting the authorities to organise a visit to the region on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-18">18 May</phrase> by diplomats, members of international organisations and the world's media. Although highly orchestrated by the Uzbek authorities, this visit was an important first step towards securing the necessary transparency into the events of 13 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-14">14 May</phrase> in Andijan.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/2">It is particularly important that we remain engaged with the Uzbek authorities at this time, in order to establish exactly what took place in Andijan, and to ensure that the root causes of discontent are addressed through urgent economic and political reform, and in line with international standards of human rights and good governance. Our ambassador in Tashkent has a central role in this process.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.5/1">Since its adoption during the UK presidency of the European Union in 1998, the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports has provided the framework for the case-by-case control of arms exports from EU countries to the rest of the world. A revised version of the code is currently under discussion, which would include new provisions covering licensed production overseas, brokering and intangible technology transfers. The revised code would also introduce a new obligation on member states to refuse exports licences if they consider that there is a clear risk that the items covered by the licence would be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law. This amendment was suggested by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Government are committed to enhance further the transparency of application of the code of conduct, and we will be pursuing this objective during our forthcoming presidency of the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.5/1">NATO will remain the cornerstone of UK and transatlantic defence and the primary forum for transatlantic security issues, but its role in international security will continue to evolve. NATO has an important part to play in supporting peace and stability in the Balkans and the Caucasus but also outside the &quot;traditional&quot; Euro/Atlantic area: in Afghanistan, where NATO forces are supporting the political process and national reconstruction; in Iraq through its training mission for Iraqi security forces; in the rest of the Middle East through the Istanbul co-operation initiative and the Mediterranean dialogue; and in central Asia. NATO's involvement in Africa, through its offer to support the African Union's mission in Darfur, is a further indication of NATO's growing role. Enhanced NATO capabilities, such as the NATO Response Force, will help to ensure that NATO is ready to take on new challenges.</p>

	<p pid="b.83.2/1">The objective of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is to protect the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges. The directive does not however set specific standards for the condition of rivers and coastal waters into which waste water is discharged. Rather, it includes requirements to put in place sewage collecting systems, and sets standards for the treatment of sewage at sewerage treatment works. Standards and deadlines are set according to the size of the population served and the sensitivity of waters receiving the discharges.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/2">The collecting systems serving the urban communities along the Thames are largely combined systems that collect both domestic and industrial waste water, and rainwater run-off. The collecting systems along the Thames have combined sewer overflows which operate to prevent flooding and sewage treatment works becoming overloaded during wet weather.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/3">The pollution of the tidal Thames by storm water overflows and compliance with the directive's standards for continuous discharges is of considerable concern to this Administration. We therefore established the Thames Tideway Strategic Study Group in 2000. We consider that the proposal arising from the interim report of the group for a large 35 kilometre interceptor tunnel needs further investigation&mdash;it would take about 15 years to implement and cost in the order of &pound;1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/4">My officials and the Thames Tideway Strategic Study Steering Group are carrying out further consideration of the issues and possible appropriate smaller-scale measures which may be able to deliver needed improvements sooner than could be delivered by the proposed tunnel. The report of the further findings and options presented, which is expected soon, will be carefully considered by Ministers and a decision will be taken on an appropriate course of action to meet our obligations to protect the environment in a cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/5">Our contribution in determining the level of investment by Thames Water in 2005&ndash;10 will result in significant improvements to the treatment provided during wet weather at Beckton, Crossness and Mogden, and reduce the frequency, amount and pollution of storm water discharges at these works that have been a problem in recent years.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.5/1">Analysis of the Environment Agency's national enforcement database shows that there has been one pollution incident directly attributable to horse manure in the past three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.5/2">Contrary to some press coverage, the recent changes made in the Waste Management Licensing (England and Wales) (Amendment and Related Provisions) Regulations 2005 apply only to the compositing of waste. The regulations do not apply to the storage of manure. All individuals and most liveries, stables and other establishments that keep horses will not be subject to the recent changes. No one is required to apply for a waste management licence or to register a licence exemption simply to store manure on the site where it was produced.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.2/1">The United Kingdom and France co-operate closely as leading nations in both NATO and the EU, including within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), and not least in the peacekeeping operations in Afghanistan and the Balkans. We maintain strong bilateral defence ties through exchange and liaison programmes, exercises, and interoperability initiatives, and are also partners in various procurement projects. The Government are satisfied with this very important relationship.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/2">The 1998 St Malo text declared the intentions of the UK and French heads of state to unite in their efforts to enable the European Union to play a full role on the international stage. It concentrates particularly on what is now known as ESDP, while recognising the need to respect countries' different situations in relation to NATO.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/3">Since 1998 ESDP has developed very considerably, with the UK and France collaborating closely throughout. For example, the UK and France jointly proposed the Battlegroups initiative at their summit in November 2003 and have each made a national Battlegroup available on standby for the first six months of initial operating capability (January to June 2005). The December 2004 Council agreement on planning capabilities was based on a UK-France-Germany proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/4">The Government are satisfied that the St Malo declaration and subsequent Anglo-French declarations provide a sound basis for Anglo-French co-operation in leading the development of ESDP with appropriate regard to NATO commitments.</p>
