	<p pid="a.146.3/1">We are committed to the ambitious five-year corporate Civil Service targets set for the Senior Civil Service (SCS) in 1998. Departments are making good progress on increasing the representation of minority ethnic staff and women at Senior Civil Service level. As at October 2002, 2.8 per cent of staff at this level were from a minority ethnic background and 25.8 per cent were women. This is up from 1.6 per cent and 17.8 per cent respectively in April 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/2">There are a range of measures in place both centrally and in departments to improve representation at senior levels. This includes Pathways&mdash;a leadership development programme run by the Cabinet Office targeted at minority ethnic staff with potential to reach the SCS; and a programme of outreach to universities and colleges to encourage minority ethnic applicants to the Fast Stream scheme. Many departments also run their own internal development courses for high potential staff from minority ethnic backgrounds. Departments have also produced race equality schemes which set out action plans on how new duties to promote race equality under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act will be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/3">Following the successful pilot of the Cabinet Office Elevator Partnership scheme which paired high potential junior women with a mentor in the SCS, a framework has been developed for departments to customise to suit their own requirements. Also, we have set targets for women in top management posts and have made significant progress in this area from the baseline figure of 12.7 per cent in 1998 to 23.1 per cent in October 2002. In addition, a Civil Service-wide focus group was set up in partnership with Opportunity Now to look at gender issues, including development and progression of women.</p>

The Government recognise that minority ethnic staff networks have a very important role to play in this transformation and actively encourages individual departments and agencies to support their activities. In addition, the Secretary of the Cabinet and Head of the Home Civil Service acts as the sponsor for the Civil Service Race Equality Network.

	<p pid="a.149.8/5" class="indent">1. the issue of dual membership in London and the provinces ought to be revisited and considered in a separate small working group, as suggested in recommendation 14 of the Report; and</p>

	<p pid="a.150.2/1">The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) currently has no mandate to work on small arms control and reduction measures in the Great Lakes region, though there have been discussions to address this. DfID has no institutional arrangements with IGAD on such work.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/2">Through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP), DfID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence contribute &pound;460,000 to the Nairobi secretariat to assist states in the Horn and Great Lakes regions to implement the commitments they made on signing the Nairobi Declaration on small arms in March 2001. The secretariat provides training and advice to national focal points, being set up in signatory countries in the Great Lakes region, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, to prevent the proliferation of weapons and ammunition. Other countries receiving support from the secretariat are Djibouti, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Eritrea in the Horn of Africa, and Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya in east Africa. Training has recently been provided to law enforcement officers on cross-border controls and management. Through the Nairobi secretariat, the GCPP supported participation by the national focal point co-ordinators at the United Nations biennial meeting of states on small arms and light weapons, held in New York from 7&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-07-11">11 July 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/3">The three departments have also provided support (&pound;2.3 million) to the Governments of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania for the development of five-year national action plans on small arms and light weapons. This support is provided in conjunction with two non-governmental organisations, Saferworld and SaferAfrica.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.2/4">Within a &pound;7.5 million contribution to UNDP's global small arms reduction programme, the GCPP finances a project in the Great Lakes, which seeks to implement a broad small arms strategy for the region. This includes supporting the Nairobi Declaration and the peace process for the DRC. These initiatives are being closely co-ordinated with efforts to support broader peace building and reform of the security sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.2/1">The objectives on peace and security to which G8 countries signed up in Kananaskis in 2002, and which were reviewed at Evian in June this year, comprise both a focus on specific countries and a pan-African approach. The specific countries include the DRC, Great Lakes, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire and Angola. The pan-African approach includes a commitment to assist African countries to prevent conflict and undertake peace support operations; and a commitment to support African efforts to eliminate the flow of illicit weapons in the region. There is no specific objective related to Zimbabwe. However, these objectives were developed with the view of benefiting the entire region. Zimbabwe would benefit from increased regional stability, as would every other African country.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/2">The challenges in Zimbabwe are of broader governance and not solely of security. We remain in regular contact with African leaders about the crisis. The Foreign Secretary met President Mbeki and Foreign Minister Zuma during a visit to South Africa in May and the Prime Minister discussed Zimbabwe with President Mbeki at the G8 Summit in June and at the recent progressive governance summit. President Mbeki continues to press both sides to resume the inter-party dialogue Zimbabwe so urgently needs. We support his efforts. Any resolution of the political, economic and humanitarian crisis facing Zimbabwe, must come from the Zimbabwean people themselves, supported by the wider southern Africa region.</p>

We take into account the views of appropriate international bodies. However, we need verification of crimes against humanity, war crimes or genocide in Burma before using such terms. The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma, Sergio Pinheiro, has regular access to Burma, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-17">17 March 2003</phrase>. I understand he takes the view that he will not use these terms to describe the situation there. The terms have likewise not been used by many major international NGOs, which monitor the human rights situation in Burma. There is room for debate about the use of particular words in different contexts but what matters in this case is that we all agree that the behaviour of the Burmese regime has been appalling and involved widespread killing and breaches of human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.2/1">As part of a wider review of how we make the most effective use of our Consular resources to help British nationals in distress overseas, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has considered the issue of visiting British nationals in prison overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2">The welfare of British nationals in foreign prisons is one of the key concerns of consular staff. Our staff seek to ensure that prisoners' rights are respected in accordance with international standards. This includes ensuring that they have access to legal representation and that their welfare needs are met during their detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/3">Once a British national has been given a custodial sentence, our aim has been to visit them once a year, or more frequently if possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4">This approach does not however take account of the wide variation in prison conditions and practices between different countries. In European Union countries, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, North America and Australasia, we are satisfied that, in general, prison conditions meet international standards and are comparable to those in the UK. From <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September</phrase> this year, our aim will therefore be to visit prisoners in these countries once after sentencing, and thereafter, only if the real need arises. In addition, consular staff can maintain contact with prisoners by telephone and fax and encourage local prison volunteer groups to visit them.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/5">In all other countries, where prison conditions give us more cause for concern, the aim of consular staff will be to continue to visit prisoners on a regular basis. This is likely to be at least once a year, and as often as once a month where circumstances warrant it. The new policy will allow us to provide our consular services on the basis of greatest need and to concentrate on countries where our consular assistance can be most beneficial.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.5/1">The British Government oppose all unwarranted assertions of extraterritorial jurisdiction in commercial cases. Such assertions infringe on the sovereign right of states to regulate activities within their own territory, interfere with the freedom of states to conduct their own economic policies, place an unwarranted burden on businesses, and can create a climate of uncertainty which may affect the trading and investment conditions of British companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/2">A number of cases have been brought under the United States' Alien Tort Statute against British companies and others in relation to their activities in third countries. Of particular concern are cases brought in the US against British companies in relation to their activities in South Africa during the Apartheid era, alleging that their presence in South Africa at the time made them complicit in human rights abuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/3">The British Government have expressed to the US Government their concerns over the extraterritorial use of the Alien Tort Statute in these commercial cases. The US Government have filed an amicus brief in a related case brought under the statute, seeking to address this issue among others.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/4">The British Government remain committed to combating impunity for human rights violations wherever they occur. We believe that the most effective means of achieving this goal is the strengthening and developing of credible national justice mechanisms that conform to international human rights standards. We believe that, in the first instance, legal remedies in the country where the act allegedly took place should be exhausted. In the apartheid cases this does not appear to have happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/5">Moreover, South Africa is engaged in an ongoing post-apartheid reconciliation process, the complexities of which should not be underestimated.

	<p pid="a.161.0/1">The ability to fly fast and low continues to be an essential skill in our armoury of tactics. Training for aircrew to achieve and maintain these skills is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/2">The amount of low flying training carried out in the United Kingdom low flying system (UKLFS) during the training year April 2002 to March 2003 was the minimum necessary for aircrew to reach and maintain these skills. Hours booked for low flying training in the UKLFS (excluding the rotary wing dedicated user areas, where different booking arrangements apply) during this period amounted to an overall increase of 2.6 per cent compared with the previous training year. The increase may be linked to preparations for operations, and an increase in the flying of Apache aircraft in preparation for their introduction into service. Since detailed records of hours booked began in 1995, the annual total has reduced by some 29 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/3">The distribution of low-flying training across the UK has not changed significantly over previous years. It is spread as widely as practicable, but for a variety of reasons, including population distribution and geographic and climatic considerations, it is inevitable that some parts of the country will see more low flying than others.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/4">We have today placed in the Library of the House a report giving a detailed account of low flying training in the UK low flying system for the period April 2002 to March 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/5">Further copies of the report can be obtained from the Vote Office: or it can be viewed on the MOD's web site; <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/lowflying">www.mod.uk/issues/lowflying</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.0/1">We regularly re-visit existing plans for capability enhancements to ensure they remain tailored to the security environment in which we need to operate. As such, we judge that the multi-role armoured vehicle (MRAV) is not ideally suited to the type of operations envisaged under the Strategic Defence Review new chapter and other developing policy work. This, coupled with recent operational experience in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Afghanistan and latterly Iraq, has demonstrated the need for rapid deployability in expeditionary operations. MRAV is not considered able to meet this capability requirement, which will be pursued through the future rapid effect system (FRES). FRES will be a very significant component of the long-term transformation of the land battle through its contribution to network-enabled capability. We have written to the German and Dutch Governments to inform them of our decision to withdraw from the MRAV collaborative project.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/2">In parallel with our decision to withdraw from the MRAV programme, we are pleased to announce the results of the competition for the future command and liaison vehicle (FCLV). The Alvis Vickers Limited multi-role light vehicle has been selected to deliver the solution to the Army's requirement for enhanced speed, reliability, flexibility and protection for a wide range of users in combat or peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/3">FCLV will also provide support for the RAF Regiment. It will play a key role in the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces by providing versatile, air-transportable vehicles, which will be among the first deployed in a crisis and will spearhead the way for troops in combat or peacekeeping operations. FCLV will replace a mixed fleet of ageing vehicles which were acquired as a stopgap following the withdrawal of the ferret scout car. This contract is worth over &pound;200 million and is a good result for the United Kingdom AFV industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.5/1">An independent review of the Forensic Science Service was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-23">23 July 2002</phrase> by the Minister of State for Policing and Crime Reduction. The review has been overseen by a steering group which all key stakeholders were invited to join. The review team reported at the beginning of July this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/2">The main thrust of the report focuses on the emergence of a more competitive market for forensic science services and the ability of the FSS to compete effectively in the face of a significantly changing environment. The report makes a number of helpful observations and recommendations aimed at improving FSS performance, but the most fundamental is that it should be transformed from a trading fund into a government-owned company as a precursor to development into a private sector classified public/private partnership (PPP).</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/3">The main risk if the FSS remains as a trading fund is that there would be a sustained and accelerating loss of business. Indeed, some forces are already outsourcing their forensic requirements to alternative suppliers. A cumulative loss of market share could reach a point at which poor trading forced cut-backs in investment, research and development and staffing. We see radical change as the only realistic option to ensure that FSS remains competitive and able to make best use of rapidly advancing science and technology to reduce crime and deliver safer communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/4">The report identifies the inherent risks, but makes a clear case for accepting that PPP offers the best means of protecting the public interest and delivering major benefits to the criminal justice system (CJS) by enabling FSS to compete effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/5">We endorse this approach and the steering group's overall view that the FSS would prosper in a private sector environment, as it clearly reflects the realities of the situation. At a time when demand for forensic analysis in crime investigation is increasing significantly, FSS performance has been mixed. There have been some notable successes, but we need to take steps to improve the service to the wider CJS in terms of timeliness and cost-effectiveness. The emergence of a small but effective and dynamic private sector has resulted in an increasingly competitive market in forensic science services, the level and intensity of which is likely to gather pace.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/6">We are confident that the proposed changes will stimulate and broaden the market, encouraging CJS customers to make even greater use of forensic science in the fight against crime, and generating momentum through improved investment to enable the increasingly effective use of forensic capabilities. This, in turn, will result in forensic science making a substantially greater contribution to crime reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/7">A number of significant logistical issues inevitably need to be addressed, but we believe that all of these challenges can be dealt with successfully in a transitional period as a government-owned company.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.5/8">As the report contains commercially sensitive information, a copy of the executive summary has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.2/1">We wish to announce that the 2002 statistics of scientific procedure on living animals in Great Britain will be published as a Command Paper on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-18">18 July</phrase>. Copies will be placed in the House Library in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/2">The number of scientific procedures licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and started in 2002 was just over 2.73 million, a rise of about 110,000 (4.2 per cent) on 2001. This increase is not seen as beyond the bounds of normal year-on-year fluctuations, and the Government have no anxieties or concerns arising from the detail of the statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/3">A familiar pattern is evident. Mice, rats and other rodents were used in the majority of procedures&mdash;84 per cent of the total. Most of the remainder used birds (5 per cent of all procedures), and fish (7 per cent). Dogs, cats, horses and non-human primates, afforded special protection by the Act, were collectively used in fewer than 1 per cent of the procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/4">There was a slight decrease in the proportion of procedures using genetically normal animals (65 per cent as against 67 per cent in 2001), and a small increase in the proportion of procedures using those which had been genetically modified (26 per cent as against 24 per cent in 2001). This continues a trend apparent in recent years, though the variations are on this occasion minimal. It is worth recording that only one in three of all the recorded procedures involving genetically modified animals were for purposes other than breeding.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/5">Non-toxicological procedures accounted for about 82 per cent of those carried out in 2002, with the main areas of use being for immunological studies and pharmaceutical research and development. Of the procedures for toxicological purposes, 61 per cent were for pharmacological safety and efficacy studies, and most were performed to conform with regulatory requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/6">About 40 per cent of all procedures used some form of anaesthesia to alleviate the severity of the interventions. For many of the remaining procedures the use of anaesthesia would have increased the animal welfare cost of the procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/7">Over 99 per cent of procedures carried out on animals listed in Schedule 2 to the 1986 Act involved use of animals acquired from designated sources in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.2/8">We should point out in relation to the statistics that the Home Office, as regulatory authority under the 1986 Act, has no control over the overall amount of animal research and testing which takes place. We do nevertheless ensure, in carrying out our licensing function, that the provisions of the Act are rigorously applied in each programme of work. In particular we always insist in every case upon full application of the 3Rs&mdash;replacement of animals where possible, and where they must be used, reduction to a minimum of their numbers and refinement of the procedures to minimise suffering. To that end, all licence applications are carefully assessed by the professional Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, which then closely monitors work in progress to ensure compliance with licence authorities, and with the related codes of practice concerning standards of care and accommodation for the animals.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.8/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Christopher Leslie, has made a statement today in another place announcing the publication of the annual report relating to the 2002&ndash;03 business returns provided by magistrates' courts in England and Wales and that copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.8/2">This is the first time that this report has been published and it heralds a new era in the development of the 42 separate Magistrates' Courts Committee (MCC) areas towards the planned unification with each other and with the Court Service agency. One key matter in the report relates to the enforcement of fines that have been in the full control of magistrates' courts since April 2001. He addressed the matter of the poor collection rates in a written Ministerial Statement made on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-25">25 June</phrase> (Official Report, Commons, col. 40WS) and set out the seven-point action plan that he is pursuing vigorously in order to improve upon the current performance that has been achieved by magistrates' courts and their agents.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.8/3">In other areas the magistrates' courts have maintained a high level of service during a demanding year. They have supported and participated in a number of criminal justice initiatives, including the street crime initiative in the largest 10 areas, extended court sitting hours pilots in London and Manchester and full involvement in the development of the local criminal justice boards. This was during a period when there were considerable additional demands on them. These included the roll-out of new computer hardware, new data demands from across the government service and the MCCs full involvement in the work being undertaken to facilitate the new planned agency. The latter will bring together the 42 currently independent Magistrates' Courts Committee areas and the Court Service agency into one unified courts administration and considerable work is being done by all involved to ensure a successful outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.8/4">Particular successes have been in supporting the achievement of the persistent young offender timeliness target of 71 days, reducing it from 142 days and achieving a national average from 2002&ndash;03 of 69 days. The active use of courts has also increased from 62.6 per cent to 67.3 per cent in 2002&ndash;03, which in part reflects the continuing cross-agency approach which means that magistrates' courts are being used by other agencies such as the Crown Court and tribunals.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.8/5">In particular, the department is leading an initiative, the case preparation project, which involves the other agencies in the criminal justice system and which is part of the work looking at what can be done to reduce the number of ineffective trials and improve the service to victims and witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.8/6">Overall, there have been a number of successes but the work that has been announced in relation to the enforcement of fines is particularly important to ensure that there is confidence in the criminal justice system and proper implementation of judicial decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.0/1">Bioethanol from ligno-cellulosic feedstocks offers the prospect of greater environmental benefits than bioethanol from conventional sugar or starch-based crops because the feedstocks can potentially be produced and processed using lower levels of agricultural and energy inputs. The potential to exploit lower-value feedstocks, including waste-streams, also promises a low-cost alternative to conventional biofuels production, as well as offering an environmentally sustainable way of dealing with waste that might otherwise be landfilled or incinerated.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.0/1">Requiring vehicles to show evidence of being insured by means of a windscreen insurance disc has drawbacks. UK law requires the driver to be insured, rather than the vehicle, and such a disc would not necessarily guarantee that the person behind the wheel was insured to drive that vehicle or was complying with policy conditions. Furthermore, it would be evidence only that somebody had insurance cover for the use of the vehicle when the disc was issued. Such insurance cover is necessary in order to renew the vehicle excise duty disc which is already required to be displayed.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.0/1">The introduction of fluoridated toothpaste in the 1970s is credited with an overall improvement in oral health, but an association between high levels of tooth decay and economic and social deprivation has been identified in most countries, including cities in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">While the Department of Health maintains contact with dental institutions in Europe, we do not yet have sufficient information to make more detailed comparisons between levels of dental caries in the different countries. However, a survey undertaken in Ireland in 2001&ndash;02 is relevant because 71 per cent of the population of the Irish Republic receives fluoridated water, but there are no fluoridation schemes in Northern Ireland. The survey found that 30 per cent of five year-old residents of fluoridated communities in the Republic of Ireland have one or more decayed, missing or filled tooth while, in the non-fluoridated communities in the Republic and Northern Ireland, 47 per cent of this age group had dental decay. The attraction of water fluoridation is its potential for reducing inequalities in oral health, in particular by protecting those families who may not buy toothpaste or establish regular toothbrushing regimes.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.8/1">Section 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 places a legal duty on the Secretary of State to make arrangements to provide independent advocacy services to assist individuals making complaints against the National Health Service. We intend to commence this section on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/2">Our intention is to deliver arrangements for a national independent complaints advocacy service (ICAS). These intentions were set out in Written Answers given to the honourable Member for Eltham on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-19">19 March 2003</phrase> (Official Report, cols. 849W&ndash;851W). The new service will be provided by four contractors who will deliver ICAS across England from <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September 2003</phrase> on a one-year contract. These contractors are The Carers Federation Ltd, POhWER, South East Advocacy Projects and the Citizens Advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/3">Delivering ICAS through these contracts will allow primary care trust patients' forums, who will in due course have delegated power to commission or provide ICAS under the NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002, time to establish their networks and capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/4">Learning from the experience of community health councils and ICAS pilot projects, this will be a completely new service that will provide consistent support to patients with complaints about the NHS across England. ICAS will be provided to standards piloted across the country. The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health (CPPIH) will, as indicated in its functions in the NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002, monitor ICAS services against the standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/5">We have worked with the CPPIH to set in place arrangements for it to act as the department's agent to manage these interim contracts on our behalf. We intend shortly to lay amendments to the CPPIH regulations to reflect this additional function.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.8/6">The new ICAS providers will begin recruiting staff and preparing publicity for patients and others during July and August for the commencement of the service on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September 2003</phrase>. We will be notifying our partners in the NHS about the new arrangements so that they can offer the contractors full co-operation before and during the contracts and help to direct patients to the new service.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.2/1">Applying the methodology utilised for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's producer support estimate (PSE), we estimate that in 2000 (the latest year for which figures are available), the annual monetary value of gross transfer at the farm gate through prices higher than world level applied to the dairy industry in the UK was approximately 1.3 billion dollars. This amounts to around 1.60 dollars per dairy cow per day.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.5/1">All the plywood used in the UK is imported, mainly because we do not produce logs of the size and quality required for efficient peeling and processing. However, some UK-grown veneers, sliced rather than peeled, are used in other products. It is unlikely that competitive plywoods will be produced in the UK to provide an outlet for our timber.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.5/2">The UK does, however, have a mill near Inverness which produces oriented strand board. This product is made from pressing layers of flakes of pine and is widely used as an alternative to plywood in many construction markets.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.2/1">The Government believe that greater use could be made of home-grown timber in flooring. However, home-grown solid wood flooring has to compete against laminate flooring and timber available on the international market, which can be obtained at relatively low cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/2">The Forestry Commission (FC) supports many woodland initiatives throughout the country where local processing is often an objective. Hardwood flooring made and sold locally as a niche market can be successful. The FC has funded market studies and is currently funding the development of a hardwood appearance grading guide which could help producers of small and larger-scale sawmills market their timber to specifiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/3">The Wood for Good campaign, supported by the FC and the UK forestry industry, is promoting exposed softwood flooring. The FC is supporting research to test wood hardening techniques on UK species. If successful, this could make them more suitable for exposed floors.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.5/1">Areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs) together with National Parks are recognised as our finest landscapes. They are given specific protection both in countryside legislation and in the planning system. For example, under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, all public bodies in both England and Wales must have regard to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of an AONB when exercising or performing any function in relation to, or so as to affect, land in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/2">Defra is responsible for AONBs in England, where the Countryside Agency acts as our advisor. AONBs in Wales are the responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is responsible for planning policies in England. These are administered on a day-to-day basis by local planning authorities. Planning Policy Guidance Notes 7, 17 and 21, deal respectively with the status of AONBs in relation to the countryside generally, sport and recreation, and tourism. All make clear that the need to conserve the landscape must be taken into account when considering proposals for development.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/4">The permanent development of a motor racing circuit would require specific planning permission for which application should be made to the local planning authority.</p>
