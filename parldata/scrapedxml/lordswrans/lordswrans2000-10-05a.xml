	<p pid="a.224.6/1">There is no 30 amp fuse on the type of train in question. The reason the train would not move on this occasion was the tripping (within design specification) of four filter charging circuit breakers. These are designed to protect the traction motors. The reason for tripping is the subject of an ongoing official investigation, as are the position of the circuit breakers and their inability to be reset when the train is in service in the tunnel. A summary of the results and recommendations of this investigation will be published by London Underground in due course.</p>

Mr Mouatt advised a regional health authority on dental public health issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.8/1">In Modernising NHS Dentistry: Implementing the NHS Plan, the Government recognise that dentistry needs to be made a higher priority across the whole National Health Service. I am delighted that Dame Margaret Seward has joined the NHS Executive to help with that. During her time as Chief Dental Officer, Dame Margaret will concentrate specifically on the dental strategy and will provide an experienced and expert focus for a wider team implementing the measures that the strategy contains. I have every confidence in Dame Margaret's ability to make a significant contribution to its success.</p>

The proposed allocation of funds to enable the NHS and local councils to achieve these and other service improvements announced in the NHS Plan will be set out in the NHS and local government allocation announcements in the autumn. In line with government policy, resources will not be ring-fenced unless this is necessary to secure outcomes required.</p>

This compares well with the corresponding figures from 1998 (when there was an average of one computer for every 17.6 pupils in primary schools, and for every 8.7 pupils in secondary schools) and demonstrates that schools are on course to meet the challenging targets which we have set for 2004--computer to pupil ratios in primary and secondary schools of 1:8 and 1:5 respectively.</p>

This has been the practice of successive Administrations. There are no plans to change existing practice.
