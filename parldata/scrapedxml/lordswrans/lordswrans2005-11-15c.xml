	<p pid="c.131.2/1">The Government actively support the spread and consolidation of multi-party democracy throughout Africa. In addition to political dialogue with individual countries and through international frameworks such as the Cotonou Agreement, we are providing practical support to improve democratic infrastructures, for example, voter registration/education, election organisation by electoral commissions and observation missions. We also support the development of legislatures, for example, by supporting committee systems, training of MPs and critical oversight bodies such as Auditor Generals' offices. Our support to strengthen the capacity of media, budgetary processes and anti-corruption efforts also contribute to better governance, identified by the Commission for Africa as the foundation for all other actions to promote development. Our support is provided by the Department for International Development country offices working in collaboration with other partner governments/civil society and donors, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Global Opportunities Fund and through the European Union's Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.2/2">The FCO's grant-in-aid to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) also allows us to support the UK political parties in their efforts to strengthen pluralistic democracies through partner parties and wider civil society organisations on a non-partisan basis. Africa has been identified as a priority region for WFD activities. Presently the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties are engaged in a number of projects across Africa.</p>

	<p pid="c.132.2/1">The e-mail referred to was a communication between officials in the Home Office relating to policy development and the handling of a particular application for British citizenship. Under Section 35 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 we are exempt from releasing information that relates to policy formulation if the public interest in withholding it outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. Information relating to private individuals is similarly protected by the Data Protection Act. On balance we believe that the e-mail referred to should not be published. The Home Office view that the provisions for acquisition of British national (overseas) status by registration were fully explained to the Indian authorities is based both on the paper documents held by the Home Office and on the recollections of officials involved in the discussions that took place in 1997&ndash;98.</p>

It was brought into effect to simplify and modernise the UK's extradition relations with all nations. Extradition between the US and UK is governed by a bilateral treaty negotiated in 1972, which will be terminated when the US authorities have ratified the new treaty, signed by the former Home Secretary and US Attorney-General on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>. However, certain provisions of the new bilateral treaty were given effect in the UK by the introduction of the Extradition Act 2003, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>. For the new treaty to come into effect in full, it first needs to secure the advice and consent of the US Senate's Foreign Relations Committee. The US authorities have informed us that committee hearings are likely to begin next month. In the mean time, extradition between the UK and the USA will continue. All those who are the subject of an extradition request to the UK are protected by full and effective safeguards in the Extradition Act 2003, regardless of their nationality.</p>

This money is over and above local authorities' road safety funding and means that the safety camera programme can produce real road safety benefits paid for by offenders rather than through public expenditure.</p>
