	<p pid="b.172.5/1">The Government have never charged to carry postal packets up to 2 kilogrammes through the British Forces Post Office system to personnel serving on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The cost payable is that charged by Royal Mail Group to carry postal packets from local post offices to the British Forces Post Office depot at Mill Hill, London. This means that the overall cost of postage to operational theatres is fixed at the standard UK inland rate for packages up to 2 kilogrammes (currently &pound;5.31 for a 2 kilogramme packet), which are dispatched by surface mail; an air mail service is also available. However, for operational reasons an airmail-only service is operated to Iraq and Afghanistan. The cost of this service is currently &pound;6.50 for a 2 kilogramme packet, which represents only 38 per cent of the Royal Mail Group airmail rate for those countries of &pound;19.58. The prices charged by Royal Mail Group are a commercial decision for that organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.172.5/2">A scheme whereby the Government paid Royal Mail Group's charges was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-17">17 April 2003</phrase>, as a temporary measure unique to Iraq, at a time when service personnel did not have access to the welfare facilities now available in theatre. When the provision of goods and services in Iraq reached the required standard, the decision was taken to end the scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-08">8 April 2004</phrase>. It was later reintroduced for a period of one month before Christmas 2004, and subsequently confirmed by the then Secretary of State for Defence, prior to Christmas 2005, that the government payment of Royal Mail Group charges in the pre-Christmas period was to become a standard element of the operational welfare package. The centrally funded posting dates for Christmas 2006 were <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-10">10 November</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-08">8 December</phrase> inclusive, for which Royal Mail Group charged the Government &pound;577,000; this sum does not include the costs for additional air transport and onward distribution that were also paid for by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.173.2/2">The distribution of mail to BFPOs overseas is heavily subsidised by the Ministry of Defence.

This figure does not include the cost of providing RAF transport, which delivers the majority of BFPO mail to operational theatres and permanent bases by air, or the costs incurred in distributing the mail to the individual addressees in theatre.

	<p pid="b.174.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibilities of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/2"><I>Letter from Colin Mowl, Director of Macroeconomics and Labour Market</I><I>,</I><I></I><I>t</I>o Lord Laird dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-27">27 April 2007</phrase><I>,</I><I> replying in the absence of the National Statistician.</I></p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/3">The questions for the 2007 test were developed based on consultation with users of census data. The census test provides the opportunity to test new and updated questions and the test questions are not necessarily those which will be included in the census in 2011. It is apparent that demands for information from the census are greater than are likely to be able to be accommodated and difficult trade-offs will need to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/4">After the 2001 census there was strong demand for information, especially on Welsh identification&mdash;and a national identity question was introduced into government surveys such as the labour force survey from 2001 onwards. National identity information is used to measure identification with different countries of the UK, as well as nations outside the UK. The question being used for the 2007 census test specifically lists the national identities of the UK and Ireland in order to meet specific user requirements and also to harmonise with proposals for the question to be asked in the Northern Ireland census. Other national identities are able to be recorded using a write-in box. We know that the question requires more development before it can be included in the 2011 census. However we need to know now that it would meet the user requirements before carrying out further question testing.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/5">Another reason for measuring national identity is to separate it from ethnic group, to make it possible to record national identity as &quot;British&quot; at the same time as recording ethnic group as, for example, &quot;Pakistani&quot;. There was criticism of the 2001 ethnic group question because the only category for British was listed under the heading &quot;White&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/6">A question on ethnic group was first asked in the 1991 census for the prime purpose of identifying areas with high levels of ethnic minority groups in order to help provide valuable information for planning and provision of services and monitoring racial disadvantage and social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/7">The categories identified in the current ethnic group question being used in the test have been developed from the frame of the 2001 census question which itself had resulted from an extensive programme of research and development. The question has adopted that mix of geographic origin and colour characteristics that testing had shown to be publicly most acceptable and from which the most useable statistics could be obtained. A separate &quot;Irish&quot; response category was included in the 2001 census ethnic group question as a result of representations made by census users, particularly from Irish community groups, for information to help monitor discrimination and measure health inequalities among the &quot;Irish&quot; population. Whilst ethnicity is clearly a dynamic characteristic when considered nationally&mdash;and the census must seek to reflect this as much as possible&mdash;an equally important criterion is the ability to compare the results from one census to another&mdash;and to that end the question must retain a degree of comparability over time.</p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/8">We have recently conducted further consultation on user needs for information on ethnicity, national identity, and also language and religion from the 2011 census in England and Wales. This has focused in particular on assessing public acceptability of the descriptions of the ethnic categories. The relevant documents are available on the National Statistics website (see <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_155.asp">www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_ 155.asp</a>).</p>
	<p pid="b.174.3/9">It is likely that the ethnicity classification will be updated for the 2011 census but it is not possible to confirm what questions and response categories are to be included until the consultation and testing programme is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010. A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals including the wording of any questions about ethnicity and identity is scheduled to be published in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.176.5/1">The European Commission currently has voluntary agreements in place with the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) and the two industry associations for Japanese and Korean manufacturers (together covering most cars sold in the EU), to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars to 140g/km by 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.5/2">This target is unlikely to be met. In a recent communication, the Commission announced its intention to require industry to meet an efficiency target for 2012 through legislation. This would entail a target of 130g/km through improvements to the main structure of the car itself, and several other measures (for example, tyres with lower rolling resistance, and use of biofuels) contributing further savings, to make the target an equivalent of 120g/km.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.5/3">We welcome the Commission's intention to introduce mandatory proposals. The Commission's proposal is still in its early stages: further detail on the mechanism of the target and how it would be implemented is yet to be decided. While we believe that the target is at around the right level, clearly this is a matter that will need careful thought and will involve much discussion with stakeholders. We have already started engaging with the key industry body in the UK, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.177.2/4">You may, however, find it helpful to know that at the time of the last census in 2001, a total of 12,896,487 people lived in urban areas in England and Wales near the coastline. This represents 24.78 per cent of the total resident population (52,041,916).</p>
	<p pid="b.177.2/5">For the purposes of this Question we have applied the definition of &quot;urban areas&quot; used in the census. This includes major urban agglomerations, cities and smaller towns defined in terms of their physical extent rather than by administrative boundaries. The &quot;coast&quot; (as defined by Ordnance Survey) includes tidal estuaries and rivers and so the figure includes people living in some urban areas that might more usually be regarded as being inland. The definition of &quot;near the coastline&quot; we have used is those &quot;urban areas&quot; whose boundaries fell wholly or partially within 500 metres of the &quot;coast (mean high water)&quot;.</p>

The UKSCI report was published in December 2005 and made 11 recommendations. In their response, the Government accepted the recommendations in full. As a result, the Government have allocated an additional &pound;50 million, bringing total investment up to &pound;100 million, for stem cell research between 2006 and 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.183.0/1">The building regulations apply whenever work is carried out and the current energy efficiency requirements came into effect in April 2006. In the consultation document <I>Building a Greener Future</I> issued on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-13">13 December 2006</phrase>, the Government proposed improvements in the requirements by 25 per cent in 2010 and of 44 per cent in 2013 leading to a zero-carbon standard in 2016. The response is still being analysed. Before any amendment is made the detailed proposals will be subject to formal consultations, and they will include a review of the provision for works on existing homes as well as new construction. The building regulations do not address fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/2">The decent homes standard has done much to address fuel poverty by increasing the energy efficiency of social housing stock and the homes of vulnerable people in the private sector. We have no plans to change the decent homes standard at this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.0/3">Using the Government's standard assessment procedure for the energy rating of homes (SAP ratings) the average score for new dwellings built to 2006 standards is around 80. For social housing in 2003 the average is around 57, compared to 48 in 2001, whereas the average SAP rating for private housing was 50, up from 45. The SAP rating performance scale extends from 1 (poor) to 100 (excellent).</p>

	<p pid="b.186.5/1">The Council of Europe convention on trafficking deals with particular activities that we are also seeking to combat. It defines those activities and sets out procedures to combat them that are practical, in such a way that signatories are aware when they are achieving compliance. It requires parties who sign to accept back a victim of trafficking who is a national, and that children will not be returned if there is an indication, following a risk and security assessment, that such a return would not be in the &quot;best interests&quot; of the child.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.5/2">The UN convention does not contain such definitions. It is written in terms of broad statements rather than precise legal language and it is possible for signatory countries to interpret it in different ways. Notwithstanding the reservation, we consider that we have sufficient protection for children and safeguards for their welfare in our own domestic laws.</p>

EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso have spoken regularly to the main political players. Our embassy in Kiev has been closely engaged with all the parties.

The EU is supporting Ukraine's programme of reform through the European Neighbourhood Policy, which offers deeper EU-Ukraine relations in return for progress on key reforms. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's global opportunities fund currently disperses around half a million pounds under its Reuniting Europe programme in Ukraine, including to projects that support Ukraine's policy of EU integration, particularly in the field of improved governance. The Council of Europe supports Ukraine's democratic development through regular monitoring of its obligations and commitments. Secretary-General Terry Davis has confirmed that the Council of Europe stands ready to offer further help to Ukraine in the context of a political settlement to the current crisis, particularly in the field of elections and any possible future constitutional commission.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-04-30b.191.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="191"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70430w0004.htm#07043025000309">
	<p pid="b.191.6/1">Aroclor 1254 is a mixture of more than 80 different polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals. PCBs are practically insoluble in water. Available data for aquatic life indicate effects on mortality, growth and reproduction at concentrations of 8 micrograms/litre. There is little information on the effects on sheep or cattle, nor on the endocrine-disrupting effects of PCBs on aquatic life. A single oral dose of 1 to 1.3 grams of Aroclor 1254 per kilogram of bodyweight has been reported as sufficient to kill half a group of treated rats.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.6/2">The UK Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) issued a statement on PCBs in 1997, and recommended that, where humans are exposed to a mixture of PCBs, the risk to health can be assessed by reference to the tolerable daily intake (TDI) rather than concentration. The TDI is based on the most sensitive end-point and will protect against the risk of other adverse effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.6/3">After reviewing the animal toxicity data on commercial PCB mixtures, COT concluded that the most critical effects&mdash;that is, those seen at the lowest level of exposure&mdash;are those on the skin, the immune system, reproduction and postnatal behavioural development. It was not possible to derive no adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for these effects from the available data but it is possible to derive lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) by means of tests on animals. A LOAEL of 5 micrograms (micrograms)/kg bw/day for Aroclor 1254 was identified for effects on the skin and on the immune system, while the effect on the reproductive system was considered to lie in the range from 5 to 30 micrograms/kg bw/day.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.6/4">In the UK, the sale of PCBs for use in open applications was prohibited in 1972 and their manufacture and use in new plant and equipment prohibited in 1986. Since then, the phase-out of any remaining uses has been of PCBs sealed in older equipment and phase-out by 2010 is required by EU legislation. Action has been taken at both national and global level; the UK is a signatory to the Stockholm convention, a global treaty signed by 151 countries with the objective to protect human health and the environment from a range of 12 chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants including PCBs. Under the convention the use, manufacture, import and export of the 12 listed substances including PCBs is banned.</p>
