	<p pid="a.77.2/1">DfID monitors and reviews information on the use and potential impacts of genetically modified crops and food from a range of sources, including the United Nations Environment Programme biosafety newsletter and the Meridian Institute's food security and ag-biotech news service.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2">The Nuffield Council on Bioethics produced a major review in January 2004 on the actual and potential benefits of genetically modified (GM) crops for developing countries. The report offers a constructive contribution to the ongoing debate on genetic modification technologies. The Government share the report's conclusions that achieving food security and reducing poverty in developing countries are complex issues, that GM crops are unlikely to feed the world but that in some circumstances they could make a useful contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor people in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/3">Recognising that there are both potential benefits and risks associated with GM crops, DfID believes that developing countries need to be able to make their own informed choices about whether to adopt GM technologies or not. To this end, the UK Government have pushed for the implementation of international legislation such as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which provides for rigorous assessment and management of the risks involved in the use of genetically modified organisms. The UK has ratified this protocol.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.3/1">The red squirrel is currently protected in the UK by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (and the Wildlife &amp; Countryside (Northern Ireland) Order 1985), amended, most recently, by the Countryside &amp; Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW) for England and Wales and the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. It is included in both Schedules 5 and 6, making it an offence to kill or injure a red squirrel or disturb its place of rest. In addition to this, the red squirrel was identified as a priority species for conservation action by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan process. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is a member of the UK Red Squirrel Group (UKRSG), the UK Steering Group for the red squirrel BAP. The UKRSG provides information and advice on red squirrel conservation issues, and provides a lead on recommended actions and targets set out in the red squirrel species action plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/2">The UKRSG has largely focused conservation action for the red squirrel in key woodland sites where they are still present. A prioritisation exercise has identified those sites with suitable red squirrel habitat that can be managed to ensure their continued survival and reduce the influence of factors that may be causing their decline, such as habitat loss and loss of habitat condition, grey squirrel incursion and disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/3">With regards to the re-establishment of the red squirrel in the UK, there are several issues to be addressed, including the amelioration of the reasons for their decline at different sites. JNCC, and the UKRSG as set out in their guidance on the release of red squirrels, do not recommend the re-introduction of red squirrels without careful consideration of the site to ensure that it is of suitable habitat to support a red squirrel population and that it can be protected from the above factors.</p>
