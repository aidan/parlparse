	<p pid="a.113.5/1">The United Kingdom has arrangements in place covering the use of operational berths around the globe, including in the British Indian Ocean Territory, by the Royal Navy's flotilla of nuclear-powered submarines and those of our allies.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.5/2">The policy, which is owned by the Secretary of State for Defence, is to provide a simplified coherent strategy for all of these berths, irrespective of location. It is incumbent on the Commander in Chief Fleet, as duty holder for all operational berths, to demonstrate adequate arrangements for the management of nuclear and environmental safety at Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory. These arrangements are regulated by the Defence Nuclear Regulator on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence. Their consent is required before the berths are used.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.5/3">Solid and liquid radioactive waste generated during routine operations onboard Royal Navy nuclear-powered submarines is not currently landed at Diego Garcia; it is retained onboard until the submarine returns to the UK. Any change to this policy would require a waste plan acceptable to the regulatory authorities to be produced. Regular environmental surveys show that the marine environment has not been affected by visiting nuclear-powered submarines.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.5/4">In the unlikely event of a nuclear emergency occurring at an approved berth in Diego Garcia, a special safety scheme has been drawn up by the local and naval authorities. The MoD's Nuclear Accident Response Organisation is responsible for ensuring an effective response to an accident or incident involving defence nuclear assets or materials, in accordance with its legal obligations and common law duty of care and in keeping with MoD and wider government policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/2"><I>Letter from Stephen Penneck, </I><I>director</I><I>-</I><I>general </I><I>for ONS, to Lord Laird, dated </I><I>March 2010.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/3">As the director-general for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent Question asking further to the Written Answer by Baroness Crawley on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-13">13 January</phrase> (<I>WA 155-6</I>), what criteria were used in the 2011 census ethnic question prioritisation exercise; what was the scoring system used to decide only to add the category of Gypsy or Irish Traveller to white ethnic group; what other categories were considered; and why an Irish category was included in 2001 and will be maintained in 2011.(HL2489)</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/4">The ethnic group question is already the longest in the census questionnaire. However, there were still demands for additional response categories. For the 2011 census, there was space only for two additional tick-boxes. As explained in answer to the previous Question referred to above, ONS developed a tool to prioritise requests for additional ethnic group tick-boxes. The ethnic group prioritisation exercise scored each ethnic group under consideration against seven criteria, which were grouped into four broader themes. These were:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/5">1 Strength of need for information on that group</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/6">1.1 Group is of particular interest for equality monitoring or for policy development (for example, particularly vulnerable to disadvantage)</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/7">1.2 Group is of particular interest for service delivery</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/8">2 Lack of alternative sources of information</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/9">2.1 Write-in answers are not adequate for measuring this group</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/10">2.2 Other census information is inadequate as a suitable proxy</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/11">3 Clarity and quality of the information collected and acceptability to respondents</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/12">3.1 Without this tick-box respondents would be unduly confused or burdened and so the quality of information would be reduced (for example, if a large, well known or highly distinct group was left out and instead respondents from this group ticked a variety of options instead)</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/13">3.2 The addition of the tick-box and/or revised terminology is clear and acceptable to respondents (both in wording and in the context of the question, for example providing mutually exclusive categories) and provides the required information to an acceptable level of quality</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/14">4 Comparability with 2001 data</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/15">4 There will be no adverse impact on comparability</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/16">Potential tick-box categories were identified throughout the extensive period of consultation with users. A score of either 2, 1 or 0 was given to each category for each principle in accordance with the level of supporting evidence and analysis, ensuring a level of consistency in relation to each principle. The scoring method equated to:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/17">2 High level of evidence1 Medium level of evidence0 Low level or no evidence</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/18">This was the system that was used to decide which tick-boxes to add to the ethnic group question, including Gypsy or Irish Traveller. Full details of the prioritisation tool can be found in an information paper on the website: <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recormnendations-for-2011">http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recormnendations-for-2011</a> /index.html.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/19">Other categories considered are listed in the summary of scores shown at Annexe A in the information paper referred to above and as listed in a previous Answer in December 2009 (<I>WA</I><I></I><I>230-3</I><I>1</I>).</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/20">A particular case was made for the inclusion of an Irish category in the 2001 census by representatives of the Irish community in Britain to provide a more accurate and reliable basis for identifying and dealing with problems of disadvantage, such as health inequality, facing the Irish community. The inclusion of an Irish category was supported by the then Commission for Racial Equality as well as central government departments and Irish community groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.5/21">The 2005 consultation showed a continuing requirement for information on the Irish community and found that statistics users were happy with the ethnic populations measured in the 2001 census. ONS therefore recommended that the &quot;Irish&quot; category, and all other categories from the 2001 census, be retained. Consultation on the 2011 census content identified a strong need for comparison of ethnic group statistics with the 2001 census. Consultation also showed that statistics users were happy with the ethnic populations measured in the 2001 census and the 2001 categories have therefore been retained for the 2011 census.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.0/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised that the services provided to the authority by Hanover Communications during 2007 and 2008 were strategic communications advice regarding regulatory action and associated litigation regarding licensed centres 0157 and 0206. These services were in addition to those provided by the HFEA's head of communications and press officer. The HFEA has also advised that the head of inspection did not receive the same financial support.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/2">HFEA has advised that the matter to which its chief executive was referring is described in paragraph 2 of that same internal memo, which, I am informed, has been given to the noble Lord. As individual cases relating to this matter were resolved, details were placed on the HFEA's website. In addition, a programme of change at the HFEA (known as &quot;Programme 2010&quot;) was commenced in late 2007 and extensively publicised. This programme has now been completed. To assess its effectiveness, the HFEA has commenced an internal governance review. Again, I am informed that the terms of reference of the review have been provided to the noble Lord.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/3">The HFEA has advised that it does not hold a record of the particular witnessing system used in each licensed centre because it considers that this is not necessary to fulfil its statutory duties. The HFEA has implemented the recommendations of the Toft report and, in 2007, further recommendations regarding witnessing were incorporated into the seventh edition of the authority's code of practice. With regard to Ms Trish Davies, the HFEA has advised that it has nothing to add to the press statement of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/4">With respect to the nature of the disproportionate costs referred to in my Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-08">8 February 2010</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>81-2</I>) the HFEA has advised that it would need to scrutinise all records created since 1991 in order to establish whether any have been lost following a request from researchers. The resources that this would involve would be substantial and would breach the &#163;800 cost limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/5">The incidents at centre 0102 relate to a complaint against the HFEA about the handling of events to which the noble Lord refers. This complaint is currently the subject of an investigation. Once the investigation into this complaint is complete, the HFEA has undertaken to inform the noble Lord of the outcome.</p>

The only new-build housing in green belt to be treated as not inappropriate would generally be limited to infill in existing villages or else affordable housing to meet local need if allowed for as an exception in development plan policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.6/3">In 2008, only 2 per cent of all new dwellings in England were built in the green belt. Moreover, of those dwellings built in the green belt, the latest estimate (2007) showed that 77 per cent were built on brownfield land.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.6/1">The new InterCity East Coast franchise is planned to start in autumn 2011. A key element of the franchise specification process is to forecast future demand for rail travel, taking into account the best available data on current and future economic conditions. Economic conditions do not have a direct impact on the competitiveness of bids, although clearly they affect the level of premium that bidders may be able to offer.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.0/1">We welcomed Rwanda's accession to the Commonwealth, agreed unanimously at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Trinidad and Tobago in November last year. Rwanda has made progress towards meeting the Commonwealth's core values, in the areas of democratic process; rule of law; good governance; protection of human rights and equality of opportunity; and economic policies aimed at improving the welfare of the public. While much remains to be done in all these areas, we are pleased that member states have embraced the opportunity to engage constructively with Rwanda as the 54th member of the Commonwealth. With particular reference to the forthcoming presidential election, scheduled for August this year, we feel that Rwanda has made good progress at institutionalising the democratic process. The UK works closely with the Rwandan National Election Commission (NEC), including to see fully implemented the recommendations made by the EU Election Observer Mission in 2007, as well as with regard to the practicalities of the forthcoming elections.</p>
