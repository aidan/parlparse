The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) makes available support and accommodation for asylum seekers, who would otherwise be destitute, from the time they claim asylum in the UK to the determination of their claim. Asylum seekers whose claims are unsuccessful are required to leave the UK. NASS support cannot and should not be continued indefinitely for those who have no legal basis to remain in the UK. Under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, support and accommodation continues to be available for failed asylum seekers who are destitute and unable to leave the UK immediately due to circumstances entirely beyond their control. If there are problems in accessing support for such individuals, their cases should be notified to NASS for resolution.</p>

Special arrangements may also be made for the interview to take place to ensure that claimants with disabilities are able to present their case effectively. Claims for the grant of asylum are decided on their individual merits, against the criteria set out in the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Particular attention is paid to claims where the disability is the result of the alleged persecution or the disability is the reason for the alleged persecution. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) considers the circumstances of all destitute asylum seekers when assessing their applications for asylum support. It takes into account particular needs when providing accommodation. Information relating to disabled asylum seekers is recorded on individual case files.</p>

Sir Roger Singleton is reviewing all cases determined before 1997 where, had the sex offenders register existed, it would have resulted in the individual's inclusion on the register, and all cases involving a sexual offence or allegation which resulted in a decision not to include on List 99 or in a restriction or a partial bar. The aim of this review will be to establish if any individual poses a risk of harm to children and if any action should be taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.35/1">We are especially keen to highlight the importance of the Hampton Court agenda agreed during our presidency last year: focusing on delivery for the citizens of the EU. Our embassy in Helsinki is in daily contact with the Finnish Government on a wide range of issues. More than 40 separate meetings have also taken place between Ministers and officials from the UK and Finland since March this year. These have covered topics as diverse as the future of Europe, enlargement, counter-terrorism, Afghanistan, competitiveness and innovation, development policy, energy, climate change, and justice and home affairs. We will maintain close contact with the Finns throughout their presidency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.68/2">The LSC was set up to plan and fund post-16 learning, based on a detailed assessment of learning and skill needs. It works with a range of partners to inform the assessment of national, regional, sector and local priorities. This planning and funding system is responsive to the customers of education and training and must be driven by need, not by central design. It is for the LSC national office to allocate its budget to local areas, and for them to determine how resources can best be used to raise participation and learning and skills levels in the areas they serve. The LSC's regional directors also have a key role to play in agreeing plans, budgets and targets locally to ensure that both regional and local skill needs are met.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.71/1">The holding and management of stocks of alcohol are not themselves licensable activities. Provided the alcohol is not sold to another party, there will be no need for a licence. A licence is not required for sales of alcohol from premises owned or leased by the seller for consumption off the premises, where the sale is made:</p>
	<p pid="b.1.71/2">to a trader for the purposes of his trade;to a club, which holds a club premises certificate, for the purposes of that club; to the holder of a personal licence for the purpose of making sales authorised by a premises licence;to the holder of a premises licence for the purpose of making sales authorised by that licence; orto the premises user in relation to a temporary event notice for the purpose of making sales authorised by that notice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.71/3">The full range of activities carried out in any individual warehouse should be considered carefully, and legal advice sought if necessary, before any decision is made about the need for an authorisation under the Licensing Act 2003 (the 2003 Act). The 2003 Act devolved the administration of licensing to individual licensing authorities, normally the local authority, and it is not for the Government to seek to direct that they adopt specific interpretations of the law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.71/4">In the first instance, it is for individual licensing authorities to interpret the law on the basis of their own legal advice. An appeal mechanism has been built into the 2003 Act to ensure that licensing authority interpretations can be challenged in the courts to ensure that they are reasonable and fair.</p>

The Government are considering what further steps are needed to tackle household waste as part of the review of the waste strategy, which will be published later this year. We are also looking at the spending pressures local authorities face, with regard to waste management, ahead of the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.80/2">Variable charging is one of a number of tools that could be used to encourage waste minimisation and recycling of household waste. Local authorities already have powers to run incentive schemes or require householders to separate their waste for recycling. Recent research shows that at least half of English local authorities have run, or are running, some form of incentive scheme and some, such as Barnet, require householders to separate their recycling.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.80/3">Many countries, including some in the European Union, have introduced successful household waste charging schemes, achieving reductions in waste arisings and increases in the separation of waste for recycling.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.131/1">The draft report was received by the department in December last year. It is normal practice for external research commissioned and funded by the department to go through a number of routine draft stages to ensure factual accuracy and the robustness of the evidence. The drafting process is not intended to affect the conclusions and findings of the research unless it brings new evidence to light or identifies a misinterpretation of the evidence presented in the research.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.131/2">Drafts of research reports are working documents and not therefore circulated beyond the project advisory group until publication. The report is expected to be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.137/1">The information requested on water consumption in MoD Main Building in Whitehall is given in the table below. Unfortunately, we have not been able to establish the information for financial year 1996-97. The water consumption figures are rounded because actual consumption data is linked to billing periods, and these do not fall neatly into financial years. The figure for consumption per occupant is an approximation based on the total population of Main Building. MoD Main Building was largely vacant for redevelopment from August 2001 to May 2004 and this is reflected in the data, which also demonstrates a significant reduction in the average water consumption rate over the period. Work is in hand under the auspices of the Framework for Sustainable Development to improve this figure still further.</p>
