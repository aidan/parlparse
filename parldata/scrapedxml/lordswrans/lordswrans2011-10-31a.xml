We are aware of allegations of fraud in the electoral roll. However, these are yet to be substantiated. We have pushed the DRC's electoral commission to ensure that all parties have scrutiny of the electoral roll, and the commission publishes full voter lists on its website and in registration centres. All double entries, whether added through human error or otherwise, must be scrutinised locally and amended. We are also in close touch with internationally recognised monitoring experts in the EU and the Carter Center to ensure a high-quality network of observers will be in the country before, during and after the election.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.5/1">The EU Foreign Affairs Council's conclusions of December 2009 urged Israel to act with &quot;the full respect of international humanitarian law&quot;.

The quartet has consistently called for both sides to respect international human rights law, a call which the UK fully supports.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.5/4">EU heads of mission in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as officials in Brussels and Geneva, also regularly review and report on related human rights issues.

	<p pid="a.211.2/1">We continue to support calls by the EU and the UN for a genuine solution to the problems that the Bedouin communities in Israel and the West Bank face. We are concerned about the prospect of relocation, particularly of those communities whose schools and homes are under threat of demolition arising from action by settlers in occupied territory, which would be illegal under international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.2/2">We have raised the issue with the Israeli authorities, most recently with Defence Minister Barak (who formally oversees Israeli responsibilities for civil administration in the West Bank), using the school for Bedouin children at Khan al-Ahmer as an example and requesting that the demolition not take place. Senior officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development most recently visited the Khan al-Ahmer school on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-06">6 October</phrase> to give profile to the broader set of issues and discussed with Palestinian and UN officials how to respond to the threat of demolition and relocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.2/3">Our embassy in Tel Aviv is in regular contact with Bedouin and activists, and continues to monitor developments, including the Prawer report, which seeks to provide an economic development plan for the Bedouin and was approved by the Israeli Cabinet on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-11">11 September 2011</phrase>. The Bedouin do not believe the report provides a solution to the problems facing their community. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office maintains that the plan is balanced, and an important part of the larger development strategy for the Negev. Legislation in support of the plan is due to be raised in the Knesset's winter session, starting in November. In our representations with the Israeli authorities and members of the Knesset, we have been told that no relocations will take place until legislation is passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.2/4">We continue to make clear that Israel should take the steps necessary to ensure that the rights of minorities are protected.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.6/17">These data show RTFCs for use in the 2011-12 obligation period selling for just over 20 pence per litre. As part of our consultation on implementing the transport elements of the renewable energy directive we proposed providing twice the financial support to waste-derived biofuels as will be provided to conventional biofuels, through the award of two RTFCs per litre of waste-derived biofuel. Under double certification for biofuels derived from wastes and residues, a litre of biofuel from wastes would yield around 40 pence per litre currently. This suggests double certification could provide a greater incentive than the duty differential.</p>
