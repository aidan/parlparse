	<p pid="a.153.5/1">The increase in Waterways Ireland's budget for 2004 is due to: (a) an allocation of &pound;5.9 million towards building a new headquarters in Enniskillen; (b) increased running costs of &pound;1 million and (c) a change in the euro/sterling exchange rate from &pound;0.65 in 2003 to &pound;0.69 in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.6/1">The Kurdish Human Rights Project's report raises issues of serious concern. Prime Minister Erdogan has called for a zero tolerance approach to torture, and many of the instances of sexual abuse alleged in this report would probably fall into that category. I am sure they will be investigated with the same care which the Turkish Government have shown by their other measures to combat impunity. Those include the abolition of incommunicado detention, and reforms facilitating the prosecution of those charged with torture&mdash;which have led recently to a number of high profile cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.6/2">A decision on whether Turkey has met the criteria for opening accession negotiations will be taken by the European Council in December, on the basis of an objective and thorough report by the Commission. The UK is determined to help Turkey to pass this test, including by practical assistance to the Government's efforts to promote and protect human rights. Our programme of recent bilateral assistance to Turkey has included a project to build the capacity of non-governmental organisations campaigning for the rights of women in the south-eastern region. lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.157.5/1">The general presumption in regional planning guidance (RPG) had been that it should meet the housing requirements of the whole community and not distinguish or discriminate between any particular groups within the community. However, more recently, regional planning bodies have recognised the need to ensure that development plan authorities make adequate provision for Gypsies and Travellers. Policy 28 of RPG8 for the east Midlands and both the submitted policy CF6 and the revised policy CF5 in my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister's proposed changes to RPG 11 for the west Midlands refer to the needs of Gypsies and Travellers. In other regions RPG does not yet contain policies for Gypsies and Travellers.</p>

The Government's response to consultation made it clear however that we are prepared to review this in the light of working experience of the new rules. Both corporate and individual subscribers are currently covered by the requirement in the regulations not to send commercial e-mail which disguises or conceals the identity of the person on whose behalf it is sent, or does not provide a valid address to which a request that communications cease may be sent.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.6/1">The Plant Health (Great Britain) Order 1993 (SI 1993/1320, as amended) sets out the controls on the import, movement and keeping of plants within the EU. The order requires all plants entering the UK from third countries to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate and are subject to inspection at import. For trade within the EU, specific disease control measures are applied at the place of production and plant passports may be issued that travel with consignments allowing their free movement between member states. Such controls operate throughout the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.6/2">From May 2002 measures to control the movement of plants susceptible to the pathogenic fungus Phytophthora ramorum into and within the UK were introduced under the Plant Health (Phytophthora ramorum) (England) Order 2002. Parallel legislation was introduced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and by the Forestry Commission. These measures included a notification requirement for movements of susceptible plants within the UK. Subsequently, following pressure from the UK Government, agreement was reached in the European Community's Standing Committee on Plant Health to extend the UK's emergency measures to apply to the whole European Community. In England these were introduced in November 2002, by the Plant Health (Phytophthora ramorum) (England) (No 2) Order 2002 (SI 2002 No 2573). These measures require all consignments of rhododendron and viburnum, the principal hosts in Europe, to be accompanied by a plant passport wherever they are being moved.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.6/3">An intensive survey programme of retail outlets, nurseries, gardens and other established planting areas has been under way since the first UK case in February 2002. Where infection is suspected the consignment is placed under notice and may not be moved or sold until that notice is lifted. Any material found to be infected is destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.6/4">However, because of our concern about the potential impact if more of our free species become infected, we are stepping up the eradication and containment action already being taken. Work is already under-way to survey at least 1,000 woodland areas, established planting areas and production nurseries. Surveillance of imported material at the main ports of entry is also being stepped up.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.6/5">Although the findings on new tree species announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February</phrase> are at sites in Cornwall, findings on shrubs are more widespread. A map of outbreaks is maintained on Defra's website and is available at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/graphics/sod.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/planth/graphics/sod.pdf</a>. We are concerned about the impact this disease might have on horticulture and on the landscape, where a major epidemic in our native trees could have a significant impact. Nevertheless, we should avoid a disproportionate response to isolated findings and try to minimise the impact of our necessary actions in controlling this disease. Our inspectors will continue to work closely with individual nursery, garden centre and historic garden owners in Cornwall and elsewhere to this end.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.2/1">Plant disease campaigns over many years have not incorporated compensation for the destruction of affected plants. Our judgment is that the limited resources of the plant health service are better deployed in detecting and, as necessary, controlling outbreaks, and in carrying out research on risks and risk management measures. However, we have recently received an approach from the industry wishing to discuss possible risk-sharing mechanisms to avoid disproportionate losses to individual enterprises when action has to be taken against plant pests or diseases and we are currently considering our response to this approach.</p>

The European Commission expects to publish the full report on its website in the near future. As soon as it does so, I shall place a copy in the Library of the House.</p>
