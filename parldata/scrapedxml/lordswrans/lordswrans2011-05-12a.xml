We have had some preliminary discussions with a small number of professional bodies, but because of the number and diversity of professional institutions and associations we cannot engage with all of these organisations individually.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.2/2">In addition we support the Technicians Council, founded by Lord David Sainsbury, which continues to provide a strong advocacy for apprenticeships for the science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) community and enables a wide range of professional associations and learned societies to explore the opportunities offered by the apprenticeship programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.2/1">The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has no plans to provide a funded, elective fertility preservation service for service personnel prior to operational deployment. Procedures to preserve sexual and reproductive function have been developed and are available for the relatively small number of injured service personnel who require them on return from operations. Specifically, when deemed appropriate, access to NHS-funded sperm harvesting and storage is offered and this process will continue to be funded by the MoD. However, it is important that service personnel also have access to sound impartial advice about the options open to them prior to an operational deployment, and guidance has recently been issued to commanding officers to this effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.2/2">All deployed personnel are provided with the clothing and equipment needed to undertake operational tasking.

This clothing and armour consists of three tiers, including special protective underwear and detachable armoured groin protection and trousers.</p>

For disability living allowance entitlement relies on the care and/or mobility needs arising from a particular condition. Where individuals with a substance dependency are in receipt of such benefits it will be because they have other diagnoses, for example mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.6/5">The department does routinely record the numbers of people in receipt of disability benefits who record drug abuse or alcoholism as their main disabling condition. This information is presented in table 2. These figures represent a subset of all claimants with a drug or alcohol dependency, as not all such claimants will have declared this as their main condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.5/1">This Government recognise how upsetting it can be for people to have to move from a care home that they see as their true home. It is important for people who need care and support to be accommodated in appropriate settings, and it is clearly not desirable if someone is forced to move from a care home where they are happy and settled and their needs are being met.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/2">No assessment of the implications of older people required to leave a care home has been carried out by government. This is because the responsibility for providing or arranging residential care rests with local authorities, not central government. Local authorities have a duty to protect the interests of the people they are responsible for in care homes. In addition, the regulator-the Care Quality Commission (CQC)-has a role in ensuring care is meeting the necessary standards and that quality is maintained. If a person were evicted from a care home-for any reason-we would expect the local authority, CQC and the person's family to collaborate to ensure that the person was placed in a suitable setting at minimal disruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/3">It is unlawful for a public body to breach any person's human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. Under Article 9 of the Convention, everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Under the Health and Social Care Act 2008, &quot;public body&quot; includes any provider that supplies accommodation together with nursing or personal care on behalf of a local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/4">The Human Rights Act 1998 does not give residents a guarantee they can remain in a care home for life. The details of the contract, including the arrangements for ending the contract, are a matter for negotiation between the care home and the person or organisation commissioning the care.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.5/5">Under the Equality Act 2010, it is unlawful for a service provider to discriminate against a person on the grounds of religion or belief in the provision of its services (including the termination of the provision of the service).</p>

	<p pid="a.233.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/2"><I>Letter from Stephen Penneck, Director General for ONS, to Lord Laird, dated May 2011</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent Question asking: further to the Written Answers by Lord Taylor of Holbeach on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-06">6 April</phrase> (<I>WA384-5</I>) and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase> (<I>WA</I><I>174</I>), (i) why the Polish population in Scotland and England of 1.1 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively was not considered sufficiently large to justify a separate tick-box category in England's census form, (ii) what is the estimated proportion of the Gypsy and Irish Traveller population in the United Kingdom; and (iii) what particular efforts were made to enumerate such nomadic peoples. (HL8922)</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/4">(i) The questions and response categories in the 2011 census take account of an extensive programme of user consultation, question research, testing and development. There were many more demands for additional tick-boxes than could possibly be accommodated on the space available on the census questionnaire. Although the ethnic group question for the 2011 census was allocated more space than that for the 2001 census, there was not enough to enable tick-boxes to be provided for all the groups present in significant numbers in the UK. With space for only two new tick boxes, a set of principles was developed by which requirements for new tick-box categories for ethnic groups could be assessed and prioritised. These covered:</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/5">strength of need for information;lack of alternative sources of information;clarity and quality of the information collected and acceptability to respondents; andcomparability with the 2001 census data.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/6">Polish scored well in the prioritisation exercise but not as well as the two new ethnic group categories that have been included. However people who want to record their ethnic group as Polish will be able to do so via the write-in option. They will also be able to record their national identity as Polish via the write-in option in the national identity question. Statistics from the 2011 census will include analysis of written-in responses, so all those who record themselves as Polish will be counted as being so in the resultant statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/7">Information about the prioritisation method is published on the census website in an information paper <I>Deciding which tick boxes to add to the ethnic group question in the 2011 England and Wales Census</I>. To coincide with the laying of the census order before Parliament in October 2009, additional material covering the questions to be asked in the 2011 Census was placed on the census website: <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations-for-2011/index.html">http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations-for-2011/index.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/8">(ii) It is too early for the census to indicate yet what the estimated population of Gypsies and Irish Travellers is. I understand that the Department for Communities and Local Government do have some estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/9">(iii) Special arrangements were made to enumerate Gypsies, Travellers and people in travelling fairs. In developing the plans to do so ONS worked closely with local authority Gypsy and Traveller Liaison Officers, as well as with Gypsy and Traveller community groups. The enumeration of these groups seems to have gone well although we are not yet in a position to report on the numbers involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.2/1">The Government are having to take some very difficult decisions on public spending to tackle the fiscal deficit. Confronting the deficit prevents erosion in the confidence that the UK will continue to be able to service its debt obligations leading to higher interest rates on our public borrowing. Spiralling interest rates ultimately benefit no one due to the wider impacts on the economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.2/1">Incidence and prevalence rates for the majority of mental illnesses have remained remarkably static. However, the numbers of people being treated are increasing and the reasons for this are complex. Doctors are becoming increasingly knowledgeable about the treatments available for mental illness, including psychological therapies, and confident in prescribing medication. Improvements in medication such as antidepressants, in terms of them having fewer side effects and withdrawal symptoms, make them more likely to be prescribed. People are also more aware of common mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety as being treatable conditions and are prepared to seek help.</p>

Immigration judges have to make difficult judgments, on limited information, often in respect of people whose identity cannot be verified and whose links to the community may be fragile. Nevertheless, they aim to refuse bail only in cases where there is both statutory authority and a demonstrated justification for doing so.

	<p pid="a.246.5/1">We have not received any further news from the Syrian authorities concerning Ms Hassan.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.5/2">No accurate figures exist for the number of political prisoners in Syria, but in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 2010 human rights Command Paper we state that reports vary from 1,000 to 3,000 held in detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.5/3">We condemn utterly the violence perpetrated by Syrian security forces against civilians who are expressing their views in peaceful protests. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-01">1 May 2011</phrase>, the killing of civilians by the Syrian regime is disgraceful and unacceptable and must stop. We are clear that individuals responsible for the violence will be held accountable if the violence persists.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.5/4">We are also extremely concerned by reports from human rights organisations that the Syrian authorities have detained more than 7,000 people since protests began in mid-March. The Syrian Government and the security forces must respect the civil rights of peaceful protestors, the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.</p>

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/24" class="indent">(3) Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.</p>
