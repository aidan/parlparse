	<p pid="a.33.5/1">The venues included in the sample were randomly selected by MORI, using the <i>Yellow Pages</i> database (yell.com). The venue types from which the sample was drawn were provided by DCMS. These reflected the range of venues where music can be staged, but where the public also go for reasons other than live music. Some public houses may, for example, stage live music on a very regular basis, but they do not exist purely to stage live events. Other forms of entertainment are an option, and the venues could exist with no live music at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.5/2">The other factor involved in selecting the range of venues to be included was the likelihood of there being any impact on live music provision resulting from the new licensing arrangements. The venue types included in the sample were also those on which the department and, through advice from the Live Music Forum, the industry more generally felt that the new licensing arrangments might, if anywhere, have an impact. The estimated figure of 1.7 million live music events in England and Wales in the previous 12 months, was calculated through first establishing the average number of live music events which venues had staged in the previous year, and multiplying this figure by the estimated number of venues which exist of the types included in the survey.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">The report by the School of Dental Sciences at the University of Newcastle <i>Bioavailability of fluoride in drinking- water&mdash;a human experimental study</i> concluded that, after considering all analyses of the data, there was no evidence for any differences between the absorption of fluoride ingested in artificially fluoridated drinking water, and in drinking water in which the fluoride is present naturally. The size of this study was such that it would be unlikely to conclude incorrectly that there was no difference in absorption if in fact there were a substantial difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">The Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Dental Officers did not submit a report on the implications of the York review, but gave advice to Ministers. We do not publish advice.</p>
