	<p pid="a.59.8/1">The consultation <I>Safe. Sensible.

It seeks views on the right balance between individual responsibility, consumer choice and restricting harmful retailing practices. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.8/3">The Government's alcohol strategy focuses particularly on reducing harms experienced by young people under 18 who drink alcohol, 18-to-24 year-old binge drinkers, and harmful drinkers, who regularly drink more than double the recommend daily limits for alcohol&mdash;three to four units of alcohol for men and two to three for women. The department estimates that those drinking regularly at these levels comprise 6 per cent of the population, who drink about 33 per cent of alcohol consumed in the United Kingdom. The strategy also seeks to increase the number of people drinking within the Government's sensible drinking guidelines. Twenty-six per cent of the population regularly exceeded these guidelines in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">Our assessment of the likely cost impact of the new concession is based on generous assumptions about bus pass take-up, fares and increased patronage.

This is being distributed by a special grant, using a formula to direct funding to areas likely to experience increased costs, such as urban and tourist centres and coastal towns and is in addition to the funding that local authorities receive through the revenue support grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.2/2">The formula is based on factors such as local population, tourist numbers and current bus use, and was adjusted following consultation with local authorities and others last year to give a distribution that reflects where the burden of costs will occur.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-10-16a.64.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100797" speakername="Baroness Morgan of Drefelin" colon=":" colnum="64"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81016w0002.htm#81016w0002.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.64.2/1">In response to Question HL5508, the process of applying shields to ContactPoint child records has not yet begun. Data loading into a secure environment, for live operational purposes, is scheduled to be completed during December of this year. As soon as this data load is complete, specifically identified local authority implementation managers will all take action to shield those child records that require it, before any practitioners are given access to the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/2">In response to Question HL5509, by increased risk of significant harm, we mean that one or more individuals could cause significant harm to the child/young person and/or their parent/carer should their location be visible and therefore, the child/young person and/or their parent/carer are being, or will be, protected at a location that is not known to the individual(s) posing the threat. Shielding is an additional safeguard and wholly in line with the Data Protection Act 1998</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/3">The Children Act 1989 introduced the concept of significant harm as the threshold that justifies compulsory intervention in family life in the best interests of children. Local authorities will make case-by-case judgments about whether a record should be shielded based on the ContactPoint guidance, which in turn makes reference to the well established principles and guidance, <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>. There are, however, no absolute criteria on which to rely when judging what constitutes significant harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/4">In response to Question HL5510, the answer is yes. Local authorities may shield child records when there are strong reasons to believe that not doing so would be likely to place an individual at increased risk of significant harm. The appropriateness of shielding a record on ContactPoint must be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/5">In response to Question HL5511, we have always sought a balance between children's and families' rights to the services to which they are entitled, and their individual rights to privacy. The purpose of ContactPoint is clearly set out in Section 12 of the Children Act 2004&mdash;to support the Section 10 and 11 duties to co-operate to improve children's well-being and to safeguard and promote their welfare. The inclusion of all children and young people in England is a requirement of ContactPoint and we believe its purpose could never be achieved through a consent-based or opt-out system. We take our responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) very seriously. As with all legislation we have sought the necessary legal advice on the relationship between ContactPoint and the DPA and are confident that ContactPoint remains compliant with the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/6">ContactPoint has been, and continues to be, subject to regular risk reviews, both internal and external, conforming to Government best practice guidelines. A summary of the results of the Deloitte independent security review, commissioned by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, was published in February 2008. The report identified that security is ingrained within the project. A further independent technical security check is scheduled before ContactPoint moves into live operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/7">In response to Question HL5512, Section 12(4)(c) of the Children Act 2004 (which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>), makes provision for ContactPoint to hold the name and contact details of any person with parental responsibility for the child or young person, or who has care of him at any time. Schedule 1(6) of the Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007 (which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-01">1 August 2007</phrase>), sets this requirement out in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/8">Regulation 4(1) of the Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007 sets out that ContactPoint will contain information on all children in England up to their 18th birthday. In specific circumstances, young people (such as care leavers and those with learning disabilities), aged 18 or over may continue to have their records held on ContactPoint up to age 25, with their informed, explicit consent. This provision exists in Regulation 4(2), and helps to facilitate the transition to adult services for those young people who may have multiple, additional needs. These young people are known as &quot;participating young persons&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.2/9">Section 12 of the Children Act 2004 provides the permissive gateway to hold such data without breaching the Data Protection Act's requirement of lawfulness&mdash;this has been confirmed by Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.3/1">The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) is implementing radical changes to create a more efficient and effective service. Public health and animal health and welfare will not be put at risk. The components of the planned cost reductions are:</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/2">MHS staffing levels in all approved abattoirs have been reviewed, resulting in a reduction of 134 frontline posts, a saving of &pound;4 million per annum;a new management structure has been agreed, which will result in a reduction of 75 positions by 2009-10, a saving estimated at &pound;4 million per annum; all five regional offices have been closed, resulting in a saving of &pound;1.7 million per annum;the new time-based charging system proposed for introduction in 2009-10 will incentivise food business operators to work more closely with the MHS to reduce MHS input costs by an estimated &pound;3 million per annum; resource management on a new geographical cluster basis will enable more efficient staff deployment over a wider area. This will reduce costs by an estimated &pound;2 million per annum; andthe scaling down of government programmes will reduce work undertaken for government customers, saving a further &pound;2.3 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/3">All of the above activities will reduce bureaucracy, improve efficiency and will not result in any transfer of cost to abattoirs and their customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/4">Alongside these cost reductions, the Food Standards Agency's long-term regulatory vision for meat production is for an increasing proportion of the cost of official controls to be met by the meat industry, not the taxpayer. Proposals for a new charging system based on time costs together with a progressive increase in charges will be subject to full public consultation, including a regulatory impact assessment, during 2008-09.</p>
