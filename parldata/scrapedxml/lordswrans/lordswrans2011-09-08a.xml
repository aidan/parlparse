	<p pid="a.34.3/1">The Government are absolutely committed to tackling and preventing female genital mutilation (FGM). There are no plans for a separate government strategy, as tackling FGM is a key part of the Government's integrated approach to ending violence against women and girls. The <I>Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls: Action Plan</I>, which was published earlier this year, includes commitments to:</p>
	<p pid="a.34.3/2">develop learning programmes for the police on FGM;support community engagement work to tackle FGM;develop guidelines on FGM for prosecutors; andreview the multi-agency guidelines on FGM.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.3/3">To meet these commitments, the work of the FGM co-ordinator is being continued by a steering group made up of the relevant departments, including the Home Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for Education, Department for International Development and Department of Health. As a result, we have made significant progress in raising awareness of FGM and supporting professionals to intervene. For example, more than 40,000 leaflets and 40,000 posters have been circulated to schools, health services, charities and community groups around the country, and we have established a regular forum for the voluntary and community sector to raise concerns with the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.3/4">This forum is also used to map community engagement work and identify best practice. In addition, the new multi-agency practice guidelines are helping to ensure that professionals are able and confident to intervene to protect girls at risk.</p>
