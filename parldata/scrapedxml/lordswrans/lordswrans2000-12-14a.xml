	<p pid="a.19.5/1">The Government's transport strategy and investment plans were set out in Transport 2010: the 10 Year Plan, published in July 2000. The 10-year plan provided the long-term framework for investment, which is now being implemented. It will put right the effects of years of under-investment that this Government inherited. The 10-year plan provided for &pound;59 billion of expenditure on local transport--&pound;30.6 billion of public revenue expenditure, &pound;19.3 billion public capital investment, and &pound;9 billion of private investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">This Local Transport Capital Settlement is the first five-year allocation from the &pound;19.3 billion of public capital investment. The total allocation for English local highways authorities outside London for the period 2001-02 to 2005-06 will be &pound;8.4 billion. The five-year allocation is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.19.5/5"> <td>LTP allocations (&pound; billion)</td> <td>2001 -02</td> <td>2002 -03</td> <td>2003 -04</td> <td>2004 -05</td> <td>2005 -06</td> <td>5 year total</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.19.5/6"> <td>Major schemes, integrated  transport schemes, and  maintenance schemes</td> <td>1.36</td> <td>1.52</td> <td>1.67</td> <td>1.94</td> <td>1.93</td> <td>8.43</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.19.5/9">These figures do not sum exactly to total due to rounding.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/10">Every authority will benefit from this significantly increased funding, which in 2001-02 represents a doubling over last year's allocation for English authorities outside London, with further increases in subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/11">Using this funding, local authorities, working in partnership with local people, transport operators, businesses and interest groups, will be able to make a real difference to the quality of transport in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/12">In making these allocations, we have accepted, or provisionally accepted, 67 new major schemes (those with a gross cost of over &pound;5 million). These include 28 public transport and integrated transport schemes, including bus priority measures and guided bus schemes, to make journeys faster and more reliable with major new interchanges, and 39 road schemes, such as local bypasses and relief roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/13">This allocation will also enable authorities to take forward the many smaller-scale improvements contained in their local transport plans. These include improvements to public transport, such as priority bus routes, improved integration, better access to bus, rail, and light rail stations, more park and ride schemes, and improved waiting facilities at interchanges. They also include schemes to make local roads safer and less congested, and measures to encourage cycling and walking.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/14">Within the overall allocation, we have also made provision for authorities to repair local roads and bridges, as announced in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-13">13 November 2000</phrase> [Official Report, col. 492W]. This funding, along with the additional revenue funding being made available through the highways maintenance standard spending assessment, should enable authorities to meet the target to halt the deterioration of local roads by 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/15">Copies of the press notice and a list of allocations for individual authorities have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.2/1">The Home Office Certificate of Identity (CID) is a travel document issued to foreign nationals, other than refugees, who are resident in the United Kingdom and cannot obtain a passport from their national authorities. This type of document is not issued under an international convention but on a discretionary basis. The CID, which guarantees the holder return to the United Kingdom within the document's validity, has traditionally been widely accepted for travel. However, it is for the authorities of each country to decide whether they will accept the CID as a valid form of travel document and I am aware that a number of our European Union partners are no longer doing so. My officials are in discussion with colleagues from the countries concerned in order to identify their particular concerns and, if possible, give assurances, which might encourage them to accept the CID for travel.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">Section 17(6) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 allows the police to issue a British Visitors' Permit for a given period, so long as that period does not exceed 12 months. This gives the police the flexibility to issue a Permit to a non-United Kingdom resident who may have legitimate reasons for bringing specified firearms or ammunition into the United Kingdom on a number of occasions within any 12-month period.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">It is for the police to decide whether to issue a Permit for a 12-month period or for a shorter more specific duration, placing such conditions on the Permit as they see fit. They would treat every case on its individual merits and we have not been made aware of any occasions where the use of this discretion has led to a threat to public safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.5/1">In response to a request to host countries by the United Nations Authorities in Kosovo (UNMIK) to cease enforcing the return of Kosovans to Kosovo during the severe Balkan winter, we have given this careful consideration and decided that a wholesale suspension of enforced returns back to Kosovo would not be justified. We do not accept that single people or couples who have put forward manifestly unfounded applications and who may, for example, have arrived in the United Kingdom in recent months and long after peace was secured in Kosovo and who have families and homes there, could not return to them. But we have agreed to suspend temporarily the enforced return of families with children or vulnerable dependants or other vulnerable cases in recognition of the difficulties that larger family groups and vulnerable people may present to UNMIK in terms of providing support and accommodation during the winter period.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/2">This position has been fully explained to UNMIK, who have also been assured that in line with their previous request we will continue to inform them of returns in advance where it is possible to do so. UNMIK have said they understand our position and have expressed gratitude for the considered way in which the United Kingdom has approached the accommodation problems in Kosovo.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/2" qnum="HL25">Further to the Answer by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath on 21 November (H.L. Deb., col. 655), what is their estimate of the cost to the National Health Service of the delay in the discharge from National Health Service hospitals of patients over 75 who no longer need hospital care but who are unable to transfer to other more appropriate care.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.2/1">Patients who have their discharge from an acute hospital bed delayed may be awaiting transfer to other National Health Service care (such as intermediate care), transfer to a nursing or residential care home or for a package of care and support to allow them to return to their own home. In these circumstances it would be very difficult to quantify the precise costs to the NHS of all delayed discharges.</p>
