	<p pid="a.288.6/1">The Government recognise that many people have a particular concern about the use of non-human primates. Under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 they, together with some other species, are given special protection and can be used only where animals of no other species are suitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.6/2">Research using non-human primates is a small but currently vital part of work to protect and improve human lives. For instance, the United Kingdom uses small numbers of non-human primates for the development and testing of vaccines against some of the world's largest killers such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB, and the potential future treatment of degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The development of new drugs and medical and veterinary technologies is still dependent on the information and insights derived from the well designed, properly conducted and carefully regulated use of animals (including non-human primates) for testing and research.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.6/3">Some advocate a &quot;zero option&quot; strategy, where the goal is to stop using non-human primates altogether as fast as possible. The majority of scientific opinion believes that it will take several decades to make the advances needed to overcome all need for non-human primates.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.5/2">The vast majority of the allowances that were changed (including continuity of education allowance) are not reviewed by the AFPRB, but it does have responsibility to recommend rates in the cases of recruitment and retention allowance (London), commitment bonuses, and the reserve bands of specialist pay. As part of the 2011-12 pay review round we will be providing written evidence to the AFPRB about the new rates and our justification for them, to inform future recommendations. The AFPRB retains a fundamental independent role in ensuring that the remuneration package of Service personnel is sufficient to recruit and retain the right people.</p>

There are a range of measures which local authorities can take on the design of safer road infrastructure, including effective cycle-specific measures such as cycle routes and better traffic management. These will depend on local decisions and need to reflect local priorities. The new Local Sustainable Transport Fund of &#163;560 million over the next four years will be available to support such measures. All this is against a background of encouraging more people to cycle while minimising the risks of cycling.

The UK also funds No Legal Frontiers, which aims to ensure greater access to justice, through the publication of Israeli laws and military orders in Hebrew, Arabic and English and to carry out advocacy work. No Legal Frontiers also reports on the functioning of the juvenile military courts and provides legal defence for juvenile defendants.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.5/1">We are aware of the reports by Palestinian and international non-governmental organisations, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, alleging torture and mistreatment by the Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces. Most allegations refer to physical abuse and the use of stress positions and other coercive interrogation techniques.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.5/2">The UK condemns any abuse of human rights. We take allegations of human rights abuses extremely seriously and are studying recent allegations of mistreatment by the PA Security Forces carefully. My honourable friend Alistair Burt raised the issue of human rights abuses when he met Prime Minister Fayyad on his recent visit to the region and asked for a concrete assurance that allegations would be investigated and appropriate actions taken. Prime Minister Fayyad gave this, noting that the PA was addressing this issue not just as a result of international pressure, but because he had a deep personal conviction that human rights should be respected and at the heart of a future Palestinian state.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.5/3">Currently the UK provides direct budgetary support to the PA as part of our commitment to Prime Minister Fayyad's state building agenda. Part of his agenda is the reform of the Palestinian security forces. A condition of our memorandum of understanding is that the PA must make progress on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.5/4">In addition we offer support through the Middle East and North Africa Conflict Pool (MENA CP)-a tri-departmental programme funded jointly by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Ministry Of Defence (MoD) and the Department for International Development (DfID). Approximately two thirds of the MENA CP budget for Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories focuses on improving the performance of the Palestinian security sector through a combination of support to the United States' Security Co-ordinator (USSC) and to the European policing and rule of law missions in the West Bank. The MENA CP support to the Palestinian Authority security forces is designed to enhance the forces' professionalism and build their capability to improve their performance against internationally recognised human rights standards and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.5/5">In recent years, UK programme funds have helped provide technical advice on governance, leadership and human rights issues to the Palestinian security sector, including the Civil Police, Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defence.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.2/1">Effective peacebuilding and stabilisation involve a wide range of partners. Local peacebuilding organisations often play a key role and support for their work is an important component of the Department for International Development's (DfID's) approach to peacebuilding. However, funding to local organisations is often channelled through multilateral partners and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). For example, the Government's Conflict Pool supported the UK-based organisation Saferworld to respond to the 2008 post-election violence in Kenya. Part of this funding supported local Kenyan organisation Concerned Citizens for Peace, which was carrying out community and national level peacebuilding and reconciliation. We are not therefore able to make an overall estimate of the overall percentage of funds being channelled to local peacebuilding organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.5/2">The cost of actuarial advice in looking at any changes to the scheme will depend upon the scope of the question asked. The Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme receives actuarial advice under a commercial contract with a firm of actuaries. The costs of any work, and the number of personnel needed to carry it out, will vary depending upon the nature of the task.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.5/3">It has been the policy of successive governments, when making changes, not to introduce them retrospectively. In any case, the Superannuation Act 1972 requires that no change be made to the scheme that reduces the amount of accrued pension without the consultation with those affected, or their representatives, and agreement being given.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.5/1">In his statement on the tragic murder of David Kato, released on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-27">27 January 2011</phrase>, my honourable friend Henry Bellingham urged the Ugandan authorities thoroughly to investigate this crime and to bring the perpetrators to justice. Our high commission in Kampala has reinforced these points in discussion with the Ugandan authorities. I understand that the Ugandan police force has arrested two men in connection with Mr Kato's murder and is continuing its investigations.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.8/1">We have made clear to the Government of Uganda on several occasions that we are opposed to actions that will have a negative effect on the human rights of Ugandans, including the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. This includes our opposition to the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, tabled by a Private Member, which would further criminalise homosexuality if passed into law. We also raised concerns with the Ugandan Government over an article that appeared in a Ugandan tabloid newspaper late last year, which apparently incited violence against homosexuals.</p>

Following questioning they were released on bail, with a requirement that they report to the police twice a week. We understand that the investigation is ongoing and that neither man has yet been charged with an offence. Meanwhile, the day to day operation of the magazine, <I>Summit Business Review</I>, continues uninterrupted and we expect the next issue will be released as planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.2/2">Uganda has a lively media, and their coverage inspires active public debate on current issues and criticism of government policies. But we are concerned about administrative and legal curbs on freedom of expression. We are aware of reports that some opposition candidates have faced difficulty in accessing local media in some areas, although this is difficult to monitor in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.2/3">We have supported, via the Deepening Democracy Programme, projects to support a free media to promote accountability, including providing assistance to radio networks, media training and the promotion of accurate messaging. I condemn interference with the responsible exercise of freedom of speech by the media. We will continue to raise the importance of respecting and promoting media freedoms in our dialogue with the Government of Uganda.</p>
