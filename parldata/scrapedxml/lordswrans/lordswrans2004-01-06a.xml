	<p pid="a.33.2/2">The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) is empowered to carry out formal investigations (FIs) under Section 48 of the Race Relations Act 1976. There are two types of FI:</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/3" class="indent">general&mdash;which can look into a particular sector of activity such as English police forces and training establishments or a particular geographical area; and</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/4" class="indent">&quot;belief&quot; or named&mdash;which looks into a named organisation or named organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/5">In order to carry out an investigation into a particular organisation or particular organisations, the CRE must believe (and have some ground to sustain that belief) that the organisation or organisations in question have committed acts made unlawful under the RRA. The CRE has not carried out any FIs into a proscribed organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/6">It is not likely that the CRE would seek to investigate a proscribed organisation, though the activities of such an organisation could be a matter for the criminal justice agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/7">There is no central list of &quot;racist&quot; organisations. It is not therefore possible to comment on whether any investigations have been carried out in this area.</p>

Each Best Value town and parish council receives a grant of &pound;30,000 per annum towards the cost of auditing their performance plans and carrying out other Best Value requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/2">Regarding the non-statutory triennial audit in respect of other parish councils, we understand that the commission does not hold details of individual councils that participated in the scheme, hence it is not possible to make a direct comparison with current audit costs.

	<p pid="a.35.5/1">No studies of the efficacy of United Kingdom anthrax vaccine against inhalation anthrax have been undertaken in humans. Animal studies with the UK vaccine suggest that although a single immunisation will induce a response, optimum protective immunity is achieved by administering booster doses. Most vaccines require several doses to achieve and maintain protective immunity and the anthrax vaccine is not expected to be different. In 1991, anthrax vaccine and pertussis vaccine were co-administered, rather than being combined and given in one injection. In February 1991, the decision was taken to drop pertussis from the anti-biological warfare programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.5/1">A general briefing containing advice for Ministers on what they could do in support of the London 2012 bid in the course of their official duties was circulated in July 2003. This briefing was based on the rules of conduct issued by the International Olympic Committee to all cities wishing to organise the Olympic Games. We would need IOC permission to place a copy of this document in the Library of the House; meanwhile it can be viewed on the IOC website at <a href="http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en-report696.pdf">http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en&ndash;report 696.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">The Government recognise the critical importance of having highly trained scientists and engineers to help meet their information technology targets. The 2002 spending review settlement saw &pound;100 million per year added to the science budget, from 2005&ndash;06, to implement the key recommendations of the Sir Gareth Roberts review of the supply of scientists and engineers. This money will create 1,000 new academic fellowships, substantially increase postdoctoral salaries and improve the training opportunities available to postdoctoral researchers. Additionally, the UK research base has a strong relative international performance in terms of achievement, productivity and efficiency. On many indicators, we rank second only to the USA in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.2/2">The Government are aware of the challenge in making the UK a world leader in the use of ICT.

	<p pid="a.43.2/1">This is a matter for the judgment of those concerned, but government facilitate access to advice to assist individuals making those sort of choices. New entrant farmers can access a range of business advice for start-up businesses through the business links network and the Small Business Service. For full-time farmers this includes access to the Farm Business Advice Service.</p>
