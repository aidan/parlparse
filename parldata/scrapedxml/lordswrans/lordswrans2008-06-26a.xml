This brings the UK's overall support to &pound;27.5 million, the largest contribution from any single country so far. This is additional to the UK's long-term humanitarian programme in Burma on which we plan to spend &pound;12 million this year, rising to &pound;18 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/2">As part of its contribution to the humanitarian relief effort, DfID has provided &pound;5 million in logistical and relief supplies, including emergency water containers, shelter materials for 30,000 families, and 14 flat-bottomed boats and engines designed to make bulk distributions of relief items in the inland waters of the Irrawaddy delta.

	<p pid="a.263.5/1">Information on the number of looked-after children during the past six years who had more than five or 10 placement moves, has been placed in the House of Lords Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/2">Improving placement stability for looked-after children is a high priority for the Government, as reflected in their public service agreement targets and the national indicator set for local government. The <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper and the Children and Young Person's Bill include a range of measures which will help to improve placement stability, including revised arrangements for care planning, strengthening the role of independent reviewing officers to ensure placement moves are given greater scrutiny, and ensuring children are placed closer to their homes and schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/3">Short-term placements refer to children who are looked after under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989, who are subject to an agreement between children's services and the child's parents or guardians, whereby the children normally live at home but are accommodated by a local authority in a pattern of short periods of care in order to give their parents (or guardians) some &quot;respite&quot; from the normal duties of looking after a child. A typical example would be a physically disabled child, who normally lives at home with his/her parents, but who is accommodated by a local authority every weekend. While these children are legally &quot;looked after&quot; during the course of their short breaks, their situation differs significantly from that of other looked after children. Consequently, these children are generally excluded from our published data.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.11/1">We are very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and among Iraqi refugees in the wider region. That is why DfID has committed over &pound;149 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq since 2003, &pound;17 million of which has been allocated this year. We have channelled our assistance to a variety of international organisations working to provide assistance to the most vulnerable people displaced inside Iraq and in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.11/2">However, it will require an Iraqi-led solution to tackle this problem fully. The Government of Iraq (GoI) have recognised that they hold primary responsibility for the welfare of their people and are working to address the humanitarian situation inside the country. For example, the GoI this week allocated $40 million to the World Food Programme, to assist in the provision of food for internally displaced people.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.11/3">It is also necessary to recognise the considerable hospitality which Syria and other countries in the region have shown by accommodating large numbers of people fleeing the violence in Iraq. However, this hospitality cannot be expected to last indefinitely. The UK Government continue to encourage the GoI to take a lead in providing financial support to their own people in the region. We are seeing some progress being made. The GoI have transferred $25 million to Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to support the Iraqis who are currently living there, and have allocated $195 million to support voluntary returnees.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.11/4">The longer term solution to the problem hinges on the security situation improving in Iraq. Currently, refugees who have been interviewed in the region have said they do not wish to return to Iraq because they believe it is unsafe to do so. The UNHCR, which leads on refugee issues, has also made it clear that the situation in Iraq does not currently warrant mass refugee return. Therefore, security must be the Iraqi Government's top priority, to allow displaced people to feel safe enough to return home.</p>

In 2008, UNRWA has allocated approximately 13 per cent of its assistance to Lebanon, 16 per cent to the West Bank and 31 per cent to the Gaza Strip. Just over 7 per cent is set aside for its head quarters in Gaza.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.5/1">The PPP contracts were signed in December 2002 (Tube Lines JNP contract) and April 2003 (Metronet BCV and SSL contracts). The PPP contracts are for 30 years, but provide for a periodic review every seven-and-a-half years that gives London Underground and the PPP companies the opportunity to review the specification and price for the remainder of the contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.5/2">For Tube lines, the second period commences in July 2010. Contract deliverables due in the second period include completion of the Northern line upgrade and delivery of the Piccadilly line upgrade. Work is already well underway for the Northern line upgrade, which is programmed to be completed by the end of 2011 against a contract requirement of January 2012. Tube lines have also started the procurement process for the Piccadilly line upgrade that is due to be completed by 2014. In January 2007, contracts for the new signalling system were awarded, and the process for procuring the new rolling stock was also commenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.5/3">Following the PPP administration of Metronet on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-18">18 July 2007</phrase>, both Metronet companies transferred to Transport for London on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-27">27 May 2008</phrase>. Transport for London, together with London Underground and the Government, are currently considering the future structure for the lines previously the responsibility of Metronet. A key consideration is to ensure that the major upgrades due to be completed on the Victoria, Metropolitan, Circle, District and Hammersmith and City lines during the second PPP period are not significantly affected by Metronet's failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.5/4">The Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 settlement sets out the expected levels of Transport for London's grant and borrowing to 2017-18. This makes provision for the continued modernisation of the Underground and Government will continue to work with London Underground and Transport for London to ensure that these upgrades can be delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.5/1">Support to northern Uganda is a priority for the UK Government's programme in Uganda. The UK Government's Department for International Development is allocating resources to support the implementation of the Peace Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) which is the Uganda Government's overarching framework for the recovery effort. The objective is to support a smooth transition from humanitarian to development programming, delivering benefits to the people of the north and helping to sustain peace. DfID together with other development partners is currently in discussions with the Government about the most appropriate way to finance the PRDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.5/2">In the mean time, DfID will continue to allocate its resources through a range of actors including the World Bank, the United Nations, the Red Cross Movement, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.0/1">The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) visited Morocco, Western Sahara, the Polisario-run refugee camps in Tindouf (Algeria) and Algiers in May and June 2006 to gather information on the human rights situation. The OHCHR shared its report privately with Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-08">8 September 2006</phrase>, but did not publish it, in line with terms of reference agreed by all parties prior to the visit. The High Commissioner for Human Rights continues to maintain the position that the report should remain an internal document, not for official publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/2">Staff from our embassy in Rabat visited Western Sahara in July 2006, and a further visit is planned. The UN Secretary-General's personal envoy to the Western Sahara, Peter van Walsum, visited the territory in September 2006, May 2007 and February 2008. Mr van Walsum hosted talks between the parties to the dispute in New York on 18 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June 2007</phrase>, 10 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-12">12 August 2007</phrase>, 7 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-09">9 January 2008</phrase> and 18 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-19">19 March 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.278.0/1">The repatriation of 200 Ugandan refugees by the United National High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is being carried out at the request of the refugees themselves. UNHCR, the Governments of Zambia and Uganda and the refugees have concluded that the current political, economic and social conditions in Uganda allow for the repatriation to take place. While we have no reasons to disagree with this assessment it will be important that the reintegration process in Uganda is monitored to ensure its success. As is the case with all returning refugees, UNHCR will monitor for at least six months to ensure a successful reintegration in Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/2">The repatriation process will be guided by the principles that refugee repatriation should be voluntary and be carried out under conditions of safety and dignity, as required under international refugee law.</p>
