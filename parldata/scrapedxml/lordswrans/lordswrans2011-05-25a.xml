This involved all amounts under and over &#163;50,000. 2,010 depositors were involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.0/2">A deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-30">30 October 2009</phrase> was put in place for depositors with Icesave accounts because, as the UK branch of Landsbanki Islands hf, Icelandic law applies to the winding up of the bank.</p>

Claims not registered by this date were extinguished. In addition, under the Financial Services Authority's rules, an eligible claimant cannot claim against the FSCS if the FSCS is unable to lodge a claim against the failed institution. Accordingly, the FSCS must reject an application for compensation if the liability of the relevant person (in this case, Landsbanki) to that depositor has been extinguished by law.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.0/4">Conversely, Heritable and Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander were UK subsidiaries of Icelandic Banks. The administration of these banks is therefore governed by UK law, under which an equivalent deadline does not exist. Therefore, there is not the same requirement to place a deadline for depositors to claim compensation for the money they had deposited with the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.0/5">The FSCS is independent of the Government. Payment of compensation for amounts up to f50,000 is a matter for the FSCS. Under the rules covering FSCS payouts, the FSCS will continue to pay compensation provided that the relevant bank in question owes a legal liability to its customer.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.2/6">add 1 per cent to the average household energy bill in 2020 compared with a bill in 2020 in the absence of these policies; andadd 26 per cent to the average medium-sized non-domestic user's energy bill in 2020 compared with a bill in 2020 in the absence of these policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/7">Since July 2010, the Government have announced plans to fund the renewable heat incentive and carbon capture and storage demonstrations through general taxation rather than a levy on energy prices, which will reduce these impacts. The Government also announced the introduction of a carbon price floor and plans to reform the electricity market, price and bill impacts for which were estimated in their respective impact assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/8">Government recently announced their proposal to legislate a fourth carbon budget level of 1950 MtCO2e over 2023-7 and are determined to meet this carbon budget in a way that ensures the most cost effective pathway to our long-term 2050 target to reduce emissions by at least 80 per cent from 1990 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/9">The overall costs to the economy and the impact on households and business will depend on how Government plan to deliver the fourth carbon budget and what policy instruments are in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/10">The CCC estimates costs of the order of 1 per cent of GDP or &#163;13.5 billion a year by 2025 based on their modelling and their suggested mix of technologies to deliver emissions reductions to meet the 1950 MtCO2e fourth carbon budget level through domestic action.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/11">Government estimate of the net cost and benefits over 2023-7 range from a cost of at least &#163;1.9 billion if the budget is met with trading, rising to at least &#163;7 billion if the budget is met wholly through domestic abatement. These costs reflect the marginal cost of meeting the fourth carbon budget over the five year period only, given technology abatement costs, operating costs and fuel savings, together with other wider impacts. They do not reflect a full assessment over the lifetime of as policy, and do not reflect a full assessment of policy costs, macroeconomic costs or distributional implications from the additional effort required to meet the fourth budget nor current policies. More detail will be available in the impact assessment published this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/12">Government will publish further detail on policies and proposals to deliver the fourth carbon budget in October, and this will include an assessment of the policy costs. They will also provide a re-assessment of the overall costs of the package of policies and measures to deliver carbon budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.2/13">Costs of climate change mitigation need to be compared against the costs of inaction. The Stem review found that the negative impact of climate change could be equivalent to a fall in global per capita consumption of 5-20 per cent now and forever. This is as a result of adaptation costs (such as increased heating and cooling bills, and flood defences) and impacts which cannot be adapted to (such as health impacts and increased flood damages).</p>

	<p pid="a.437.6/2">The financial crisis highlighted some concerns over the reliability of CRA ratings. These concerns primarily relate to specific forms of structured credit, an area where much reform has been achieved under European Regulation EC 1060/2009 (also known as CRA1). Typically, and even through the crisis, CRAs are considered to have offered reasonably good estimates of credit quality among corporate and sovereign issuers.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.6/3">An additional source of instability associated with ratings pertained to the mechanistic reliance on CRAs by the market and to the lack of transparency. Both of these areas, alongside ways to promote competition, are priorities for further reform.

	<p pid="a.439.6/2">We support co-operation between UK and Indian enforcement agencies in a range of areas and will continue to engage the Indian Authorities on measures to combat human trafficking and illegal immigration, including offering UK experience and expertise where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/3">The Government are committed to working with international partners to address the problem of human trafficking. The issue was raised with the Government of India at the last EU-India Human Rights dialogue, held on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-22">22 March 2011</phrase>. The EU is currently funding three major anti-trafficking projects in India (and neighbouring countries) with local partners through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Our High Commission in New Delhi is involved in a pilot project to improve the exchange of information between agencies dealing with the prevention of trafficking and the rehabilitation of victims of commercial sexual exploitation in India. And the Department for International Development is currently developing a new regional programme aiming to reduce human trafficking across the South Asia region, including in India.</p>

	<p pid="a.440.2/1">The UK has taken the lead in international efforts to impose and implement financial sanctions on the Gaddafi regime. We and our EU partners have implemented the sanctions elements of UN Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973 through EU Regulations 204, 233, 272, 288, 296 and 360, which have steadily extended and updated the range of regime-linked individuals and entities subject to asset freezes. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-11">11 March 2011</phrase> the UN also established a Sanctions Committee to monitor the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1970, chaired by Portugal. We are offering guidance and support to the Sanctions Committee. The targeted sanctions imposed under these UN Resolutions have squeezed the regime financially, making it harder for Colonel Gaddafi and his associates to fuel the war further.</p>

	<p pid="a.440.5/1">Records are not centrally held for the number of convictions obtained using DNA evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/2">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) holds records of matches, ie DNA matches between material left at the crime scene and a person with a profile on the NDNAD. The match gives the police an intelligence lead on the possible identity of the offender, as there could be an innocent reason for a person having been at a crime scene.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/3">Records of how the police make use of these DNA matches to develop evidence to be presented in court are held on case files, locally by police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service. If a person is to be charged on the basis of a DNA match, the CPS requires that there must be supporting non-DNA evidence available to be used in evidence. No one is ever prosecuted solely on the basis of a DNA match; the DNA evidence is one piece of the information that the courts would require for a successful prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/4">Information is however collected centrally on the number of DNA detections, based on quarterly questionnaires completed by forces. These are crimes with a match which were detected (in broad terms, cleared up by the police).</p>
	<p pid="a.440.5/5">However, we cannot say whether the DNA match was the key factor which led to the offender being detected, as there may also have been other types of evidence in the case. Information on the number of DNA detections is provided in National DNA Database annual reports, which are published on the National Police Improvement Agency website,</p>

	<p pid="a.445.3/1">The work to develop a UK strategy for building stability overseas has identified resource scarcity as a potential driver of conflict and instability. The Department for International Development (DfID) is already supporting efforts to enable poor people to share the benefits of natural resources and environmental assets such as air, water, forests and energy, and improving access to environmental services.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.3/2">Trans-boundary collaboration on water management issues has the potential to reduce drivers of regional political tension. As part of the UK's work on water resources, the Government are providing funding to trans-boundary water initiatives in Africa and Asia, including the South Asia Water Initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.446.2/1">All of the Department for International Development's (DfID's) funds are channelled through trusted partners such as the United Nations, non-government organisations and the private sector, that have robust monitoring and financial accounting systems to ensure aid reaches its intended recipients. None of the resources are channelled through the Government of Zimbabwe. For 2011-12, DfID has development funding of &#163;80 million which will be directed towards provision of basic services like health and education and supporting the livelihoods of the poorest Zimbabweans.</p>
