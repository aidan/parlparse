Instead the development and enhancement costs for the online service have been met entirely by QinetiQ. It is intended that the company will recoup these investment costs and generate income through the charges for services on the census website.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.8/1">The Government are considering a package of measures which, taken together, should meet the concerns expressed by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgments in a series of cases from Northern Ireland, including that of Jordan v The United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.8/2">In furtherance of that objective, I have had a number of discussions with the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland (the Director) regarding the giving of reasons when a decision is reached not to initiate or continue a prosecution. We have agreed that the following statement should issue:</p>
	<p pid="a.259.8/3">&quot;The policy of the Director in the matter of providing reasons for decisions not to initiate or continue prosecutions, is to refrain from giving reasons other than in the most general terms. The Director recognises that the propriety of applying the general practice must be examined and reviewed in every case where a request for the provision of detailed reasons is made. This policy is based on a series of public interest considerations. It also reflects the duties owed by the Director to a range of parties as a public authority under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The lawfulness of the policy was upheld by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in Re Adams Application for Judicial Review (2001) NI 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.8/4">The Director, in consultation with the Attorney General, has reviewed his policy in the light of the judgments delivered by the European Court of Human Rights on the <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-04">4 May 2001</phrase> in a number of Northern Ireland cases, including the case of Jordan v The United Kingdom. Having done so, the Director recognises that there may be cases in the future, which he would expect to be exceptional in nature, where an expectation will arise that a reasonable explanation will be given for not prosecuting where death is, or may have been, occasioned by the conduct of agents of the State. Subject to compelling grounds for not giving reasons, including his duties under the Human Rights Act 1998, the Director accepts that in such cases it will be in the public interest to reassure a concerned public, including the families of victims, that the rule of law has been respected by the provision of a reasonable explanation. The Director will reach his decision as to the provision of reasons, and their extent, having weighed the applicability of public interest considerations material to the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.2/1">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/2">The NHS Plan, which was published in July 2000, set out a work programme for the National Health Service to improve the standards in cleanliness within hospitals and initiated an immediate nation-wide campaign to clean and smarten up the NHS. Patient Environment Action Teams (PEAT) undertook unannounced visits to assess progress. Over &pound;60 million has been invested to make improvements to the hospital environment since the NHS Plan was launched, which will directly benefit patients and visitors. The Clean Hospitals Programme has been a clear success and has had a significant impact on standards of cleanliness, decoration and supporting services, to the extent that by October last year there were no hospitals in England where cleaning standards were found to be less than acceptable. Standards are now much more in line with patients' expectations. National results of the PEAT programme, as set out in the table, were published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-31">31 October 2001</phrase>.</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.261.2/9">New national standards for cleanliness in the NHS, which form part of the performance assessment framework, were issued to the NHS last year. They describe what a &quot;clean&quot; hospital looks like and will help all hospitals to further raise the levels of cleanliness and, importantly, they will help to ensure that the standards achieved are maintained in the future. This means that for the first time there is a definitive set of cleaning standards with which all trusts will have to comply.</p>

The UK raised concerns that global sponsorship should benefit from derogation until <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase>. The UK also mentioned the need to ensure that the directive was compatible with other legislation pertaining toe-commerce. There was some discussion of the scope of the directive, and Commissioner Byrne explained that it did not cover indirect advertising.

Member states expressed concern over recent ECJ rulings that treaty provisions on freedom to provide services applied to health services, which had previously been thought to lie outside treaty competence. The Commission called for further discussions on the detail and will produce a discussion document for the Spanish Presidency conference in February. The UK explained that the rulings had implications for domestic legislation, to which we were responding, and that there was a need to look further at competence boundaries. Other member states were of the same opinion.</p>
