	<p pid="a.94.3/1">The effect on the income of charities will depend on how they have managed their investments since 1997 when the reforms of corporation tax were announced. It is not possible accurately to measure the effect on charities as they will have rebalanced their portfolios and the economy in general should have benefited. To give time for the benefits of the reforms to feed through and for charities to make any necessary adjustments to their investment strategies the withdrawal was deferred from charities until April 1999 and is being phased in with a transitional relief payable over a further five years. Altogether, this compensation package is worth over &pound;1 billion.</p>

The main reason was that no prior attainment could be found for the pupil from which to measure progress to the next key stage of their education. This is predominantly an issue with pupils whose earlier education was not assessed through the National Curriculum&mdash;for example, those in independent schools which do not participate in National Curriculum assessment arrangements.

	<p pid="a.104.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-18">18 December 2001</phrase> the House of Commons decided to grant Members who have chosen not to take their seats the right to use the facilities within the precincts of that House. As a result of this decision the Members in question have been issued with security passes by the House of Commons authorities and as pass-holders they enjoy rights of access to large parts of the parliamentary estate, including the public areas of the House of Lords. However, the present situation is without precedent and there is no rule specifically concerning any further rights of access that might be granted to Members of the House of Commons who have not taken their seats. It will be for the Offices Committee to make a recommendation on this matter.</p>
