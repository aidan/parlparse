	<p pid="a.89.4/2" qnum="HL3913">Further to the Answer by Lord Rooker on 28 April (<I>Official Report</I>, House of Lords, col. 1), why the Veterinary Products Committee recommended that they continue to license diazinon sheep dips when the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority suspended authorisation for all sheep dips and jet sprays containing diazinon in May 2007 following evidence showing these practices may affect the occupational health and safety of rural workers.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-10a.89.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="89"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80610w0001.htm#80610w0001.htm_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.89.5/1">The Australian Government's suspension of the diazinon sheep dip and spray products was based on the evidence reported in the second part of a preliminary review of diazinon, published in June 2006 by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/2">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) assessed the Australian preliminary report in relation to veterinary medicinal uses of diazinon. It concluded that the report contains nothing to suggest diazinon sheep dips should be banned in the UK. The Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) and the Medical and Scientific Panel (MSP) reviewed the APVMA documents and commented on the VMD report and its conclusions. Both independent committees agreed with the analysis provided by the VMD.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/3">The primary reasons to conclude that the APVMA's review gave no reason to change UK Government policy on OP sheep dips were:</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/4"><I>a</I><I>cceptable daily intake (ADI) for diazinon</I>&mdash;concern was raised that the authors of the report had added an additional uncertainty factor into both the internationally accepted ADI and also their margin of exposure determinations and had based their conclusions on the reduced numbers. It was felt that the extra uncertainty factor was not justified and that the standard internationally agreed default values should have been used;<I>differences in personal protective equipment (PPE)</I>&mdash;there are significant differences in the PPE required in Australia and the UK. In particular PPE for the torso and legs differs significantly. In Australia, this consists of cotton overalls and water-resistant footwear/boots. The UK requirements are a boiler suit and bib-apron or waterproof coat, and waterproof trousers/leggings worn over Wellington boots. The report does not include sufficient detail to make an estimate of differences of total body exposure due to these differences in PPE;<I>e</I><I>xtrapolation of experimental data</I>&mdash;the Australian study was conducted by exposing workers to the various application methods by treating 50 sheep. This exposure was then extrapolated to a total of 2,000 sheep for dipping and 500 for jetting (assuming a linear relationship for exposure). This extrapolation in itself brings a degree of uncertainty into the final results;<I>application methods</I>&mdash;the report gives no specific detail of the methods used to apply the diazinon in the study. Therefore, it is not clear if additional worker protection such as splash guards around dips and races were used as required in the UK; and <I>closed </I><I>t</I><I>ransfer </I><I>s</I><I>ystem</I><I>&mdash;</I>one critical difference was that in 2000 in the UK the sheep dip packaging was redesigned to prevent operators being exposed to the concentrated product.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/5">All of these comments were passed back to the AVPMA in response to their public consultation on their diazinon review.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.5/6">The Government are and always will be guided by the best scientific advice. The MSP is tasked with the responsibility of continually looking at scientific papers worldwide and advising the VPC of appropriate action. The VPC has recently confirmed its advice that there is no reason currently to take any additional regulatory action on these products, provided they are used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.5/1">The new local government performance framework was introduced in April 2008 and creates a framework for managing local government performance. At its heart is the national indicator set comprising 199 indicators, including NI 197 improved local biodiversity&mdash;active management of local sites. All local authorities will report on their performance against all 199 indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/2">Local area agreements (LAAs) are three-year performance management agreements between central and local government on up to 35 of the national indicators where there are particular performance issues or opportunities. Negotiations through government offices are due to be concluded with 150 upper tier authorities by the end of June 2008. A number of localities have chosen NI 197 as an improvement indicator.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/3">Local government performance will be assessed through a new comprehensive area assessment inspection regime to be introduced in April 2009 through the Audit Commission. This replaces comprehensive performance assessment and will dovetail with the work of other inspectorates into one overall approach. Details of the assessment process are subject to consultation, but is likely to focus on the national indicators selected in each LAA. The performance of other national indicators may form part of the assessment where there is a risk to delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/4">National Indicator NI 197 measures the performance of local authorities for biodiversity by assessing the implementation of positive conservation management of local sites and consequently their wider performance for biodiversity (in turn contributing to wider environmental quality).</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/5">The indicator does not measure the biodiversity duty (NERC Act 2006) which requires all public authorities, including local authorities, to have regard to biodiversity as far as is consistent with the proper exercise of their functions. Nevertheless, successfully to improve a local site system and the management of local sites will require local government to deliver many of the themes articulated in the duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/6">The joint area review (JAR) is a three-year programme running until December 2008. All 150 upper tier local authority areas will be reviewed to judge the contribution that the council and its partners in the local area are making to improve outcomes for children and young people. As such, the statutory provisions for biodiversity and nature conservation will not form part of this review.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">The research agency of the Forestry Commission (Forest Research) has continued investigation into the disease caused by the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum (known as Sudden Oak Death in the USA). These investigations also include another Phytophthora pathogen, recently named P. kernoviae. Only discovered four to five years ago in Britain, both pathogens are considered recent introductions. Both attack the foliage of certain ornamental and understorey shrub species such as Rhododendron, where they produce spores. When heavy infestations of these &quot;foliar&quot; hosts occur, nearby trees become infected, resulting in extensive bark killing and even mortality. Beech is very susceptible and is most at risk from both pathogens, but P. ramorum is capable of causing potentially lethal cankers on various trees including southern beech (Nothofagus), turkey oak (Quercus cerris), red oak Q. rubra and sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa). Native oaks show low levels of susceptibility only in laboratory tests and only one individual of sessile oak (Quercus petrea) in woodland has succumbed to a natural P. ramorum infection. Currently, more than 150 P. ramorum outbreaks have been detected on shrubs in gardens and woodlands, mostly in England, but infected trees have only been found at about 10 of those sites. There are about fifty P. kernoviae outbreaks (mainly in Cornwall with a small focus in Wales) but about 20 per cent have affected trees. Efforts at eradicating or containing the disease in woodland concentrates on destroying infected foliar hosts&mdash;mainly R. ponticum. However, Forest Research work shows that even when foliar hosts are removed, both pathogens can persist for at least one to three years in soil and litter layers. FR scientists have also shown that both pathogens can be found in debris on footwear, and probably on vehicle tyres, thus providing a mechanism for local spread into new areas.</p>
