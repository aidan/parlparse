	<p pid="a.429.5/1">We believe that good diplomatic relations are in the interests of both the UK and Iran, and that a successful outcome to the nuclear talks would transform relations for the better. It is regrettable that some Iranian officials have reacted so strongly to recent British statements-worsening relations help neither side. However, part of a mature relationship is being able to discuss differences openly, including concerns over Iran's nuclear programme and the human rights situation, and we will continue to take every opportunity to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.0/1">Since 1999, the National Health Service Counter Fraud Service has recovered over &#163;65 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/2">In line with the White Paper <I>Liberating the NHS</I>, from April 2011 NHS Protect will incorporate the functions of the NHS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service that cannot be undertaken by NHS bodies, either in isolation or regionally. A consultation exercise is under way with trade unions and staff on the changes. The underlying principle is to ensure that, within the available budget, NHS Protect is able to respond to the changing needs of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/3">NHS Protect will deliver an intelligence-rich service to assist the NHS to better address security risks, including fraud, at a local level. Provision will be made to ensure that general practitioner consortia have appropriate access to effective anti-fraud services, following on from the work that the NHS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service currently undertake with primary care trusts. To support this, NHS Protect will provide guidance and assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/4">The NHS Business Services Authority does not plan to pilot the changes which are due to be in place from April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.0/5">The proposed changes will mean that the staffing complement for NHS Protect will be 165 posts, compared to the current complement of 209 for the NHS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service.</p>
