	<p pid="b.115.2/1">The results of the global positioning system (GPS) integrity study revealed certain shortcomings in GPS which necessitate further investigation to establish how to safely implement GPS for air navigation purposes. As a consequence, the Civil Aviation Authority has initiated a programme of GPS trial approaches to be conducted in 2006 under carefully controlled conditions. The purpose is to ensure that, when using GPS for specific phases of flight (eg on approach), the required degree of safety can be demonstrated both in UK airspace and by UK aircraft flying elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.5/1">It is estimated that when the national bowel cancer screening programme is fully rolled out in England, an extra 4,000 cancers a year will be detected. Research has shown that screening with the faecal occult blood test every two years will cut the mortality from bowel cancer by 15 per cent in those people screened.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.5/2">The National Health Service bowel cancer screening pilot in Coventry and Warwickshire showed that screen-detected cancers had no detrimental effect on bowel cancer services.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.5/3">A national training programme for endoscopy has been established to make sure we have sufficient staff to diagnose the cancers, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence produced updated guidance on <i>Improving Outcomes in Colorectal Cancers</i> in May 2004. This guidance is aimed at helping those involved in planning, commissioning, organising and providing bowel cancer services to ensure the configuration of appropriate high quality services.</p>

	<p pid="b.119.8/1">In November 2005 a European Commission-commissioned, Health Protection Agency-run, influenza pandemic exercise (Exercise Common Ground) was undertaken. Participants included the EC and European Union member states.</p>

RDS reviewed the report when originally published in 2002 and more recently when Natural Justice contacted the Home Office about conducting further research. The Home Office concluded that, while the results showed a positive effect on behaviour, the numbers involved were too small to make the drawing of wider conclusions possible. Although the Prison Service has a long-standing commitment offering access to Natural Justice for further research on this issue&mdash;subject to operational, ethical and methodological considerations being met&mdash;additional evidence is needed to warrant a major change to prisoners' diet as suggested. In addition, the Prison Service has made significant steps in achieving its objective for all establishments to offer a range of foods and meals that enable prisoners to make healthy eating choices.</p>
