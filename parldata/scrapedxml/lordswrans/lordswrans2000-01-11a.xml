Any cinema which my right honourable friend has listed as being of architectural or historic interest is protected on the same basis as applies to any other listed building. Under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, listed building consent is required for the carrying out of works resulting in the demolition of a listed building or for any alteration or extension which would affect its character as a building of special architectural interest. Conservation area consent is required for the demolition of an unlisted building within a conservation area. The Act also allows local authorities to take action where a historic building has deteriorated to the extent that its preservation may be at risk.</p>

Furthermore, funding has been made available for the BAA Millennium Youth Games, which includes women's football. The Sport England funding is a combination of lottery and Exchequer funding. Ultimately, however, overall responsibility for the development of the women's game in England falls to the Football Association.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">We see no need for the Treaties governing membership of the Union to include a specific provision on unilateral withdrawal. It remains open to Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972, the logical consequence of which would be to withdraw from the EU. The terms of such a withdrawal would be for the Government to negotiate with the other member states.</p>

Workshops covered access to further, higher and adult education; access to employment; access to the National Health Service; using direct payments to empower people with learning difficulties; and whether disability was a barrier to tourism. Discussions in each of these workshops led to a worthwhile exchange of information and experiences and the dissemination of good practice. The workshop on tourism was facilitated by the English Tourism Council (ETC). It provided DCMS and its sponsored body the ETC with a greater understanding of the key difficulties facing disabled travellers. This will assist them in their aim of making English tourism the most accessible and welcoming in Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.5/1">Primary care groups may include complementary medicine within the range of services they provide if they consider that this is appropriate to the needs of their patients and in line with the locally agreed health improvement programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/2">As part of a larger exercise to monitor the work of primary care groups, a survey by Manchester University has asked them to indicate their intentions for commissioning complementary therapies. A report on this survey should be published in spring, and will inform a new research project by Sheffield University which will compare actual provision of complementary medicine by primary care groups in the coming year with its provision five years earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.5/3">In the meantime, officials at the Department of Health have conducted a separate informal survey of the attitude of primary care groups towards the provision of complementary medicine. If the results are typical, early indications are that at least half of all primary care groups provide some form of complementary medicine. The results are still being analysed, and will need to be compared with the result of the Manchester survey. In due course we will consider what lessons the results provide and how best to disseminate them to National Health Service service commissioners.</p>

This will increase the number of cameras deployed, further deter speed and red light running and thereby achieve the Government's road safety objective. Each pilot scheme will involve local authorities, magistrates' courts, the police and in some cases the Highways Agency and Crown Prosecution Service. The schemes will be based in these eight police areas--Essex, Northampton, Thames Valley, Nottingham, South Wales, Cleveland, Lincolnshire and Strathclyde. In the light of the results of the pilot schemes consideration will be given to the extension of the funding arrangements nationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">The Government do not have any intention at present to introduce regulations to limit the generation of toxic smoke from ignited construction products. A review of Approved Document B (fire safety) has just been completed, and the 2000 edition of this document will be published in January. This document makes reference to a number of parts of BS 476 (fire tests on building materials and structures) that are considered to give acceptable methods of tests. The key parameters usually considered in these fire tests are the heat release rate and flame spread but not smoke production. These in themselves will also have an effect on smoke production.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/2">Although there are no proposals at present to introduce smoke production tests as part of the performance standard for regulatory purposes, the use of a fire engineering approach is recognised in Approved Document B and the fact that products have a low smoke emissivity could be used as part of the justification for a particular engineering solution. Further revisions to Approved Document B will be necessary to take account of future harmonised European standards and smoke production will be one of the many issues that will be looked at.</p>

Phenols were voluntarily withdrawn by manufacturers from sheep dip products following a review by the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) in 1992. The reasons for the withdrawal of phenols are a matter for the companies concerned. It is likely that they were withdrawn because there was considered to be insufficient return from the market to justify the research needed to satisfy the further requests for data made by the VPC.
