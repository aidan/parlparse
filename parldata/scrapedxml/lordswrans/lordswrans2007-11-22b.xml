	<p pid="b.88.0/4">The decision to use a special grant reflects both the views of local government and the challenges of deriving a formula distribution that matches the probable cost impact of the new concession. Existing funding will continue to be distributed through formula grant and we anticipate transferring this additional funding in the formula grant process at the beginning of the next three-year settlement period (2011-12). There was no significant support among local government to extract the existing funding for statutory concessions from the formula grant system.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.3/1">Financial Accounting Standards 157 on &quot;Fair Value Measurements&quot; is a US standard on how to measure fair value, and sets various disclosure requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/2">Level 3 assets or liabilities are those which are valued using unobservable inputs. This is distinct from assets or liabilities which are valued using prices from an active market (Level 1) or on the basis of inputs that are directly or indirectly largely observable from markets (Level 2). The disclosure requirements are greatest for Level 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/3">Financial Accounting Standards 157 does not apply to UK banks as they report under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which does not require such precise disclosures. However, it will affect UK banks which are SEC registrants and required to produce reconciliations to US GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/4">The difference in disclosures will narrow in the future due to the implementation of a new international financial reporting standard on &quot;Financial Instruments: Disclosures&quot; which becomes mandatory for reporting from the 2007 annual accounts.</p>

In London, civil traffic enforcement is governed by local Acts of Parliament but London Councils has issued similar guidance.</p>
