These data are not available on the Ministry of Justice extract of the police national computer, which is the source of reoffending data. Similarly applications to family courts on child contact do not require the disclosure of a criminal record so there is no way to extract or cross-reference this information. We do know that family court orders for child contact and residence are often breached but this is not a criminal offence and only extreme cases would be dealt with by way of committal to prison for contempt of court. The court has other measures such as a new order or transferring residence of the child from a parent who continually ignores court orders to someone more responsible.</p>

The model drew heavily on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance in the relevant areas and went out to consultation in July 2008. The full impact assessment was published in November 2008. The evidence shows that a significant amount of vascular morbidity and mortality is preventable. The modelling work estimates that this programme can prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokes, save at least 650 lives a year, and prevent over 4,000 people a year from developing diabetes.</p>
