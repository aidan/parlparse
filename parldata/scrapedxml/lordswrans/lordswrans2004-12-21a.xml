	<p pid="a.138.2/1">Insecurity in Darfur continues to hinder access for delivery of humanitarian assistance. In the last four weeks the recent attacks such as those on Tawilah town on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-22">22 November</phrase> in north Darfur, and the killing on a road north of Nyala on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-12">12 December</phrase> of two Save the Children (UK) staff in south Darfur, have prompted withdrawals of some international staff from certain areas. This impacts severely on numbers of people in need who can be reached. In the month of November, the World Food Programme delivered food to 1.3 million people in Darfur, which was an increase on the 1.16 million people reached in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/2">It is very difficult to establish a figure of the number of fatalities in Darfur. The UK supports the World Health Organisation to monitor the health and nutritional status of the affected population in Darfur, including morbidity and mortality surveys. The most recent survey was carried out in September. It suggested that between 6,000 and 10,000 people are dying each month in Darfur. This assessment will be updated shortly. The UK deplores on-going attacks by both rebels and Arab militia, such as the recent attack on Adwa on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December</phrase> resulting in 150 killed. To date the UN estimates that there are 1.6 million internally displaced in Darfur, with a further 200,000 displaced as refugees in Chad.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">Both the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the EU signed the Cotonou agreement, which lays the foundations for the negotiation of economic partnership agreements (EPAs). These foundations include the progressive removal of barriers to trade between the parties; making EPAs reciprocal trade agreements. Reciprocity is also required under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules for regional trading agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/2">However, EPAs will not be traditional regional trade agreements. Although they are reciprocal, the WTO rules governing regional trading agreements allow flexibility for developing countries. Compared to the EU, the ACP countries will have less stringent market opening commitments, and a longer period of time in which to implement them. This will allow the ACP economies time fully to prepare for the impact of trade liberalisation on their economies. Additional instruments in EPAs, such as safeguard mechanisms, will help protect ACP countries from any potential adverse effects of trade liberalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/3">The European Commission has also stated that it has no offensive interests in the EPA negotiations. The 2004 government White Paper on trade and investment makes a commitment to hold our EU partners to this: to ensure that the developmental needs of the ACP are at the forefront of the EPA negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.3/1">Economic partnership agreements (EPAs) are intended to support African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries' integration into the global economy in a more sustainable way than by continuing dependence on eroding trade preferences. The need to change the existing EU-ACP trading relationship arose because the existing non-reciprocal Lom&eacute; preferences failed to boost standards of living in the ACP countries. These preferences also do not conform to global trading rules, as established by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which threatened their future viability.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/2">Under the the EU's generalised system of preferences (GSP), the least developed countries (LDC) in the ACP group have access to the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, which grants them duty-and quota-free access to the EU market. This option will remain open to LDCs. However, most ACP-LDCs continue to use Cotonou preferences rather than EBA.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/3">EPAs are intended to go beyond traditional regional trade agreements to be genuine tools for trade and development. This means that assistance in areas such as building supply-side capacity and facilitating trade will be a core element of EPAs, and vital to their success. During the transition period between Cotonou preferences and an EPA, all ACP countries will receive assistance to help their economies adjust to and take advantage of a more liberal trade agreement with the EU. This assistance will come in the form of development aid and technical assistance, from the EU budget and from individual member states. Efforts will be made to ensure this assistance is co-ordinated and consistent with the national development priorities of the recipient countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.2/1">The UK oils strategy was launched in September 2002 to address the misuse of duty-privileged fuels such as red diesel and kerosene in the road fuel sector. Narrowing the differential between the duty rate for road fuel and that for red diesel reduces the incentive for misuse and eats into the profits that can be made by the organised criminal gangs behind the large-scale supply of the illicit market.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.2/2">Of more concern is the security of rebated fuel storage at these operators' sites. With red diesel and kerosene now being harder for fraudsters to source, due to the Registered Dealers in Controlled Oils (RDCO) scheme, they are increasingly turning to theft of product. Through discussions with traders we are trying to increase their awareness of this risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.2/1">Paragraph 6.13 of the February 2003 Energy White Paper <i>Our energy future&mdash;creating a low carbon economy </i>(Cm 5761) noted that it is &quot;likely that the UK will become a net importer of gas on an annual basis by around 2006 and of oil by around 2010&quot;. While projections of both supply and demand are inherently uncertain, on the basis of the latest information available to the Department of Trade and Industry it now seems most likely that the United Kingdom will become a net importer of oil on an annual basis in 2009.</p>

It will include an analysis of how many people receive aftercare and what the average length of time for which patients discharged from compulsory in-patient treatment receive free aftercare. The analysis will also look at the likely cost of aftercare under the draft Bill after the period of free &quot;intermediate care&quot; and the effect of means testing, so that accurate comparisons can be made between the costs under the 1983 Act and those under the draft Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.6/1">The National Parking Adjudication Service (NPAS) provides free and informal independent adjudication in relation to decisions by local authorities outside London to impose penalty charges for parking contraventions. If a local authority rejects representations against the imposition of a penalty charge then they are required to inform the recipient of their right to appeal to an independent adjudicator. Whether they choose to do so is a matter for the recipient of the penalty charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/2">Some 8,537 appeals were made to NPAS in the financial year 2002&ndash;03 as a result of the issue of 2,156,813 penalty charge notices, an appeal rate of 0.40 per cent. Some 9,205 appeals were made in calendar year 2003 as a result of the issue of 2,447,971 penalty charge notices, an appeal rate of 0.38 per cent. The chief adjudicator in her foreword to the 2003 report suggests that the lower than expected number of appeals may well be due to some councils having become more familiar with the decriminalised parking enforcement (DPE) scheme. For example, Manchester generated 1,162 appeals in 2002&ndash;03 but only 806 in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.6/3">It is also relevant that the 20 new councils joined the DPE scheme at various points in 2003, half of them from <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-01">1 September</phrase> onwards. While those joining the scheme in the second half of the year will have issued penalty charges any resultant appeals will have taken time to work through the system and some will not have arrived with NPAS until early 2004. In this respect it should be noted that comparing financial year 2002&ndash;03 (April 2002 to March 2003) with calendar year 2003 is not an exact like for like comparison.</p>
