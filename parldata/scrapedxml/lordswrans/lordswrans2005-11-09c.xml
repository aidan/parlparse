	<p pid="c.76.0/1">The estimates and contingencies referred to in the Question relate to a possible flu pandemic among humans, not avian flu, which is a disease which primarily affects birds.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.0/2">The estimate of &quot;at least 50,000&quot; deaths arising from a possible human flu pandemic is based on the case fatality for seasonal flu and experience from the 1957 pandemic. A pandemic strain could be more severe but the severity of the disease is expected to be reduced by treatment with antivirals. This is why we have purchased 14.6 million antivirals to treat the 25 per cent of the population that may become ill in a pandemic. The estimate is thus independent of the timing of the onset of a flu pandemic.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.0/3">In September 2005, we published a framework for the storage and distribution of the antiviral stockpile. This framework takes into account that we may need to prioritise antivirals if a pandemic emerges before our stockpile is complete in September 2006. The World Health Organisation has identified the United Kingdom as one of the best prepared countries in the world.</p>

	<p pid="c.76.3/1">Avian influenza rarely affects humans and hence it is unlikely to cause significant numbers of human fatalities even if there was an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry in the United Kingdom. If an influenza strain emerges which readily infects humans and is easily transmitted, this could cause a pandemic. As outlined in the UK Influenza Pandemic Contingency Plan, we estimate that there could be a possible 2,800 excess deaths or more in Wales due to a human influenza pandemic. We are working closely with officials in the Welsh Assembly Government to co-ordinate planning for an influenza pandemic.</p>

	<p pid="c.79.2/1">The Croatian visa regime was introduced in 1999 to stem the rising number of asylum applications in the UK being received from Croatian nationals: there were 150 applications for asylum from nationals of Croatia in 1997, 335 in 1998 and 1,780 in 1999. It has clearly been effective in its objective as the number of asylum seekers from Croatia has fallen significantly: there were 115 applications for asylum from Croatian nationals in 2000, 35 in 2001, 35 in 2002, 15 in 2003, five in 2004 and one or two applications in the first half of 2005. All visa regimes are kept under review and introduced, or lifted, on the basis of immigration need. When considering removing an existing visa requirement we must ensure that any favourable change to the immigration threat from the nationality concerned is sustainable. I refer the noble Lord to the Answer I provided on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, <i>WA 153</i>) in which I made clear that the visa regime on Croatian nationals is the subject of ongoing review and we will lift the visa regime at the earliest possible time.</p>

The Government believe that the lack of a free and fair election constitutes an important element in the case for sanctions and that election monitors play a crucial role in providing information on how elections are conducted. Other elements which the Government take into account when considering sanctions include broader failures on the part of the target state and individuals to address good governance, human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</p>

Around 40,000 patients responded to this question.</p>

The scheme has recently been formally evaluated and overall findings were positive on the model and quality of support provided. A copy of the summary findings from the evaluation can be obtained from <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/whatsnew1.html">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/whatsnew1.html</a>. The full evaluation report is currently being considered and decisions about the future scope and nature of support will be made in light of its findings. It is recognised that child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and protection under the Children Act. Local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need by providing a range and level of service appropriate to each child's needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.88.5/1">There are 83 quarantine facilities that deal with such imports.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.5/2">The State Veterinary Service is responsible for inspecting such premises on behalf of Defra. The State Veterinary Service directly employs over 500 veterinary and animal health inspectors. In addition, a substantial number of vets in private practice are also appointed as inspectors to carry out this work on behalf of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.5/3">Quarantine premises are inspected prior to approval, on arrival of new quarantine consignments, during quarantine periods and prior to release of consignments. In addition, visits will also be made when unexpected illnesses or deaths occur. Ad hoc visits to quarantine premises are also made by government veterinary staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.88.7/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="c.88.7/2" qnum="HL1927">What advice they received that led them to oppose the initiative by the Belgian Environment Minister, Bruno Tobback, to halt imports of wild birds in March 2005; and whether the United Kingdom was the sole member state to oppose this initiative.</p>

	<p pid="c.88.8/1">A ban on imports of wild birds was raised by Belgium at the Environment Council meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-10">10 March 2005</phrase>. The only other EU member to support Belgium was Hungary. The European Commission did not support a ban at that time as it could not be justified on animal health, welfare or conservation grounds. The UK, along with other member states, agreed with the European Commission assessment at that time.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.8/2">Since then both the UK and the European Commission have been monitoring changes to the global disease situation and we now agree with the European Commission that a temporary ban is appropriate.</p>
