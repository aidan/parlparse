The Government will take account of the results of the consultation exercise in making final policy decisions later in 2008.

Temporarily to restrain wild birds for the purpose of scientific study is, therefore, likely to render them &quot;protected animals&quot; under the legislation.

	<p pid="a.27.5/1">The Civil Service Compensation Scheme is a statutory scheme made under the Superannuation Act 1972. This sets out the compensation terms to be provided to civil servants on termination of contract. There are two main categories of compensation; namely, &quot;flexible&quot; and &quot;compulsory&quot; terms. For staff aged under 50 (or with short service), the compensation comprises a cash lump sum calculated by reference to age and length of service; the &quot;compulsory&quot; terms are more generous than the &quot;flexible&quot; terms. For staff aged between 50 and 60, pension benefits are paid early and service is enhanced by a maximum of six and two-thirds years. In addition, those departing under the &quot;compulsory&quot; terms receive a cash lump sum of up to six months' pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/2">The Civil Service Management Code sets out the circumstances in which the different categories of compensation should be used.

	<p pid="a.31.2/1">The case for FiReControl was made in an independent review of the FRS control rooms conducted by Mott Macdonald in 2000 and was subsequently revisited following the tragic events of 9/11 in 2001. Recent events have strongly reinforced the need to move to an integrated, resilient network of regional control centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/2">The FiReControl project will enhance the capability of the fire and rescue service (FRS) in England to deal with major emergencies such as natural disasters, industrial accidents and terrorism.

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">We will review approaches to urban drainage as part of the upcoming government water strategy, Future Water, due to be published in early 2008. This will take into account recommendations from the independent review of the summer flooding being undertaken by Sir Michael Pitt.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2">To support this work, the Government, along with UK Water Industry Research (UKWIR), are spending &pound;2 million on 15 integrated urban drainage pilot studies around the country to test new approaches to reduce the risk of urban drainage flooding. The pilots are intended to clarify responsibilities for urban drainage management and are due to complete in spring 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/3">For 2005-10, Ofwat has allowed water and sewerage companies a programme of nearly &pound;1 billion to safeguard homes against the risk of sewer flooding. This would resolve or mitigate every known high-risk problem of internal flooding from overloaded sewers where companies' plans confirmed action was needed by 2010. The Government have announced their intention to improve management of the overall sewerage system by transferring private sewers and drains draining to the public system into the ownership of water and sewerage companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/4">Gullies are provided to drain water from roads and their maintenance is the responsibility of the relevant highway authority. The term spillway is most commonly used in the design and operation of reservoirs where it is important to have sufficient overspill capacity to maintain the safety of the dam structure. In the context of urban drainage, it is important that the design of the urban fabric allows safe routes for the outflow of excess surface water. Planning guidance encourages this though it can be difficult to achieve in established developed areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.3/2">The UK is also supporting the development of broad social protection interventions that will include children affected by AIDS in seven African countries and funding international and local NGOs to provide services directly to vulnerable children including food, shelter and psycho-social support. DfID's funding through public partnership agreements also supports organisations to respond to the needs of children affected by AIDS. These organisations include PLAN UK, World Vision and Save the Children.</p>

DfID helps to tackle HIV-related mother and child mortality and to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV through our support to health system strengthening.

	<p pid="a.39.3/1">Infant diagnostics for HIV continue to be a challenge in resource-limited settings. The most common way to test for HIV is to identify antibodies to the virus but antibody tests are not reliable in very young children. In response to this a new approach to HIV diagnosis in infants has been introduced in some African countries since late 2006. This involves testing &quot;dry blood spots&quot;' collected in a way that does not need specialist equipment at the point of care. This technology offers a vital opportunity for timely access to lifesaving treatment and care services for children who are infected with HIV. However, these services are just getting started in many countries and therefore relatively few infants have been able to receive such tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/2">The UK announced support of &euro;20 million for UNITAID in September 2006, as part of a 20-year commitment, increasing to &euro;60 million per year by 2010 subject to performance. This month, UNITAID together with UNICEF launched a joint initiative that will include support to early paediatric diagnosis to improve early access to paediatric HIV treatment for young HIV-infected infants.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.8/1">Defra has funding and policy responsibilities but does not carry out works to reduce flood risk. The operating authorities (principally the Environment Agency) undertake prioritised programmes of maintenance work on watercourses, including cleaning and dredging where appropriate. Otherwise responsibility for clearance lies with the land owner.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.8/2">Reducing maintenance on low-risk watercourses releases resources for the Environment Agency to use on high-risk watercourses in accordance with its risk-based approach to asset management.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.8/3">The effect on low-risk watercourses will probably be increased weed growth and siltation which will reach a natural balance. This may result in an increase in flood risk along these watercourses, which is accepted as it is classified as low risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.8/4">While it is important that all channels for flood water are kept free of debris and at their design profile, there is often a limit to the amount of dredging that can sensibly take place. Main rivers and other larger or more natural watercourses should not need dredging and normally establish stable regimes. On some rivers, too much dredging could cause the river banks or walls to collapse; likewise deepening a tidal river below its natural bed level will not normally reduce flood risks. Dredging can also cause significant disruption to the natural river environment.</p>
