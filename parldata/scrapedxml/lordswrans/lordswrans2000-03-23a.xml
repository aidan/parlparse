	<p pid="a.39.0/1">The granting of patents by the European Patent Office (EPO) is carried out under the direction of its president who is responsible for its activities and is accountable to the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation. Member states of the organisation, including the United Kingdom, are not consulted before the office decides to grant patents. The EPO has issued a press statement which makes clear that a mistake was made in issuing patent No. EP0695351 and that the scope of protection of this patent does not extend to human cloning. The office regrets that the error has occurred and states that it will take every care to prevent such errors recurring in the future. The president reported his office's error to the administrative council, on which the United Kingdom is represented. The council expressed its strong concern that the error had occurred and requested the office to ensure that measures would be taken to avoid repetition of such errors. We understand that the patent has been challenged by Greenpeace Deutschland, which initiated opposition proceedings on <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-24">24 February</phrase>.</p>

However, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), a blood component for transfusion, is sourced from UK donated blood in the same way as red cells and platelets. Like red cells, FFP is not pooled before use, although samples from up to 10 donor units of FFP are pooled to enable nucleic acid amplification testing for the earlier detection of hepatitis C infection.</p>

The weight limit and other payment terms are set by the European Commission; it is not within the Government's gift to amend them unilaterally. The Government consider that payments under the scheme are fair to taxpayers and producers and have no plans to seek the agreement of the Commission to any change in payment terms.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.6/1">We expect the forests managed by the Forestry Commission to provide a rate of return of 6 per cent overall. This is an economic measure which includes not only the operating surplus from commercial activities but also the many non-market benefits provided by the forests. These include public recreation, increasing biodiversity and other environmental benefits. The value of these non-market benefits is such that, to date, we have not needed to vary the target rate of return. On the other hand, the expected annual cash surplus is revised regularly to take account of changing circumstances.</p>
