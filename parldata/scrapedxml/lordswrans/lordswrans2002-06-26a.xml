	<p pid="a.141.2/1">Since 1998, the Government have brought in Section 85(1) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 which requires that, &quot;In exercising or performing any functions in relation to, or so as to affect, land in an area of outstanding natural beauty, a relevant authority shall have regard to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the area of outstanding natural beauty&quot;. Relevant authorities are listed at Section 85(2) of the Act and include any public body.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/2">Incentives for woodland management are provided for the Government by the Forestry Commission which provides incentives for woodland creation and management through its Woodland Grant Scheme on a national basis, not just in designated areas. A challenge fund provides further incentives to create new native woodlands in national parks (nearly 1,300 hectares were approved over the past 5 years). In addition, the commission has signed an accord with the association of AONBs setting out how it will maximise uptake of existing woodland incentives whilst ensuring woodlands contribute to AONB objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/3">Through the Heritage Lottery Fund's strategic plan 1999&ndash;2002, the Government support landscapes of outstanding importance to national heritage through acquisitions, management and access projects. One of the three priorities for land was targeted on AONB applicants. Such awards were known as area partnership schemes and by April 2002 about &pound;7 million had been committed to AONBs. This initiative will continue under the strategic plan 2002&ndash;07 but will be known as landscape partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/4">The disused military airfied at RAF Bentwater is no longer in Crown (MOD) ownership. It was sold in the mid-1990s to a development company. The land has since been divided and sold separately. It is being used as an industrial estate, redeveloped for housing or restored to agriculture (including informal recreation). All of these uses are within the agreed planning brief for the site.</p>

Local authorities in every region of England (apart from London which is being handled separately) will receive a total of &pound;42 million in 2002&ndash;03 from the fund to kick start new projects. The money will go to schemes that improve recycling, complement municipal waste management strategies and contribute to a better quality of life for residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/2">From over 190 applications to the fund for 2002&ndash;03, 12 schemes were approved by DEFRA with the assistance of an expert panel. Details of the successful schemes will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses shortly when the local authorities have been informed. We are now inviting applications for grants from the fund for 2003&ndash;04 when &pound;76.3 million will be available; almost double the amount for 2002/03.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/3">The national fund prioritises five key areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/4" class="indent">improving partnership initiatives between authorities;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/5" class="indent">contributing to high performance, innovation and best practice;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/6" class="indent">establishing a challenge fund for general projects;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/7" class="indent">developing community initiatives;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/8" class="indent">turning around low recycling performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/9">Overall, England recycled just 10 per cent of its household rubbish in 1999&ndash;2000, one of the lowest rates in Europe, and we are taking action to improve this. We have set a target of 25 per cent recycling by 2005&ndash;06 and have allocated &pound;19.9 million from the fund for helping turn around low performance and &pound;12.5 million for partnership working. The assistance given by this fund will help some of the lowest performers in their efforts to reach a minimum recycling rate of 10 per cent in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/10">Neighbourhood renewal is also a key area of government policy and over half of the 88 NRU local authorities in England are low recycling performers. 21 NRU local authorities were approved for direct grant in 2002&ndash;03, amounting to a total of some &pound;14 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.5/11">We will be publishing revised guidance for the submission of bids to the fund for 2003&ndash;04 very shortly on DEFRA's website.</p>

	Sheep National Envelope: England

	<p pid="a.143.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/2" qnum="HL4925">Whether they have reached a decision on the implementation of the sheep national envelope in England.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-06-26a.143.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="143"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020626/text/20626w03.htm#20626w03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.143.2/1">Under the revised EU sheepmeat regime national envelopes were introduced to provide member states with an element of flexibility in how they support their sheep sectors; funds under the envelope can be used to provide extra support to producers, improve the marketing and production of sheepmeat and encourage more environmentally friendly farming practices. National envelopes can be implemented on a regional basis; this is being done in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/2">In England, the national envelope is worth &pound;5.4 million in 2002. There is also a provision in the revised regime permitting member states, or parts of member states, to increase the size of the national envelope by reducing the basic rate of sheep annual premium by up to one euro. This could increase the size of the envelope in England by around &pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">The Government issued a consultation letter in January seeking views on how the national envelope should be used in England. We have now considered the responses we received, and have reached decisions on the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/4">The Governemnt intend to make maximum use of the flexibility we negotiated at the Agriculture Council to switch support from subsidies per breeding ewe to support for restructuring and modernising the industry in line with the strategy set out in the Curry commission report. This means that, after a transitional year this year, we will by 2003 use the maximum available under the scheme to reduce sheep numbers in historically overgrazed areas by encouraging extensification in the uplands and to improve the quality and marketing of sheep.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/5">For the transitional year of 2002, we intend to introduce a scheme to reduce sheep numbers in areas subject to historic overgrazing. Under the scheme the Government will purchase sheep quota from producers, who in return will be required to undertake to maintain lower stocking levels on the land in question. The scheme will operate by tender; in deciding which offers should be accepted we will take into account both price and other relevant factors such as the extent of historic overgrazing. This scheme will be open for applications in the autumn, and we hope that offers will be dealt with before the close of the next quota-trading period.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/6">&pound;2 million will be allocated to the quota purchase scheme in 2002. The remains of the 2002 national envelope will be paid to producers as a top-up to sheep annual premium payments; this will be worth some 46 pence per eligible animal.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/7">For 2003, and in subsequent years, we intend to make full use of the opportunity in the new regulation to increase the size of the national envelope by reducing the rate of the sheep annual premium. This will enable us to fund a range of schemes from the national envelope.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/8">The quota purchase scheme will be retained in 2003 and beyond; the level of resources allocated to the scheme will be decided in the light of our experience this year, but we expect it to be at least &pound;1 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/9">We are minded to introduce two further schemes in 2003: an upland extensification scheme and an industry development scheme:</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/10" class="indent">the upland extensification scheme will be linked to hill farming allowances, and will pay additional sums, on a per hectare basis, to producers in less favoured areas who stock sheep below certain stocking levels. There are likely to be different stocking criteria and payment rates for different categories of land;</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/11" class="indent">the industry development scheme will seek to encourage producers to participate in existing initiatives intended to improve the marketing and quality of sheepmeat. The details of the scheme still need to be developed, but the intention is to pay producers, via an uplift in their sheep annual premium payments, who participate in eligible schemes. These might include recognised assurance schemes; sire referencing and genetic improvement schemes; schemes linked to the National Scrapie Plan; recognised local-marketing initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/12">We will be consulting interested parties further on the details of these two schemes. We will also be considering, in the light of further views we receive, whether any further schemes should be introduced in 2003 or thereafter. Schemes will be operated by the RPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/13">The Goverment believe that these schemes will make a major contribution towards addressing the problem of historic overgrazing in the uplands and improving the responsiveness of the sheep industry to the market. We recognise, however, that schemes funded from the national envelope can form only one element of the co-ordinated programme of measures needed to restore habitats damaged by historic overgrazing. We will be looking to English Nature to take appropriate action under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, encouraging producers to make use of agri-environment schemes and considering what steps we can take, including use of the cross compliance rules where appropriate, to reduce stocking pressure on land in unfavourable environmental conditions.</p>

	Pension Funds: Stock Market Values

	<p pid="a.146.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.146.1/2" qnum="HL4626">Further to the answer by the Baroness Hollis of Heigham on 27 May (HL Deb, col. 1040), whether they will place in the Library of the House the analysis which supports the view that &quot;what has happened on the stock market . . . has wiped one third or so off the value of pension funds&quot;; and how that estimate compares with that made by the major fims specialising in pension performance measures.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-06-26a.146.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100298" speakername="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" colon=":" colnum="146"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020626/text/20626w03.htm#20626w03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.146.2/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-20">20 June</phrase> this year, the stock market had fallen in value by almost exactly one third to 4,639 points from its peak at 6,950 points in December 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/2">The overall effect of this fall on the value of pension funds is dependent on individual pension fund asset distribution, determined by individual scheme investment strategy. However, since a substantial proportion of all pension funds are invested in equities, it follows that the reduction in their value is likely to be of the same general order as the overall reduction in stock market values.</p>
