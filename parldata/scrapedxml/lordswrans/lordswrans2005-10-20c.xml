	<p pid="c.139.6/4">The noble Lord may recall that the Government announced in June that the autumn and winter was the time to see whether we can improve the wider process for better dialogue and greater understanding.

	<p pid="c.140.14/1">In the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) the term &quot;reduction&quot; refers to the method used to bring Treaty Limited Equipment below agreed ceilings. Disposal of redundant weapons is the permanent removal from service of Treaty Limited Equipment that is already below treaty ceilings. All former Soviet Union countries that are CFE signatories are below their ceilings. The disposal of surplus equipment within the ceilings stipulated in the CFE Treaty is a national responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="c.142.0/1">There are a variety of socio-economic models in the EU. These reflect the differing institutional structures and cultural preferences in the member states. The Rhineland model represents one such approach, tailored to the characteristics of the German economy, which in the past has played a part in delivering a strong export-driven economy. In the UK, the Government's approach has delivered a strong economy, low unemployment, and high employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.142.0/2">However, in the context of globalisation and large-scale unemployment in Europe, all socio-economic models face new challenges. The recent pamphlet <i>Global Europe: full-employment Europe</i>, published by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, sets out the challenges facing European economies, and the actions they must take if they are to be successful in the global economy.
