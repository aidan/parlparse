	<p pid="a.108.2/1">The civil penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which were introduced on 3rd April 2000, provide that a relevant vehicle may be detained following the giving of a notice of liability to civil penalty.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/2">The power to detain a vehicle may be exercised only if in the opinion of the senior officer concerned there is a significant risk that the penalty (or one or more of the penalties) will not be paid before the end of the prescribed period if the transporter is not detained. The Carriers' Liability (Clandestine Entrants and Sale of Transporters) Regulations 2000 prescribe the period in which payment must be made as being 60 days from the date of the giving of the notice of liability to civil penalty.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/3">In determining whether or not it is appropriate to detain a vehicle, the senior officer will consider all factors that may indicate a significant risk that the penalty will not be paid within the prescribed period. These will include the amount of the penalty imposed, the financial standing of the company or individual involved, their willingness to pay and any history of late or non-payment of previous penalties they may have incurred. The senior officer will also take account of any alternative security that may be put forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.5/2">It would not be right for me to comment on an individual case which may be the subject of ongoing civil penalty proceedings. In general, however, in forming an opinion the senior officer will take into account all factors that may indicate a significant risk that the penalty will not be paid within the time prescribed. These factors will include the amount of the penalty imposed, the financial standing of the company or individual involved, their willingness to pay and any history of late or non-payment of previous penalties. The fact that a company may not have previously incurred a penalty is not an indication in itself that a penalty imposed will be paid within the prescribed time.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/5">(2) enfranchisement will be refused where property stands on land which is held inalienably;</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/7" class="indent">(i) where there are particular security considerations (on the advice of the Royal and Diplomatic Protection Group of the Metropolitan Police or other security agencies)</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/11">(5) where enfranchisement is refused on the grounds set out in paragraphs (2) and (3) but the tenant would otherwise qualify for enfranchisement, lease extension or the grant of a new lease by analogy with the statutes, the Crown will be prepared to negotiate new leases.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/12">(6) the Crown will follow the valuation bases set out in the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/13">(7) the Crown will agree to be bound by arbitration where there is dispute over valuation or other terms, except in cases under paragraphs (2) and (3). The Leasehold Valuation Tribunal will be empowered to act as the arbitration body, and will hear such disputes on voluntary reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/14">(8) the Crown will be entitled to apply to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal for approval of a scheme of estate management in the same way as other landlords.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.6/1">We have published draft orders under the Health Act 1999 containing provisions to set up a new Nursing and Midwifery Council and a new Health Professions Council. These will replace the existing United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting, the four national boards and the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. The orders will be published for three months before debate in Parliament. A period of consultation will last until <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-01">1 June 2001</phrase>. Copies of both draft orders have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.6/2">Appointments to the shadow Nursing and Midwifery Council and Health Professions Council are under way. These appointments should be made in early April for the shadow councils to start work as soon as possible afterwards. The shadow councils will have the status of advisory groups until the new councils are statutorily established in April 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2" qnum="HL1524">Whether the present level of litter on the A12 trunk road between the M11 and the A14 is acceptable and to what firm the Highways Agency has given the contract for collection of litter from this stretch of road.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-04-03a.114.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="114"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010403/text/10403w03.htm#10403w03_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.114.3/1">No amount of litter is acceptable on any road, but the problem is exacerbated by disposal of rubbish by the general public.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/2">However, the responsibility of litter collection on the A12 trunk road lies solely with the respective district council through which the road passes. This was defined in law under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and standards of cleanliness that should be maintained are set out in a code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/3">The relevant district councils are: Brentwood District Council (Essex), Chelmsford District Council (Essex), Malden District Council (Essex), Braintree District Council (Essex), Colchester District Council (Essex) and Babergh District Council (Suffolk).</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/4">While the Highways Agency has no direct responsibility for litter collection, it has taken a proactive role in ensuring that it is carried out. The agency has aimed to achieve this by allowing the district councils access when traffic management is in place for other reasons, such as when roadworks are carried out, so that they can work safely and minimise their costs. Additionally, the agency has been meeting with the relevant district councils to discuss how they fulfil their duty, which is to keep the area clean.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/5">As a result of their discussions, the Highways Agency offered the district councils the opportunity to work with our maintaining agents while scavenging patrols were carried out. Scavenging patrols are carried out to remove any items which are causing a safety hazard or are arguably not typical litter, i.e. lorry tyres, fridges, gas bottles etc. Since such patrols in themselves require traffic management to ensure the safety of the workforce and the travelling public, the district councils were offered the opportunity to work within the traffic management to remove the litter which it is their duty to remove.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/6">In addition, through the discussions with the district councils, the Highways Agency has been able to obtain assurances from them that they would work together to maximise the amount of work that can be done during their litter patrols.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.3/7">The district councils have now proposed a programme for carrying out their works, and the Highways Agency will discuss this with them to make sure that the greatest use is made of everyone's resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">As my right honourable friend will be aware, it is the Government's policy that broadcasters are independent of government and, therefore, we do not seek to intervene in detailed matters of programming content. This is a matter for the BBC Board of Governors, who must ensure that the obligations set out in the Royal Charter and agreement are met. BBC Northern Ireland remains committed to ensuring that its output on radio, television and online services provides a variety of cultural activity which reflects the diversity and vibrancy of all traditions in the community.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.3/1">We understand that the Kirch Group intends to hold an open auction for the live rights but it intends to comply with the UK listed event legislation. Through correspondence and a meeting of officials, we have made the Kirch Group fully aware of the extent of this legislation: that the whole of the World Cup Finals tournament (all 64 matches) is a listed event and that any broadcaster purchasing live rights from Kirch would have to comply with the provisions of the 1996 Broadcasting Act. We expect that the Independent Television Commission, the regulator responsible for ensuring compliance with the legislation, will take all proper steps to ensure that the law works in the way that it is intended, so that UK viewers have the opportunity of seeing the whole of the finals tournament on &quot;free to air&quot; television.</p>
