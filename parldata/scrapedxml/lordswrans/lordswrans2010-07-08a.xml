	<p pid="a.68.2/1">A referendum involves differing cost elements from other polls. Figures for conduct elements of the referendum will need to be estimated based on our existing model used for the 2009 European and 2010 general elections. However, we would expect the costs for a referendum to differ from those of an election in a number of ways. For example, we would expect ballot papers for a referendum to be shorter than at an election, and therefore be cheaper to print. Turnout figures may also differ, affecting the amount of time it takes to count ballot papers and the fee paid to counting staff: turnout figures for a national referendum are difficult to estimate. As indicated in the Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June</phrase> (<I>WA</I><I>166</I>), we would expect that combining the referendum with other elections would allow certain fixed costs to be reduced; for example, by using the same polling stations.

	<p pid="a.70.0/1">At the request of the South African Government and in accordance with a binational memorandum of understanding (MoU), the Home Secretary deployed a policing delegation of 12 persons to support and advise the host authorities in policing England football fans in venue cities and to undertake a range of intelligence, uniformed liaison and media liaison duties. The size of the delegation was greatly reduced from that sent to previous tournaments in the light of the lower level of (public order) risk and the projected profile and behaviour of the visiting England support.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/2">In accordance with the MoU, the South African authorities met the police delegation's accommodation, internal travel and meals costs. Costs falling on the UK Government, covering flights to and from South Africa, subsistence payments and ad hoc additional costs, amount to &#163;59,236.89 to date. Pay costs of the officers concerned are borne by their host police authority, though claims for any overtime incurred whilst in South Africa will be submitted to the Home Office for consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.5/1">Where any provider ceases to have a legal aid contract for whatever reason, the LSC will make an assessment of any potential financial issues in the individual circumstances. This will include payments on account made, claims to be billed and whether, for example, the provider will be continuing to conclude cases for existing clients.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.5/2">The LSC is working closely with the administrators and others to ensure that urgent arrangements are made so that clients continue to receive a good quality service and that cases are transferred to other providers where necessary. The LSC has agreed payment of &#163;280,000 for the work to transfer RMJ clients' files. The LSC is also working with the administrators to confirm the correct payments to be made to RMJ. This assessment will take several weeks to be concluded. In the mean time, they have agreed an advance payment of &#163;70,000 against any payment for work in progress, plus a contingency of &#163;20,000 for this work.</p>
