	<p pid="a.264.0/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr Malcolm McKibbin) has written to the noble Lord.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question about how many roadside trees were planted in Belfast in the 10 years up to the end of 2003; how many have survived to date; and whether they plan to strengthen sapling protection procedures. I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my, responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/4">I can advise that the number of trees planted in the public footways in the Belfast area for the 10 years up to the end of 2003 was approximately 2,500. The annual survival rate is 95 per cent. with the 5 per cent. failure rate attributable to instances of disease, road traffic accidents and vandalism. We replace these trees as soon as is practicable and attempt to recover the full replacement costs, where possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/5">I should also explain that the trees planted in the public footways are termed &quot;Extra Heavy Standards&quot;. These trees are about 10 years old, and when planted are protected with a galvanised tree guard. There are currently no plans to enhance this level of protection. Where external funding is available, (for example Environmental Improvement Schemes funded by the Department for Social Development), semi-mature trees are planted. However, you will appreciate that the additional costs for these semi-mature trees could not be funded from our annual street planting programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/6">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

Under the provisions of Section 11A of Local Government Finance Act 1992, inserted by Section 75 of the Local Government Act 2003, local billing authorities have, since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, had powers to set the council tax discount for second homes at any level between 50 per cent. and 10 per cent.

This work includes examining the possibilities for a dedicated financial instrument for aspects of counter-proliferation such as nuclear safety under the Euratom Treaty.

	<p pid="a.280.2/1">We can confirm that the cost of establishing the, Gangmasters Licensing Authority and the cost of enforcing the offences introduced by the Gangmasters Licensing Act 2004 will be met by Defra. These costs will not affect the fees charged by the authority for the issue of licences.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/2">The authority was established on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and is currently working to set up the new licensing arrangements. It is hoped that the authority will. compete this work by the end of the current financial year. It is estimated that the cost of setting up the authority during 2005&ndash;06 will be some &pound;2.3 million. The authority expects to commence issuing licences early in the 2006&ndash;07 financial year. On the assumption that 1,000 licence applications are received in the first year, the authority expects to incur staff costs of some &pound;1.4 million and other costs of some &pound;1.0 million during 2006&ndash;07. If the authority meets its anticipated commencement date for issuing licences, few if any of the costs incurred during 2006&ndash;07 will be classified as setup costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/3">As required under the Gangmasters Licensing Act the authority will consult the Secretary of State before finalising licence fees. While the Secretary of State would ideally wish to see the authority recover its operating cost through licence fee income, it is also important to ensure licence fees are not seen as a barrier to business or a disincentive to those businesses that wish to operate legally. Final decisions on licence fee levels will be informed through consultation.</p>

It is up to individual Members to decide what mode of transport to use, although paragraph 4.2.9 of the Guide states that &quot;Travel by private car is considerably more expensive than by public transport and Members are therefore urged to use public transport wherever practicable.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.284.6/1">The identity cards programme has taken a number of steps to assess the operation of biometrics and card technology as part of setting requirements for the proposed identity cards scheme. The programme has formed a team with experience in biometrics and technology who have conducted a review of relevant scientific research in this area. They are working with leading experts from the US National Institute for Standards &amp; Technology, San Jose University, UK National Physical Laboratory, members of the Biometrics Working Group and the Communications-Electronic Security Group as well as learning from the experience of our colleagues at UK Passport Service, Immigration &amp; Nationality Directorate and the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO). Lessons from international biometric identity cards schemes such as Hong Kong and the Philippines are also being reviewed and initial engagement with companies in the field of biometrics has taken place in accordance with Office for Government Commerce guidelines. This work will continue and will be subject to the supervision of the Home Office Senior Biometric Adviser and our biometric assurance group, chaired by Sir David King, the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser. The work of the National Physical Laboratory, in their 2003 feasibility study on the use of biometrics report, confirms that, &quot;In the case of facial recognition, it would seem advisable to update the templates at least every 10 years. Fingerprints and iris should be considerably more stable&quot;. This report can be found on the Identity Cards website.</p>

Information provided for PQ1249 and PQ1250 is the number potentially eligible for national insurance credits rather than the numbers expecting to receive them. The estimates therefore include people eligible for credits but who might also be economically active and also paying national insurance (NI) contributions. For example, a person's eligibility to home responsibilities protection is based on receipt of child benefit regardless of whether that person is working and paying NI contributions. All estimates have been provided by the Government Actuary's Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.2/47">(1) These figures include &quot;potential credits&quot; cases.

	<p pid="a.294.2/48">(2) Part (f) asks about &quot;credits under existing rules for auto-enrolment&quot; and we have assumed this to mean those receiving credits because of autocredits. Autocredits projections assume that autocredits will be available to men and women aged 6064 following equalisation of state pension age, which begins in 2010. This is in line with current policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.2/51">(5) Estimates of numbers claiming each benefit are provided by GAD.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/52">(6) The total credits will add up to more than the numbers inactive. This is because it is possible to be economically active and receive credits. For example, the unemployed are counted as &quot;active&quot; but will get credits if claiming JobSeekers Allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/53">(7) The estimates are based on the same assumptions for economic activity as used for the GAD QR update.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/54">(8) Starting credits (included in the other category) are awarded from the age of 16 for up to 3 years for those that need them.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.2/55">(9) No data is given for statutory sick pay (SSP) or statutory maternity pay (SMP). People with SSP or SMP are employed, liable for contributions and are not normally entitled to credits.</p>

	<p pid="a.305.2/1">The Police Ombudsman's budget is set at a level to allow the Office to fulfil all of its legal obligations under Part II of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 and I refer the noble Lord to that Act. Part of those obligations is the determination of complaints from the public about the conduct of police officers, only a small number of which end in prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions and subsequently conviction by the courts. There is no direct correlation between the Police Ombudsman's budget and the cost of convictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.2/2">Value for money can only be determined when compared to similar organisations; a fair comparison would be with the predecessor of the Police Ombudsman, i.e. the combined functions of the RUC Complaints and Discipline Department and the Independent Commission for Police Complaints. In his 1997 report, <i>A police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland,</i> Dr Maurice Hayes placed their combined operating cost at about &pound;6,850,000. Given the range and scope of work of the ombudsman's office, which is fully independent of government and police and as it is 8 years since the report was completed, its current budget of &pound;7,100,000 (cash) would seem to represent value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.307.2/1">The Department for Social Development (DSD) has provided timebounded funding to several community festivals in the past, to support community cohesion and to promote towns and cities. It was DSD's intention to provide seed funding so that once festivals had become established further assistance would not be required. The department is still providing funding to a number of festivals on a transitional basis, until permanent government policy on festival funding has been established. In 2005&ndash;06 transitional arrangements will continue for those festivals funded on that basis in 2004&ndash;05, and DSD will consider applications for funding up to 2004&ndash;05 levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.316.5/1">Section 175 of the Pensions Act 2004 (the Act) provides that the Board of the pension protection fund (PPF) must impose pension protection levies in respect of all eligible schemes. The levies are to be made up of a risk-based levy and a scheme-based levy and Section 177 of the Act requires at least 80 per cent. of the total amount raised must be raised by risk-based levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.5/2">The risk-based levy is designed to reduce cross-subsidy between schemes and promote fairness. This approach means that schemes that pose a higher risk pay more for the PPF compensation cover, and costs are kept down for employers with well funded schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.5/3">The risk based levy is also one of the measures designed to protect the PPF from moral hazard. This is the risk that because the PPF exists to compensate scheme members if their employer has become insolvent and the scheme is under-funded, employers will deliberately manipulate their affairs so as to shift their deficits into the PPF. By charging companies with higher levels of under-funding a higher levy, companies will be encouraged not to under-fund their schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.317.5/2">In his 1997 report, <i>A Police Ombudsman. for Northern Ireland</i>, Dr Maurice Hayes placed the combined cost of operating the RUC Complaints and Discipline Department and the Independent Commission for Police Complaints at about &pound;6,850,000. This did not include costs for additional staff, such as CID and other officers used in conducting criminal investigations arising from complaints, nor the cost of ancillary police services, including; legal advice, use of police officers for court duty, conveying sensitive material, and statistical and research work. Given the range and scope of work of the ombudsman's office and the eight years since the report was completed, the current figure of &pound;7,100,000 is fully justified.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.0/1">The budget allocated to the Ulster-Scots Agency for 2005 is considered sufficient to enable. it to meet the objectives and targets laid out in its approved Corporate and annual Business Plans. The Agency recently introduced a moratorium on new applications I am told to ensure that it did not exceed its approved annual budget,a requirement of financial probity which is shared by all publicly funded bodies. An application for additional inyear year funding has been received from the Agency and is currently being considered by the two Sponsoring Departments.</p>
