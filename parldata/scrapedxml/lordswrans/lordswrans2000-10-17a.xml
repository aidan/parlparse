Development work will start in November. The date on which it will come into operation is currently being re-assessed because project timescales may be affected by concurrent work on the development of the DNA database. The impact assessment completed earlier this year estimated that the project would require some 1,400 person days to complete and would also require additional disk capacity costing &pound;50,000. The Government remain committed to the development of the register, as required by the 1997 Act.</p>

It can provide information on the number of days employees were unable to work in the week that they were surveyed. However, as this number of days can also include some when the respondent would not normally work, no accurate estimate of the total number of working days lost in a year can be calculated.

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">Since April 1999 the Vehicle Inspectorate has been allowed to retain receipts from the licensing of heavy goods and public service vehicle operators in order to finance the inspectorate's general enforcement activity in this area. Any excess receipts are surrendered to the Consolidated Fund; they cannot be diverted to other forms of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2">The Treasury allows departments to retain receipts and net them off against related spending only where specific criteria are met. In December 1998 the Treasury issued a press release announcing two sets of criteria against which requests from departments to retain receipts from licences/levies or fines/penalties to offset against enforcement costs could be assessed. The spending against which retained receipts must be set is tightly defined and generally limited to activities directly related to those generating the receipts.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.2/1">Dental fluorosis is a mottling of the teeth, which only in its more extreme forms will leave some people concerned about the appearance of their teeth. Even then the teeth are still endowed with extra resistance to decay and the effect can be removed by routine dental treatment. The presence of dental fluorosis in an individual does not imply that fluoride has had any other adverse effect in that individual. The numerous studies of the effects of fluoride and of fluoridation of water supplies have not demonstrated that drinking water containing fluoride at 1 part per million has any significant effect, beneficial or adverse, other than on teeth. The findings of the Centre for Research and Dissemination systematic review are consistent with this view.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.8/1">Today we have published the final version of PPG11 Regional Planning. The new regional planning arrangements we announced in draft last year have been seen to work well in practice and have been widely welcomed. Our new guidance contrasts with previous practices where Whitehall produced draft regional planning guidance with decisions being taken behind closed doors. Under our new arrangements it is the regions that produce the drafts. There is then open public debate at a public examination before the Secretary of State approves the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.8/2">Fundamental to the new arrangements is that these strategies should be produced on an inclusive basis to promote regional ownership. The regional planning bodies need to work with a wide range of stakeholders in accordance with a streamlined and publicly accountable timetable.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.8/3">The new strategies should integrate land-use and transport planning. They will provide a long-term regional planning framework for the preparation of structure plans, unitary development plans and local transport plans. They will also inform other strategies and programmes, including the RDA regional economic strategies.</p>
