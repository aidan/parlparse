	<p pid="a.54.2/1">The Government welcome the Environment Agency's <I>Flooding in England</I> report, which sets out the challenges we face in managing risk from flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">We have taken immediate action to help communities at risk of flooding:</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">funding has been increased from &pound;600 million in 2007-08 to a forecast of &pound;780 million for 2010-11, with an additional &pound;20 million brought forward into this year's budgets to allow an early start to projects that will benefit 27,000 homes when complete;85 flood defence schemes have been completed, protecting nearly 58,000 additional homes in England. Operating authorities are currently on course to exceed delivery targets and provide better protection to 160,000 homes over the three years since March 2008 to March 2011;an additional 136,000 people have signed up to receive flood warnings in England and Wales;a &pound;7.7 million flood forecasting centre, jointly run by the Environment Agency and the Met Office, has been set up. The centre is already providing important services to local authorities and emergency responders, helping them to be better prepared for potential flooding;a &pound;5 million grant scheme for householders for property-level flood protection (such as air bricks and door boards) has been announced. The results of the first round of the scheme which will provide greater flood protection to nearly 600 households in England were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-25">25 June</phrase>; andthe first allocations have been provided to six local authorities from the &pound;15 million funding allocated to help the highest priority areas manage surface water flood risk. Progress on implementing the first round as well as next steps on the remaining funds will be announced later this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">The Pitt progress report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-25">25 June</phrase> this year, details the significant progress the Government have made in implementing the recommendations contained in Sir Michael Pitt's report on the 2007 summer floods. The report comes six months after Sir Michael Pitt's review, published in December 2008, in which he made 92 recommendations to improve the UK's preparation for, management of and response to severe flooding.</p>

This was based on the department's understanding that the lack of data was as a result of overseas visitors not bringing their EHICs to the UK. Subsequently, in February 2008, the department identified that trusts were capturing information on overseas visitors but it was insufficient to allow the UK to raise claims for treatment provided. Therefore, the department initiated a project to address this.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.2/1">Yes. The Regulatory Reform Committee asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">&quot;Why could the definition not exclude particularly controversial matters such as extension of licensing hours at sex encounter establishments, extension of existing music or dancing licensing hours beyond 11 pm, and first-time applications to allow playing of music?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/3">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport responded as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/4">&quot;DCMS has indeed agreed to exclude most alcohol-related variations in response to the concerns of consultees.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/5">In many cases the extension of music and dancing beyond 11 pm, or the addition of the playing of music to a licence, will not fall within the definition of a minor variation. This would be most likely where, for example, the extension would coincide with a pre-existing authorisation to sell or supply alcohol. But there may also be cases in which such an extension could not impact adversely on the licensing objectives, and we would not want these to be excluded from the benefits of the new process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/6">The new minor variations process will allow licensees to make minor changes to their licences more quickly and cheaply. As this response makes clear, this may potentially include the addition or extension of authorisation for regulated entertainment (such as live music). In all cases, the test of whether a variation is minor is whether it could have an adverse impact on the licensing objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/7">A live music group has been set up by Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) and the Musicians' Union to explain and encourage the use of the new minor variations process for those premises that wish to add live music to their licence. It will also encourage uptake of the existing exemption for incidental music.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.5/1">Under the Licensing Act 2003 (the Act), licensing authorities must carry out their functions under the Act with a view to promoting the licensing objectives. These are the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, the prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm. Public nuisance, in particular, may present a risk to residential amenity.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">The licensing regime under the Act regulates licensable activities (such as the sale by retail of alcohol) by authorising them subject to representations (including representation from local residents) and subject to conditions on the licence or club premises certificate. Although other legislation exists that regulates public nuisance (such as environmental health legislation), this typically addresses problems after they have occurred. The licensing regime regulates potential risks in advance, while allowing the particular circumstances of the premises to be taken into account (including the applicant's own risk assessment and whether existing legislation may be sufficient to mitigate risks). This means, for example, that licence holders have more certainty about what is permitted, and enforcement action is both easier and more rarely required.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/3">Licensing authorities report that simple conditions, such as requirement to close windows and doors, are invaluable in the prevention of public nuisance. More strict conditions or restrictions may be required in certain circumstances. For example, residents of properties physically adjoining licensed premises may benefit from specific noise limits. Likewise, conditions may be attached to a licence to ensure public safety, although the Act does not duplicate health and safety legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.2/1">The provision in the Licensing Act 1964 known as the &quot;two in a bar rule&quot;, was created before the widespread use of modern amplification. It was widely misunderstood, unpopular with musicians and not widely used. Feedback from local authorities' representatives and members of the public, however, showed that two performers with amplification can create a significant level of public nuisance. It was abolished partly for this reason. Additionally, musicians' representatives argued that, given that an amplified duo could make a great deal of noise, it discriminated unfairly and irrationally against the majority of musicians, who perform in larger groups.</p>
