	<p pid="a.263.2/1">The apprenticeships programme is demand-led. The documents <I>Skills for Sustainable Growth </I>and <I>Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth</I>, published in November 2010, set out the abolition of central targets and increased freedom and flexibility for further education colleges and training organisations. We rely on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities to meet local demand, taking advantage of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/2">From the 2011-12 academic year, there will be a single adult skills budget, with earmarked delivery for apprenticeships. As part of its current allocations process, the Skills Funding Agency will set out a minimum expectation of apprenticeships delivery, in terms of the overall number of places that may be afforded. However, they will not build into that any specific assumptions about expected demand across public, private or third-sector organisations. Further education colleges and training organisations will be able to use their single adult skills budget allocation to expand apprenticeships, in line with the needs of their communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.11/1">The Financial Services Authority, alongside the Bank of England, has engaged actively in the design of the European Banking Authority (EBA) stress tests, with the aim of making them robust and consistent. It is clear from the material now published by the EBA that, taken as a whole, the assumptions to be used in the EBA stress tests are significantly tougher than last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.11/2">The EBA stress tests include the effect of EU-country sovereign stresses in several ways. Higher market interest rates in some countries depress economic activity in the scenario and should increase losses on lending to corporates and households. And sovereign debt held in trading books will be subject to &quot;haircuts&quot; based on changes to the market price as measured by sovereign credit default swaps. Sovereign debt held in the banking book, under current prudential and accounting standards in most EU countries, would only be mark-to-market in the event of an incurred loss, ie in the case of a sovereign default, which does not form part of the EBA stress scenario.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.11/3">The EBA has also committed to publication of banks' sovereign exposures in both the banking book and trading book, broken down in granular detail. This will not only allow for a split of information on exposures in the banking book between &quot;available for sale&quot; and &quot;held to maturity&quot; securities, but also according to maturity. As a result, market analysts will have all the elements needed to run their own stress tests of the banking book, under any assumptions of sovereign stress they wish to use.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.2/1">Market expectations of rising interest rates are based on expectations of continuing economic growth and above-target inflation in the near term. An economic scenario of lower-than-expected economic growth would (other things being equal) be consistent with lower-than-expected inflation and nominal interest rates. That is the case with the European Banking Authority stress scenario, as developed by the European Central Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/2">The Financial Services Authority uses a different set of macroeconomic assumptions in its &quot;anchor stress test scenario&quot; which is applied to United Kingdom banks as part of its rolling programme of stress testing.

	<p pid="a.268.5/1">There are multiple scenarios the European Banking Authority could run (and national regulators do expect banks to run in private).

	<p pid="a.268.5/2">Commodity prices are not directly modelled, but do indirectly feed into the macro modelling through price effects of currency assumptions and their impact on aggregate demand.

	<p pid="a.277.8/1">The UK Government are committed to upholding human rights standards and the Department for International Development (DfID) works closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in promoting and protecting human rights for all people without discrimination on any grounds. We have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and their optional protocols and work with the UN and the European Union to advance disability rights and rights of the child in other countries. DfID also contributes to the Disability Rights Fund which provides grants to disabled persons organisations in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe, which then lobby for rights for people with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.8/2">The UK works with governments and civil society groups in the poorest countries to support disabled children. For example, in Malawi DfID's programmes are sending 85,000 children with disabilities to school. In Bangladesh the DfID-funded Leonard Cheshire Trust project works with 16 districts of Rajshahi Division to promote inclusive education in 200 primary schools, train 400 primary school teachers and reach out to 2,400 children with disabilities. DfID has produced a guidance note on inclusive education for children with disabilities, which was developed with practitioners and experts in the field.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.2/1">The Pensions Regulator was set up under the Pensions Act 2004 and is the body responsible for the regulation of work-based pension schemes in the UK. Parliament gave the regulator operational independence in its regulatory decision-making; this means that Ministers are not involved in decisions to exercise its powers or its casework.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.2/2">For any takeover of a company with occupational pension liabilities, the immediate responsibility falls on the scheme trustees to ensure that members do not lose out as a result of the corporate event. As part of their fiduciary duty, trustees are expected to act in the best interests of the scheme in any negotiations. However, the regulator stands behind the trustees and there is a proportionate regulatory regime in place to address situations where a change to the ownership of an employer could present a risk to members' benefits. Decisions by the regulator are subject to legal tests and it must be satisfied that it is reasonable to exercise its powers.</p>
