Transition is also identified as a key issue within the joint HM Treasury and DfES review of children and young people. <I>Growing Up Matters</I> will be a valuable contribution to this review, the outcomes of which will inform the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

Guidance on the statutory chief officer's post of the director of adult services published by the Department of Health in 2006 required local authorities to ensure that &quot;The Director of Adult Services and the Director of Children's Services have put adequate arrangements in place to ensure that all young people with long-term social care needs have been assessed and, where eligible, receive a service which meets their need throughout their transition to becoming adults&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.297.14/1">Globally, an estimated 120 million to 140 million women and girls have been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM), with an estimated further 2 million added each year. It has serious consequences, including high risk of infection, long-term disability, and can cause severe problems in childbirth, including death for the mother and baby.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.14/2">The UK Government are strongly committed to eliminating FGM as part of improving women's sexual and reproductive health and rights. The practice breaks UN conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action urged governments to prohibit FGM and protect women and children from such dangerous practices.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.14/3">We do support the work of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to end FGM. We also support several other international organisations working in sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), to support community-led initiatives which challenge FGM. With them, we are seeking to intensify international and national efforts to stop the practice in all its forms and to champion the rights of woman and girls. DfID recognises this as a critical prerequisite for the achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs). In 2005-06 DfID provided &pound;30 million to support the work of UNFPA.</p>

	<p pid="b.297.20/1">As reported in the quarter three National Health Service finance report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-20">20 February 2007</phrase>, strategic health authorities (SHAs) have identified savings of at least &pound;450 million through their continued prudent management of central NHS programme budgets. These savings are available to offset the deduction made to NHS resources in the current financial year in respect of prior year overspends, so that, at quarter three, the NHS is forecasting a net surplus of &pound;13 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.20/2">In the quarter two NHS finance report, the department recognised savings of &pound;350 million from the SHAs' management of these central NHS budgets, but noted that SHAs expected to deliver at least a further &pound;100 million. This &pound;100 million has now been confirmed, allowing the full &pound;450 million to be recognised at quarter three. This additional &pound;100 million is not related to redundancies.</p>

Until Mugabe addresses the urgent need for reform, instead of punishing his people for voicing their concerns, we will continue to argue for the targeted measures to be maintained. It is important to note that these measures are not economic sanctions, but are aimed at specific individuals within the Mugabe regime.
