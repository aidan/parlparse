The VI is an industry initiative managed by a steering group made up of a wide range of pesticide interests, including the Crop Protection Association, which has led on this publication.</p>

Each sea cadet unit is an independent charity under the direct management of a unit management committee and, by act of affiliation with the Marine Society and Sea Cadets (itself a charitable body), affiliated units form the Sea Cadet Corps. While the funding arrangements may be different they are effective, and the training choices and opportunities offered to sea cadets are comparable with their RAF and Army counterparts.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.23/1">It is too early to say what the projected effect of the caps will be for phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme as the European Commission has yet to make assessments on all member states' national allocation plans (NAPs). The Commission has so far made decisions on 20 member states' NAPs. Six further plans have been submitted for assessment, leaving one member state yet to submit its NAP. Should member states accept the Commission's decisions, the NAPs that have so far been assessed would give a total cap of 1,663 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year between 2008 and 2012. This is against 2005 verified emissions of 1,685 million tonnes of carbon dioxide for those member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.23/2">The UK's phase II cap of 246 million tonnes of CO2 will deliver savings of 29 million tonnes of CO2 per year and puts us on track to achieve carbon dioxide reductions of 16.2 per cent by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.32/1">The term &quot;hard-line activist&quot; has no statutory definition. It is commonly used to describe someone who is uncompromising in their views or beliefs and is prepared to commit criminal offences in furthering a particular cause or ideology. The Home Office does not classify individuals as hard-line activists and there is therefore no such register.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.32/2">The term &quot;hard-line activist&quot; used by the Metropolitan Police in the context of the &quot;Sack Parliament&quot; demonstration referred to a group of individuals who were clearly intent on disrupting the work of Parliament that day.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.35/1">The department has made over 750 general and local statutory instruments since 2001. However, the department does not have a central database of revoked regulations or one which identifies those that are updated regulations, and collation of the data requested would involve disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.35/2">The department views the revocation, modernisation and rationalisation of its regulations as an essential part of its approach to regulating better. For example, the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2005, which govern the statutory controls on veterinary medicines, provided much-needed clarity and improved comprehension by replacing part of the Medicines Act 1968 and 49 separate statutory instruments. To keep these regulations up to date and to maintain their ease of use they have been replaced by the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2006 as part of an annual exercise to revoke and remake them.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.35/3">The Veterinary Medicines Regulations are one of a number of simplification measures the department is taking forward. The department's 2006 simplification plan, <I>Maximising Outcomes, Minimising Burdens</I>, identifies a reduction in the administrative burden Defra imposes on business of &pound;159 million, more than 30 per cent of the department's total administrative burden.

The RPA, as the paying agency, is still required to pass SPS claimant data to the EA.

	<p pid="b.15.65/1">It is for local primary care trusts in conjunction with other stakeholders to make an assessment of availability and commission services for local people.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.65/2">NHS South West has advised departmental officials that screening was introduced in Gloucestershire in September 1990 for men reaching the age of 65. Each year just over 3,000 men are invited for screening.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.65/3">NHS South East Coast has advised that screening was introduced at St Richard's Hospital, part of the Royal West Sussex National Health Service Trust, in 1983 for men aged from 65 to 80. Since 1988, men over the age of 65 have been screened as part of a research programme funded by the NHS Research and Development Forum and the Medical Research Council, and each year just over 2,000 men are invited for screening.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.65/4">The United Kingdom national screening committee (NSC) has advised that screening for men aged 65 for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) can be recommended in principle subject to further work, particularly on the appropriate configuration of treatment services and the provision for men to make an informed choice about whether to undergo screening. At its meeting in March 2007, the NSC considered further work undertaken by the AAA screening working group. More detailed work will now be undertaken on the practical issues that would be involved in implementation.</p>

But it does not follow that taxpayers should subsidise the level of court fees generally. Rather, help should be directed at those least able to pay court fees. Litigants that can afford to pay the full cost should do so. To set fees at a lower level, or remove them altogether, would allow corporations and other wealthy litigants to benefit from taxpayer contributions. Further, the reduction in income would increase pressure on other budgets such as legal aid.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.101/1">Directing passports to the holder's nearest police station would place a considerable administrative burden on IPS, which would be required to identify the station in question, and the police who would be obliged to deal with a further 6 million personal callers a year as a consequence. It would also incur considerable cost which would have to be recovered through the passport fee. Travelling to a police station would create considerable difficulties and expense for many passport applicants, especially those in rural areas. It is therefore not regarded as practical that passport applicants should collect their passports from police stations.</p>
