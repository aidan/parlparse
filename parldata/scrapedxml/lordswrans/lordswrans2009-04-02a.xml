It is not at all clear that targeted online advertising is interception, and if indeed it is interception, whether it is a breach of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). It may also be relevant to note that communications companies are able to intercept communications as a function of conducting their business. They might do this to stop unwanted email messages or potentially harmful viruses that would otherwise cripple our communications networks.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.0/1">Analysis from independent research conducted by Ipsos MORI between 2004 and 2007 indicates that the CRB is making a real difference to the protection of children and vulnerable adults; 80,000 unsuitable people have had offers of employment which involved working with children and vulnerable adults withdrawn on the basis of information contained on their disclosure. Many more unsuitable people are thought to be deterred from applying to work with children as a result of the requirement for a CRB check.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/2">This analysis also demonstrates that users of the Criminal Records Bureau's (CRB) service feel that the information provided on disclosures is useful when making recruitment decisions. More than eight out of 10 customers (83 per cent) say CRB checks improves their ability to protect children and the vulnerable adults and nearly nine out of 10 customers (88 per cent) say CRB checks improves their confidence in their recruitment decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/3">Almost three in four members (72 per cent) of the general public think that the CRB is making a difference to the protection of children and vulnerable adults in this country. Over the past three years, as public awareness of the CRB increases, there has also been a reduction of around seven percentage points in the number of people worried about children and vulnerable adults becoming a victim of crime by those caring for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/4">The research shows that customer satisfaction levels are at an all-time high, reflecting the year-on-year improvements made by the CRB.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.3/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) recognises that there are individuals who move frequently between short-term appointments and may not wish to apply for a fresh CRB check each time they seek a new position, especially if this occurs very frequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/2">The CRB advises that organisations can accept a previously issued disclosure at their own risk but make the limitations and risks of doing so very clear. This information can be found on the CRB website at <a href="http://www.crb.gov.uk">www.crb.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/3">There are good reasons why a disclosure that is issued for one position may not be suitable for other positions, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/4">disclosures are primarily designed to be used by an organisation at the point of recruitment for a particular position, whether as an employee or a volunteer;conviction or other relevant information can be recorded against an individual at any point after a disclosure is issued; and the disclosure process may also include a search to establish whether an individual is subject to a direction under Section 142 of the Education Act 2002, the Protection of Children Act and Protection of Vulnerable Adults (PoCA and PoVA) lists.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/5">Legislation governing these lists, as set by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department of Health, requires fresh checks of the lists for certain positions involving work with children and vulnerable adults, regardless of any previous existing checks. This may limit the ability for recruiting organisations to accept previously issued disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.3/6">It is ultimately for each recruiting organisation and not the CRB to decide whether a fresh disclosure should be applied for. The recruiting organisation, using a range of pre-recruitment checks, is best placed to assess whether disclosure is required for a specific position, bearing in mind their legal and other responsibilities. The overriding consideration must always be the safety of those whom the disclosure service is designed to protect.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.2/1">Rafah has limited capacity and the present agreement between the Egyptian authorities and the authorities in Gaza is for people only to cross into and out of Gaza. Due to this the UK Government have not raised the issue of the transport of materials for reconstruction through the Rafah crossing with the Egyptian Government. The UK Government continue to press the Israeli Government for improved access and for a relaxation of restrictions on the type of goods that are allowed across the border from Israel into Gaza.</p>

Other DfID-funded projects also have a psychosocial element: the Welfare Association gives support to the disabled, Islamic Relief are working with primary school children and their parents, and Save the Children are providing psychosocial activities in eight play areas. Organisations working in the mental health sector, including the ones that DfID fund, collaborate with GCMPH in their work.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.2/1">The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) policy on record retention and destruction is agreed between the tribunal, the departmental records officer and a national archive. All tribunal policies accord with the requirements of the Public Records Act 1958, which does not require the AIT to retain any files which are not selected for permanent preservation on the basis of having exceptional legal or procedural importance. All files created pre-2006 that were not selected for permanent preservation will now have been destroyed, or be in the process of being destroyed, in accordance with the retention and destruction policies for that period.

	<p pid="a.273.2/2">The Administrative Court was able to provide statistics for the period 2005-2006 regarding applications for reconsideration from its own electronic database. These statistics provide only for applications to the Administrative Court directly for reconsideration of an AIT decision under the opt-in provision established by the 2004 Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act. The AIT's electronic database incurred a problem with approximately 2,000 cases in 2005-06 which resulted in the data for the outcomes of reconsideration applications not being recorded correctly. This was because the outcome of the reconsideration applications was overwritten erroneously with the outcome of the reconsideration hearing. The incorrect data inputs could not be identified or corrected following this and the monthly reports for that period did not break down the outcomes into appellant and respondent. It has therefore not been possible to provide the statistical data for outcome of reconsideration applications for 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.9/1">The Highways Agency is responsible for motorways and trunk roads in England, including compliance of its network with European Union legislation. For older bridges, there has been a large programme of structural assessment followed by strengthening of bridges where necessary. Total costs are estimated to be about &pound;777 million overall, including an allowance for future costs. Expenditure to the end of 2007 was about &pound;651 million. These figures represent total actual costs; it has not been possible to determine the total costs in real terms.</p>

The Department for Transport provides funding for highway maintenance to English local authorities, outside London, as part of the Local Transport Plan settlement capital allocations. Authorities may use this for bridge strengthening, and have also been able to apply for specific funding for maintenance of highway structures, including bridge strengthening, on the primary route network (PRN) to which the European legislation applies. The Department for Transport has provided &pound;221.2 million for bridge strengthening and major maintenance on the primary route network for the period 2005-06 to 2010-11 (&pound;225.72 million in 2008-09 prices). Prior to 2005-06 the information is not available to this level of detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.9/3">Roads in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are the responsibility of their respective devolved Administrations. Funding in London is a matter for the mayor. The strengthening of bridges owned by other bodies, such as Network Rail, is a matter for the respective bridge owners.</p>

In order to comply with European legislation and avoid further financial penalties, from 2009 the RPA will be using a 3 per cent reduction as a starting point for first-time breaches of the cross-compliance requirements and standards. The European legislation allows the RPA to reduce this to 1 per cent or increase it to 5 per cent, depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the non-compliance.

	<p pid="a.286.2/1">Following approval of the UK's application to join the police and judicial co-operation arrangements in Schengen, work began to deliver our connectivity to the Schengen Information System (SIS) in 2002. However, before this could become operational the European Commission proposed the development of an upgraded system (SIS II). The date by which the European Commission initially envisaged that SIS II would be operational was very close to the planned UK date for access to the original system. Furthermore, the original SIS does not include biometric information and is therefore a much weaker control tool than other capabilities that are already in place or being implemented by the UK and our European partners. Ministers therefore took the decision that the UK should refocus its resources on the development of connectivity to SIS II, which will ultimately provide the UK with better functionality than the original SIS.</p>

The Government have also endorsed an outline 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Safety and Security National Concept of Operations which describes how the strategy will be delivered.

The main impact would be the net loss to Sudan of approximately &euro;300 million from the 10th EDF. Although we do not have clear figures, we know that southern Sudan would lose a substantial amount of development assistance, and this is an issue that the Government of Southern Sudan has raised with us. The withdrawal of these funds leaves potentially significant gaps in support to the World Bank managed Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the South, and other programmes which the EC has previously supported such as the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, and recovery and rehabilitation needs throughout Sudan.</p>

Many of the 300 projects initially supported by RBC funding are now continuing with mainstream funding from local authorities and other sources.</p>

Kickstart is targeted at schemes that have the potential to become successful or which are currently marginal schemes that with some extra support could be made more successful. The Government are currently inviting local transport authorities to submit bids for funding for a new round of Kickstart projects. &pound;25 million is available between 2009-10 to 2011-12. Kickstart support will not be used to fund projects which have previously received funding under previous challenge schemes, except in wholly exceptional circumstances.

	<p pid="a.296.3/1">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) has advised that it based the decision to alter these bandings on the YJB Asset research (2003) which provided reconviction rates for children and young people falling within the different bands. It also took into account the concerns and experience of the youth offending teams piloting the scaled approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.3/2">As a result it was clear that what was the low band in the model published in September 2008 would in practice contain children and young people who could not be considered as being of low likelihood of reoffending according to the research data. This was considered to be unacceptable as it would undermine public confidence and that of the courts, so the decision was made to amend the model.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.3/3">The revised model, published in February 2009 on the YJB website, is now consistent with the research and the experience and advice of the pilot sites and will ensure that children and young people will be receiving levels of supervision commensurate with their assessed likelihood of reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.6/1">The scaled approach is a new risk-based assessment tool developed by the Youth Justice Board which it is piloting and it is its responsibility to assess its impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.6/2">The YJB has advised that the impact of changing the asset scores for the three bands in the new model will result in an increase in the numbers of young offenders falling into the medium and enhanced bands and a decrease in the numbers in the low band from that of the previous model. This change impacts on the workload of youth offending teams with the earlier model resulting in a significant fall in workload and the revised model having no discernible increase in contact requirements to those presently required.</p>
