	<p pid="a.230.6/1">We estimate that 35,000 to 40,000 seriously injured service personnel and veterans under the age of 60 will be eligible for concessionary travel. This figure includes people who already qualify for concessionary travel. Based on generous assumptions, we estimate the additional costs to be in the region of &pound;4 million to &pound;8 million per year. The new concession will be introduced by <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.6/2">The statutory bus concession allows concessionaires free bus travel on local buses from 9.30 am to 11 pm Monday to Friday and at all times at weekends and on bank holidays. These times will apply to the new concession for military personnel. At present, we have no plans to extend this scheme to other military personnel and veterans.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.0/2">Our support for new capacity at Heathrow, subject to meeting strict local environmental limits, is underpinned by detailed modelling of passenger demand up to 2030. These forecasts indicate that the range of domestic and international flights offered at Heathrow is crucial to the UK and particularly beneficial to the connectivity of passengers located in regions outside the south-east.

We have also not considered measures to reduce the number of transit passengers using Heathrow.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-07-22a.239.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="239"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80722w0004.htm#80722w0004.htm_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.239.0/1">Further to the Secretary of State for the Home Department's Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase>, the Government have made good progress in implementing the conclusions of the reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/2">On crowded places, we have introduced a standard way of assessing risk which will for the first time provide baseline data about local areas with crowded places at highest risk. The investment of a further &pound;1.5 million during the financial year 2008-09, for additional counterterrorism security adviser (CTSA) posts, has meant that there are now more than 180 officers to support this work. We have also tripled the capacity of the national barrier asset (which provides temporary protection for the highest risk locations).</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/3">In the autumn, we will consult publicly about two key guidance documents: a new strategic framework to encourage greater partnership working at local level to reduce vulnerabilities of crowded places; and a counterterrorism supplement to the existing guidance <I>Safer Places</I><I>&mdash;T</I><I>he Plan</I><I>ning System and Crime Prevention</I>, which will act as a practical guide for designers and planners.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/4">The National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NaCTSO) is due to publish shortly two new protective security guidance booklets for cinemas, theatres, restaurants and hotels. Guidance tailored for the requirements of major events, education and health sectors, religious sites and commercial centres is also being prepared to supplement existing protective security guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/5">CTSAs have now delivered more than 460 ARGUS exercises (counterterrorism scenario-based training exercises for primarily retail businesses located in crowded places) since January 2007. A new ARGUS &quot;professional&quot; has been developed aimed at architects, planners, designers and developers following four pilots carried out earlier in 2008 across the UK. NaCTSO has also developed an ARGUS exercise for the &quot;night-time economy&quot;, which will be available from CTSAs from August 2008 onwards. Regional-based counterterrorism awareness briefings are also being provided to police architectural liaison officers in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/6">On critical national infrastructure (CNI), a new infrastructure categorisation scheme has now been implemented. Sector sponsor departments and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) are reviewing our essential services to produce a new, up-to-date catalogue of national infrastructure. This includes information networks as well as physical sites for a more comprehensive picture of the UK's critical national infrastructure. The catalogue will be reviewed on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/7">We are developing guidance to explain the Government's strategic approach to infrastructure protection, outlining the roles and responsibilities of those involved in critical national infrastructure protection, for sharing with key partners. We have also accelerated the research and development work being led by the CPNI.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/8">On transport, the review recognised the scope and nature of our transport security programmes and that there was no requirement for a fundamental change in how we regulate counterterrorism security. The Government had already been working to address the security of public areas at airports and on the railways prior to the incident at Glasgow Airport in June 2007, building on existing security procedures which apply to both airports and the railways.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/9">We continue to balance the necessary response to the ongoing level of threat with the need for people to travel. Where necessary, we introduce additional requirements, such as those proposed in the transport security Bill. Where appropriate, we develop capability, such as our three-year operational trial of an extension to the British Transport Police's passenger screening announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-26">26 June</phrase>, and the introduction of vehicle restraint measures at key stations. Where possible we minimise the impact, such as lifting the &quot;one bag&quot; restriction on aircraft cabin baggage at 50 UK airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/10">On the review of hazardous substances announced by the Prime Minister in November 2007, I refer the noble Baroness to the Statement I laid before this House today.</p>

	<p pid="a.240.2/1">The &pound;12.5 million announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-03">3 June</phrase> is the money that the Home Office has allocated to a number of departments, agencies and organisations to deliver programmes to support vulnerable individuals. This comprises a range of activities rather than a single programme that the Government invited bids for.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/2">The &pound;12.5 million from the Home Office is to help prevent extremism in communities and will be spent on funding projects specifically to support institutions or individuals vulnerable to radicalisation. New schemes will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/3">&pound;1 million for the Home Office to extend police-led multi-agency projects to identify and support vulnerable individuals at risk of being targeted by violent extremists;&pound;3.5 million to youth offending teams and youth secure establishments on new work to prevent violent extremism, focused on supporting young individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system;&pound;7.25 million to the National Offender Management Service and partner agencies to do further work in prisons and the community to tackle vulnerability to radicalisation among offenders;&pound;750,000 for the Home Office to fund further grassroots projects aimed at tackling radicalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/4">All of the &pound;12.5 million will be spent in the 2008-09 financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/5">The Home Office regularly carries out cross-government consultation with all its key stakeholders including the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills among others. Organisations with experience in dealing with vulnerable individuals were identified and projects created to contribute to the delivery of the PREVENT strategy. All approved projects are scrutinised by governance boards, which feed into the NSID(E) board chaired by the Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid="a.241.5/1">In 2007-08, 23,344 cases of fraud by false representation that involved a cheque, plastic card or online bank account were recorded by the police (this includes some instances of the similar offence of cheque and credit card fraud committed under old legislation in place before <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-15">15 January 2007</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.241.5/2">Those offences could have been referred directly by a financial institution, reported by an account holder or merchant who was not refunded moneys by their financial institution or dealt with as a direct call for service to the police where a suspect was believed to be committing a crime at the time. The offences will in some instances relate to online fraud, but there is no specific category of recorded crime to separately identify them.</p>

The case broadly concerned the enforcement powers that may be required to deal with situations where unlawful discrimination is apparent, but no individual victim has been identified. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is already empowered to bring enforcement proceedings in situations where no identifiable victim has come forward&mdash;for example, where it identifies discriminatory advertisements, discriminatory practices or where it otherwise thinks an unlawful act is likely to be committed. Our initial view, therefore, is that our existing legislative framework is compliant. We are, however, considering the judgment in detail and will be analysing it in terms of our wider proposals for the new Equality Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.6/1">No licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) permits centres to culture live human embryos beyond 14 days or the appearance of the primitive streak, in accordance with Sections 3(3)(a) and 3(4) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (HFE) Act 1990. Entities which form when human embryos are allowed to outgrow their structure are not classed as live human embryos and do not breach Sections 3(3)(a) and 3(4) of the 1990 HFE Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.6/2">This is because the entities do not have the organisation structure of a viable embryo and are not representative of a 3D suspended embryo undergoing gastrulation (the stage of development during which the primitive streak emerges). The HFEA has issued licences to two centres (St Mary's Manchester and Roslin Cells Limited) that allow embryos to outgrow in this way in order to extract the inner cell mass.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.6/3">One research project (at Guy's Hospital, London) has been licensed by the HFEA under several purposes, including increasing knowledge about the development of embryos.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.6/4">It is a condition of an HFEA research licence that if a stem cell is derived a sample of the line has to be deposited in the United Kingdom Stem Cell Bank. The HFEA is aware that 35 stem cell lines have been derived under HFEA licences. Information on the lines that have been deposited and the number of lines awaiting to be deposited can be found on the UK Stem Cell Bank website at: <a href="http://www.ukstemcellbank.org.uk">www.ukstemcellbank.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.5/1">Chromatographic fingerprinting is an accepted methodology in the analysis of herbal products and has been included in European guidelines and the <I>European Pharmacopoeia</I> since the early 1990s. With regard to multi-ingredient herbal medicinal products, it is recognised that identification and assay of individual herbal ingredients in the herbal product is difficult to perform and sometimes impossible. The European Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products has recently developed a guideline, in consultation with industry, that addresses the issue of multi-ingredient herbal products. The guideline states that if testing for identity or assay or to demonstrate stability cannot be performed in the herbal product, alternative strategies may be considered. The guideline refers to appropriate fingerprint chromatograms, appropriate overall methods of assay and physical or other appropriate tests. The applicant is therefore able to select appropriate methods and justify their use.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.5/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) submitted evidence in 2007 to the Commission's review of directive 2004/24/EC. In addition, the MHRA has had a number of opportunities&mdash;for example, through sharing a platform at conferences&mdash;to update Commission officials on the agency's early experience of the expending number of companies submitting applications under the traditional herbal registration scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.2/1">Patients are able to opt out of having their clinical information uploaded to the &quot;spine&quot;, the national database of key information about patients' health and care within the NHS Care Records Service, by choosing not to have summary care record. Clinicians are none the less required by their professional bodies, and for clinical governance and medico-legal reasons, to keep clear, accurate, legible and contemporaneous patient records, and to keep these secure and confidential.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/2">It is good practice for all those who provide care to patients to discuss and agree with them what they are going to record and, if asked, to show what they have recorded and to provide copies of any letters they write. In this way all patients are able to have responsibility for the content, accuracy and completeness of their own records in whatever form they are kept.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/3">Since December 2003, we have provided the facility for patients to store their personal health information on a secure website, HealthSpace. This effectively provides people with their own on-line personal health organiser. It is a free service available to all National Health Service patients living in England aged 16 and over. HealthSpace offers a set of basic features to support people in managing their health, including a diary feature with a calendar/reminder service and address book; personal health history with the ability to record key metrics for chronic disease management, for example weight, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels; a search system for local NHS services information; and access to the choose and book online booking service.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/4">In 2007, HealthSpace also started providing people in areas covered by the NHS Summary Care Record Early Adopter Programme with the option of on-line access to their summary care records. Eventually, this option will be available to all NHS patients in England.</p>

In January 2007 it published a personal information toolkit for the general public; in June 2007 it produced guidance to data controllers about collecting personal information on the internet and in November 2007 it launched a new website to provide tips and advice on safe social networking and to help young people protect their personal information.

The impact of technology was one of the issues covered by the review's consultation paper and is covered extensively in the final report. More generally, the Government and the Information Commissioner's Office keep legislation under review in light of ever-increasing technological changes in the field of data protection. To this end, the Information Commissioner recently commissioned an assessment of the current legislation.</p>

We hope that the militant groups will fulfil their commitment to cease attacks on Israel, and that Israel will ease restrictions on Gaza in line with its own commitments, ensuring that humanitarian aid and supplies can get through. We need to build on the opportunity that the ceasefire represents by working towards the reopening of the crossings between Israel and Gaza, under the control of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.5/1">Dedicated support already exists for young witnesses. In cases where a charge is brought, young witnesses have access to support from joint police/Crown Prosecution Service witness care units. These provide the young person or their parent/guardian with information about the progress of the case. In cases that go to trial, they will undertake a detailed needs assessment to provide support and information to attend court. This will include the relevant <I>Young Witness</I> information pack.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.5/2">At court itself, the witness service provides support to young witnesses in every criminal court in England and Wales. In 2006-07, the most recent year for which figures are available, Victim Support's witness service helped almost 31,000 young witnesses (under-18). Some areas offer additional support from young witness support schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.3/1">The &pound;480 million that the Department for International Development (DfID) plans to provide to Pakistan in aid between 2008 and 2011 is a commitment included in the development partnership agreement signed by Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Shaukat Aziz in November 2006. Pakistan has made commitments in this arrangement to poverty reduction, sound public financial management and respect for human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.3/2">The funds that we are making available will be committed under four headings as set out in the country plan, which was recently launched by the Secretary of State for International Development in Pakistan. These headings are:</p>
	<p pid="a.275.3/3">giving people access to better health and education services;making government more effective (by helping to improve capability, accountability and responsiveness of government systems);making growth work for everyone, through more sustainable and inclusive policies and programmes; andensuring that the international community works better together to improve development outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.3/4">DfID has a rigorous set of procedures to safeguard funding and ensure that it benefits those most in need. Overall progress on the country programme is measured by means of quantifiable, time-bound targets, supported by a detailed business plan. Individual programmes and projects also include a performance measurement framework with measurable targets. Progress against these targets is assessed by means of annual reviews. These reviews, which also include a comprehensive risk analysis, ensure that DfID funds are being used effectively and are achieving their intended results.</p>

During the campaign, the Office for Criminal Justice Reform invested additional resources into the Poppy project, which resulted in service-level agreements being put in place with refuges across the country. The Scottish Government put aside additional resources to reimburse local authorities for the cost of supporting victims with no recourse to public funds during the campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.9/1">Current assessment indicates that, given the complexity of many cases being investigated and HET's commitment to ensure families receive as much information as possible, it is unlikely the work will be completed within the original timescale. The Chief Constable has already indicated his commitment to the process beyond this point. However, a definite decision on the way forward will be best taken after the forthcoming report from the Consultative Group on the Past and the recent NIAC report. As funding of HET is in addition to the main policing budget, the backlog of work is having minimal impact on police operations.</p>

This work should lead to changes when equipment is renewed, rather than a campaign programme of change.
