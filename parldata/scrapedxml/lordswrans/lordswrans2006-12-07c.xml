	<p pid="c.154.2/1">No count is made of the number of vehicles permitted to use these aids, but lawful use is restricted according to requirements specified in the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 as amended (RVLR), with occasional special orders to meet particular requirements (for example, for Highways Agency traffic officer vehicles). The aim is to avoid unnecessary proliferation of these aids which could undermine their impact and effectiveness. We have not made any specific assessment of potential confusion caused to other road users by such aids; however, assessments have previously been made that demonstrate the conspicuity benefit of these lights and markings for high-risk and/or emergency vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="c.155.8/1">It is predicted that 2,729 athletes will have received talented athlete scholarships through the Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS) by the end of the year 2006-07. These figures break down as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.155.8/4"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>920 athletes supported</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.155.8/5"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>1,109 additional athletes supported</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.155.8/9">Athletes on the TASS programme are not generally at the performance level to be competing at Olympic, world or European championship level. There are notable exceptions however: for example, the silver medal won by Shelley Rudman during the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics; the three European Athletics Championship Medals won at Gothenburg 2006; and the 21 medals won by TASS athletes during the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.8/10">Additionally, we have seen significant performances from TASS athletes at World and European Junior Championships: for example, the gold medals won by Harry Aikines Aryeetey at both the 100 metres and 200 metres at the 2005 World Youth Championships.</p>

	<p pid="c.157.2/1">The Government take this difficult problem seriously and are taking a range of non-legislative steps to tackle it. Including, raising awareness of the potential dangers of suicide websites being accessed by vulnerable people; encouraging search engine companies to ensure that search results give prominence to sites offering help and support to people contemplating suicide; and working with internet service providers to discourage them from hosting sites which may encourage suicide. The Department of Health is also continuing to explore what more non-legislative action might be possible in the context of their Suicide Prevention Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.157.2/2">At the Government's request, the Law Commission has considered the law as it applies to suicide websites as part of their work on participation in crime. It concludes (in Annexe B to its report <I>Inchoate Liability for Assisting and Encouraging Crime</I>, published on<phrase class="date" code="">11 July</phrase> and available on its website) that the problems posed by suicide websites can be adequately addressed without reform to the Suicide Act 1961. But it recommends that the language of the legislation could be updated, and that consideration should be given to applying its proposed provisions on extra-territorial jurisdiction to the offence of assisting suicide. We will consider these recommendations carefully.</p>
