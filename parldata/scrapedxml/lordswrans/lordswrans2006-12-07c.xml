	<p pid="c.153.6/1">The Government are not aware of any proliferation of the use of lights or other conspicuity aids in breach of the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 as amended (RVLR). Government policies, and the RVLR, restrict special warning beacons and high conspicuity markings to specific definitions of vehicles and uses; for example, vehicles used for emergency or abnormal-load escort purposes, so as to avoid undermining their impact and effectiveness. Use of such beacons and markings in breach of RVLR is a matter for enforcement by the police.</p>

The aim is to avoid unnecessary proliferation of these aids which could undermine their impact and effectiveness. We have not made any specific assessment of potential confusion caused to other road users by such aids; however, assessments have previously been made that demonstrate the conspicuity benefit of these lights and markings for high-risk and/or emergency vehicles.</p>
