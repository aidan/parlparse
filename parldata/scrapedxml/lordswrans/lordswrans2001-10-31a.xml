	<p pid="a.161.2/1">The Government's objectives for improving the contribution of European Community development programmes to poverty reduction were first set out in a Department for International Development strategy document published in December 1998. Many of those objectives have been achieved, including negotiation of a new agreement between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific states, signed in Cotonou in June 2000, which has poverty reduction as its overarching goal; agreement--for the first time--on a clear European Community development policy with poverty reduction as its central objective; and a new structure for the implementation of European Community development programmes, including the establishment of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">The Government published their revised objectives for European Community development programmes in August 2001. These focus on supporting the effective implementation of the new policies, including reversing the decline in the proportion of European Community aid allocated to poor countries; promoting trade policies that help developing countries benefit from the global economy; integrating action on environment issues into European Community development policies to promote sustainable poverty reduction; and developing effective responses to crises, conflict and humanitarian disasters. The Government are working in a wide range of ways in collaboration with the Commission, the European Parliament, other member states and with civil society to support efforts to achieve these objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.5/1">Red diesel is gas oil which has been marked with a red dye and a tracer chemical making it eligible for a rebated rate of excise duty. The effective duty rate is currently 3.13p per litre. This is around 93 per cent lower than the ultra-low sulphur diesel rate of 45.82p per litre.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/2">The concept of rebated duty on heavy oil was first introduced in 1928. The system of marking gas oil that was eligible for a rebate was introduced in 1961.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/3">Red diesel may be used as fuel not only for certain agricultural vehicles but also for other off-road vehicles and in some commercial central heating systems. Under the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 it must not be used as fuel for road vehicles. Schedule 1 to that Act (excepted vehicles) categorises the types of vehicles which are not considered to be road vehicles and which can, therefore, use red diesel as a fuel when travelling on the public road in the circumstances set out in the schedule. The intention of Schedule 1 is to limit the use of red diesel to vehicles that only use the public road on very limited occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/4">Quantities of red diesel released for consumption in 2000-01 are provisionally estimated at 6,879 million litres. Assuming this level of consumption, application of the ultra-low sulphur diesel rate would have raised additional revenue of around &pound;3 billion. In practice, the cost would be considerably less than this because an increase in the duty rate would reduce the demand for red diesel.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/5">Customs data on payments of duty on red diesel do not indicate the end-use. Therefore no estimate has been made of the financial benefit to the farming industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.0/1">We will be consulting very shortly on a package of measures to help local authorities deal with the abandoned vehicles problem. The main proposals are to reduce the notice periods used by local authorities so that abandoned vehicles can be removed more quickly; enable local authorities to use DVLA's powers to remove unlicensed vehicles and to provide better access for them to DVLA's records; promote exchanges of best practice between local authorities; and, in the longer term, bring forward changes to vehicle registration and licensing procedures to ensure greater accuracy of DVLA's vehicle record.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.3/1">During the 2001 EU budget year, the UK received &pound;2.47 billion in CAP receipts. Direct payments to farmers accounted for approximately 90 per cent of this. The rest related to expenditure on market support measures such as intervention storage and export refunds. Of the direct payment receipts, approximately &pound;1.4 billion were in respect of England. Market support expenditure cannot be allocated to particular regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.3/2">For the 2000-07 rural development programming period, the UK has been allocated 154 million euros of EU rural development funds per annum, which represents 3.5 per cent of the annual EU total of 4.3 billion euros. Of the UK allocation, 50 per cent has been committed to the England Rural Development Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.2/1">This proposal forms part of a much wider set of proposals produced by the European Commission to amend the procedures for the authorisation and control of both human and veterinary medicines in the EU. In its present form this particular proposal could result in UK farmers having to pay more by incurring veterinary surgeons' fees when obtaining those medicines that are currently available without veterinary intervention. In considering this proposal the Government have taken account of its likely impact on the supply of veterinary medicines and have agreed that, during negotiations, UK officials should seek to modify the proposal to enable a flexible approach to the distribution of veterinary medicinal products that takes advantage of existing national practices, so long as consumer protection and animal welfare can be demonstrably assured.</p>
