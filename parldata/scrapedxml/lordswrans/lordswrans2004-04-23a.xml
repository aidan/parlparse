	<p pid="a.67.2/1">The Government have set out their investment plans for 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 to support their Success for All strategy to reform further education and training. These plans enable the Learning and Skills Council to increase funding for further education significantly. For the academic year 2003&ndash;04, core funding rates per qualification increased by 3 per cent for school sixth-forms and 4.5 per cent for further education colleges (setting aside the impact on rates of changes to targeted funds for pay and staff training and teachers' pension funding).</p>

	<p pid="a.68.5/1">The Department of Health has issued model rules and guidance on electoral systems for membership of the board of governors of NHS foundation trusts and these are available in the Library. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 provides for the commencement of elections once a trust has made an application to the Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts. The regulator is responsible for ensuring that an NHS foundation trust's constitution including its provisions for carrying out elections are in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The department will be reviewing the model rules in the light of the experience of the NHS foundation trusts which were authorised on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
