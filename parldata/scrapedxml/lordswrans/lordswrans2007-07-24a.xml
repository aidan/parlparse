Moreover, the team also works with coroners across England and Wales in support of &quot;home coroner&quot; procedures.

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">We are committed to achieve tour intervals of 24 months between operational deployments, the so-called Harmony Guidelines, and are generally succeeding in this aim. Over the past two years the Infantry, Royal Armoured Corps, Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers have had a combined average tour interval of about 23 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2">A number of plans are in place to re-balance the Army under Future Army Structures (FAS). These are designed to provide more robust establishments and strengthen those support trades that are in great demand, such as engineers, logisticians and intelligence operators&mdash;the key enablers that support our front-line troops. As these changes are implemented, tour intervals for troops should increase. However, Harmony Guidelines inform, and cannot dictate, deployment decisions. Exceptionally, operational demands may continue to require shorter tour intervals in some cases. For this reason there is no firm target date by which the Army is expected to achieve and sustain 24-month tour intervals for all units.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/3">There is no specific compensation mechanism in place for units deployed on operations with a tour interval of fewer than 24 months. However, monetary redress is provided via the &quot;x factor&quot; (a percentage addition to military basic pay which reflects the differences between conditions of service experienced by members of the Armed Forces over a full career and conditions in civilian life) and the operational allowance, which has been paid to all military personnel deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. In addition, the longer separation allowance (LSA) is paid to military personnel whose involuntary separation (for 10 consecutive days or more) precludes them from returning to their duty station, family home or permanent residence.</p>

It requires licensed electricity suppliers to source a specific and increasing percentage of their sales from renewable sources. Eligible renewable generators receive one renewables obligation certificate (ROC) for each 1 MWh of electricity generated. However, to encourage more renewable generation from a wider range of sources, the Government are proposing to change the RO so that renewable technologies are awarded differentiated levels of support; for example, offshore wind could receive 1.5 ROCs/1MWh and wave could receive two ROCs/1 MWh. The Government are currently consulting on these proposals.</p>

Where installed, MIDAS detects slow-moving or stationary traffic (from loops in the road) and sets safety messages on VMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.2/2">Supervisory staff working in these control centres assess the accuracy and timeliness of signs in real time. In addition, the performance of the Traffic Officer Service/RCCs and the performance of the NTCC are monitored monthly through performance indicators. In addition, the agency, through its road users' satisfaction survey, seeks customers' views on the accuracy of speed reduction and &quot;conditions ahead&quot; information, as well as whether the information has improved over the past 12 months.</p>
