	<p pid="a.275.2/1">There are ditch and half ditch management options available as part of entry-level stewardship (ELS) which include some provision for clearance. However, these would need to be adopted with other options from the scheme to achieve the necessary points total. Ditches managed by third parties, such as internal drainage boards, are not eligible. Moorland Grips are also ineligible. There is not a specific ditch and watercourse clearance option. The scheme's aim is primarily to secure widespread environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/2">Ditches in ELS may be cleaned only once during the agreement period, and then only half the length of the ditch may be cleaned. The exception is where vegetation needs to be removed from the bottom of a ditch for flood prevention. This may be cut annually between September and February. Any dredging or spoil must be levelled along the bank and vegetation allowed naturally to regenerate.</p>

The UK state pension is uprated for UK pensioners living overseas where there is a reciprocal social security agreement or a legal requirement to do so. The provisions on the non-uprating of UK state pensions for some pensioners living abroad have been the subject of litigation in the domestic courts, all of which found in favour of the Government. The issue is now the subject of an application for a hearing to the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/2">The cost of up-rating the UK state pension for recipients residing in the British Overseas Territories where state pension is frozen would be just under &pound;500,000<sup>1</sup> for 2008-09 on the assumption that the frozen pension is brought up to the current value and then uprated. The current estimate is that it would cost around &pound;440 million to bring all frozen rate pensions up to the current rate and this would be an ongoing cost increasing year on year.</p>

Safe harbor is recognised by the Information Commissioner as providing an adequate level of protection for the purposes of that principle.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.2/1">The Government did not make any proposals to amend the draft Convention on Access to Official Documents drawn up by the group of specialists on access to official documents (of which the UK is a member). The consensus among member states was that the draft convention should not become a &quot;dead letter&quot; convention, but one that established a set of principles governing the right of access to official documents which as many countries as possible could sign. The draft convention already contained a provision for a right of access to an appellate authority to challenge a denial of access to information, but the Government did seek to persuade the Steering Committee on Human Rights that the term &quot;denial&quot; should be interpreted broadly to encompass any situation where access to information had been made ineffective. No proposal was made to limit the areas in which a reservation may be made. In accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, a state can formulate a reservation to the convention on signature and ratification as long as it is compatible with the objective and purpose of the treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.6/1">The UK supports the work of the UN Human Rights Council's special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. For this reason, the UK voted against an amendment to a resolution renewing the mandate of the special rapporteur put forward by Pakistan, on behalf of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, at the seventh session of the Human Rights Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.6/2">We fully accept that limitations to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression may be permitted in certain circumstances under international human rights law. Other Human Rights Council mechanisms address this issue, including the newly agreed mandate of the special rapporteur on racism and religious freedom. But we were concerned at the way the amendment sought to shift the focus of the mandate away from looking at what states do in violation of the right to freedom of expression towards looking at what is appropriate for individuals to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.6/3">Unfortunately, the amendment was carried. This led the UK and other western states to abstain on the resolution as a whole. Nevertheless, the special rapporteur's mandate was renewed for a further three years. The UK will continue to support the work of this special rapporteur.</p>

Therefore, the time lag between the end of 2006 and publication of the results was a little over 14 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.3/2">There is a vast amount of data that needs to be collected and compiled in order for the NAEI to be produced, and unfortunately this takes time. A number of important datasets are required, such as the Environment Agency's pollution inventory. This provides emissions from around 2,000 major point sources in England and Wales and, therefore, extensive compilation is required following the deadline of the end of April 2007 for operators to supply data. The NAEI also relies heavily on the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform's digest of UK energy statistics, which is normally only made available at the end of July. The digest contains a comprehensive picture of energy production and use over the past five years and, therefore, this dataset takes a significant time to compile. There are also many other datasets required, some of which are not available until the autumn. The aim is to have all the input data available by the end of September at the latest, so that compilation can commence.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.3/3">It then takes approximately three months to compile the emissions inventory, as it is a complex task. The NAEI provides estimates of emissions to the atmosphere for 44 pollutant species and, in addition to the latest set of data being added to the inventory, the full-time series is updated to take account of improved data and any advances in methodology used to estimate the emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.8/1">Department for Transport guidance is that the value of time applied to the appraisal of schemes should vary by journey purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.8/2">For non-work purposes, everyone is assumed to have the same value of time on any mode. The following values are recommended: &pound;5.04 per hour for commuting and &pound;4.46 per hour for other journeys. The values for non-working time spent waiting for public transport is two and a half times the &quot;commuting&quot; and &quot;other&quot; values. Where walking and cycling is used as a means of interchange between modes of transport, the non-working values of time are doubled for that part of the journey. This reflects research suggesting people place a greater weight on these time savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.8/3">For work purposes, the value of time varies by mode reflecting average differences in the income of relevant business travellers. For example, values of time of &pound;36.96 per hour are applied to rail journeys and &pound;26.43 per hour for journeys by car. There was insufficient data to produce a specific value of time for working journeys by light rail when these figures were calculated. Promoters will either apply the average value across all modes (&pound;26.73 per hour) or, making a judgment informed by local circumstances, apply the values for other modes. This is reviewed by the department on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.8/4">All values are in market prices and expressed in average 2002 prices and values.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.5/1">The Transport Research Laboratory conducted two reviews of 20 mph zones in 1996 and again in 1998. The 1996 review found that 20 mph zones which incorporated traffic-calming measures achieved an average 9 mph reduction in vehicle speeds, annual accident frequency fell by 60 per cent and overall reduction in child accidents of 67 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.5/2">The 1998 review looked at wider issues in terms of vehicle speeds and included 20 mph zones and 20 mph limits where there was lesser or no traffic calming.

	<p pid="a.296.2/1">Both sets of packaging legislation in the UK, the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 and the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended), aim to minimise the amount of packaging used in the first place, and therefore reduce all types of packaging waste. The regulations also encourage reuse of packaging and increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/2">The Packaging Essential Requirements Regulations transpose into UK law the provisions of the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC) relating to the requirements which must be satisfied in order to be placed on the market. These regulations place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging shall be designed, produced and commercialised in such a way as to permit its reuse or recovery, including recycling, and to minimise its impact on the environment when packaging waste or residues from packaging waste management operations are disposed of.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/3">The requirements guarantee the free circulation of compliant packaging on the single market. For the UK to go beyond these requirements risks contravening the directive's single market goals, as any additional measure could be regarded as a barrier to trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/4">Although the Government cannot force producers to use specific materials in their packaging or products, we do encourage them to minimise packaging, use recyclable materials and take steps to ensure that these are recycled as far as possible at disposal. Almost all packaging is in fact recyclable, but whether material is actually recycled is ultimately determined by the local collection and reprocessing facilities available.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/5">The Government are also making it easier for local authorities to plan for, and put in place, the waste infrastructure that is needed on the ground in order to reprocess more recyclable materials.</p>
