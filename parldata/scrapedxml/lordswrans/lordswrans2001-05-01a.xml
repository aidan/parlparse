	<p pid="a.75.2/1">Asylum seekers detained in prison establishments can wear their own clothes, arrange to have clothes brought to them or be issued with prison clothes. National prison standards require that the clothing worn by immigration detainees held in prison, whether their own or prison issue, are suitable, tidy and clean and are adequate for warmth and health. Guidance on the frequency of clothing changes is given in the operating standards manual.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.2/2">In detention centres, Rule 12 of the Detention Centre Rules 2001 (SI 2001/238) provides that all detainees may wear clothing of their own if it is suitable and clean and shall be provided with clothing adequate for warmth and health. Detainees can also be provided with suitable and adequate clothing on their release. Facilities are also provided for the laundering of items of clothing. These standards are restated in operating companies' contracts which require that, if any detainee is unable to wear or provide their own clothing, they will be provided with a reasonable choice of clothing which is clean, in good repair and well fitting. The clothing provided should observe cultural and religious requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">The circumstances surrounding the decisions by the Minister for Prisons and Probation and his predecessor not to re-appoint certain members of the boards of visitors at Holloway and Standford Hill prisons and Haslar holding centre were different and each was considered on its merits. Nevertheless, an independent review of the events at Holloway prison did conclude that lessons should be drawn from them and as a result changes were made to the triennial review process. More recently, the Prisons Ombudsman, who was asked to review events at Standford Hill prison, has made further recommendations for change to the triennial review process, as has Sir Peter Lloyd's Working Group on the Review of the Boards of Visitors. Their recommendations, which include the proposal that members who are not being re-appointed should be advised of the reasons and given the opportunity to appeal against the decision, will be given very careful consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">My honourable friend the Home Office Minister of State (Mrs Roche) has announced today in another place that she has made an authorisation, in the light of evidence about the particular risks posed to the effective operation of our immigration controls by some members of certain ethnic or national groups, permitting the Immigration Service to discriminate, where necessary, in the examination of passengers belonging to the following ethnic or national groups: Tamils, Kurds, Pontic Greeks, Roma, Somalis, Albanians, Afghans and ethnic Chinese presenting a Malaysian or Japanese passport or any other travel document issued by Malaysia or Japan.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2">The decision on a passenger's entitlement to enter the United Kingdom will continue to be taken on the merits of the case in accordance with the Immigration Rules. The authorisation simply allows the Immigration Service to prioritise and manage its resources effectively in undertaking examinations necessary in order to reach that decision. In the majority of cases, any delay experienced by legitimate passengers in the groups concerned while passing through the control will be very short.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/3">The authorisation specifies the particular legal powers exercisable by immigration officers to which it relates. My honourable friend the Minister of State (Mrs Roche) will review the authorisation concerning discrimination on the basis of ethnic or national origin in the examination of passengers each month. A copy of the additional authorisation has been placed in the Library. Any future additional or amended authorisations will also be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/4">The Race Monitor to be appointed under Section 19E of the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) will report to Parliament via the Secretary of State on the likely effect of authorisations made by Ministers and on how they are operated in practice by officials. In addition, the Government are currently considering whether it would be feasible for them to publish information retrospectively about the use made of authorisations covering discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or national origin in the examination of passengers. The Government would be prepared to publish information justifying the making of such authorisations to the extent that publication would not prejudice the effective administration of immigration controls or other statutory provisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/5">Information on marriages and divorces is collected on the basis of the Registration District where the marriage was solemnised and the location of the court respectively rather than by residence. At present statistics on marriages are published by Registration District. These are available on StatBase, the National Statistics database, which can be accessed via the National Statistics website. Statistics on divorces are available from the ONS at national level only. These are also available on StatBase. The Court Service publishes the numbers of petitions filed and the numbers of decrees nisi and absolute granted by Court Circuit, although the information is available by individual court on request from the Court Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/6">Offences of domestic violence recorded by the police are not identifiable separately from other offences of violence and there is therefore no immediate prospect of figures of small geographical areas becoming routinely available.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/7">The scope to develop statistics will be the subject of further research in the context of the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from the National Statistician, Len Cook, dated 30th April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/3">As Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent questions asking: what is the estimated cost of the 2001 Census; what is the estimated accuracy of the head-count provided by the 1991 Census; how many prosecutions were launched for failure to complete the 1991 Census and what steps were taken to evaluate the costs and benefits of the 2001 Census prior to the decision to proceed with it (HL1819, HL1822, HL1823 and HL1824).</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/4">The total estimated cost for the 2001 Census in England and Wales over the 13-year period 1993-94 to 2005-06 is &pound;207 million. The Census is a devolved matter in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/5">The 1991 Census of Great Britain is estimated to have undercounted the overall total head count of residents by 2.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/6">In 1991 there were 354 prosecutions for refusal to complete a 1991 Census form in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/7">Following the 1991 Census the three United Kingdom Census Offices undertook a Census Policy Evaluation and Reappraisal (PEAR) in 1992 to review the future needs for statistical information on population and housing and the options for providing such information. The then Government's decision, announced on <phrase class="date" code="1992-10-13">13 October 1992</phrase>, for planning to proceed on the basis of a Census in 2001, followed the results of the PEAR review which confirmed that:</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/8" class="indent">(a) there would be a continuing need both in the public and private sectors for the type of statistical information on population and housing provided by the census over the period 1996-2016; and</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/9" class="indent">(b) there were no alternative sources for providing such information on a nationwide standard basis for local areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/10">In addition to this review, a major survey of census users was carried out in 1994 to obtain user opinion of the efficacy of the 1991 Census and requirements for 2001. Almost 1,000 users throughout the United Kingdom responded to the survey in one way or another, and the continuing need for statistical information on population and housing was once again clearly stated.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/11">Throughout 1997, the Census Offices conducted a consultation exercise among the census user community to ascertain the business cases for a range of topics that were being considered for inclusion in the 2001 Census. In summary, the criteria for accepting these topics were:</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/12" class="indent">that there was a clearly demonstrated need;</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/13" class="indent">that users' requirements could not adequately be met by information from other sources;</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/14" class="indent">that they should be shown, in tests, to have had no significantly adverse effect on the Census as a whole, particularly the level of public response; and</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/15" class="indent">that practicable questions could be devised to collect data which is sufficiently accurate to meet users' requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/16">This information, and the details of the Government's proposals for the 2001 Census and the uses to which the information to be collected would be put, were set out in a White Paper 'The 2001 Census of Population' (Cm 4253) published in March 1999, a copy of which is in the House of Lords Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.2/1">The five-digit box on the End of Year Summary P14 records only the amount of the employee's earnings above the earnings threshold up to and including the upper earnings limit. This is the amount of earnings on which the employee's national insurance contributions are payable.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/2">Because employers' national insurance contributions are payable on all earnings above the earnings threshold, it is possible for the total of employee's and employers' contributions payable to consist of seven digits (whole pounds) plus two-digits (pence).

	<p pid="a.82.5/1">Information on the destination of leavers is not available for 1997. Total outflows from the claimant count over the three years 1998 to 2000 were 9.4 million, of which, (a) 17,800 males aged 60 to 64 moved onto income support. A further 16,200 claimants left because they had reached state pension age. On (b), of those moving onto other benefits, 438,700 claimants moved onto incapacity benefit, 148,600 moved onto income support and 149,600 onto other benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/2">The 438,700 who moved onto incapacity benefit comprised just part of the 2.1 million total inflows onto incapacity benefit between 1998 and 2000. While total outflows from incapacity benefits were lower (at 1.7 million), the total numbers in receipt of these benefits fell between 1998 and 2000 due to large flows onto retirement pension that are not counted as outflows.</p>

These sanctions do not necessarily result in people leaving the claimant count. They can remain on the count even if they are not receiving any benefit. As there are advantages in remaining on the count, not everyone will leave when they are sanctioned.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.5/1">In order to protect the environment and human health, the Government's preferred hierarchy of disposal options for waste arising from the foot and mouth crisis starts with rendering; followed by incineration in authorised facilities; then disposal in licensed, engineered landfill; on-farm burial and burning; and finally off-farm mass burial or burning.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.5/2">Disposal of carcasses at landfill sites is regulated by the Environment Agency under the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. Only licensed landfill sites approved by the Environment Agency as being suitable for this purpose are being used and disposal of carcasses is carried out on the basis of a best practice document agreed between the Environment Agency, MAFF and the Environmental Services Association (ESA).</p>

It may be needed either to authorise changes to the conditions attached to an existing planning permission for a landfill site or for the excavation and use of land for the burial of dead farm animals. Decisions on whether permission is required, and for the determination of applications once made, are matters for the local planning authority concerned in the first instance.</p>

The Environment Agency is responsible for monitoring run-off and seepage from burning and burial sites. Both burning and burial sites are subject to EA risk assessment before permission is given to MAFF for such burning or burial to take place. Authorisation under the Groundwater Regulations will take into account the assessment of risks to controlled waters and to public and private water supplies. The regulations require &quot;requisite surveillance&quot; of groundwater in respect of an authorisation and the Environment Agency may therefore impose monitoring conditions. Such monitoring may be undertaken by the Environment Agency or MAFF. Local authorities advise on the risk of air pollution from burning and the Department of Health/local public health medical officers are also involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.5/3">At the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-30">30 March</phrase>, the PM/RC delegated authority to the European Programme Secretariat to enable it to deal with an accelerated application for &pound;1 million ERDF to match North West Development Agency funding for business support measures to assist the rural and tourism sectors. This application was in full compliance with the eligibility rules under the programme and was subsequently submitted by the NWDA and an offer issued by the secretariat.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.5/4">Under that project, business support agencies can obtain additional funding for an enhanced service to those sectors in the north west hit particularly hard by the drop in tourism and rural business.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.2/1">In 1995, the members of the Pesticide Incidents Appraisal Panel were: Dr J Osman, senior employment medical adviser in the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) Health Directorate (who Chairs the Panel; Dr N Bateman, then consultant physician at the Northern Regional Health Authority's Regional Drug and Therapeutic Centre; Dr V Murray, Occupational and Environmental Toxicologist, and Miss F Northall, Information Scientist, both at the London Centre of the National Poisons Information Service; Dr T Marrs, then senior medical officer in the Department of Health; Mr J Bouckley, HSE inspector; and Dr A Scott, senior employment medical adviser in the Employment Medical Advisory Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/2">Dr Bateman and Dr Murray resigned from the panel in the interval between 1995 and now Dr Murray's resignation means that presently there is a vacancy on the panel. Currently the other independent members are: Dr T Aw, Senior Lecturer in Occupational Medicine at the Institute of Occupational Medicine in the University of Birmingham; Dr S Bradberry, Medical Officer at the West Midlands Centre of the National Poisons Information Service; Dr. R Ferner, consultant physician at the West Midlands Centre for Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting; Miss Northall, jointly with Miss G Cullen, who is also an Information Scientist at the London Centre of the National Poisons Information Service; and Dr A Robertson, occupational hygienist and managing director of consulting at the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh. The Department of Health is now represented by Mr Jon Battershill, toxicologist; and Mr G. Walker has replaced Mr Bouckley. Dr Osman continues to chair the panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/3">There is no information on the interests of panel members for 1995 other than that the HSE and Department of Health members will have been subject to the normal rules of the Civil Service regarding such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/4">The profile of the panel's work has increased considerably in the recent past and, as a consequence, the need for statements of interest was considered at the panel's most recent meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-04">4 April 2001</phrase>. At that meeting it was agreed that it was indeed appropriate for members to declare interests and the Chair was charged with drawing up procedures based on those already used by high level government advisory bodies. The new procedures will be introduced as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.9/2">Direct snapshot comparisons between countries can be misleading as they do not reflect the strength of the underlying infrastructure or planning. We are well on track to deliver our commitment to make all government services available online by 2005. The ukonline.gov.uk portal and Government Gateway provide us with world-class foundations for doing that.</p>
