It has been instrumental in facilitating the negotiation of a ceasefire between two competing warlords in Northern Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.2/2">Four more PRTs are planned to be operational before the end of this year in Jalalabad (south east), Kandahar (south), Herat (west) and Charikar (near Kabul).

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-21a.162.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="162"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031021/text/31021w02.htm#31021w02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.162.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-04">4 October</phrase> my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary attended the opening session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in Rome. The conference has been convened to enable member states to make decisions on a future Constitutional Treaty in order to ensure that an expanded European Union is both more effective and more accountable. Its starting point is the draft treaty produced by the Convention on the Future of Europe, placed before the House this August as Command Paper 5897.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-09">9 September</phrase> we issued a White Paper (Cm 5934) setting out the Government's approach towards the IGC. As we said in that White Paper, the draft treaty is a good basis for starting the IGC negotiations. It consolidates existing treaties into a clearer and more comprehensible text, but one which does not alter the fundamental constitutional relationship between the member states and the Union. It provides for the more efficient decision making processes which will be needed in an enlarged Union of 25 members. For example, it proposes a new position of full-time Chair of the European Council, which will make the Union more efficient, by ending the frequent changes of direction and priority inherent in the rotating presidency system. It also reinforces the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, and the application of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/3">We do not regard the draft treaty as perfect: as for many other member states, there are some points in the text which we want to change and others which we need to examine in more detail. Final decisions at the IGC are by unanimity and, as our White Paper stated, we will only accept a final text which makes it clear that issues like tax, defence and foreign policy remain the province of the nation state.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/4">This first detailed session of the IGC, attended by Foreign Ministers, agreed that, when the Council of Ministers is legislating, its proceedings should be as open as possible. It also agreed that the provision in the draft treaty for establishing a legislative council, which we opposed, would be dropped.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/5">The European Council of 16 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-17">17 October</phrase> will continue discussion of the draft Treaty. In the mean time, Foreign Ministers met in the context of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-13">13 October</phrase>. We hope for agreement on a final text in sufficient time to allow for signature of a treaty, as provided in the conclusions of the Thessaloniki Council, as soon as possible after <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. In the interim we will of course continue to keep the House informed of progress, including through ministerial appearances at the IGC Standing Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.2/1">Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a further licence to export military list goods to Iraq. The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of &quot;arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions&quot;. Accordingly, Her Majesty's Government consider it appropriate to grant exemptions for the export of submachine guns and pistols which are to be used by private security firms contracted to provide close protection for employees of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in Iraq. The export is consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis against the UN embargo and consolidated criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.2/1">The British Council, although not a government department, receives a substantial grant-in-aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The council regularly organises or sponsors exhibitions overseas of works of art loaned from national galleries and private collections in the United Kingdom. It provides certain assurances or guarantees in respect of loss or damage while these works are on loan.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/2">In the six-month period ended <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-30">30 March 2003</phrase> the British Council provided such assurances to four national lenders and undertakings to 171 private lenders. The value of the contingent liabilities that remained outstanding as at <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-30">30 March 2003</phrase> in respect of national lenders was &pound;300,000 and &pound;3,703,862 in respect of private lenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.2/3">Following a recent review, HM Treasury, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British Council have agreed to a revision of the government art indemnities arrangements for artworks loaned to British Council exhibitions overseas. The revised scheme, which comes into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, has three main features. The maximum total liability available to the Council at any one time will be &pound;50 million (compared with the current &pound;70 million). The &pound;50 million limit does not include &quot;high value&quot; exhibitions (i.e. single exhibitions valued at &pound;30 million or over), which are treated separately. In the case of &quot;high value&quot; exhibitions the council will submit proposals to the UK's Public Diplomacy Strategy Board and HM Treasury for approval at least two years in advance. For all exhibitions the council will have to show evidence of having approached the government of the host country for cover and of having sought sponsorship for commercial insurance.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-21a.165.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="165"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031021/text/31021w03.htm#31021w03_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.165.5/1">I am pleased to be announcing today the allocation of nearly &pound;5 billion over the next two years to drive forward the Government's commitment to affordable housing. This includes the balance of the &pound;1 billion for key worker housing promised in the Communities Plan and funding to help ensure that all people living in social housing have a decent home by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/2">Key worker housing programme</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/3">Using housing initiatives to support recruitment and retention in key public services is a government priority. Over the summer the Government have worked to develop a successor programme to the Starter Homes Initiative. This will target resources on the key workers who can make the biggest possible contribution to improving frontline public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/4">The proposals I am announcing today represent the main features of the key worker housing programme to be run in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/5">The majority of support will continue to be directed towards our priority categories such as teachers and health workers. However, we also propose that the programme should be widened to apply to other public sector workers, such as social workers, where there is clear evidence of recruitment and retention problems. This is in response to the needs identified by the regional housing boards in their housing strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/6">Support will be provided to key workers through one of four simple options. Emphasis will be more on family homes rather than on starter homes as the evidence base compiled in recent months suggest that this is what the workers who are critical to service delivery need and want.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/7">The options are: Homebuy, &quot;Homebuy plus&quot;, shared ownership or intermediate renting. Homebuy will provide key workers with an interest-free equity loan equal to 25 per cent or more of the value of the property on the basis that the key worker pays back the same proportion of value of the property when he or she sells it. Homebuy plus will offer assistance on the same basis but with larger equity loans for a very small number of critically important key workers&mdash;for example, teachers who will become middle managers in key London schools. Shared ownership will allow a key worker to buy part of a property&mdash;at least 25 per cent&mdash;and pay rent on the remainder. Key workers will be able to increase their stake in the property when they can afford to do so. Intermediate renting offers the chance to rent a property at a rate between social rents and open market values.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/8">The Starter Homes Initiative has concentrated on helping key workers buy homes on the open market. The new scheme will shift the balance progressively towards new build schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/9">Through this programme we will ensure that support for key workers is better targeted and better tailored to meet both the recruitment and retention needs of our frontline public services and the needs of the employees crucial to delivering those services.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/10">Local Authority Social Housing Grant</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/11">I am pleased to announce increased funding for transitional arrangements following the abolition of local authority social housing grant. An additional &pound;75 million has been made available for debt-free authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/12">Local authorities social housing grant (LASHG) was abolished from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>. It was a mechanism which local authorities used to fund new or improved social housing through registered social landlords (RSLs). The authority made a loan from its own capital resources to the RSL. The loan was then repaid to the authority by the Housing Corporation. With-debt authorities were then required to set-aside the reimbursement to meet debt and credit liabilities. Debt-free authorities, on the other hand, were allowed to use the reimbursement for any purpose they wished&mdash;not necessarily housing. This meant debt-free authorities effectively obtained additional affordable housing at no cost to themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/13">As anticipated, the transitional funding was oversubscribed. Many of the bids submitted did not meet the bidding criteria. The Housing Corporation prioritised the bids in consultation with the government offices and I am today announcing approval for transitional local authority social housing grant schemes (LASHG). The transitional arrangements will lead to &pound;680 million spend on schemes and will provide 14,000 homes over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/14">The Housing Corporation will be notifying local authorities of the outcome of the bids.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/15">I should like to emphasise that local authorities remain able to support new social and key worker housing by housing associations. They will, however, no longer be reimbursed by the Housing Corporation&mdash;and, in particular, debt-free authorities will no longer be able to spend the money twice. I would encourage local authorities to continue to support the acquisition of new affordable housing wherever this is the best way to achieve the objectives set out in their housing strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/16">Regional Housing Boards</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/17">The Communities Plan set out a range of measures to deliver a step change in tackling the serious imbalances between the supply of and demand for housing in many parts of England. A key element of this was to ensure better integration between investment in housing, the planning system and economic development strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/18">In order to help to achieve this, the framework for determining the allocation of funds for housing investment is being substantially changed to focus resources on strategic housing priorities. Regional housing boards have been established to make recommendations to me on how the funds available to each region should be distributed between local authorities and housing associations and where they should be targeted. These recommendations reflect priorities set out in their regional housing strategies, which build on the existing housing statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/19">I have given careful consideration to their funding recommendations, regional housing strategies and other supporting information and I can now announce my conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/20">The task the boards faced&mdash;balancing the competing demands within the region while at the same time supporting delivery of a small number of key national priorities and targets&mdash;was a difficult one.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/21">I am pleased to say that I am accepting the broad thrust of the boards' recommendations for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 and their regional spending priorities. In most regions the recommendations will be accepted in their entirety. There have been further discussions with the boards for the London, East and South-East regions. These have taken into account the increased resources now available for transitional local authority social housing grant and the additional homes we expect English Partnerships to provide via innovative new schemes, neither of which the regional boards were aware of at the time they made their recommendations. As a result the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been able to increase the funding made available for key worker housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/22">A table giving details of each region's allocation will be placed in the Library. Details of the housing allocations for individual local authorities will be announced in four to six weeks' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/23">A competitive bidding round for the funds available for new affordable housing schemes is being launched by the Housing Corporation; the results will be announced by March.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/24">I have been impressed by what the boards, local authorities and other stakeholders have achieved in a short space of time. There is clearly a real appetite for a strengthened regional role on housing and for finding new ways of working to improve effectiveness of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/25">It is important to build on this&mdash;both to increase and strengthen partnership working and innovation and to develop regional and, where appropriate sub-regional, housing strategies. Sub-regional housing strategies require a stronger analysis of current and future housing needs. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister always recognised that the short time available would limit the analysis this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.5/26">Central government will play its part. Work is already under way to evaluate the first round of the new arrangements and will include feedback from the regional housing boards. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consider carefully what changes are needed.hp (21-23)</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/4">The proposals to modernise civil registration include the linkage of a person's marriage and death record to their birth record, thus creating a through life record. Changes to legislation are necessary and are being taken forward using the provisions in the Regulatory Reform Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/5">The Department for Work and Pension is notified each week of all deaths registered in England and Wales. There are no plans to include the national insurance number in the information collected at death registration.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.5/1">Culture Online is a new project, led by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which aims to use new technology to increase access to and participation in the arts and culture. Digital technologies B including, but not limited to, the Internet, give us the opportunity to present cultural resources and activities in different formats and allow people to use and add to them in new and exciting ways. Projects involving interactive games, audio and video footage, and digital cameras and editing software and tools can improve the quality of education and bring in new users.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/2">Culture Online is commissioning digital educational materials from cultural and new media organisations. We are about to commission the first seven projects (details of which will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses). They involve a range of organisations including local and regional museums and theatres, the V&amp;A, Kew Gardens and the National Theatre. Just over a half of all projects will be aimed at school age children. The rest will be aimed at adult learners, particularly those who may not traditionally have been involved in the arts and culture. The first projects will start in November and will be accessible by the public next year. Projects will be available through participating organisations' websites, the Culture Online website (<a href="http://www.cultureonline.gov.uk">www.cultureonline.gov.uk</a>) and the DfES Curriculum Online portal.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.0/1">Data extracted from the State Veterinary Service (SVS) database show that, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-31">31 August 2003</phrase>, the overall number of overdue tests stood at 3,134, down almost 200 tests from <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-31">31 July 2003</phrase>. The current number of overdue TB tests is below the level prior the onset of the foot and mouth disease outbreak of 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.0/2">Almost 30 per cent. of these 3,134 tests have been overdue less than one month. the nature of TB testing is such that most TB tests are completed on or shortly after their due date. Delays in the submission of test results from veterinary practices can result in those tests appearing as outstanding on the date that the statistics were compiled, even if the herds in question had already been tested.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.0/3">Another 12 per cent. of these tests have been overdue by six months or more. All those herds have been under movement restrictions at least since last April. Despite the gradual reduction in the number of overdue TB tests there is no room for complacency. With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-01">1 October</phrase>, and on the first working day of each month thereafter, the SVS is placing under restriction any herds in which a TB test becomes overdue by more than three months.</p>

VED Evasion: Draft regulations introducing a regime of &quot;continuous registration&quot; under powers taken under the Finance Act 2002 Budget were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-15">15 October</phrase>. Subject to the approval of Parliament, they come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-30">30 November 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.6/2">The effect of the regulations is that in the event of a vehicle keeper failing to relicence their vehicle by the due date they will be liable to an &pound;80 fixed penalty reducing to &pound;40 if paid within 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.6/3">The fundamental change from the present position is that action may now be taken in respect of unlicensed vehicles on the face of the vehicle registration records held by the DVLA. Thus it will no longer be necessary as at present, for the vehicle to be seen on the road in order for action to be taken. Stronger penalties may result where the vehicle continues to be unlicensed.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.6/4">These measures should ensure that there is a greater incentive for motorists to renew their tax discs by the due date and to inform DVLA when a vehicle changes hands. There will be a major publicity campaign to explain these measures to motorists starting in January 2004.</p>
