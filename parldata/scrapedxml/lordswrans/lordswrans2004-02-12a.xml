Much of the detailed information requested by Lord Christopher was not held centrally within the Cabinet Office and officials had to consult the Ministry of Defence. The Christmas recess also intervened. The process therefore took much longer than is desirable and for this I apologise. Cabinet Office staff draft Answers to Parliamentary Questions as part of their normal day-to-day duties.

	<p pid="a.172.5/2">The data transferred are those contained on the disclosure application form. The form is scanned, encrypted and then transferred via a secure link to a site in India. On receipt of the scanned image, the data are entered onto a system compatible with those used by the CRB to process disclosure applications. On completion the data are again encrypted and transferred back to the UK via the secure link. The data are retained in India only for the duration of time taken to input. Thereafter, the data are destroyed. The overseas personnel involved in the data input are fully trained in data security and privacy and abide by a strict code of conduct.</p>

It was decided in December 2002 that this section should no longer be used and customers were informed in January 2003. The section was formally revoked by the Police Act (Criminal Records) (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2003 with effect from February 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/5">It is the responsibility of a registered body to verify the applicant's identity using guidelines issued by the CRB. All registered bodies have been informed that applicants no longer need to supply bank details. They have been made aware via both the disclosure website and the customer newsletter. Applicants themselves are made aware via the application guidance notes, which clearly state that there is no longer a requirement to supply bank details.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.2/1">It has at all times been the intention that, in terms of data protection, security and other aspects, the arrangements for processing data should entail no material increase to the risk of misuse of data. Consequently, before agreement was given for any data to be processed in India, the site was visited by senior officials from the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), who were fully satisfied that this was the case. The main CRB contract, (signed in August 2000) requires that the CRB's private sector partner, Capita, and any sub-contractor of Capita must comply with the Data Protection Act 1998; and that Capita may not enter into a sub-contracting arrangement without the permission of the CRB.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.2/2">The CRB undertakes a wide range of checks and audits on all systems and processes to satisfy the security expectations of the Data Protection Act 1998. In addition to daily routine auditing of CRB systems, the CRB undertakes yearly security accreditation and BS7799 compliance and has undergone a full data protection adequacy audit. Where processing is conducted by a data processor overseas, the same security standards are applied. Additionally, all staff members both within the CRB agency and within organisations processing data on behalf of the CRB agency receive regular data protection and security training.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.2/1">For planning purposes, the provision of land for burial is currently considered to be a local, rather than regional, land use issue. The government consultation paper on burial law and policy therefore seeks views on whether the provision of burial grounds should be linked to the local core strategy development plan, outlined in planning policy statement 12: local development frameworks. Such plans should cover a period of at least 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/2">I understand that, due to the comprehensive nature of Clause 1(2) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, it will not require a separate provision for burial grounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.2/1">Defra's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate is responsible for inspecting plants and plant produce under a plant quarantine surveillance programme covering both imports from third countries and consignments moving in trade. But resources are finite and industry must share responsibility for the ongoing surveillance of imported material (which may not exhibit symptoms of pests or diseases at the time of inspection) and must exercise caution in choosing suppliers when importing plants and produce to ensure that they are not importing known or unknown pests and diseases. Others, such as the general public and transport operators, also have responsibilities in ensuring that they do not bring pests and diseases into the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/2">Powers to prevent the import of plants and plant products that may contain non-indigenous pathogens are contained in the Plant Health Order 1993. This provides an inspector with a number of options including serving a notice on the importer or other person requiring that such plants are destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/3">The Government consider that so far as possible the financial risks associated with the destruction of imported or other plants that host non-indigenous pathogens should be borne by the parties concerned.

	<p pid="a.196.0/1">DVLA would very much like to be able to offer customers the ability to pay vehicle excise duty by debit or credit card at local offices like Stanmore.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/2">The agency is currently piloting a scheme to accept debit card payments for vehicle excise duty. If it is successful it will be introduced across the DVLA local office network including Stanmore.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/3">DVLA cannot absorb the commission charges levied by credit card companies but is currently investigating options for the recovery of these costs.</p>
