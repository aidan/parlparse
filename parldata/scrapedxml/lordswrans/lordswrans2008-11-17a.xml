He was explaining that there needs to be a greater recognition that Afghanistan's problems will not be solved by military means alone. Any requests for an increase in force levels will be considered very carefully in light of developments on the ground, especially in the context of our efforts to improve governance and take forward reconstruction and stabilisation in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/3">Recent polling by the Asia Foundation, while finding concerns about security and the direction of progress on their country, also found that a large majority of Afghans are content with their Government.

	<p pid="a.167.2/1">Any request for funding for a treatment that the National Health Service does not normally pay for would have to be considered on an exceptional basis by the relevant primary care trust. This includes circumstances where a patient who has been funding additional treatment privately runs out of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2">The draft revised guidance published by the department on NHS patients who wish to pay for additional private care, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-04">4 November 2008</phrase>, makes it clear that &quot;patients who pay for private care in these circumstances should not be put at any advantage or disadvantage in relation to the NHS care they receive. They are entitled to NHS services on exactly the same basis of clinical need as any other patient&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-04">4 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced a range of measures to widen access to drugs on the NHS, which will, in fact, reduce the demand from patients for additional private care (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-11-04.131"><I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 131</phrase>). For those few patients who may still wish to buy additional private care, the draft revised guidance makes it clear that no patient should lose his or her entitlement to NHS care as a result of choosing to purchase private care separately. The draft revised guidance emphasises that the NHS should never subsidise private care with public money, as this would breach core NHS principles. It also says that patients' agreement to the likely costs should be sought in advance of any private care being provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/4">The Secretary of State's announcement was in response to the report, <I>Improving A</I><I>ccess to </I><I>M</I><I>edicines for NHS </I><I>P</I><I>atients</I>, by Professor Mike Richards, the National Clinical Director for Cancer, which can be found at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_089927">www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_089927</a>.
