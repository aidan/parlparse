	<p pid="a.249.3/1">Departmental performance against government sustainable operations targets, including water consumption, has been published in annual sustainable development in government reports (STiG). The Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), the independent watchdog, published its latest SDiG report in December 2005. It covered the reporting period April 2004 to March 2005 and is available at: <a href="http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/watchdog">www.sd-commission.org.uk/watchdog</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/2">According to the SDC's report, seven government departments met the 2004 water consumption target. These departments were: the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; the Department for Constitutional Affairs; the Department of Health; the Inland Revenue; Her Majesty's Customs and Excise; the Department for International Development; and the Office for National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June 2006</phrase>, the Prime Minister launched a set of intentionally challenging sustainable operational targets for the government estate. They set an example to the rest of the public sector, businesses and consumers and will catalyse efforts to improve the way the Government manage their land and buildings sustainably. The new targets relevant to water consumption are as follows. Departments are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/4">reduce water consumption by 25 per cent on the office and the non-office estate by 2020, relative to 2004-05 levels; and</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/5">reduce water consumption to an average of 3m<sup>3</sup> per person per year for all new office builds or major office refurbishments.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.5/1">My department has received four letters from justices of the peace summoned for jury service about the combined commitment of being a JP and a juror. All four were received within the first year of JPs and others being eligible to serve. This does not include applications for excusal or deferral from JPs summoned for jury service. Any such applications, made to either the Jury Central Summoning Bureau or Crown Court, would be dealt with on their individual merits. In the case of a self employed magistrate, the effect of jury service on both their work and their ability to sit as a magistrate would be taken into account in coming to a decision. A circular was sent to advisory committees and sub-committees on justices of the peace on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March 2006</phrase> clarifying a number of points about magistrates summoned for jury service. It followed a similar circular in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.3/1">In the Ministry of Defence letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June</phrase> to the president of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal, the fourth paragraph states: &quot;As you are aware, the Ministry of Defence welcomed the decision by the Pensions Appeal Tribunal in the case brought by Mr Martin. The Tribunal's decision accepted the use of the umbrella term Gulf War Syndrome for accepted conditions which are causally linked to service in the 1990-91-Gulf War. The Secretary of State recognised that some veterans were concerned that the link between their ill-health and their service in the Gulf had not been sufficiently acknowledged. The Tribunal's decision in Martin gave a formal means of providing such recognition and it was for that reason, not least, that the Ministry of Defence welcomed it&quot;. The then veterans' Minister, in his Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November 2005</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-11-24.129"><I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 129WS</phrase>), hoped that this formal recognition would help to provide an element of closure for those who have sought this acknowledgement of their ill-health. The extract from the <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June</phrase> letter was made in the context of the earlier Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.3/2">Moreover, in the spirit of helping to provide closure and acting in good faith, the Veterans' Agency in its notification letters to Mr McGreevy went further than required by including previously accepted conditions, which were linked to his Gulf service, under the umbrella term of Gulf War syndrome. While the <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June</phrase> letter accepts that this was done in error, it nevertheless indicates the Ministry of Defence's willingness to assist in the closure process.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.5/1">The sponsorship of the Museum of London, the Horniman Museum and Gardens and the Geffrye Museum was the subject of a similar consultation exercise in 1998, when the Greater London Authority (GLA) was in the process of being established. The result of the consultation was that it was decided not to transfer responsibility for these museums to the GLA. However, it was left open to review the matter at a later date when the GLA had been given time to develop its role and functions.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.3/1">We are unable to give a value to the timber imports identified as illegally felled that enter the UK as timber imports are not identified as legal or illegal at ports of entry.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.3/2">The UK Government take the trade in illegally felled timber very seriously and are taking a range of actions to address it. The EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation adopted last year enables member states to enter into partnership agreements with developing countries and provide them with assistance to tackle illegal logging. This assistance will include a licensing system designed to identify products as legal and license them for export to the EU. It will be reinforced by powers for HM Customs to take a range of actions relating to unlicensed products from partner countries; this will allow member states to prohibit the import of illegal timber from those countries into the EU for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.3/3">The UK Government recognise that government purchasing policies can also send a strong signal to the market and timber suppliers. Since 2000, the UK Government have committed central departments to seek to procure products made from timber that has been legally harvested and grown in a sustainably managed forest or plantation.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.3/4">At the international level, the UK is also working with other major timber consuming countries. Most recently, this has included following up G8 commitments to tackle illegal logging made at the G8 environment and development ministerial in 2005, and establishing a joint working group on forestry with China.</p>

	<p pid="a.272.2/1">According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (2005) statistics, global deforestation, mainly due to conversion of forests to agricultural land, continues at a rate of 13 million hectares per year. At the same time, forest planting and natural expansion of forests have reduced the net loss of forest area. The net global change in forest area in the period 2000-2005 is estimated at -7.3 million hectares per year (an area about the size of Panama or Sierra Leone), down from -8.9 million hectares per year in the period 1990-2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/2">Estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that tropical deforestation is currently responsible for about 20 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Only approximately one twentieth of this is offset by reforestation in temperate regions. Tropical forests act as a significant carbon sink, helping to limit the rate of rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide to less than 50 per cent of the rate of emissions. Removal of rainforests weakens this buffering and exposes us more to the effect of our emissions. An accelerated rise of carbon dioxide from both an increased source and a weakened sink implies an accelerated rate of global warming.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/3">Rainforest destruction also affects climate through changes in other greenhouse gases, organic soot particles and through processes such as water recycling, which have local and global impacts. For example, rainforest loss can increase the concentration of ozone, another greenhouse gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/4">Aerosols are released by burning forests and can modify temperature and local rainfall regimes. Rainforests recycle rain water back to the atmosphere, which maintains their own moist climate and also affects neighbouring regions; deforestation can modify atmospheric circulation and rainfall across the globe.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.3/1">DfID's representative in Helmand is based in the provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in Lashkar Gah, Helmand province. The PRT also contains representatives from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the military and, arriving shortly, the British Embassy drugs team. These four representatives work together as the Helmand executive group, which is responsible for the delivery of the UK joint plan for Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/2">DfID leads in advising the civilian and military members of the Helmand PRT on the development implications of all interventions in the province. For example, the PRT supports a number of quick impact projects (QIPs) designed to demonstrate immediate progress to the people of the province and to help build a platform for longer-term activity. DfID's advice helps maximise the developmental impact of these projects and ensures that they fit with national government priorities. The Helmand executive group jointly supervises identification, selection, implementation and monitoring of QIPs, which is funded from a range of departmental budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/3">In June, DfID increased the funding available for QIPs by &pound;3 million, but the advisory role of the DfID representative remains the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.278.5/1">The Low Carbon Buildings Programme is providing &pound;80 million to reduce upfront capital costs for a range of microgeneration technologies, building on the support already provided under the PV Major Demonstration Programme and the Clear Skies Initiative. Uptake of the grants offered to date indicates that the level of support has given sufficient incentive to those considering investing in microgeneration for their premises.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.2/1">The information is not available in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/2">The White Paper <I>Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system</I> (Cm 6841) includes proposals to ensure more carers are able to build up better state pensions. To do this we are proposing to introduce a new carer's credit for those reaching state pension age from 2010. It would be available for relevant weeks of caring within a tax year allowing a person to build entitlement to basic state pension (BSP) and state second pension (S2P) if they are caring: for 20 hours or more a week; and for one or more persons receiving the middle or highest rate of disability living allowance care component, attendance allowance, or constant attendance allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/3">We have proposed to link the new carer's credit to those caring for someone in receipt of specified disability benefits. We estimate that around 70,000 people a year could gain a credit for BSP from this proposal, and over half of these will be women. The new credit should also mean around 110,000 more women and 50,000 more men will be accruing entitlement to S2P.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/4">We estimate that this may leave around 60,000 people in 2010 who report themselves to be caring for 20 hours or more who may not be accruing BSP through paid contributions or credits, including the new carer's credit. The equivalent figure for S2P is around 180,000 people. It is not possible to break down these figures further by the individual benefits received by the person being cared for.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/5">The potential costs of awarding these extra people a credit for BSP and S2P build up slowly over time. They could reach some &pound;200 million in 2030, over and above expenditure on the current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/6">With existing data sources, it is difficult reliably to estimate the intensity of care that someone in receipt of a disability benefit such as incapacity benefit or the disability premium in income support, may be receiving from a particular carer. It is also unclear what care needs, if any, those in receipt of these benefits might have.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/7">For the purposes of estimating the cost of the new carer's credit in the White Paper, it was assumed that all those in receipt of the middle or higher rate care component of AA/DLA, or CAA, would have a carer providing more than 20 hours' care per week. Although this is not a precondition for the receipt of those benefits, entitlement provides a clear indication that the recipient has a significant level of care needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/8">As with any reform, the timing of change to the state pension system involves striking a balance: to achieve fair outcomes for tomorrow's pensioners, while ensuring that the transition from the current arrangements is affordable, avoids complexity and is delivered successfully. Backdating the carers credit to make it available on the basis of self certification for past periods of caring activity would not be feasible; to do so would be intrusive and forfeit any checks and balances in the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.2/9">It is not possible to make accurate estimates. However, assuming that all those eligible for the proposed carer's credit from 2010 were automatically awarded five years-worth of backdated credits, costs of the new carer's credit could reach around &pound;200 million, over and above expenditure on the current system in 2030.</p>
