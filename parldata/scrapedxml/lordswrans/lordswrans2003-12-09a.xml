	<p pid="a.54.8/1">Following the appeal of Sally Clark and the acquittal of Trupti Patel, I established a group comprising the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Home Office and other relevant agencies to consider whether any cases in which Dr Williams has given important evidence require a more in depth review.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.8/2">On the <phrase class="date" code="">28 July</phrase>, the inter-departmental group held its first meeting. Progress was made in two areas. How previous cases in which Dr Alan Williams conducted a post mortem were to be identified and what factors would be used to select the cases on which the group should concentrate.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.8/3">Following that meeting, work commenced immediately on the identification of cases. Several agencies assisted in respect of this process, with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service taking the lead. The group set a deadline of mid-September for the conclusion of that process. By that date, approximately 50 previous cases had been identified, which dated back between five and seven years. These cases all involved charges of murder, manslaughter or infanticide where Dr Williams had been instructed by the police to conduct the post mortem and which had resulted in a conviction.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.8/4">The cases themselves are now being reviewed. An experienced member each of the Metropolitan Police and of the Crown Prosecution Service are conducting the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.8/5">This work is continuing. It is anticipated that the results of the initial review will be considered early next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.8/6">The group is also considering whether the exercise of reviewing cases should be extended to those involving Professor Meadow.

Representatives of local authorities have not produced any full or overall cost estimate of the regime for England and Wales, but have indicated where they believe the Government's estimate would fail to fully recover their costs. We are therefore currently considering whether our estimate requires revision in the light of the information and material provided by representatives of the local authorities.

They would only be available at disproportionate cost, would require the yield from sporting activities to be inferred from across a range of more broadly defined leisure activities and would require assumptions about tax incidence that could render the results misleading.</p>

Such industries are characterised by potentially dangerous operations involving complex management control arrangements and complex technical processes. Road transport is not the same. The main hazard is human error, which road transport legislation is designed to minimise.</p>

In addition, we are promoting employment among those aged 50 and over and helping people over pensionable age to remain in work where they wish to do so. Our Age Positive Campaign is encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practises, and studies show that there has already been a marked reduction in the number of companies using age in recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/3">The Department for Work and Pensions does not produce projections of future levels of employment; however, recent reseach by the department shows that a fifth (33 per cent of women and 10 per cent of men) of the workforce aged 50 and over plan to continue working beyond state pension age. The report of this research, Factors Affecting the Labour Market Participation of Older People, was published in November and a copy is available in the Library.</p>
