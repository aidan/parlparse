Officials at the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong have been informed by the Nepalese Consulate-General there that some such certificates have been issued in error.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.8/1">The Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) regulates procedures applied to protected animals for experimental and other scientific purposes that may cause the animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. Protected animals are defined under the Act to include any living vertebrate other than man which has reached a specified developmental stage. For mammals, this is when half the gestation or incubation period for the relevant species has elapsed.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.8/2">An animal embryo altered for an experimental or other scientific purpose by the introduction of one or more human cells would be governed by the provisions of the ASPA once it reached the halfway point of gestation or incubation because for the purposes of the Act it would be considered to be a living vertebrate other than man. The subject matter of the ASPA is a reserved matter under Part II B7 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.8/3">Section 1(3) (b) of the ASPA enables the Secretary of State by order to alter the stage of development at which an animal attains protected status under the ASPA, therefore allowing an animal in its embryonic form to become a protected animal and subject to the regulation of the Act. In the light of that power, scientific procedures applied to animals at an earlier developmental stage are covered by the reservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.8/4">We therefore take the view that the creation of an animal embryo altered for an experimental or other scientific purpose by the introduction of one or more human cells falls within the subject matter of the ASPA for the purposes of the Scotland Act 1998 and is a reserved matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.11/1">Estimating the precise impact of buy-to-let on the housing market is difficult and there is little evidence available. The buy-to-let market has expanded rapidly in the past 10 years since the creation of dedicated buy-to-let mortgages in 1996, rising from 6 per cent of the private rented stock in 2000 to almost 35 per cent in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.11/2">Despite this increase in buy-to-let, the overall size of the private rented sector has remained relatively stable and has only experienced a slight increase as a proportion of total stock from about 10 per cent to 12 per cent. There has been an increase in the proportion of private rented sector properties that are buy-to-let, implying that the increase in buy-to-let mortgages is a reflection of a change in the composition of supply within the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.11/3">No specific research has been undertaken on the impact of buy-to-let on the amount of housing left empty or anti-social behaviour. The National Affordable Housing and Planning Unit is considering further analysis of the impact of buy-to-let on affordability.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.2/1">The Common Travel Area (CTA), consisting of the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland, was put on a statutory footing by the Immigration Act 1971 which states that a person's arrival in or departure from within the CTA is not subject to control and a person does not require leave to enter. This is subject to exceptions provided for by Section 9(4) of the Immigration Act 1971 and the Immigration (Control of Entry through Republic of Ireland) Order 1972 which include where a deportation order has been made or where there are national security grounds. Travellers falling within one of these categories must obtain leave to enter despite travelling within the CTA. Guidance can be found at <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/lawandpolicy/immigrationrules/partl">http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/lawandpolicy/immigrationrules/partl</a>. Persons subject to immigration control entering the Republic of Ireland from outside the CTA would be examined by the Irish immigration authorities and checked against watchlists, including data provided from the UK. The UK and Republic of Ireland work closely together at all levels to maintain the appropriate checks within the CTA and will continue to do so in the future. The Border and Immigration Agency, UK police and the Garda National Immigration Bureau work collaboratively and run regular intelligence-led operations to counter potential risks to the intra-CTA borders.</p>
