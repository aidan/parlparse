	<p pid="a.215.11/1">Airbus Military has announced a series of delays in the development and production of the challenging A400M programme, and has recently indicated that first deliveries to customer nations will be three years after the achievement of first flight of the A400M prototype. Airbus has indicated that first flight will occur no earlier than the second half of 2009, and has also announced a slowdown in its production plans. Early A400M production aircraft will be delivered to some of our partner nations and therefore the first UK delivery would occur at least six months after Airbus delivers the first A400M. This suggests that initial UK deliveries cannot start before 2013.</p>

We retain the scope to provide a refuelling capability from the A400M in future, should we determine that additional capacity is required.

	<p pid="a.218.5/1">Information about the procedure for children and study is available on the UKBA website at www@ukba.gov.uk.

	<p pid="a.218.5/2">Where the child's primary reason for coming to the UK is for education, the Immigration Rules do not permit access to state education. Children under 18 who wish to come to the UK to undertake a period of study for more than six months must fully satisfy, and enter under, the main student rules. Children under 16 may only qualify on this basis if they have been accepted for studies at an independent fee-paying school which meets the requirements of the Education Act 1944.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.5/3">There is, however, currently a concession outside the Immigration Rules which permits non-EEA students aged under 18 to attend a state-maintained school for up to a year as part of an organised exchange. Provided appropriate arrangements have been made, and all the criteria met, leave may be granted outside the Immigration Rules for the duration of the exchange, up to a maximum of 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.2/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) offers two different types of checks, standard and enhanced. Standard checks are primarily for posts that involve working with children or vulnerable adults. They may also be issued for people entering certain professions, such as members of the legal and accountancy professions. Standard checks contain the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/2">Convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings held in England and Wales on the Police National Computer (PNC); most of the relevant convictions in Scotland and Northern Ireland may also be included.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/3">If the position applied for does involve working with children or vulnerable adults, the standard check may, depending on the specific nature of the duties to be undertaken, also contain:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/4">information from the Protection of Children Act list (PoCA); information from the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list (PoVA); and information held by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) under Section 142 of the Education Act 2002 of those considered unsuitable for, or banned from, working with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/5">Enhanced checks are for posts involving a far greater degree of contact with children or vulnerable adults. In general, the type of work will involve regularly caring for, supervising, training or being in sole charge of such people. Examples include a teacher, scout or guide leader. Enhanced checks are also issued for certain statutory purposes such as gaming and lottery licences.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/6">Enhanced checks contain the same information as standard checks but with the addition of any locally held police force information considered relevant to the job role, by chief police officer(s).</p>

	<p pid="a.220.5/1">Each code is a balanced set of requirements aimed at the risks faced by the vessels. Differences in requirements also occur as fishing codes use length as a measure of risk whereas the workboat code uses distance from a safe haven as the measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.5/2">The principal differences between codes cover stability, liferafts and construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.5/3">Workboats need a stability assessment, the form of which varies depending on the vessel's area of operation and carriage of passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.5/4">New fishing vessels of 12-15m must be constructed in accordance with the stability requirements contained in Merchant Shipping Notice 1770&mdash;The Code of Practice for the Construction and Use of 15m Length Overall to less than 24m Registered Length Fishing Vessels. Other small fishing vessels are not required to have a stability assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.5/5">Workboats and fishing vessels of 12-15m are required to carry liferafts for the number of persons onboard. Other small fishing vessels are recommended to carry liferafts.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.5/6">It should be noted that the workboat code applies only to workboats operating at sea. Workboats of under 12.2m in length on inshore waters (categorised waters) are not required to carry liferafts. Many fishing vessels of under 12m fish in such inshore or inland waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.5/7">In many respects the construction requirements placed on small fishing vessels, particularly in the area of construction to the seafish construction rules, are higher than those placed on workboats.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.0/1">The principal role in providing security for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in London rests with the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), though other police services such as the City of London Police and the British Transport Police (BTP) will also have an important role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/2">Other police forces will have a role in security for Olympic venues outside London. In addition, organisations such as the Security Service, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and the UK Border Agency (UKBA) have a role in security as part of their wider duties. The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is responsible for construction of venues and infrastructure, which will include security elements.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/3">A wider section of other public bodies are involved in security preparations for the Games at a local and national level. Private organisations such as the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) and private security firms also have an important role to play in overall security arrangements.</p>

We look forward to early implementation of these instruments, which we believe should safeguard the rights of minorities in Pakistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.230.2/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Policing, Crime and Security, Vernon Coaker, has met with the National Black Police Association (NBPA), as part of his assessment of minority-ethnic recruitment, retention and progression in the police service. The assessment together with an ambitious action plan was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-20">20 November 2008</phrase>. Although no representation has been made on this particular issue, we will continue to work with the NBPA to take forward the action plan and through this to promote equality and diversity in the police.</p>
