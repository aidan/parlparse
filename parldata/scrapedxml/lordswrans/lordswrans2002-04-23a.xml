We consider the two agreements to be compatible and they need to be implemented in a mutually supportive way. It is for the member states to ensure their national laws achieve this.

	<p pid="a.25.5/1">The content of health records is the responsibility of the individual health professionals who create those records, subject to the requirements of regulatory bodies and law that records be adequate for purpose. Only the courts have the power to require health professionals to delete information from records. In the absence of such a direction from the courts, both the General Medical Council and the Medical Defence Union advise health professionals not to delete information for medical and legal reasons. Although the department has not published guidance on this issue, we accept the view of the General Medical Council as being authoritative.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/2">A health record is essentially a record of clinical opinion at a point in time in the face of the evidence available. While subsequent evidence or conflicting clinical opinion may lead to the conclusion that the original opinion is incorrect, it remains the only record of a health professional's thoughts and actions. Clearly it is in the interests of society generally, and of health professionals individually, for there to be a complete and true record of the opinions that underpin clinical interventions of all kinds. A claim for negligence or a complaint could be made many years after an episode of care has concluded and the medical record is key evidence in determining whether a health professional has performed acceptably.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.2/1">Responsibility for this matter has been delegated under the terms of the framework document to the Government Car and Despatch Agency. I have asked its Chief Executive, Mr Nick Matheson, to write to the noble Lord.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Nick Matheson, Chief Executive of the Government Car and Despatch Agency, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-23">23 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/3">Lord Macdonald of Tradeston, Minister for the Cabinet Office, has asked me in my capacity as the Chief Executive responsible for the Government Car and Despatch Agency to reply to your Parliamentary Question about the cost of tolls imposed by the Greater London Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/4">I am currently assessing the likely impact of congestion charging upon the work of the Government Car Service. My initial conclusions are that the introduction of the charge will not lead to a significant change in the use of ministerial cars because all Ministers and their private offices are located within the congestion charge zone.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/5">Cars and drivers are allocated for the use of Ministers and their private offices. In addition to ministerial duties, they are also used for several other purposes such as the movement of documents and for use by officials as directed by the ministerial private office.</p>
