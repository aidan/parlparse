</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.69.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2" qnum="HL2856">What pressure they have exerted on the Rwandan Government to make women victims of rape by Hutu militiamen a priority for medical and welfare programmes.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-06-16a.69.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040616/text/40616w01.htm#40616w01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.69.2/1">DfID is addressing this issue at two levels: first, we are helping the Government of Rwanda to put in place the right framework to make health and welfare services available to all Rwandans who need them; and, secondly, we are supporting the Government of Rwanda to meet the specific needs of genocide survivors.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">DfID is concerned about the particular needs of genocide survivors, including the victims of sexual violence. Accordingly, DfID is providing direct assistance to the survivors of the genocide through the Government of Rwanda's Survivors' Fund (FARG). DfID has committed &pound;850,000 to enable FARG to broaden the welfare services it provides to include advice and counselling on issues around HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">DfID has also committed &pound;200,000 to provide healthcare, including provision of anti-retroviral therapy, for witnesses and others called by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Many of these witnesses were victims of rape during the genocide.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/4">Out of the appalling legacy of genocide, the Government of Rwanda have, over the past 10 years, made tremendous progress in developing a framework of equitable policies and institutions. Rwanda's poverty reduction strategy provides a powerful vehicle for improving the lives of Rwanda's people, and we are beginning to see real progress: although still very high, the incidence of poverty is declining; child immunisation has increased to around 90 per cent; and we are seeing falls in key indicators such as child mortality and maternal mortality.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/5">The British Government have worked very closely with Rwanda in recent years. DfID's assistance has steadily increased and now stands at &pound;42 million, of which two-thirds is provided directly to the Government, while the remainder is devoted to programmes that enhance peace and reconciliation, poverty reduction and accountable governance. Our support has helped the Government of Rwanda to increase their spending on poverty reduction especially in key sectors such as health and education: for example, the Government of Rwanda nearly doubled their expenditure on health between 1999 and 2003, from 8.8 million dollars to 17.75 million dollars.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.1/2" qnum="HL2855">Whether Tutsi women raped by Hutu militiamen during the genocide in Rwanda have had access to HIV drugs and nutritional programmes funded by the international community; and whether their imprisoned attackers are being supported by these programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">I can confirm that defendants at the International Criminal Tribunal (ITC) for Rwanda have access to healthcare, including anti-retroviral treatment (ART) while witnesses and others called by the ICTR have so far had only limited access to health care. DfID is deeply concerned by this inequity. The Secretary of State for International Development last year wrote to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, asking how the United Nations and the international community could work to resolve this. Following Mr Annan's intervention, ICTR has now set up a treatment centre in Kigali to provide healthcare, including anti-retroviral treatment, for witnesses and others called by the tribunal. Many of these witnesses were victims of rape during the genocide. DfID has committed &pound;200,000 to assist this programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/2">HIV/AIDS is a serious problem in Rwanda. Rwanda does not yet have the health infrastructure required to effectively deliver HIV/AIDS care and treatment countrywide. The Government have produced a comprehensive <i>Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS Control</i> and all the major donors, including the Clinton Foundation, the Global Fund and the World Bank, have committed to support it. This framework includes the progressive provision of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to all who need it, through a strengthened network of health centres. Rwanda is one of the countries that have reached agreement with manufacturers on significantly reduced drug prices in the context of its national HIV care and treatment plans. This has been achieved through a partnership between the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and five of the leading multinational pharmaceutical companies (the Accelerating Access to HIV/AIDS Care, Treatment and Support Initiative). This will make it quicker and more economical to reach and treat Rwandans living with HIV/AIDS, including genocide survivors. However, the rollout of care and treatment is at an early stage and so far only a small number of Rwandans have had access to anti-retroviral therapy, including some genocide survivors.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/3">The UK has committed &pound;25 million through the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa programme (IPAA) to increase capacity in certain national HIV/AIDS commissions, including Rwanda. DfID is currently considering whether we can build on this engagement, to ensure that Rwanda has the capacity to manage and direct the various programmes of support. DfID has also provided support to UNAIDS, which will shortly appoint a specialist to assist with co-ordination and monitoring of the international effort against HIV in Rwanda.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.5/1">The Government are gravely concerned about the situation in Darfur. It is very difficult to establish the numbers of people who have died in Darfur, as access to the region is very limited. However, the UN estimates that there have been approximately 10,000 deaths and over 1 million displaced people within Darfur, and approximately 120,000 refugees in Chad.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is providing assistance to refugees in Chad. So far it has established six camps in Chad, where 68,000 refugees are living, and has provided essential non-food items such as tents, plastic sheeting and blankets. It is also helping the refugees encamped at the boarder. The UK has given UNHCR &pound;2 million to support this work in Chad.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/3">The UK is heavily engaged in the humanitarian response to this crisis. DfID is the second largest donor after the US and so far we have committed over &pound;16.5 million to agencies working in Darfur and eastern Chad. A breakdown of these commitments is given below. In addition, DfID has seconded four humanitarian officers to support the response of Office for the Co-ordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to the crisis in Darfur and is seconding an additional three for the UN joint logistics centre. We are also paying for a despatch of non-food items (22,500 blankets and 15,000 plastic sheets) for distribution by humanitarian agencies. DfID is lobbying other donors to increase their contribution to the humanitarian response and will keep our level of assistance under continuous review.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2" qnum="HL3144">Whether, in aid programmes for Africa, and in their discussions with relevant governments, priority is being given to the needs of children suffering from HIV/AIDS and of those orphaned by the disease.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-06-16a.73.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="73"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040616/text/40616w02.htm#40616w02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.73.2/1">The response of the Department for International Development (DfID) to orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) is being stepped up. DfID is working with partners at the global level on advocacy and supporting evidence-based best practice. At the national level, ensuring effective policy and programme responses to the needs of children affected by HIV/AIDS is a high priority for us and for the achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs).</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/2">DfID recognises the urgent need to accelerate support for children affected by HIV/AIDS. The new UK strategy on HIV/AIDS will present a clear position on orphans and vulnerable children, which DfID expects to be a key priority. DfID's new policy of HIV/AIDS treatment and care will also have implications for the response to OVCs made vulnerable because of HIV/AIDS through the prolongation of life for parents, guardians and for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/3">DfID is increasingly incorporating OVC perspectives into country programming. For example, DfID has supported government responses to OVCs in Malawi and Zimbabwe. In the former, DfID has been working to ensure that social protection measures for families affected by HIV/AIDS are integrated into the poverty reduction strategies (PRSP). These measures included targeted nutrition and cash transfers, legislation on inheritance and the introduction of less intensive crops to affected households.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/4">DfID endorses the <i>Strategic Framework for the Protection, Care and Support of Orphans and Children made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDS</i>. DfID will be working closely with development partners at country level to help to operationalise the approaches recommended. In preparing our new HIV/AIDS strategy DfID will be considering ways in which we can better work with partners to support governments in their efforts to develop national policies, legislation, planning and programmes for OVCs and their care givers. DfID shall be advocating with governments that they appropriately prioritise the allocation of resources for OVCs. DfID is also considering how we can best assist governments in improving the monitoring of the results of OVC interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/5">DfID will work with development partners to ensure strengthened and sustained support for community-based responses to care and support of OVCs. DfID sees this as a key element in the national HIV/AIDS response and has already signalled in the UK call for action that we will be working closely with the United States in countries in Africa starting with Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia. This will provide opportunities to collaborate in improving support for OVCs in those countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/6">At the global level DfID will continue to participate in the global partners forum for children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS, which is convened by UNICEF. This has enabled the development of the strategic framework, the sharing of information, better co-ordination of global efforts and strengthening of advocacy. In addition, DfID will advocate effective strategic action for children infected and affected by HIV/AIDS through existing international development processes such as education for all (EFA), the EFA fast track initiative and the WHO/UNAIDS 3X5 (3 million people on treatment by 2005) initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.2/7">Finally, DfID is calling for stronger political direction in the fight against HIV/AIDS. DfID will make HIV/AIDS a centrepiece of our presidencies of the G8 and EU in 2005. DfID anticipates that this will include opportunities for addressing issues concerning children affected and infected by HIV/AIDS. DfID sees the need for better funding, including raising our own commitments. DfID will make HIV/AIDS a priority for the extra &pound;320 million the UK will be devoting to Africa by 2006 and the new UK government strategy will set out policy guidance.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-06-16a.74.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="74"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040616/text/40616w02.htm#40616w02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.74.2/1">To be eligible for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative a country must be eligible only for highly concessional assistance from the International Development Association (IDA)&mdash;the part of the World Bank that lends on highly concessional terms&mdash;and from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s poverty reduction and growth facility. Countries with an income per capita of 865 dollars or less are currently eligible. They must face an unsustainable debt situation even after the full application of traditional debt relief mechanisms (such as application of Naples terms under the Paris Club agreement). To enter the initiative, the eligible country must be in peace, have an established record of good macroeconomic management; and have a policy performance record with the World Bank and IMF.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/2">A framework peace agreement was signed in Nairobi by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Movement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-05">5 June 2004</phrase>, bringing closer an end to the country's 21-year civil war between north and south. Any formal steps on normalising financial relations with the international community will not take place until a comprehensive peace agreement has been finalised. Furthermore, the international community will find it hard to move forward on debt relief for Sudan while there is conflict in Darfur, western Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/3">Once a comprehensive peace agreement is in place, Sudan will have to negotiate a rights accumulation programme (RAP) with the IMF. This will allow them to establish a record of good macroeconomic management and a policy performance record with the World Bank and IMF. The duration of the RAP will have to be negotiated with the final decision resting with the executive board of the IMF. Following the RAP it is expected that Sudan will clear its arrears to the IMF and World Bank, which would allow those institutions to have normal lending programmes with Sudan. Before Sudan can enter the HIPC initiative, it will also have to reach agreements with its other creditors to repay or reschedule its arreas. In particular it will have to come to agreement with Paris Club creditors.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/4">Sudan is also required to prepare an interim poverty reduction strategy paper (i-PRSP) before it reaches HIPC decision point and begins to receive interim debt relief. A draft i-PRSP is under preparation by the Government of Sudan but it does not as yet include the needs of southern Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/5">While it is difficult to estimate precisely when decision point for Sudan will be, it is unlikely that it could be reached much before end 2005. However, G8 leaders agreed last week to work to extend the HIPC sunset clause beyond December 2004 by two years. This should allow eligible HIPC countries&mdash;including those emerging from conflict such as Sudan&mdash;to benefit from HIPC debt relief, once they have met the criteria.

	<p pid="a.75.2/2">The decision to invite a Chinese army band was taken by the Tattoo Board only after careful consideration of the human rights situation in China, on the basis that engagement through cultural activities would be beneficial. The participation of the band in the Tattoo in no way implies support by Her Majesty's Government for any past actions by the People's Liberation Army.</p>

The current standard, and earlier versions, has no requirements covering noise generated by road traffic crossing over bridge expansion joints.

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">My earlier Answer was based on the land area described as &quot;non-commercial orchard&quot; in the June 2003 Agricultural Census. In England there were 3,465 ha of such land of which 2,408 ha are currently being managed as &quot;traditional orchard&quot; under the Countryside Stewardship scheme. Within Somerset, the census showed 193 ha of non-commercial orchard of which 170 ha (88 per cent) are within the scheme. We hope to encourage further areas of traditional orchards to join our new Environmental Stewardship scheme which, subject to EU approval, will be introduced next year.</p>
