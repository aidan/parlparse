Both reviews recognised the importance of events to Northern Ireland and the contribution of the Northern Ireland Events Company. The 2003 review pointed out that the full potential for an events strategy was not being realised due to the lack of a coherent integrated events and tourism strategy. Excellent Events now features as one of the five winning themes within the NITB Tourism in Northern Ireland strategic framework for action 2004&ndash;07.

	<p pid="a.75.5/1">Orphans and vulnerable children are a high priority for DfID. We are particularly concerned with support for children who are affected by AIDS or infected with HIV in Africa, where the situation in the worst affected countries is reaching crisis level, but are also concerned to step up our work in Asia.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.5/2">DFID has endorsed the UNICEF <i>Strategic Framework for the Protection, Care and Support for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Living in a World with HIV and AIDS</i>. This sets out comprehensive guidance for countries to use in developing national policies and programmes to respond to the needs of vulnerable children, including orphans, street children and those at risk from drugs, prostitution, trafficking and HIV and AIDS. It therefore provides a good basis for discussing policy with partner governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.5/3">In 2004, we saw significant progress in a number of African middle-income countries in developing comprehensive, costed national action plans to address the needs of orphans and other vulnerable children. These are Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland, which are among the worst AIDS-affected countries in the world and the number of vulnerable children is growing alarmingly. DfID will be stepping up its support to these countries through multilateral channels and UNICEF in particular. DfID will also be providing support to Botswana to assist in developing and implementing its national action plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.5/4">Brazil is giving high priority to meeting the needs of poor and vulnerable children in integrated programmes in all regions. These include measures to support access to education and health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.5/5">DfID has had less success in Russia. Despite providing the majority of support to harm-reduction activities over the past five years, we have had relatively little success at the federal level in promoting a favourable policy environment for vulnerable young people at risk from drugs.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.5/1">It is for the courts to decide what prohibitions should be set out in the ASBO. The conditions should be reasonable and proportionate but protect all persons within a defined area from the anti-social acts of the defendant. The conditions are proposed to the court by the applicant agency and care should be taken to the formulation of the conditions so that individuals are not denied access to medical services or from visiting relatives, unless those relatives were party to the anti-social behaviour and the community needs further protection from their association. Local partnership working should ensure that the prohibitions set out in an ASBO application are workable and appropriate. Individuals may apply to discharge or vary the conditions of their ASBO.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.8/1">The Government are working with the police and the alcohol industry to prevent the sale of alcohol to, and the purchase of alcohol by under-18s. This includes the wider use of fixed penalty notices for staff who sell to under-18s, confiscation of alcohol from minors and working with the industry on a social responsibility scheme which will include a protocol around seeking proof of age. A Christmas alcohol misuse enforcement campaign is also under-way in all 43 police force areas in England and Wales. Town centres across the country are being targeted in an effort to crack down on under-age drinking and alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.8/2">The Government also acknowledge that enforcement alone is not sufficient to tackle these problems and that a more holistic approach to tackling the misuse of alcohol is needed if we are to challenge current attitudes to drinking. That is why we launched the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-15">15 March 2004</phrase> which outlines a programme of work based on 41 recommendations covering actions on prevention, communication, education, and identification and treatment to tackle alcohol misuse and ensure that both consumers and retailers have a healthy and responsible attitude to alcohol.</p>
