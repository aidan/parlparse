Defence exports are different, as customers are overseas governments, but there are clear benefits to be gained from building on trade promotion expertise within government by bringing together support for both civil and defence exporters. This approach recognises the importance of the defence sector to the economy: avoiding duplication; capitalising on synergies from the transfer; and making a good organisation even better.</p>
