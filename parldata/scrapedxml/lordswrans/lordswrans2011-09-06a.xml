	<p pid="a.25.2/1">During my recent trip to Kenya, I encouraged the Government to invest more in long-term food security in the arid lands. The Department for International Development (DfID) has seconded a staff member into the Ministry for the Development of Northern Kenya and Other Arid Lands to support efforts better to address food security among pastoralist communities. DfID is investing in a range of other activities (for example, social protection, livestock insurance, and community planning on the impact of climate change) to address the marginalisation of pastoralists in Kenya. We are also working with the authorities in Somaliland to increase business opportunities around the marketing and export of livestock. In Ethiopia, DfID is encouraging the Government there to scale-up the delivery of basic services to pastoralist communities. The UK-supported Productive Safety Nets Programme is operational in pastoral areas of Ethiopia and aims to find long-term and sustainable solutions to food in-security.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.5/1">The final figure for the conduct of the referendum will be known only once all accounts from regional counting officers and counting officers for the conduct of the poll have been received and settled. No direct costs will be incurred by local authorities as costs will be met centrally from the Consolidated Fund. We estimate that combining the referendum on the voting system with local elections and other polls on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-05">5 May</phrase> will have resulted in savings being made by central and local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/2">We have estimated that the cost of the referendum on the voting system to central government (its conduct and the cost of the mailings from the designated lead campaign organisations) is &#163;89 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/3">The Electoral Commission also incurred costs in running the poll. It is wholly independent of government and is accountable to Parliament through the Speaker's Committee of the House of Commons. A member of the Speaker's Committee responds to questions about the operation of the Electoral Commission in the House of Commons. There is no mechanism for answering such questions in the House of Lords. However, I understand that the Electoral Commission intends to write to the noble Lord setting out the costs it incurred in delivering the referendum. A copy of this letter will also be placed on its website and in the Library of the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">A World Food Programme report (June 2011) found that 54 per cent of the population of Gaza is food insecure, with an additional 12 per cent of the population vulnerable to food insecurity. Israeli restrictions severely limit imports and exports, as well as the movement of people in and out of Gaza, and access to agricultural land and fishing waters. Although the June 2010 changes to the closure regime have allowed more food to enter Gaza, the economic problems caused by the restrictions mean that food insecurity levels are nearly identical to those prior to the changes. Three-quarters of the Gaza population continue to depend on humanitarian food assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">This is unacceptable and unsustainable, and the UK will continue to press the Israeli authorities to recognise that the restrictions are not in Israel's interests and should be lifted.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.2/2">As the report highlights, the right to work is of particular concern for Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon. The UK welcomes the recent legislation passed by the Lebanese Parliament to allow Palestinians to work, but urges Lebanon to increase Palestinian access to work, education, healthcare and social welfare. The UK ambassador to Lebanon met with Prime Minister Miqati in June 2011 and pressed the new Lebanese Government to take further steps to improve the living conditions and civil rights of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">The Government have made it clear that megatrucks (ie those typically 25.25 metres long or greater) will not be allowed on the UK's roads for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">The impacts of allowing the use of megatrucks in the UK can be found in the report published on the Department for Transport's website entitled <I>Longer and/or longer and heavier goods vehicles-a study of the effects if they were to be permitted in the UK</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/3">There are no plans to make any further risk assessment.</p>
