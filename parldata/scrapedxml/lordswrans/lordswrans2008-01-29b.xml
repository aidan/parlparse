The NMS require that the consequences of unacceptable behaviour are clear to staff and children and that any measures applied are relevant to the incident and are reasonable. Homes use a range of interventions and responses to ensure that children's behaviour is properly managed. The Government fund the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care in order to promote effective practice in the sector.

	<p pid="b.116.3/1">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) funds a substance misuse service across the secure estate for children and young people. Those young people who have misused substances (about 7 per cent of those in custody) receive targeted support based on their level of need and the substances they have misused. Those young people (about 5 per cent) who require specialist treatment, such as those needing detoxification, receive individual specialist support from a range of providers, including healthcare.</p>
