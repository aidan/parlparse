	<p pid="a.138.0/1">One effect of subsections (2) and (3) of Section 1 of the 1997 Act is that a person who had one of the specified forms of British nationality immediately before the relevant date can qualify for registration only if he or she would otherwise have been stateless. Since that would not be the case where a person already had another nationality or citizenship, it follows that subsection (6) can be referring only to the giving up of another nationality or citizenship acquired on or after that date. That is why the instructions say that a person will be disqualified if, on or after the relevant date, he or she has,</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2" class="indent">&quot;acquired and renounced, or otherwise voluntarily relinquished, the nationality or citizenship of another country or territory&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">The noble Lord rightly points out that acquisition of another nationality or citizenship on or after the relevant date will not, in itself, operate to disqualify the person concerned. We shall look at the relevant paragraph again and consider whether the drafting might be improved so as to avoid possible misunderstanding.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.3/1">Section 4B(2)(c) of the British Nationality Act 1981 does not specify that the &quot;action or inaction&quot; that brought about the loss of the person's non-British nationality or citizenship must have been that of the person himself. It therefore seems to us unnecessary to inquire into the extent to which the person was cognisant of an action taken on his behalf (in this instance, an application by a parent for him to have a British passport). The actions specified in paragraph 3.4 of Annexe D to Chapter 12 of the Nationality Instructions, which relate to deprivation and nullity of citizenship, are of a different order in that they are taken neither by nor on behalf of the person concerned.</p>

However, certain elements of the treaty, which also apply to many other extradition partners, were given effect by the Extradition Act 2003 and secondary legislation under it. Inclusion of the US in this way was done in advance of the coming into force of the 2003 treaty because the Government considered it right to treat the US in the same way as other trusted extradition partners. To change the designation of the US under secondary legislation would be a retrograde step.</p>

The department will calculate its annual offset requirements based upon air travel cost and distance data for the year, multiplied by a factor of two to reflect the fact that the impact of aviation on climate change is increased over that of direct carbon dioxide emissions alone by some of the other emissions released and their specific effects at altitude. The scheme covers air travel from April 2006. Staff were notified in May through the department's in-house magazine.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.8/1">Responsibility for improving the rights of way network and ensuring that routes are properly recorded and maintained rests with individual local highway authorities. Data on new routes created in the north-west or anywhere else in England are not collected centrally. They could be collected only at disproportionate cost.</p>
