	<p pid="c.221.6/1">There is currently a public/private partnership for the provision of digital hearing aids, governed by a national framework agreement.

Any issues of quality that cannot be resolved locally may be escalated to the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.6/2">The NHS is not mandated to use the national framework agreement, and local NHS organisations are able to negotiate their own contracts with the independent sector if they wish.

Registration by an independent sector provider with the Healthcare Commission is a prerequisite forall contracts awarded under this procurement.

	<p pid="c.223.2/1">I am advised that cerebral palsy is sometimes because of a blocked blood vessel, complications in labour, extreme prematurity or illness just after birth. Infections during pregnancy,or during infancy and early childhood&mdash;meningitis or encephalitis, for example&mdash;can also cause cerebral palsy. Occasionally it is due to an inherited disorder. It is sometimes possible to identify the cause of cerebral palsy, but not always.</p>

	<p pid="c.223.5/1">Adjusting for inflation, the purchasing power of &pound;50 in 1981 would be equivalent to the purchasing power of around&pound;137 (to January 2006). The Bank of England currently has no plans to change the denominational structure of its note issue. It does not believe that there is public demand for a &pound;100 note. This is because the public makes much greater use of electronic payments than they did in 1981. Survey evidence shows that the vast majority of cash transactions are for a value of &pound;5 or less and that the highest denomination note that the public would prefer to receive from an ATM withdrawal is &pound;20. A further consideration is that high denomination notes can be more attractive to those wishing to hold and transfer criminal funds.</p>

	<p pid="c.226.0/1">United Nations Secretary-General-designate, Mr Ban Ki-Moon, has already stated that he will actively look for a diplomatic solution to resolving the issues posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The DPRK human rights situation is a matter of serious concern to the Government. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary previously raised DPRK human rights issues withMr Ban when he was Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea, and they again discussedDPRK issues during Mr Ban's visit to London on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December</phrase>. We will continue to stress to Mr Ban the importance of maintaining international pressure on DPRK to improve its human rights record and to allow UN Special Rapporteur Vitit Muntarbhorn access to North Korea.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.0/2">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, hosted a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-16">16 November</phrase> at the House of Commons, where Mr Muntarbhorn addressed Members of both Houses and non-governmental organisations.</p>
