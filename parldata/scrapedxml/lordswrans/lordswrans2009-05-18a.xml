	<p pid="a.243.5/1">Long-lasting insecticide impregnated bed nets are a key part of efforts to reduce malaria. Monitoring local production and markets is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.5/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) supported programmes in Nigeria and Mozambique, managed by the Malaria Consortium, to monitor the source of nets. This helps track changes in the size and production of the net market from local suppliers. These programmes are working closely with local distribution networks to understand how best to foster local markets. Mozambique now has good data from research over three years, which are currently being analysed. There appears to be no evidence that DfID support has undermined local net production, rather the contrary, as it is actually creating and expanding the market. Social marketing and communication activities are promoting long-lasting insecticide treated nets, which are much more effective than cheap, imported and low quality untreated nets, thereby helping to ensure that the market is more quality conscious.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.5/3">In Ghana, DfID has supported the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to conduct research with a voucher scheme in collaboration with private sector sellers, to promote the local trade of insecticide treated nets.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.6/1">Other than the relevant fingerprints and DNA samples belonging to S and Marper, no fingerprints or DNA samples have been destroyed as a result of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the case of S and Marper v United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.6/2">Article 41 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides that if the court finds that a violation has occurred, just satisfaction must be made to the injured party. The application of the judgment to others in similar situations must be considered in the light of the full content of the judgment. The judgment does provide for the member state to consider the scope for achieving a proper balance with the competing interests of tackling crime and preserving respect for private life.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.6/3">We do acknowledge the need to implement the judgment in a timely manner but we also recognise the over-riding importance of introducing a proportionate response which has been subject to wide public debate as well as consideration by Parliament. That is why on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-07">7 May 2009</phrase> the Home Secretary launched the public consultation &quot;Keeping the Right People on the DNA Database&quot;. The consultation paper sets out the Government's proposals to implement the S and Marper judgment and the proposed framework to ensure public protection and safeguard the rights of the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.6/4">The responses from the consultation will assist in the forming of draft regulations to be submitted to Parliament for approval later this year. Until Parliament has amended the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 on the retention of DNA and fingerprints, the current law remains in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.6/5">Individuals who wish to have their DNA samples and fingerprints destroyed can apply to the chief police officer of the force which took the samples and fingerprints for them to be removed under the exceptional case procedure. The decision whether or not to agree to the request for removal is a matter for the discretion of the relevant chief police officer.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.3/1">UK legislation of EU origin may be directly applicable in member states. Other legislation requires incorporation into national law. This is sometimes done by primary legislation, sometimes by secondary legislation, but on other occasions by administrative means. In yet other situations, domestic legislation which is being amended for other purposes may also incorporate changes to reflect EU directives. This makes it extremely difficult to determine how many legislative measures have been introduced in the UK as a result of EU measures. Such figures would also have only a very limited purpose: some EU measures may require numerous pieces of domestic legislation to bring them into effect, or a number of EU measures may be given effect in one piece of domestic legislation. We therefore remain of the view that it would entail disproportionate cost to research and compile this information.</p>

The results of the telephone survey showed that a quarter of those people who opposed water fluoridation did so because of a fear that it would damage their health, but successive research studies have found no association between water fluoridation and systemic illness. The survey also found that 69 per cent of respondents had little or no knowledge of fluoridation.</p>

All the return operations involved officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and from our embassy in Washington, accompanied by officers of the Metropolitan Police Service to ensure the security of the flight and to comply with police procedures during the return. In all cases military or private charters were necessary both to ensure security and because no other flights were available from Guantanamo Bay to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.5/1">All appointments for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality and Human Rights Commission are made in accordance with guidance from the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Beyond this, some differences stem from the different statutory bases for appointments to the two bodies. The Equality Act 2006 established the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). Under the terms of Act, EHRC can have no fewer than 10 and no more than 15 commissioners including the chair. Candidates are selected on merit and are required to meet the standards of an independent panel before they can be considered for appointment. The Minister for Women and Equality has the final decision on appointments, based on the panel's recommendations.. In making appointments to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Secretary of State has an obligation under Section 68(3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to, as far as practicable, secure that the commissioners, as a group, are representative of the community in Northern Ireland. In the most recent public appointments process to the commission in 2007, candidates were assessed against the following published criteria: corporate focus, responsibility and accountability, judgment and strategic thinking, and specialist expertise.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.3/1">The use of short-term detention in Iran is particularly fluid and difficult to monitor, therefore it is difficult to accurately determine the number of Baha'is imprisoned in Iran since 2000. However, Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials are in close contact with the National Spiritual Association of the Baha' is of the UK, who have provided information dating back to 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.3/2">Our records show that 228 Baha'is have been arrested since August 2004. Of those:</p>
	<p pid="a.264.3/3">threeare currently imprisoned in Iran;81 have been arrested and released on bail and are awaiting trial;nine have been arrested and released without bail;84have been tried and sentenced and are free pending appeal or summons to begin serving their sentences;10 have been tried and sentenced and have completed their prison terms;eighthave had charges cleared in their original trials or have had their verdicts overturned on appeal; andthree have served their prison sentences and have begun their terms of exile.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.3/4">Whilst we have received reports of members of the Baha'i community being killed or executed since 2000, we cannot directly attribute those deaths to the fact that they were Baha'is. The last documented killing of a Baha'i in Iran dates back to July 1998, with the execution of Mr. Rhullah Rawhani.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.3/5">The persecution of individuals based solely on the grounds of their religion or beliefs is wholly unacceptable, and alongside our EU partners we have repeatedly expressed our firm opposition to all forms of discrimination and oppression. We will continue to urge Iran to respect and protect its religious minorities and free all prisoners held due to their faith or religious practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.2/1">The code of practice on the statutory power of arrest by police officers (PACE Code G) issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 requires that the arresting officer must record in his pocket book or by other methods of recording information about the nature and circumstances leading to the arrest; the reason or reasons why arrest was necessary; the giving of the caution; and anything said by the person at the time of arrest. Such a record should be made at the time of the arrest unless impracticable to do so. If not made at the time, the record should then be completed as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/2">The information given by the arresting officer on the circumstances and reason or reasons for arrest must be recorded as part of the custody record.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/3">PACE Code E on the audio recording of interviews with suspects requires that audio recording must be used at police stations for any interview with a person cautioned for an indictable offence. At the end of the interview, the suspect must be handed a notice which explains how the audio recording will be used; the arrangements for access to it; and that, if the person is charged or informed that they will be prosecuted, a copy of the audio recording will be supplied.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/4">PACE Code of Practice C for the detention, treatment and questioning of persons by police officers provides that a solicitor or appropriate adult must be permitted to consult the custody record as soon as practicable on arrival at the police station and any other time when the person is detained. A copy of the custody record must be made available if requested by a solicitor or appropriate adult after a person leaves police detention. This entitlement lasts for 12 months after release. The detainee, appropriate adult or legal representative shall be permitted to inspect the original custody record after the detainee has left police detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/5">The Metropolitan Police advise that they do not hold a central record of instances where requests for evidence made by persons wishing to make a claim against the force has been refused due it being mislaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/6">Disciplinary action against individual police officers or police staff is an operational matter for chief officers.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.6/1">The premise of this Question is wrong. In 2008, 79 per cent of children reached or exceeded level 4+, the expected level in key stage 2 (20 per cent more than in 1998 and 2 per cent more than in 2007). An additional 15 per cent of pupils achieved level 3 in 2008 and it would be wrong to suggest that a child achieving this level does not have a secure grasp of basic mathematical skills. At level 3, a pupil has a range of mathematical skills; for example the ability to solve whole number problems involving multiplication and division, use simple fractions, recognise negative numbers and extract and interpret data from simple tables and lists.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.6/2">In 2008, fewer than 36,000 children (less than 6 per cent of pupils) failed to reach level 3 at KS2. For these children, the department is rolling out new programmes to raise standards in maths. The Every Child Counts intensive intervention programme targets the lowest attaining 5 per cent of pupils and will have national coverage from September 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.6/3">The maths specialist programme aims to train 13,000 primary teachers over 10 years so that every primary school will have access to a math specialist who will improve maths teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.6/4">By 2010-11, we aim to provide one-to-one tuition to 300,000 children a year in each of English and mathematics.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-05-18a.274.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100960" speakername="Lord Darzi of Denham" colon=":" colnum="274"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90518w0006.htm#0905185000273">
	<p pid="a.274.2/1">Monitoring of adult social services' efficiency in England is undertaken by a number of organisations: the Care Quality Commission (CQC), as part of its role as the independent health and social care regulator, the Audit Commission, and the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.2/2">The CQC was established by the Health and Social Care Act (2008) and replaced the Commission for Social Care Inspection, as well as the regulators for healthcare and the Mental Health Act. Under the provisions of the 2008 Act, the CQC carries out a number of activities related to the regulation of local health and social care services, including registration of providers to ensure minimum quality standards are met, regular reviews of providers and commissioners of services, and inspections of particular care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.2/3">The CQC undertakes periodic reviews of all local authority adult social services, and publishes its assessment of the quality of those services, and their capacity to deliver improved outcomes for local people. This judgment includes a specific criterion on the local authority's efficient use of resources to meet the needs of its local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.2/4">The CQC's assessment of adult social care is further used as part of the evidence base for the annual comprehensive area assessment (CAA) published by the Audit Commission. The CAA, which will be published for the first time in October 2009, brings together the assessments of six national regulators to form an overall judgment of the delivery of public services in a locality. It will publish an area assessment (providing an overall judgment on the locality) and an additional organisational assessment of the local authority management. This latter assessment will make a scored judgment on two corporate areas: managing performance and use of resources, and so will contribute towards the checks on efficiency in adult social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.2/5">The Department of Health also works to support efficiency in adult social care, and has put in place a number of programmes to help local authorities achieve efficiencies. For instance, the Care Services Efficiency Delivery programme has invested about &pound;5 million per year to specifically support the local efficiency agenda through working with local authorities to improve planning and procurement, developing more efficient systems for the assessment and delivery of care with a strong focus on re-ablement and recovery. Additionally, the Partnership for Older People Projects have supported 19 local pilot programmes to develop a wide range of innovative services and focus on early interventions to reduce long-term care needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.2/1">The regulation of adult social care providers is now the responsibility of the new independent regulator, the Care Quality Commission, which took over from the Commission for Social Care Inspection, the Healthcare Commission and the Mental Health Act Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>. The new commission will take a risk-based proportionate approach to its regulatory role.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/2">The commission has a range of enforcement actions it can take against registered providers of adult social care who do not fulfil their legal obligations. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/3">a formal non-statutory caution;a notice requiring improvement within a specified time period;conditions that place restrictions on registration (for example, preventing the provider from running a particular service or preventing further admissions to a service);prosecution of organisations and/or individuals&mdash;resulting in fines or, in extreme cases, imprisonment; and ultimatelycancellation of registration, which closes the service down.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/4">The commission could also refer the matter to another body, for example, the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/5">National minimum standards for domiciliary care providers recognise that people want care workers who are reliable, dependable and arrive and depart at the time expected. They specify that care staff should arrive at the home of the person using the service within the time band specified and work for the full time allocated. They also say that people who use services should be kept informed about their care and told in advance of any changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/6">If any agency fails to meet its obligations contained in service specific regulations in relation to operation and the care of its customers, the commission will consider if a prosecution is suitable and in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/7">Separately, the commission may also consider the viability of continued registration of the provider. The provision of inaccurate information to the commission would be a serious matter, which would be considered in the context of the case and the overall safety of people using services.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/8">From April 2010, we are introducing a new registration framework for providers of regulated health and adult social care activities. We are currently consulting on a number of policy issues to support the new framework, including what incidents should require notification to the commission. We are intending to set out the categories <I>of </I>information that providers will need to supply to the commission in regulations which we will put before Parliament later this year. The Care Quality Commission will be able to take enforcement action against providers of regulated activities who do not meet the requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/9">We have no specific plans to make the reporting of all missed visits by social care workers mandatory at this time. However, the proposals in the consultation for incidents that require notification include:</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/10">an allegation that a person who uses services has been abused;an incident which is reported to, or investigated by, the police and involves the health and well-being of people who use service; andan allegation of misconduct in relation to registration requirements against a person working for the purpose of carrying out a regulated activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/11">The Care Quality Commission is currently working to develop the precise detail, content, format and timescale of notification it will require.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/12">In addition, all providers of regulated activities will need to meet a set of registration requirements in order to register with the Care Quality Commission, and to maintain registration. These include requirements to treat people with dignity and respect, keeping records of the provision of care and treatment, and involving people in making informed decisions about their care and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/13">Where providers are not meeting the registration requirements, the commission will have the flexibility to use its independent enforcement powers to bring poor providers back into compliance or to prevent people who use services from being exposed to serious risk of harm.</p>

Forces need to consider whether it is appropriate to consult representatives of the local community in advance of authorising the powers. However, any decision not to consult with the community, due to operational reasons, should be fully explained and justified by the authorising officer.</p>
