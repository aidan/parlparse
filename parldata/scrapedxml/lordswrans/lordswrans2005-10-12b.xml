<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-10-12b.99.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="99"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51012w01.htm#51012w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.99.0/1">The policy of rent restructuring is based upon detailed analysis of the financial implications for tenants and landlords, including the payment of housing benefit. The purpose of the policy is to bring a standard approach to the calculation of social rents, so that similar properties in the same area attract similar rents within the social rented sector regardless of landlord.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/2">Key workers are targeted separately by their own housing scheme, key worker living, which provides equity loans, shared ownership and intermediate rented units to help recruit and retain key workers in London, the east and south east of England. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is currently undertaking an evaluation of the impact of the key worker living programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/3">Evictions for the non-payment of rent are a matter for the landlord. In the past councils have been keen to find alternative solutions, and ODPM guidance has recently reaffirmed that eviction should be the very last resort. Housing benefit is available to help all those who are entitled whether or not they are in work.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/4">We estimate that 60 per cent. of social rents are covered by HB. We do not expect this to change significantly as a result of the relatively small changes introduced by rent restructuring. As some rents increase in real terms, others will fall.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/5">Tenants will not be required to move to alternative social housing. We are not aware of any evidence which suggests that rents are the sole factor for tenants choosing to move. One of the objectives for rent restructuring is greater transparency to support the greater choice afforded by choice-based letting. So if tenants do decide to move home, perhaps to a smaller property, they will find rent pricing structures more transparent in future across the social rented sector.</p>
