</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-10-12a.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100955" speakername="Lord Malloch-Brown" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91012w0001.htm#09101214000003">
	<p pid="a.1.2/1">The Afghan Government increasingly have to contend with the insurgency's ability to promote its extremist ideology. In order to help counter the extremist narrative, the UK is committed to increasing the Afghan Government's ability to communicate their credibility and authority, particularly in the Pashtun Belt. The UK supports the Afghan Government in developing their communications capacity and capabilities to support growing Afghan ownership of communications, including through funding of the new Government Media and Information Centre in Kabul and support for communications infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">UK strategy in Afghanistan incorporates public diplomacy and outreach such as bilateral visits by prominent Muslim opinion-formers, in order to break down Afghan misconceptions about UK life and the myths around UK motivations for intervening in Afghanistan. In June this year, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office provided funding for a group of Helmand MPs to visit the UK to develop their understanding of the role of the UK's Muslim Community. The delegation's engagements included meeting British Muslim scholars and opinion-formers, visiting British mosques and Muslim faith schools. Also at the invitation of the Government, a group of Afghan religious leaders are visiting the UK in July in order to see first-hand demonstrations of Islam's compatibility with democracy. Their engagements include meetings with the Friends of Islam All-Party Parliamentary Group, the Society of Afghan Residents in the UK, and a visit to the Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">The UK works hard to explain foreign policy to domestic and international public in order to address inaccurate perceptions. We do this through media and public diplomacy work, including putting Arabic and Urdu-speaking spokespeople forward to media outlets such as Al-Jazeera, and speeches, interviews and articles by Ministers and ambassadors.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.5/1">The UK continues to press others to share more of the burden in Afghanistan, focusing on what others can realistically deliver, including military and non-military.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">Lobbying efforts have resulted in real progress in the form of commitments announced at the NATO summit in Strasbourg on 3 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-04">4 April 2009</phrase>. Many European nations, including eastern European NATO members, such as Poland, Romania and Lithuania made announcements of increased troop contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3">In 2008, a France-UK summit launched the UK-France (now multinational) Helicopter Initiative with the aim of helping finance equipment upgrades and crew training to improve the availability of helicopters to NATO, EU and UN operations. The initial focus was on the ISAF operation in Afghanistan, therefore increasing burden-sharing among the partner nations in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/4">The fund has so far generated &euro;27 million, and this has helped enable the commitment of an additional 17 helicopters for Afghanistan, starting with an initial deployment of Czech helicopters at the end of this year, plus plans for Bulgarian and Hungarian deployments thereafter. Other Eastern European NATO allies are also considering helicopter deployments. The Prime Minister raised this issue at the last NATO summit in April 2009, and the UK continues to engage with EU and NATO opposite numbers to gain their support for this initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/2">In the communications sector, there is no legislation that specially covers payment methods. However, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (UTCCRs) are relevant. Ofcom has considered how the UTCCRs apply to consumer contracts for communications services in relation to certain standard consumer contract terms. It did so during its review of additional charges and has published its guidance (the guidance) on additional charges, which sets out its views. This guidance is available on its website as follows: <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">http://www.ofcom.org.uk</a> /consult/condocs/addcharges/statement/addchargestatement.pdf. A copy of this document has been deposited in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/3">A charge levied when a consumer chooses a particular payment method is considered to be an additional charge (a charge from their supplier above those that they already pay for the service). Ofcom has considered additional charges in detail in the guidance. Ofcom's view is that communications providers are free to charge customers who pay their bills by certain payment methods, and no legislation prevents them from doing so. But, it thinks that terms which provide for a charge for the payment method may be assessed for fairness under the UTCCRs if these terms are not:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.2/4">expressed transparently, in plain and intelligible language; andpresented in such a way that the typical consumer would regard the charge as part of the price they are paying for the services they are buying, and not a separate, incidental additional charge.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.3/1">The most recent conflict in Gaza caused considerable damage to public infrastructure and exacerbated an already serious situation.

	<p pid="a.18.2/1">The Government are taking a comprehensive approach to piracy off the coast of Somalia. This involves close co-ordination among all relevant government departments, the UK shipping industry, the International Maritime Organisation and the wider international community. The aim is to reduce the risk to vessels transiting the seas off the Horn of Africa while tackling piracy at its root&mdash;instability in Somalia&mdash;through the provision of humanitarian and development assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/2">UN Security Council Resolution 1851 established a Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) whose work is taken forward by four working groups. The UK chairs Working Group 1 on operational co-ordination and regional capacity development.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/3">The Royal Navy is actively countering piracy around the Horn of Africa and is playing a leading role in international efforts to do so. The UK is at the forefront of the European mission, Operation ATALANTA, providing the operation commander and the operation headquarters at Northwood. The UK commands the Standing NATO Maritime Group (SNMG), which has a counter-piracy mandate, from HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot;. We are also providing ships to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), which conduct maritime security operations in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/4">Operation ATALANTA is achieving positive results in providing protection to World Food Programme (WFP), AMISOM reinforcements and other vulnerable shipping. ATALANTA has delivered a significant reduction in the number of successful attacks in the internationally recognised transit corridor in the strategically critical Gulf of Aden through close co-operation with the international shipping industry. Thirty-six shipments of WFP shipping have been escorted, which equates to 243,179 metric tonnes of food. This is an important first step in a comprehensive approach to tackling the problem of piracy on land.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/5">ATALANTA has warships from 10 European countries, including Norway, on patrol in the Gulf of Aden and the Somali Basin. The Maritime Security Centre (Horn of Africa) has been established at Northwood and is a world-leading example of military co-ordination and co-operation with industry, set up by the UK-led European operation. ATALANTA is also leading the way in encouraging the Somali authorities to take ownership of the problem and is working in support of the European Commission&mdash;a good example of military-civil-diplomatic co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/6">The UK and EU are at the forefront of the international response to piracy, whether it is through legal arrangements for the prosecution of detainees in Kenya and other regional nations, involvement in the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGCPS) or co-chairmanship of the military co-ordination mechanism known as the shared awareness and deconfliction meeting (SHADE), which brings together EU, NATO, CMF with China, Russia, Japan and India, among others.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.2/7">More than 80 suspected pirates have been apprehended by UK and EU warships in the past few months and they are currently being processed through the Kenyan legal system. The warships and maritime patrol aircraft are fully engaged in protecting merchant ships, disrupting pirate activity, pursuing suspects and helping regional nations improve their own capacity to deal with the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">We agree with General Agwai that levels of organised violence and fighting between Sudan armed forces and armed movements in Darfur have declined significantly in comparison to levels experienced in 2003-05, and that conflict in Darfur is now more characterised by banditry and local disputes. But levels of lawlessness and insecurity remain high and humanitarian access poor. We also share the view of many international observers that the causes and consequences of conflict have yet to be addressed, and that without this there can be no sustainable peace in Darfur.</p>
