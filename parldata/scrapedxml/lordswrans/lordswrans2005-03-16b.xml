	Oil Market: China

	<p pid="b.138.1/2" qnum="HL1701">What effect they foresee on (a) the availability of oil in the market, and (b) fuel prices, from the reported large-scale acquisition by China of oilfields and oil concessions from, among other countries, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Angola and Brazil.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-16b.138.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="138"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050316/text/50316w02.htm#50316w02_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.138.2/1">There are a wide range of factors that will influence future developments in the oil market. Growth in China's demand for oil is one, and has been factored into current oil price levels as well as the future production capacity plans of the major oil producers. Although China has concluded a number of deals in recent years in oil-producing countries it is unlikely that the additional effect these deals will have on the availability and price of oil will be significant in the short and medium term. The oil market is a global market involving a large number of producers and consumers. Moreover, oil production from these fields and concessions will be used to meet China's growing oil import needs, as well as global oil demand more generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.2/2">However, we will continue to monitor market developments and promote the development of competitive and liquid global oil markets as the most effective way to help deliver more stable prices and for consumers to be able to purchase what they need at any time.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-16b.138.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="138"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050316/text/50316w02.htm#50316w02_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.138.5/1">The Solent European Marine Site (Prohibition of Method of Dredging) Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/2696) was made to avoid any deterioration in the natural habitat and species for which the Solent European Marine Site (EMS) has been designated. The Solent EMS is totally contained within six nautical miles of the English coast where vessels from other countries do not have access rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.5/2">Articles 5(1)(a) and (b) are well precedented and relevant enforcement provisions. They enable British sea-fishery officers to enforce the order on British vessels even if they have left the relevant area, and on vessels from other countries even if they do not have access rights to the area. There is no intention to extend this order to all British territorial waters; measures to protect other European marine sites from damage caused by fishing are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
