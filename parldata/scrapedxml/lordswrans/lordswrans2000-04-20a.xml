<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-04-20a.123.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="123"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000420/text/00420w01.htm#00420w01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.123.5/1">Clause 4 of the Freedom of Information Bill requires my right honourable friend the Home Secretary to consult every person to whom an order relates or persons appearing to him to represent such persons. We have still to consult formally as required under Clause 4 and, therefore, it is not possible to provide a list of bodies which will be designated under this part of the Bill. Our enquiries to date have, however, identified a number of bodies which we believe are likely to meet the criteria set out in respect of bodies designated under Clause 4. These are set out in the following list. Some of the bodies are listed in their own right and others by means of a generic description. The list does not represent a final list of bodies which may be designated as public authorities for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/2">Clause 5 of the Bill provides that a company is publicly-owned for the purposes of the Bill if it is wholly owned by the Crown, or it is wholly owned by any public authority listed in Schedule 1 to the Bill other than (i) a government department, or (ii) any authority which is listed only in relation to particular information. Subsections (2) and (3) clarify the meaning to be given to &quot;wholly owned by the Crown&quot; and &quot;wholly owned by a public authority&quot; for these purposes and set out other definitions. The effect of Clause 5 is that a company which meets the criteria is caught by the freedom of information regime. Because we are using a generic definition we have not compiled a separate list of bodies which may be covered by Clause 5.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/3">Clauses 2 to 6 of the Freedom of Information Bill provide for coverage of all public bodies, either by means of a generic description of by specific inclusion in a list or an order. Bodies which might qualify for inclusion in the list at Schedule 1 have, however, not been so listed where we are satisfied that the body will have ceased to exist when the Bill comes into force, have no separate identity from a parent organisation, or are not yet established. In the latter case, the body will be brought within scope of the legislation by order.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/4">There are two exceptions to the principle that all public bodies are to be covered by the Bill. Clause 21(3) provides that any information provided by, or relating to, specified bodies is exempt. The specified bodies are the Security Services, the Secret Intelligence Service, the Government Communications Headquarters, the Special Forces (Special Air Service and Special Boat Service) and the National Criminal Intelligence Service. This has the effect of excluding those bodies from the scope of the Bill. In addition, certain Scottish bodies are exempt from the order-making powers in the Bill. These bodies are the Scottish Parliament, any part of the Scottish Administration, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body or any Scottish public authority with mixed functions or no reserved functions within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998. Legislation in respect of those bodies is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">Whether disclosed information may be published on the Internet or not depends on whether the information is subject to copyright under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Anyone wishing to publish disclosed information which is copyright must first seek and obtain the permission of the copyright holder. The provisions in the Freedom of Information Bill will not disturb this.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">In terms of copyright, the information that may be disclosed under the proposed freedom of information regime will fall into three categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/3">Some information held by public authorities will be Crown copyright. This is defined as those works made by Her Majesty or by an officer or servant of the Crown in the course of his duties. The Government's White Paper on The Future Management of Crown Copyright, published on <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-26">26 March 1999</phrase>, stated that:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/4">&quot;the future management of Crown copyright will emphasise improved and streamlined access to ensure that government information is used and developed to best advantage&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/5">and that,</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/6">&quot;the general principles which govern the operation of Crown copyright should be extended, where possible, to non-Crown governmental bodies and to local government&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/7">Some information held by public authorities may be subject to the copyright of a third party. For example, government departments and agencies commission a wide range of works by non-Crown individuals and organisations. Unless specific provision is made in the commissioning contract for the copyright in such commissioned works to be assigned or transferred to the Crown, the copyright will continue to rest with the Author.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/8">Finally, there will be information which is not subject to copyright. There would be no restriction on the copying of such information which could also be put on the Internet.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">Clause 19 of the Freedom of Information Bill exempts information which is reasonably accessible to the applicant by other means. When assessing whether the information is &quot;reasonably accessible&quot; to the applicant, the Information Commissioner will of course take into account the form in which it is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">Where information is judged to be reasonably accessible by other means, the applicant will not have a right to require the information to be communicated to him in a different form other than the form in which it is already available.

	<p pid="a.130.6/1">The United Kingdom is a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Under the Convention, the United Kingdom has an obligation to consider all applications for asylum made in the United Kingdom or at its ports. The Secretary of State will, therefore, consider all claims for political asylum made in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.6/2">Where an applicant refuses to disclose his nationality, this will be taken into consideration when the claim is considered. However, failure to disclose his nationality may affect the assessment of the applicant's credibility and ultimately the overall decision whether or not to grant asylum.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.5/1">Yes. A mandatory instruction was issued to prisons in August 1997 requiring them to inform the relevant police force when sex offenders who are subject to the Sex Offenders Act 1997 are released. There is also a statutory requirement on those sex offenders themselves to notify the police of their address and other details on release from prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/2">It is not standard practice to alert the police of the release of other sex offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.3/1">Strategic Planning Guidance for the River Thames (RPG3b/9b) was issued in February 1997. The guidance includes a section on the built environment alongside the River Thames. It states that development should establish and reflect a relationship with the river, it should take full account of its local context, including its relationship with buildings and structures of particular sensitivity. The scale, mass, height, silhouette, skyline, layout, material and colour of buildings adjacent to and in the vicinity of the river should all be given close attention and should be appropriate to the local context. Because of the emphasis on the context of buildings and the varied character of the river, there is no rigid prescription about the height of buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.3/2">In November 1999, Ministers broadly endorsed advice produced by the London Planning Advisory Committee on high buildings and strategic views. The advice re-states the guidance in RPG3b/9b that London boroughs should identify the extent of the Thames policy area in their development plans and carry out an appraisal of their stretch of the river. This appraisal should form the basis of the designation of any areas appropriate for high buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.3/1">I am today announcing the Government's proposals for setting maximum prices for generic medicines supplied for use in NHS primary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/2">Generic medicines play an increasingly important part in NHS treatment. In 1998, 63 per cent. of all prescriptions were written generically and savings from generic prescribing have allowed the NHS to invest in other areas of patient care. The Government are committed to building on this success.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/3">The policy of encouraging generic prescribing depends on a reliable supply of generics which offer value for money. Over the last year the generics market has failed to deliver either. There have been apparent shortages and steep price rises in many generics, which cannot adquately be explained by changes in the cost base for generics manufacture.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/4">Generic price increases and related turbulence in the generics market are expected to cost the NHS in England some &pound;200 million in 1999-2000. Equivalent pressures have been experienced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Government are determined that the NHS should not face further additional cost pressures arising from generics in 2000-2001. We therefore propose to use powers in the Health Act 1999 to introduce a statutory ceiling, applicable across the UK, on the prices of the main generics. The proposals will not apply to branded medicines sold to the NHS by the research and development-based pharmaceutical industry, the profits of which are regulated voluntarily under the 1999 Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS). The statutory ceiling will correspond to prices some 15 months ago, before last year's steep price inflation. It will be reviewed after 15 months. We also propose to require the submission of information by suppliers of generics to underpin the review. The scheme will also include provision for appeals and for penalties in cases of contravention.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/5">Subject to the outcome of consultation, we propose to lay regulations to underpin the controls around the middle of June.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/6">The Government have considered the scope for introducing a voluntary scheme for setting maximum prices. It is difficult to see how a meaningful voluntary scheme could be negotiated, given the fragmentation of the generics supply chain, the number of representative bodies involved and the fact that many companies are not represented by any of them. However, if the Government are persuaded, through the consultation exercise, that a meaningful voluntary agreement could satisfactorily be negotiated, then they will seek to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/7">The Government are committed to ensuring that the principle of fair reimbursement for community pharmacists and dispensing doctors is maintained under the proposed scheme. At the same time, we share the view of the House of Commons Select Committee on Health that aspects of the reimbursement system--in particular the Category D arrangement--are flawed. We believe that Category D has had the effect of encouraging speculation in the supply chain and now propose to abolish it. We intend to discuss this and the wider implications of the price control scheme with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC) and the General Practice Committee of the BMA (GPC). There will be separate discussions to cover arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/8">The Government's proposals are intended to correct last year's unjustified price increases in the generics market and, in so doing, to protect the position of the NHS. At the same time, the Government remain committed to building on the UK's successful record on generic prescribing. We are therefore determined to ensure that, for the longer term, we have in place arrangements which best serve the Health Service as well as supporting a soundly managed and fully competitive generics market. Identifying such arrangements is the purpose of the Fundamental Review of the generics supply chain, which we have commissioned from Oxford Economic Research Associates (OXERA). We expect OXERA's programme of work to be concluded in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/9">A copy of the consultation document setting out the Government's proposals for setting maximum prices has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It is also available on the internet at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/gendcon">www.doh.gov.uk/gendcon</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.2/3">The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on employment changes by industry in the United Kingdom since 1948. I am replying in the Director's absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/4">The data requested appears in the attached table. The figures for 1948 to 1968 are based on information from British Labour Statistics Historical Abstract 1886-1968. For the years 1978 to 1998, figures are based on employment surveys in the nearest available year.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/5">You should be aware that the figures given in the reply are based on industry classifications that have changed several times since 1948, and therefore some estimates may not be strictly comparable over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.2/37">(1) The figures are arranged according to the five versions of the Standard Industrial Classification in use from 1948 to date. For this reason the figures are broadly comparable but there may be some fine definitional differences in certain industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/38">(2) The 1988 figures are interpolations based on the 1987 and 1989 Censuses of Employment. There was no Census of Employment in 1988.</p>
