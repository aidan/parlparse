	<p pid="a.175.5/1">There are no plans to include controls on lending to customers in the proposed banking reform or saving gateway Bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/2">In 2004 the Government put in place Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulation of mortgages. The FSA's regime offers appropriate consumer protection&mdash;for example, by requiring that firms satisfy themselves that a mortgage commitment is affordable. The OFT regulates other consumer credit business. Regulation of consumer credit is being further strengthened with the implementation of the Consumer Credit Act 2006, due to be completed by October 2008. This Act has, among other measures, strengthened the OFT's ability to investigate and take action against firms which lend irresponsibly. The OFT will bring forward guidance on irresponsible lending later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/3">The Government maintain a regular dialogue with the financial services industry and other interested parties with the aim of promoting responsible lending practices. For example, BERR has established an expert working group to examine proposals to enable lenders to share more data on historic credit accounts, with the aim of preventing at-risk consumers becoming overindebted.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-19a.176.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="176"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80619w0001.htm#80619w0001.htm_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.176.2/1">Table 1 gives the number of burglary offences recorded in south Belfast police district command unit, while table 2 gives the number of convictions relating to the same area. Data in tables 1 and 2 should not however be compared, for three reasons. First, data in table 1 refer to the DCU in which the burglary was recorded, while table 2 refers to the DCU in which an offender's address falls. Secondly, an offence recorded as burglary may subsequently be prosecuted on a different basis&mdash;eg, as theft. Thirdly, conviction data are collated on the principal offence rule, where only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">Because of the principal offence rule, it is not possible to identify those offenders convicted of multiple offences of burglary and any subsequent sentencing trends. It is only possible to give sentencing information for those offenders for whom burglary was the principal offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/3">Table 1 covers the financial years 2005-06 to 2007-08, while table 2 covers the calendar years 2004 to 2006 (the latest available years).</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/4">The Government are giving particular attention to the problem of burglary in Northern Ireland. In 2007-08, a total of 11,698 burglary offences were recorded by police in Northern Ireland, which represents a net 37 per cent drop in the level of burglary since 2002-03 (when 18,659 offences were recorded). During the same period, the number of domestic burglaries recorded by the police decreased by 34 per cent, from 10,125 to 6,712. These reductions largely correspond with the timing of a NIO PSA target to reduce the recorded level of domestic burglary between 2001-02 and 2006-07, the final outturn of which showed levels of burglary down 25 per cent, well ahead of the 15 per cent target.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.3/1">Under the provisions in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, the mixing of human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with animal gametes will not fall to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to be regulated unless the human DNA is in the form of a human gamete or the process of mixing the DNA results in an embryo where the animal DNA does not predominate. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill does not change the name of the HFEA.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/2">The use of intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection to generate true hybrids to be grown beyond the two-cell stage could be of use in the understanding of serious mitochondrial diseases. No project of research may be licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority unless it is satisfied that research is necessary or desirable for one of the statutory purposes set out in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill and the use of an embryo is necessary. It is unknown whether any species of animal's gametes could successfully undergo &quot;hybridisation&quot; with a human gamete. The closer an animal is to humans in evolutionary terms, the more likely there would be success, but humans are significantly more advanced than any other species of animal, making the chances of successful &quot;hybridisation&quot; with any species low, no matter how closely related they are to humans.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-03">3 June</phrase>, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Meg Munn, raised parliamentary and public concern about the situation of the Ahmadiyya community with the Indonesian ambassador. Our ambassador in Jakarta raised the matter with the Indonesian authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-28">28 April</phrase>. The EU also expressed concern to the Indonesian authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-28">28 May</phrase>. At the UN Human Rights Council's examination of Indonesia under the universal periodic review in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-09">9 April</phrase>, the UK raised the treatment of the Ahmadiyya community. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and look for opportunities to raise the issue of respect for religious freedom with the Indonesian authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">The intention of the programme-makers was to portray the normalisation of prison life in Northern Ireland after the Troubles, and to give the audience a fresh perspective on the complex and challenging issues faced on a daily basis. The series featured all three prison establishments and the Prison Service did not exercise any editorial control in relation to the programme content.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/2">The production crew of three people scheduled their observational filming and interviews with staff and prisoners around the prison regime. This ensured that there was no adjustment in staff complements. Participation was completely voluntary and all prisoners and members of staff who were interviewed gave prior written consent. Written consent was also given by other individuals appearing on camera, and where this was not possible, their images were pixilated.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/3">The Prison Service incurred no additional administrative costs through the making of the production.</p>

It is through the power of supervision that I am responsible to Parliament for the actions of the director and, through him, the Public Prosecution Service. It is in the nature of supervision that I am kept informed of difficult, complex or sensitive cases and of matters relating to the effective functioning of the service. The director may seek my advice on individual cases and I may offer advice but the decision to prosecute, or not to prosecute, remains the director's unless I direct, in which case the decision becomes mine. The power to direct a prosecution decision has never been used since the creation of the office of director in 1972.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.5/17" class="indent">1. School-based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home-to-school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.5/18" class="indent">2. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending local authority-maintained primary schools and are drawn from the DCSF schools census adjusted to be on a financial-year basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.5/19" class="indent">3. 2002-03 saw a break in the time series following the introduction of consistent financial reporting (CFR) to schools and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is after the 2001-02 figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.5/20" class="indent">4. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years include all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &pound;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &pound;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.5/21" class="indent">5. Cash-terms figures are converted to 1996-97 prices using March 2008 gross domestic product deflators.</p>

However, VOSA did issue some 15,000 prohibition notices to prevent continued non-compliance with the law by foreign-registered vehicles.</p>
