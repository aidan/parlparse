	<p pid="a.1.5/1">Winning Consent, the report of an inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), was published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-10">10 January</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary today arranged for a copy of the commissioner's formal response to the report, submitted to me in my capacity as Police Authority for the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), to be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">The inspection was carried out as a direct response to a recommendation of the report of the inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3">It was one of the most detailed and thorough inspections ever carried out by HMIC into specific aspects of policing in one police force, and examined community and race relations policies, and the handling of murder enquiries, in the MPS. Winning Consent contains 41 recommendations. Twenty-nine relate to diversity issues, and 12 are concerned with the content of murder investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/4">I welcome the commissioner's candid and very positive response. When the report was published, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary said that he expected senior management in the MPS to address the issues in it urgently and with vigour. This response confirms that they have done so. It demonstrates how much has already been achieved by the Metropolitan Police in implementing the report and reflects the commissioner's total commitment to meeting the challenges laid down and continuing the process of improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/5">The report makes 41 recommendations. The commissioner has accepted all of them (except one, which concerns a matter of professional, operational judgement, in the allocation of murder investigations within the Metropolitan Police). Many of the recommendations are for action to be implemented over time. The commissioner explains that there is a specific plan of action in place for each such recommendation; and some recommendations have already been implemented in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/6">A fuller account of my assessment of the commissioner's response is being placed, together with it, in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.2/1">The numbers of Commissions rogatoires (requests) for information on fraud received, actioned and completed in 1999 are shown in the tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">Requests sent to the Home Office are dealt with by the United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA) for Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, in the Organised and International Crime Directorate of the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/3">The UKCA database does not distinguish between different types of fraud cases, so the figures cover not only financial fraud, but other types of fraud as well, such as fraudulent trading.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/4">As requests for asset restraint and confiscation may be made in the context of financial fraud, these have been shown as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/5">&quot;Actioned&quot; denotes action taken by UKCA to forward the request to the appropriate agency, be it a police force, Customs and Excise, the Serious Fraud Office, a magistrates' court, or--less frequently--another agency. At the same time as actioning requests, the UKCA sends an acknowledgment to the requesting state, notifying it of the action taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/6">The UKCA has a target for actioning incoming requests of 20 working days. Therefore those requests received after early December will not have been actioned until early in 2000. Similarly, the figures for requests actioned will cover some requests received at the end of 1998. This explains the discrepancy between the &quot;Received&quot; and &quot;Actioned&quot; figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/7">How long requests take to be executed by these agencies is beyond the Home Office's control and depends on a wide variety of factors--for example, the complexity of the request, the availability of witnesses, the level of detail in the original request. The figures in the &quot;Completed&quot; columns will therefore represent a substantial number of requests received in 1998 or even earlier.</p>

Views were invited on a number of issues, including whether the new regulations should permit the voluntary display of the European Union symbol in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) No. 2411/98. In the light of the comments received, I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-30">30 March</phrase> this year that new regulations would be made in the near future to include provision for the voluntary use of the symbol. A copy of the Department's Press Release (number 252) was placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">The provision of number plates on new cars is a matter between the buyer and seller. The purpose of Council Regulation 2411/98 is to allow motorists to dispense with the need to display a separate national identity sticker when using their vehicles within the EU. Proposals for the Council regulation were discussed with member states in the normal way. I am not aware of any funding being made available to encourage the use of the EU symbol on number plates. It will be for individual motorists to decide if they wish to make use of this option or continue to use the traditional oval GB sticker when driving UK registered vehicles in other member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/1">The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have today jointly issued a consultation paper inviting views on whether any further action should be taken by government following the House of Lords ruling in this case. The paper proposes that an application for planning permission should in future be required for certain works of partial demolition within conservation areas, such as the demolition of boundary walls and fences.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/2">The proposals issued today are designed to address problems that have been identified as arising as a direct result of the Shimizu judgment. They are separate from, and do not prejudge, the broader review of heritage policy which my honourable friend the Minister for the Arts announced in November 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.2/3">Comments are requested by <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-14">14 August 2000</phrase>. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.5/1">We have received several representations from the Chairman of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust about the use of committal to prison for non-payment of local tax debts.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.5/2">Local authorities have responsiblity for the billing and collection of local taxes. While the Government cannot comment on the actions local authorities take in individual cases, imprisonment for non-payment of local taxes is very much the last resort in the enforcement process. Before authorities can make an application for committal to prison, they must have tried other enforcement measures first to recover the debt. Even where an application for committal to prison has been made by a local authority, the procedures themselves are designed to ensure that magistrates cannot hand down prison sentences without a thorough examination in the presence of the debtor of the reasons for failure to pay. Magistrates can only order a sentence if they find that non-payment was due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect on the part of the debtor. Indeed, magistrates have the power to remit all or part of a debt if they consider this is justified, for example, on grounds of severe financial hardship.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.5/2">Following a competition run by Vosper Thornycroft, the sub-contract to build the ships has been awarded to Appledore Shipbuilders in Devon. The ships, which are due to enter service in 2002 and 2003, will be named HMS &quot;Echo&quot; and HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.5/3">These important new warships demonstrate our commitment to the modern force structure that emerged from the Strategic Defence Review. They will be equipped with the latest survey systems, and provide a significantly enhanced surveying capability and much improved sea-keeping capability over the vessels which they will replace, which are old and increasingly costly to maintain. They will be part of the Fleet's front-line in a variety of world-wide operational roles, as well as undertaking specialist surveying tasks necessary to the long-term effectiveness of the Royal Navy.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.3/1">The National Health Service Executive collects data on the costs of clinical negligence claims, rather than the number or types of claims. It is therefore not possible to say how many claims were outstanding at the end of March for each of the years requested, or which relate to NHS dentistry. In relation to general dental practitioners, no information is collected on the number of claims, as claims are made against individual practitioners and not through the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/2">The recent Court of Appeal judgment about the level of general damages in personal injury cases means that this element of awards in future cases will not be decided on the basis set out in that judgment. The judgment also applies to all current outstanding claims and so has meant an immediate increase in costs to the NHS. However, these increases are not as significant as would have been the case if the Court of Appeal had decided to accept the recommendations on general damages levels made in the Law Commission's Report (No. 257) on this issue.</p>
