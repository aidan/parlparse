	<p pid="a.49.5/1">As we stated in the Police Reform White Paper of last December, we recognise that the current police pension scheme lacks the incentives to encourage officers to stay beyond 30 years and we are looking at ways of modernising police pensions to make them more flexible and affordable for future entrants. Any changes affecting new entrants will, however, take time to work through. We have therefore also been considering more immediate measures to retain the important skills and experience of officers beyond 30 years under the current police pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.5/2">The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) agreed in May flexible arrangements that would give managers in the police service scope to retain officers who are entitled to retire with maximum benefits where they so wish. The arrangements agreed by the PNB entail an officer retiring with a lump sum in the ordinary way and then being re-engaged in his or her previous rank where management consider that would be helpful. We are currently considering the details of these arrangements and the proposal that the scheme should initially be piloted in five forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.3/1">In response to concerns for nuclear test veterans about their health, two independent epidemiology studies were carried out on the Ministry of Defence's behalf by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), in conjunction with the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. The results of these studies were published in 1988 and 1993 and showed that, as a group, participation in the British atmospheric nuclear tests has not had a detectable effect on the expectation of life or on the risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases by those who took part.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/2">A third study has been undertaken by the NRPB into the incidence of multiple myeloma, other cancers and other causes of death among nuclear test veterans. The results of this study are expected to be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.6/1">There is no scientific or medical evidence that shows that the health or other physical problems suffered by the children and grandchildren of nuclear test veterans can be attributed to participation in the test programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/2">The recently published Seventh Report of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) has dismissed ideas of a general link between paternal preconceptional exposure to radiation and childhood cancer. Current information on radiation health effects suggests that studies of cancer among people exposed to radiation are likely to provide a more sensitive means of detecting such effects than studies of their children.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.0/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport is today publishing the final report of the English National Stadium Review, led by Patrick Carter, and placing copies in the Libraries of both Houses. The report reflects the detail of the agreements concluded by all principal parties on the national stadium project on <phrase class="date" code="">26 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/2">My right honourable friend set out on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-19">19 December 2001</phrase> in another place (Official Report, cols. 291&ndash;3) four tests which we expected the Football Association (FA) and Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL) to meet before the offer of government support to the national stadium project could be confirmed:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/3">First, an independent assessment of the multiplex stadium construction contracts: this was undertaken by Cyril Sweett Ltd and copies were placed in the House Libraries in May. Since May the contract has changed from a design, construct and finance arrangement to a design and construct contract. Cyril Sweett Ltd has therefore reviewed the new contract and produced an addendum report that concludes the new contract remains value for money. I am placing copies of the addendum report in the House Libraries today.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/4">Secondly, as my right honourable friend explained in her <phrase class="date" code="">7 May</phrase> statement in another place (Official Report, cols. 21&ndash;2), WNSL has made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General papers relating to the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/5">The third test is corporate governance changes to be made to produce a management structure capable of delivering a complex project within procedures acceptable to the public sector. In addition to the significant strengthening of the WNSL Board, already announced, a range of improved procedures are now in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/6">The fourth is confirmation that financial support was adequate and fully committed. As Patrick Carter's report sets out, this is now the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/7">Having reviewed the steps the FA and WNSL have taken since December last year and Patrick Carter's assessment of the progress made by WNSL, including his view that on balance our four tests have been met, we have confirmed the Government's support to the national stadium project which we had first offered in December. My right honourable friend has however also ensured that the public interest in the new national stadium is protected by stronger safeguards than those secured at the previous project's failed syndication in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/8">The time has come for Government to stand back as the project moves into the construction phase and is taken forward by the FA and WNSL. But, as Patrick Carter has noted, to safeguard the public interest, the project as a whole will require careful monitoring, and with Sport England and the London Development Agency we shall be putting in place new arrangements as recommended by the Office for Government Commerce.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.5/1">Exports of meat, meat products, livestock and genetic material can only take place with health certification which meets the importing country's requirements or, in the case of EU member states, which meets EU harmonised conditions. Health certification is in place for exports to EU member states and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is working closely with the industry, including through the export certification user groups, to identify priority non-EU markets and to persuade the authorities in those countries to lift remaining restrictions. Defra officials have been active in persuading overseas authorities to accept UK exports again by corresponding with veterinary authorities overseas and have arranged for British embassies and high commissions to make representations and to follow up correspondence. In co-operation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, through our network of British posts overseas, we have also launched a lobbying exercise of all host governments which continue to maintain a ban on British beef, meat and animal products. We have been, and will continue, supporting our livestock companies and associations at international trade shows and have arranged inward missions of Ministers and officials. We are devoting considerable resources to reopening markets and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.5/2">Defra is also working closely with the industry to promote British meat, products and livestock exports at trade fairs and will have a presence at several overseas shows this year. Of the &pound;2.5 million made available by Defra during 2001&ndash;02 for the foot and mouth disease recovery plan, some &pound;750,000 was used by Food From Britain to promote and build exports of food, including meat and meat products. During the current year, of a further &pound;500,000 provided for rebuilding the export market, around &pound;350,000 will be used specifically for meat and meat products. The Meat and Livestock Commission, Defra's non-departmental public body responsible for promoting British meat and meat products at home and abroad, is very active assisting meat exporters to re-establish markets, especially in continental Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.3/2">We are proposing, with the agreement of my noble friend Lord Rooker, Minister for Planning, to improve the protection afforded to these threatened species by integrating the requirements of the directive within the land-use planning process, ensuring consideration of all the relevant issues within the planning process rather than in two separate regimes. Officials in Defra and the ODPM have worked closely together in drawing up the proposals and a public consultation will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/3">The proposals should improve the implementation of the Habitats Directive by ensuring that planning authorities take the directive's provisions relating to European protected species, such as great crested newts, and bats, fully into account in considering development applications. The proposals will also reduce the regulatory burden on business by integrating the two regimes and thereby removing the need for a separate consent to be sought following grant of planning permission. It will therefore be a quicker, more streamlined and effective process.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-10-16a.59.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo021016/text/21016w03.htm#21016w03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.59.5/1">The World Summit on Sustainable Development addressed some of the greatest challenges of our times. For over a year my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had said the summit should be about more than just fine words. It should be about a step-change&mdash;a move from words to concerted action and implementation. And it was. The Secretary of State also made clear from the beginning that separate fora would take forward discussion on climate change and on trade, including trade in agricultural produce.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2">So Johannesburg built on the success of last year's Doha talks on the new trade round, the Marrakech accords on climate change and this year's Monterrey conference on financing for development. It reaffirmed and strengthened the international community's commitment to sustainable development and reinvigorated the Rio Earth Summit agreements, as well as the UN Millennium Development Goals on poverty eradication. There are no silver-bullet solutions, no miracle cures. But what we do have is a new political commitment, momentum and energy for the attainment of a sustainable world.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/3">As in all negotiations, we were rightly ambitious, given the agenda we had. We judge the final deal reached between the 180 participating countries&mdash;for which the UK, led by the Prime Minister, negotiated hard&mdash;to be a successful outcome. We went to Johannesburg to make a concrete difference to people's lives. We believe that we succeeded. And, while I understand the disappointment of those who pushed us for more, I believe that what was achieved, taken in conjunction with the UN Millennium Development Goals, will, if implemented, represent a revolution in the lives of the poorest people on the planet and the beginnings of a revolution in how we treat the planet itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/4">The summit agreed an impressive plan of implementation. We agreed a new target to halve by 2015 the proportion of people living without basic sanitation. This will save millions of lives in developing countries, and support existing goals on safe drinking water and health. There are also new targets and timetables on chemicals, biodiversity, marine protection and fish stocks. These and other commitments will galvanise action and set standards for the next 10 years or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/5">The summit also agreed joint actions on reliable and affordable energy provision for the poor and urgently and substantially to increase the global share of renewable energy sources. The provision of energy is a prerequisite for the achievement of the millennium development goals. The summit did not set a global target for renewables, but even those countries which resisted a global target have nevertheless committed themselves to domestic action. At the summit the Prime Minister announced that the UK's Export Credit Guarantee Department will make available &pound;50 million per year to renewable energy exports to developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/6">And on climate change, Johannesburg issued a ringing call for countries to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Three key developing countries&mdash;China, India and Brazil&mdash;recently ratified. And crucially, in his positive statement at the summit, the Russian Prime Minister Kasyanov again signalled that Russia is preparing to ratify the protocol. The Canadian Prime Minister, Chretien, said that Canada will make a decision on ratification later this year. We are hopeful that the Kyoto Protocol might enter into force in early 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/7">Over 300 new partnerships were also launched at the summit, representing in excess of $235 million in resources. We are familiar with the idea of partnerships at home. But this is a bold new idea for the UN. These partnerships will be the unique inheritance of Johannesburg&mdash;they are not a substitute for multilateral commitments, but they will provide additional and complementary resources. For example, the EU Water for Life Initiative and the UK-led multistakeholder partnership for water and sanitation will support the delivery of the new sanitation target and the existing goals on safe drinking water and health.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/8">Johannesburg has given the global community a strong mandate for intensified action at global, regional and national levels. More fundamentally, it has forged close links between development and environment policy in the service of sustainable development. There is now a widespread agreement that development assistance should be directed at helping the poor and that it needs to be sustainable if it is to be of lasting benefit. Sustainable management of natural resources and of the environment are essential for poverty eradication. This now needs to be reflected in the poverty reduction and sustainable development strategies of developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/9">We shall work with our partners in the international institutions&mdash;the UN, the G8 and the OECD&mdash;to ensure that development and environment policy are mutually supportive. We need to ensure that the follow-up to Johannesburg, Monterrey and the Millennium Development Goals is coherent. International trade and climate change issues already have dedicated international processes of their own. On both, the UK Government are taking a lead role.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/10">The Prime Minister has hammered home the case for trade reform, especially of agricultural subsidies. Developing countries need improved market access so they can sell their produce fairly without being hampered by trade-distorting and environmentally-damaging subsidies in the developed countries. This is the single most important issue we need to follow up after Johannesburg. Improved market access and subsidy reform are a joint concern for development and environment policy. Currently OECD countries give around $55 billion in overseas aid but subsidise their agricultural industries by around seven times that amount. CAFOD has suggested that through the CAP the average European dairy cow gets a $2 subsidy a day&mdash;the same as the daily income of half the world's population. We will continue to push for reform of agricultural subsidies both within the WTO and, within the EU, on the common agricultural policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/11">And on climate change, later this month, the Secretary of State will be in Delhi for the next stage of the UN negotiations on implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/12">The implementation of the EU's sustainable development strategy will be a driver for change in Europe. In particular, it will need to reflect the summit agreement to develop a global 10-year framework of action programmes to accelerate the shift towards sustainable production and consumption. We need to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation&mdash;to get more from less. The industrialised North has agreed to take the lead on this and it must be central to the EU's strategy. This means action on a whole range of issues such as energy efficiency, waste minimisation&mdash;a real challenge for us in the UK&mdash;and integrated product policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/13">But equally important is action we will take at home. We will integrate the Johannesburg agreements and relevant follow-up into UK policy and action, with a sharp focus on the use of technological innovation to deliver sustainable development. If, as a nation, we achieve greater resource efficiency, this will not only help our environment but also improve our competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/14">On energy, we are working towards our 10 per cent renewable electricity target by 2010. We are making great strides in both energy efficiency and tackling fuel poverty. On climate change, we have been leading globally in the Kyoto process. We are on track to meet our Kyoto target of a 12.5 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and have put in place a comprehensive programme of measures to meet our more ambitious domestic goal to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/15">The Government will shortly publish an Energy White Paper that addresses how to set the UK on the longer term path to a low carbon economy, as the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and others have recommended. In particular, the commission has recommended we put ourselves on the path to 60 per cent reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. We will respond formally to that recommendation at the time of the White Paper, but already it is clear that action on that scale&mdash;in the UK and internationally&mdash;is what is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/16">And this autumn we shall be taking receipt of, and later responding to, the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit's report on how we manage waste, stemming growth and prompting recycling and re-use.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/17">Last week the Secretary of State hosted a meeting with leading UK stakeholders to discuss the follow-up action by government and stakeholders at UK level. This provided a useful forum for us to discuss the proposals developed by stakeholders and within government and to establish some shared conclusions on the implications of the summit.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/18">Our next review of progress towards sustainable development, which will be out early in the new year, will include further details on how we intend to take the Johannesburg outcomes forward. Over the course of the next year we will also be reviewing the UK sustainable development strategy and meeting our summit commitments will form a significant part of this.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/19">Perhaps the most innovative feature of the summit was the emphasis on partnerships between governments and civil society, particularly NGOs and business. The UK delegation therefore included Members of the House of Commons, representatives from the devolved administrations, local government, the UK sustainable development commission, from business and NGOs; and since this was a summit on the future, four youth representatives. Besides the formal government negotiations there was a wealth of other events and initiatives. UK participants were active everywhere and made a huge contribution to the overall outcome. Governments must take the lead in setting the framework for sustainable development, they cannot deliver it alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/20">Johannesburg demonstrated that it is possible to reach agreement on practical steps towards a more sustainable world. We must, and will, keep moving forward. In the words of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, this summit will put us on a path that reduces poverty while protecting the environment, a path that works for all peoples, rich and poor, today and tomorrow. We have to go out and take action. This is not the end. It is the beginning.</p>
