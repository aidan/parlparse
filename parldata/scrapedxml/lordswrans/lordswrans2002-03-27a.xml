	<p pid="a.45.5/1">The White Paper made a shorthand reference to the basic proposition of the Royal Commission; namely, that existing life Peers should retain their right to life membership. That is what the Royal Commission proposed for the vast majority of existing life Peers. The Government rejected the proposal in Recommendation 103, that life Peers appointed after the publication of the Royal Commission's report should be deemed to have been appointed for 15 years, on the same grounds as led the Royal Commission to make its basic proposition contained in Recommendation 102. At the time of appointment, those life Peers would reasonably expect that their appointment would have been for life, given that the Government had made no announcement that it intended to seek to implement Recommendation 103. Since <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-20">20 January 2000</phrase>, there have been 34 creations of Labour life Peers, 11 Conservatives and 14 Liberal Democrats, with creation being defined as the issue of a first Writ of Summons after that date. Labour still has 21 fewer Members of the House than the Conservatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.5/1">The UK, along with the rest of our EU partners, does not consider the West Bank and Gaza to be covered by the trade provisions of the EU/Israel Association Agreement. The West Bank and Gaza are incorporated in a separate interim preferential trade agreement between the EC and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/2">The European Union has insisted in its discussions with the Israeli authorities that the territorial scope of the EU/Israel Agreement must be respected. The European Commission has undertaken technical discussions with Israel in search of a solution to this issue. The Commission has also published, in November 2001, a notice to importers in the Official Journal of the European Communities. This notice alerted EC importers of the ineligibility of products originating in the Occupied Territories for the preferences provided by the EU/Israel Association Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/3">HMC&amp;E, with other member states' customs authorities are verifying the origin of certain products. If these products are found to have originated in the Occupied Territories HMC&amp;E may request a guarantee against the difference between the preferential tariff and the normal tariff applied to these goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/4">Article 2 of the agreement states that, &quot;Relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreements itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy, and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement.&quot; Israel is in addition bound by the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/5">We understand the intense political pressures on the Israeli Government to respond to repeated suicide bombings and our condemnation of terrorism in all its forms is unequivocal. Israel has the right, like all states, to takes measures in self-defence. However, Israel's response must be proportionate and avoid civilian casualties. We therefore have concerns with certain measures implemented by Israel in response to the current intifada, including the practice of extra-judicial killings, the imposition of the closures and the destruction of Palestinian homes and agricultural land. Both bilaterally and through the EU, we have made these concerns clear and urged Israel to cease such practices.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/1">We have received no evidence that equipment manufactured in the UK and licensed for export by this Government has been used by Israeli forces in the Occupied Territories during the recent and continuing violence. Most UK exports have been components for pieces of technology, which can be embedded in other systems and are therefore not visible. The UK has not licensed for export main equipment such as tanks, aircraft, warships or artillery to Israel since May 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/2">However, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-11">11 March</phrase>, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs the Member for Exeter informed the House of Commons that new information had come to light that UK-supplied equipment licensed for export under a previous administration, and a different export control regime, is being used by the Israelis in the Occupied Territories. This relates to a number of Centurion tanks, exported to Israel between 1958 and 1970, which the Israelis have modified into armoured personnel carriers.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/3">This contradicts a written assurance that the Israel Government gave us on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-29">29 November 2000</phrase> that &quot;no UK originated equipment nor any UK originated systems/sub-systems/components are used as part of the Israel Defence Force's activities in the Territories&quot;. We have urgently sought an explanation from the Israeli Government. We shall inform both Houses of the outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/4">We consider all export licence applications to Israel on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking careful account on a case by case basis of the nature of the equipment and the proposed end-use and end-user.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.5/1">There are no plans to amend the criminal injuries compensation (overseas) (CIC(O)) scheme rules. This scheme exists to provide compensation for sevice personnel injured as a result of a criminal act while serving overseas. The CIC(O)'s provisions mirror those of the criminal injuries compensation schemes of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and thus ensure that service personnel serving abroad are placed in the same position as those serving in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.5/2">Sergeant Trevor Walker's injuries were the result of military activity by warring factions in Bosnia. Since this was not a &quot;criminal act&quot; within the terms of the CIC(O) scheme, he was not eligible for compensation under the scheme. This judgment has been upheld by the Divisional Court, Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. In circumstances such as Sergeant Walker's, compensation would normally be through the payment of benefits for attributable injury under the war pension scheme (WPS) and the armed forces pension scheme (AFPS) on medical discharge. Sergeant Walker currently remains in service. He will be entitled to receive a war pension on retirement. He will also receive compensation under the AFPS if he is subsequently medically discharged as a result of his injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.5/3">The Ministry of Defence has been conducting a review of compensation arrangements for service personnel and the proposals for a new compensation scheme (to replace the WPS and attributable benefits under the AFPS) to include compensation for service personnel injured as a result of terrorism or warlike activities, even if they remain in service. It is proposed that service personnel injured on or after the date of the new scheme's introduction would be covered by the new arrangements. Injuries which pre-date the new scheme's introduction would be covered by current compensation arrangements.</p>

Seven per cent of the cases for the years in question have yet to go to the panel pending the collation of further information.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">In a further 25 per cent of cases either the relevant information is not available or it was not considered appropriate to write to the individual. For the remaining cases, exceptional circumstances would usually have been the main cause for the longer time periods involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/3">It should be noted that it is not the panel's purpose to advise individuals on possible links between pesticide exposure and ill health but rather to see if any general lessons can be derived from cumulative information on incidents and to report annually. Nevertheless, the secretariat endeavours to inform individuals of the outcome of their assessment as soon as possible after panel meetings.</p>

As regards to medicines for human use, the licensing authority is responsible for the issue of marketing authorisations.

Civil or criminal liability may arise where any such party does not fulfil its legal responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.6/1">Training and enterprise councils (TECs) were private companies and it was for them to determine the remuneration levels and pension arrangements for their staff. A range of different pension schemes were in place across the TEC network, including final salary, group money purchase and group personal pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.6/2">TEC staff transferred under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, 1981 (TUPE) to the Learning and Skills Council and joined the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) unless they chose to opt out. The Department for Education and Skills is ensuring that every member of the various TEC pension schemes, whether money purchase or final salary, has been granted their full statutory rights in relation to transfer values from their scheme. It has also worked to ensure that those transferred have been treated fairly and consistently, securing a range of flexibilities within PCSPS which will benefit the pension arrangements of many transferees.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.6/3">The transfer value of a pension is dependent upon the available assets within the scheme and funding decisions made by the employer and/or the individual. This has meant that many former TEC staff will be able to secure year-for-year transfer values in PCSPS, while some will secure more than year-for-year and others less.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.6/4">The only circumstance where it would be appropriate for the Government to consider taking action would be where it became evident that a TEC had not fully met its contractual and legal obligations in respect of its pension arrangements and we are not aware at present of any such cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.2/1">Based on recommendations from the Environment Agency, it (by authority of the Secretary of State) was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-05">5 March 2002</phrase> that we have reviewed the identification of sensitive areas in England in accordance with the criteria in Part I of Schedule I of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (England and Wales) Regulations 1994 (which transposes the European Council Directive (91/271/EEC) concerning urban waste water treatment).</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/2">This review has resulted in the identification of four freshwater stretches of the Rivers Stour, Wissey, Chelmer and Leam, which are intended for the abstraction of drinking water, to be identified as sensitive areas (nitrate) on the basis of elevated levels of nitrate under the terms of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/3">These new requirements on water companies to remove nitrate from sewage treatment discharges will complement the action required by farmers under the Nitrates Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/4">Work to provide more stringent treatment (nitrogen removal) at six qualifying treatment works is expected to be completed by end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/5">One hundred and eighty bathing waters (already identified under the Bathing Waters Regulations 1991) in England are also to be identified as sensitive areas as discharges from qualifying sewage treatment works receive, or are to receive by 2005, more stringent treatment (ultraviolet disinfection) to fulfil standards of those regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/6">Funding for these improvements have already been provided for in the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) periodic review of water company price limits for the five-year period from 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/7">We are committed to a steady improvement to Britain's freshwater and bathing quality. Already we have the best-ever recorded bathing water quality. Today's moves mean that we can continue our efforts to ensure clean and healthy water both for this country's inhabitants and its aquatic life.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/8">A list of the new sensitive areas will be printed in Hansard, and maps showing the location of all current sensitive areas (nitrate) and (bathing waters) will be deposited in the Library of the House and at offices of the Environment Agency in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">Trunk roads within Scotland are a devolved issue, and a matter for the Scottish Executive. Cross-border issues are addressed through dialogue and discussion between the Government, their agencies and the Scottish Executive.</p>
