	<p pid="a.1.5/1">This Government have made clear their commitment to reinvigorate the Middle East peace process. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister met the Palestinian Authority President, Yasser Arafat, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-15">15 October</phrase> and visited Egypt for talks with President Mubarak on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-11">11 October</phrase>.

The Foreign Secretary discussed the Middle East peace process with US Secretary of State Powell when he visited Washington on 23 and <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-24">24 October</phrase> and also discussed the Middle East peace process with EU Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-29">29 October</phrase>. Following that meeting the EU issued a declaration which called on Israel to withdraw from Area A land and the Palestinian Authority to arrest those responsible for violence against Israel, and called on both parties to resume negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">We are working in concert with the US and EU to get the peace process back on track by urging restraint and a resumption of negotiations on the basis of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell Committee report. The goal remains a permanent settlement, based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of &quot;land for peace&quot;; security for Israel within recognised borders; and an end to occupation, which allows the emergence of a viable, democratic and peaceful Palestinian state committed to co-existence with Israel.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.2/1">In 1994, the Government withdrew the embarkation control for passengers travelling to continental destinations from ferry ports and small/medium sized airports. The residual embarkation control at the large airports was reconfigured by the Immigration Service in March 1998 after a lengthy period of consultation with interested parties. The routine presence of immigration officers was replaced by a new arrangement based on an intelligence-led approach, with enhanced co-operation between the agencies and an increased use of CCTV technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/2">The reconfiguration of the embarkation control means that the Immigration Service can now use its resources more flexibly, concentrating on key delivery areas, while operating a targeted embarkation control any time there is an immigration-related operational need. It has a contingency plan for emergency, short-term targeted embarkation controls, which can be set up at one hour's notice if there was an urgent operational need. This involves setting up an embarkation control at the traditional point and an additional gate check embarkation control at airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.2/3">I do not think a return to a routine, manual embarkation control is a sensible use of Immigration Service resources, which is why we are considering as a matter of urgency a range of measures to enhance border security, including the use of new technology.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">The EU arms embargo was lifted at the General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-08">8 October 2001</phrase> due to the improved security situation and ongoing process of internal reforms undertaken by the FRY authorities. In light of this, the Government have decided to lift the controls imposed in 1996 on exports to the FRY of all wheel drive vehicles capable of off-road use that have a ground clearance of greater than 175 millimetres; heavy duty recovery vehicles capable of towing a suspended load of more than 6 tonnes or winching a load of more than 10 tonnes; and drop-sided trucks that have a load-carrying capacity of more than 5 tonnes. An amendment to the Export Control (Goods) Order will be made in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/2">The Government have also decided to lift the policy, as announced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-14">14 March 2000</phrase>, of presumption of refusal for the export of dual use goods to the FRY which could benefit the armed forces, internal security forces or similar entities of the authorities in Belgrade. Again, with the change to a democratic government in the FRY and ongoing improvements in the security structures there, we have no reason to continue doing so. This will bring our export control policy on the FRY in line with that on most other countries. All future applications for dual use goods to the FRY will be judged on a case-by-case basis, on their merits, against the consolidated EU and national export licensing criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">This research concluded that the experience of pain in the unborn or new-born is still poorly understood and pointed to concern about the effects of anaesthetics and analgesics. The possibility of harmful long-term effects of pain in prematurely born babies is a matter of serious concern, but this has to be carefully balanced against the potential risks of the analgesics themselves. It is essential to establish that the treatment does not do greater harm to the developing brain than the pain it is intended to relieve and for this understanding to be reached before it is possible to issue guidance.</p>

As identified in the strategy, a range of organisations and enterprises with tourism, conservation and rural development responsibilities will have a role in implementation at a national, regional and local level.

	<p pid="a.5.5/1">Between 1987 and 1999 a total of four persons were prosecuted for incitement offences under the Public Order Order 1987. All four offenders were found guilty and the most serious penalty imposed was six months' detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.5/2">As the number of prosecutions under the order is small, I have not answered the Question on a year to year basis.</p>
