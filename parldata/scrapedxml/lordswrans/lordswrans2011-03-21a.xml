	<p pid="a.101.2/1">Apprenticeships are designed around employers' needs for performance in a particular skill, trade or occupation, and the same requirements apply to all apprentices. An apprenticeship framework comprises the separate elements of a competence-based qualification, a technical certificate, transferable functional or key skills or their GCSE equivalent and non-certificated elements covering employee rights and responsibilities, and practical learning and thinking skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/2">We have had no representations specifically focused on dyslexia, other than correspondence on individual cases. A working group of external experts chaired by Peter Little OBE is advising officials on access to the apprenticeship programme for people with disabilities and/or learning difficulties, including implementation of the flexibility that will allow people with disabilities to use alternative forms of evidence to establish their suitability for an apprenticeship. The Apprenticeships Unit has commissioned a study led by SKILL to analyse apprenticeship disability data and develop recommendations on ways to make the programme more accessible and improve success rates for disabled apprentices.</p>

Both of these were subject to an equality impact assessment. All apprenticeship frameworks are based on the Specification of Apprenticeship Standards in England (SASE) on which disability organisations were consulted. Framework developers are required to have regard to disability legislation in preparing apprenticeship frameworks and quality assurance guidelines for framework development reinforce this. Issuing authorities have directions and guidance from the Secretary of State to ensure that the quality assurance guidelines are adhered to.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.2/1">The Ministry's aim has been to demonstrate the effectiveness of Together Women and similar women's community projects and embed the different approach as part of local commissioning arrangements. Many projects have received funding from a range of sources, including probation trusts and local authorities, but securing sufficient funding to sustain service delivery has become more challenging. The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has committed to provide further investment to sustain the majority of the projects in the financial year 2011-12. A full announcement will follow shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/2">As a result of this more local approach to commissioning each project has a different funding arrangement. In all cases funding levels will be lower than 2010-11 to take account of the need for efficiencies.</p>

Having assessed the handling of Financial Services Authority (FSA) parliamentary questions, we have decided that it would be appropriate to retain the current practice whereby the FSA writes directly to Peers and Members in response to their questions. The Government believe that retention of that practice is both transparent-Members and Peers can make the replies they receive public in any way they see fit-and proper in terms of the FSA's operational independence from Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.5/2">The UK was the first country to respond to the UN High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) and International Organisation for Migration (IOM) appeal for financial and logistical support to help repatriate people on the Libya-Tunisia border. For example, in response to a UNHCR request, the Department for International Development (DfID) has sent 38,000 blankets and 1,400 tents, providing shelter for up to 10,000 people stranded at the Libya-Tunisia border. In addition, two DfID Air Logistics Officers have joined UNHCR's Humanitarian Evacuation team to help the smooth running of the airlift operation. We continue to work with the UNCHR to get help to those in need and to make sure that we have the right supplies and people in position to be able to react to all eventualities.</p>

What we do know is that the process for making this decision will be more rigorous in the future, and will follow two basic steps. The first is to assess the Government of Uganda's commitment to the following: poverty reduction and the millennium development goals; respecting human rights and other international obligations; improving public financial management, promoting good governance and transparency and fighting corruption; and strengthening domestic accountability. The second step will involve assessing whether budget support can achieve better results and value for money than other instruments.</p>
