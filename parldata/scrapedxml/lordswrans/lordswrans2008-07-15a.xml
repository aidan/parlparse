<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-07-15a.132.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="132"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80715w0001.htm#80715w0001.htm_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.132.0/1">Overseas firms operate in the UK through a mixture of branches and subsidiaries. With regard to subsidiaries, a UK-incorporated subsidiary of an Icelandic bank is a British bank and is authorised by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) like other British banks. All subsidiaries are required to comply with FSA rules on capital, liquidity, complaints and the FSCS. All UK-incorporated subsidiaries of Icelandic banks regulated by the Financial Services Authority continue to meet threshold conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/2">With regards to branches, firms from an EEA state are permitted to passport a branch into the UK under EU legislation and are authorised by their home state regulator. The FSA is responsible for the supervision of conduct of business, financial crime and liquidity in respect of these EEA firms' UK branch business. The home state regulator is the prudential supervisor. However all EEA banks are required to meet the capital requirements implemented in their member states under the Banking Consolidation Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive. And the FSA has a regular dialogue with overseas regulators and firms where the firms passport into the UK, to share information about the firms and specifically their UK operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/3">With regard to the Icelandic Deposit Guarantees and Investor-Compensation Scheme, the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme maintains contact with schemes in other member states. There are currently two major Icelandic players in the UK: Landsbanki provides its Icesave product through a UK branch while Kaupthing's Edge product is provided through a UK-incorporated subsidiary. As Kaupthing Edge's deposits are collected through a UK-incorporated subsidiary, they are covered exclusively by the UK's FSCS in the same way as savers with other British banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/4">As Icesave is provided through a UK branch, its home state compensation scheme will apply. Where there is a gap between the coverage of the home state scheme and the UK maximum, where an EEA firm opts to contribute to the FSCS the deposit will be protected up to the UK maximum. This is the case with Icesave: it has &quot;topped up&quot; into the FSCS; the first &euro;20,887 (around &pound;16,700) of savers' money falls within the scope of the Icelandic deposit guarantee scheme while the remaining amount of the claim up to &pound;35,000 is covered by the FSCS. Therefore, savers with up to &pound;35,000 in an Icesave account would be protected against any losses in a similar way as if their savings were in a British bank.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.132.3/12">The department changed payroll provider contracts in 2003-04 and the cost of retrieving bonus information for 2003-04 would be disproportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.3/13">The department has two sets of arrangements under which bonuses can be awarded. For senior civil servants (SCSs), pay arrangements are common across all government departments. The department's senior pay strategy, which conforms to these common arrangements, explains that bonuses may be awarded for delivery of personal objectives or other short-term personal contributions to wider organisational objectives. Individuals are required to agree their priorities with their manager at the beginning of the performance year. Line managers then make recommendations for performance bonuses which are considered by the department's pay committees at the end of the performance year. The pay committees, which meet annually, make the final decision on whether a bonus should be awarded, relative to the performance of others.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.3/14">For staff below the SCS, the department operates a special bonus scheme whereby managers may award a bonus to recognise an outstanding contribution in a particularly demanding situation. This can include a temporary and substantial increase in job loading, dealing with pressures arising from temporary vacancies or job requirements, a high level of commitment and resolution to get a job done, difficulties requiring a special effort to overcome or a contribution over and above what would normally be expected for the job and of the person, or team, concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.5/1">It is for each local authority to decide the priority that it attaches to financial support for rural bus services in its area. The resources available to include revenue support grant from central government and the inclusion within area-based funding of rural bus subsidy grant which totals &pound;57 million this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.5/2">The measures in the Local Transport Bill, now before Parliament, will help enable local authorities to improve the availability and quality of bus services in rural and urban areas alike. These measures include strengthened arrangements for partnerships between local authorities and bus operators, expanding the role of community transport, extending the existing taxi-bus provisions to the private hire vehicle sector and for the first time the establishment of a statutory bus passengers' champion.</p>

The European Commission's consultation document on which interested parties are asked to comment, does not contain any proposals regarding the borderline between medical devices and medicines. The borderline is determined by the definitions of medical devices and medicinal products in their respective directives. This was only recently clarified in an amendment to the Medicinal Products Directive which came into force in 2005 and a more recent review of the Medical Devices Directive completed in September 2007 did not consider that any further adjustments were required. Any differences in interpretation can be raised by national regulatory authorities at a European level and reflected in guidance issued by the appropriate working groups to enable consistent application between member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.2/2">Table 2 documents the total number of convictions for burglary, the number sentenced to immediate custody and the average custodial sentence length (in months). Data cover the calendar years 2004 to 2006 (the latest available years) and are collated on the principal offence rule, so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">It is not possible to compare recorded crime data in table 1 with conviction data in table 2 as an offence recorded as burglary may subsequently be prosecuted on a different basis&mdash;for example, as theft. In addition, recorded crime data are offence-based while prosecution and conviction data are offender-based. Specific attention is currently being given to the problem of burglary in Northern Ireland. In 2007-08, a total of 11,698 burglary offences were recorded by police in Northern Ireland, which represents a net 37 per cent drop in the level of burglary since 2002-03 (when 18,659 offences were recorded).</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/4">The number of domestic burglaries recorded by the police fell by 34 per cent during this period, from 10,125 to 6,712. These reductions correspond closely with the timing of an NIO PSA target to reduce the recorded level of domestic burglary between 2001-02 and 2006-07 by 15 per cent. The actual reduction in the level of domestic burglary during this period was 25 per cent, which was well ahead of the prescribed target.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.8/1">The Government announced, in March 2008 that they would undertake post-legislative reviews of Acts of Parliament, other than Finance Acts, between three and five years after the legislation came into force. The Government agreed with the Law Commission report <I>Post-</I><I>l</I><I>egislative Scrutiny</I> (Cm 6945) that it would be premature at this stage to establish a dedicated system for post-legislative review of secondary legislation as such. However, review of each Act should properly include the consideration of all or much of the delegated legislation made under the Act. Any such scrutiny should reflect any work already done by other Committees of the House, including the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the House of Lords Merits Committee. Further information on the Government response to the Law Commission report can be found at: <a href="http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm73/7320/7320.pdf">www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm73/7320/7320.pdf</a>.</p>
