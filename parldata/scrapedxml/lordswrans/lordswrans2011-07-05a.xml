	<p pid="a.31.5/1">We do not currently hold information on all service personnel receiving in-patient treatment in NHS hospitals as, for example, those that enter of their own accord are placed under a generic category by the respective hospital, thus making them difficult to identify.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/2">However, what can be provided are the numbers of service personnel medically evacuated currently either receiving, or waiting for, secondary healthcare within the hospitals that host our Ministry of Defence (MoD) Hospital Units (MDHUs) or at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The data have been extracted from the Defence Patient Tracking System (DPTS) as at <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-23">23 June 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/3">There are 58 UK service personnel recorded as currently receiving in-patient treatment in NHS hospitals. In addition, there are 702 UK service personnel recorded with a future appointment expected, of which six have an in-patient appointment booked and 41 have a future appointment booked. It is not currently known whether the remaining 655 service personnel will be offered an in-patient or out-patient appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/4">The MoD also has contractual arrangements with several NHS trusts, where it commissions elective secondary healthcare against an accelerated pathway of 10 weeks, primarily for personnel who are about to deploy on operations and who develop medical problems that place them in medically downgraded categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/5">The data provided are provisional and subject to change as the DPTS is a live system and is subject to constant updates.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.5/6">The 2011-12 budget for the treatment of Armed Forces personnel in NHS facilities is just under &#163;21 million which includes in-patient and out-patient activity. The annual in-patient activity is projected to be approximately 9,000 personnel for 2011-12. In addition to these contracts service personnel can be treated in any NHS facility under NHS-funded arrangements, as mentioned above. The MoD does not have data for this activity and they could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/1">A total of 1,162 trained defence medical personnel are currently working within host NHS Trusts. This figure is fluid as a consequence of medical personnel being deployed on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/2">There are also a number of personnel on short-term detachments and/or locally arranged placements that have an honorary contract within an NHS hospital in order to maintain professional currency. These contracts are generally arranged by the individuals, therefore numbers are difficult to establish. There are also a number of medical personnel in training that have not been included in the figures above because they are yet to provide a service.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/3">It is difficult to quantify the percentage of work related to non-military patients as Defence Medical Services (DMS) personnel are placed in host NHS Trusts to develop and maintain their clinical skills in order to meet operational requirements. By definition military personnel are a fit group and normally require routine, non-urgent treatment whereas DMS personnel need exposure to very sick and/or complex patients. The predominance of their clinical focus is therefore civilian, the exception to this being the care provided to operational casualties at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.</p>

The next step is for the research studies commissioned by the Department for Transport to be referred to the Committee on Toxicity. This will be done once the last study-swab test research-has been completed by the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh.</p>

Statutory guidance published jointly with the Department of Health in 2001 sets out the national minimum standards for the education of children who are unable to attend school because of medical needs. It also sets out the roles and responsibilities of mainstream schools in meeting the needs of children who are on their roll but are away from school due to illness.

As such, the obligation to collect and report these data was removed from local authorities in line with the announcement made by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in October 2010. The indicator estimated the proportion of dwellings occupied by benefit recipients in each area that were either energy-efficient (SAP 65 and above), or energy-inefficient (SAP 35 and below) which is not a measure of fuel poverty. Modelled data, published by DECC and produced centrally, estimate fuel poverty consistently and on a similar basis to that used for the national statistics on fuel poverty. It places no burden on local authorities. In addition, users and local authorities responded positively to a consultation carried out in 2009 on the modelled sub-regional data.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/14">Power stations do not operate at 100 per cent as the system needs to respond to changes in demand for electricity. CCGT output largely follows changes in electricity demand during the day and the relative price between gas and coal. The load factor fell in 2009 due to lower electricity demand, the increase in nuclear output and an increase in capacity as a new station opened.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/15">Load factors at nuclear stations are lower in recent years compared to the peak of 80 per cent seen in the late 1990s. This is due to an increase in maintenance work. In 2008 the load factor was particularly low due to additional outages at Heysham and Hartlepool.</p>

This has relieved pressure from the Cromwell Green Entrance as all Lords' banqueting guests can now be admitted via Black Rod's Garden Entrance. In order to further relieve pressure on the Cromwell Green Entrance, a trial is being conducted to assess the impact of some visitor route tours beginning at Black Rod's Garden Entrance, and a proposal is also being developed to make improvements to the search lanes in Portcullis House.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.2/1">At this early stage in the Government's proposals for a high-speed rail network, no decisions have been made regarding the detailed specification of rolling stock. At this point however, the Government do not anticipate that trains operating on HS2 will be capable of tilting, either on the high-speed network or on the conventional network. This is because tilting trains are necessarily heavier than non-tilting trains, and increasing the weight of a vehicle ultimately results in a reduction of maximum speed. This means that a tilting train would not be able to operate at speeds of 225 mph or 250 mph as required by the HS2 route.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/2">We tested our assumptions on tilting trains both with train manufacturers and with our technical challenge panel, who agreed with our conclusions. It is possible that future technology would permit a tilting high-speed train to be built, but no manufacturer could visualise and offer either credible costs or likelihood of successful commercial development of such a product. There are currently no tilting high-speed trains anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/3">Services running off HS2 onto the west coast main line to continue to Scotland would be speed-limited by the curvature of the route in a number of locations. However there is scope for increasing the non-tilt line speed from 110 mph to 125 mph or higher at a number of locations. Between Lichfield-where HS2 rejoins the WCML-and Glasgow, the difference in time between a non-tilting 110 mph train and a tilting 125 mph Pendolino is estimated to be 13 minutes. HS2 Ltd believes that by reviewing the assumptions behind the WCML upgrade works it should be possible to run non-tilting trains at 125 mph for lengthy sections, and thereby regain 6 or 7 of the lost 13 minutes. Similarly from Lichfield to Manchester a 110 mph non-tilt train would lose two minutes, of which we believe one minute could be regained. The HS2 business case is based on these journey time assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/4">A high level assessment of journey times indicates that the London to Glasgow journey would take four hours using a London to the West Midlands high-speed line, reducing to three hours and 30 minutes once the Y network became operational. This compares to a current, standard journey time of four hours and 30 minutes.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.0/1">The Department for Transport is working with international bodies to draft recommendations on adding artificial sound to quiet vehicles. Such recommendations may specify the characteristic of the sound and the speed up to which such sound should be generated. Tyre noise is an important source of noise at speeds found on rural roads where noise levels from electric and conventional vehicles are similar. The Department for Transport will soon be publishing the report of research on the audibility of electric vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.3/1">We are working in partnership with the Environment Agency and a number of private landowners to improve the data available on incidents of fly-tipping on private land, given there is no reporting requirement. At present the data available do not permit us to make an assessment of the cost of these incidents to the UK economy. The partnership project with the Environment Agency includes the National Farmers Union and the Country Land Association, who have reported instances of fly-tipping on private land in pilot areas (West Midlands and the north-west) since April 2009, and later nationally, to the national fly-tipping database (Flycapture). There have been low levels of reporting to the database, and between April 2009 and March 2011 a total of 1,827 instances were recorded by all private landowners in the project. We are working with landowners and the Environment Agency to try to increase the number of landowners who report this data to the Flycapture database.</p>
