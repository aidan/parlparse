	<p pid="a.134.2/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="">27 June</phrase> last year the provision of &pound;15 million over three years from the Capital Modernisation Fund to assist small retailers in deprived areas to improve the security of their businesses: &pound;3 million was available in the 2001&ndash;02 financial year, with a further &pound;6 million in both 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/2">This money, which is being spent on schemes identified by regional crime reduction directors, in conjunction with crime and disorder reduction partnerships, is being used to help small retailers to improve security. This is being achieved by employing a variety of interventions, including enhancing the security of individual premises and improving the environment of shopping centres. Nearly 3,000 shops in 114 retail schemes in some of the most deprived areas in England and Wales benefited from first year funds. More shops will be assisted in the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/3">My department has also supported work undertaken to establish retail crime partnerships by funding a consultant post for the past two years. The consultant has worked closely with the British Retail Consortium to produce a definitive guide how to establish and run a retail crime partnership and encourage retailers and other stakeholders in main shopping centre areas to establish partnerships to tackle retail and related crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/4">Funding totalling &pound;223,000 was also given to aid retail crime reduction initiatives under various programmes administered by regional crime reduction directors in the financial year ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> and a further &pound;86,500 is expected to be disbursed through regional crime reduction directors specifically for retail crime reduction initiatives in the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/5">Other funding under the Crime Reduction Programme, such as the &pound;170 million for schemes for the installation of closed circuit television, particularly in town centres, will help to reduce shop theft as well as other types of crime. Other initiatives such as the street wardens schemes will also be of benefit to retailers in the areas where they operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/6">My department also makes advice available to retailers and crime reduction practitioners on the crime reduction website <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>, including best practice guidance in the &quot;Toolkit&quot; on Business and Retail Crime. Booklets which give crime reduction guidance to retailers have also recently been updated and give advice in a user-friendly postcard format leaflet entitled Don't Discount Crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.2/1">I am afraid that the information is not available in the form requested. However, a family of four (two adults and two children both under the age of 16) would receive a total subsistence payment of &pound;126.26 per week. If they were in National Asylum Support Service (NASS) accommodation, the costs of this, together with associated utility bills and council tax, would be met centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/2">It is not possible to predict the level of gross earnings per week to achieve this level. This would be dependent on the individual circumstances of the family.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.2/2">However, the United Kingdom Government's position on the use of Great Apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, pygmy gorillas, and orang-utans) is that we cannot foresee any justification for their use in scientific procedures.

The consultation document requests comments on a number of questions relating to entry criteria, employment restrictions and end of stay, as well as raising the possibility of extending the scheme to other countries. The document considers the issue of whether the United Kingdom should introduce a new scheme for citizens of those candidate countries that it is thought will join the European Union in 2004, using the Working Holidaymaker Scheme as a model.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.5/5">In the White Paper we also undertook to look again at the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme to see how it might better meet the needs of the agricultural sector. So today we are also making available a paper on this scheme that will be the focus of a series of consultation meetings with key stakeholders, representatives of farmers, growers, sector associations, trade unions and the scheme operators.

	<p pid="a.137.5/1">The figures requested are shown below. The Legal Services Commission cannot differentiate asylum from wider immigration cases but the vast majority of cases listed are thought to be asylum. All figures for 2001&ndash;02 are provisional estimates and may be subject to year-end adjustments.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/2">We believe that good quality publicly funded legal representation is very desirable in asylum cases to ensure that the facts are properly presented and the right decision is made as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/3">The cash available for legal aid is set by the Lord Chancellor's Department according to the Supply Estimates agreed by the Treasury. The budget allocated to the Commission is split between the Community Legal Service (CLS) and the Criminal Defence Service (CDS). While overall spending on the CLS is limited by the Lord Chancellor in directions given to the commission, he has recognised the importance of legal representation in appeal proceedings and made an additional &pound;60 million available last financial year for asylum cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">The stability pact is only one of the instruments used to deal with the problems of South East Europe. In the case of the issues raised:</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/2" class="indent">(a) The Danube Commission expects the river to be fully navigable in September following work at Novi Sad. European Commission-led work continues on the reconstruction of the bridges, with progress reliant on co-operation from the countries of the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/3" class="indent">(b) The signing of the framework agreement by political party leaders on <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-13">13 August 2001</phrase> led to a cease-fire in Macedonia and made a political solution possible. NATO-led Task Force Essential Harvest oversaw the collection and destruction of over 3,800 weapons from the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army. Task Force Essential Harvest successfully concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-25">25 September 2001</phrase>. Since then the Macedonian Government have focused on the implementation of the framework agreement and have recently proposed to Parliament two laws for the voluntary handing over of weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/4" class="indent">(c) The stability pact's small arms and light weapons clearinghouse opened in Belgrade on <phrase class="date" code="">8 May</phrase>. It will focus on developing projects to address the cross-border flow of weapons and ammunition. HMG support this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/5" class="indent">(d) My right honourable friend the Prime Minister launched a successful initiative which has put in place a UK-led EU team in Bosnia Herzegovina to train the border service in measures to combat people-trafficking. But the countries of the region have the principal responsibility for combating traffickers in their jurisdictions. Arrests have been made but more needs to be done. The Stability Pact Task Force on Trafficking in Human Beings has been attempting to promote regional co-operation and a common approach to anti-trafficking legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.6/1">In relation to feeding animal proteins back to the same species from which they are derived, current BSE-related feed controls combining national and EU measures prevent processed animal proteins from being fed to animals kept, fattened or bred for food production, and mammalian meat and bonemeal from being fed to all farmed livestock. These controls effectively prevent same-species feeding practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.6/2">There are a few remaining permitted exceptions to these controls, where the scientific evidence does not suggest that a total ban is necessary. Notable examples include the use of milk and milk products; non-ruminant gelatin used for coating of feed-additives; animal-derived dicalcium phosphate; tallow; and eggs and egg products.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.5/1">Council Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 requires member states to carry out compulsory TSE monitoring and testing programmes, which apply to specified categories of cattle, sheep and goats. The TSE (England) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/843) set out the detailed arrangements whereby veterinary inspectors may slaughter animals for the purpose of the enforcement and administration of the Community monitoring requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/2">Elsewhere, slaughter powers within the TSE (England) Regulations 2002 are the same as those in place under the previous domestic regime and remain fully commensurate with our EU obligations. However, such powers were not contained within the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (No 2) Order 1996 alone. That is important to understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/3">Further circumstances in which inspectors may need powers to slaughter are described in Parts III (Animal feeding) and IV (Specified Risk Material) of the TSE England Regulations 2002. These powers are in respect of animals exposed to an explicit TSE risk. They go no further than is necessary to meet the relevant EU legal requirements and continue arrangements that were previously in place under the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy(No 2) Order 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/4">Powers to slaughter animals in Part V of the TSE (England) Regulations 2002 relate to EU legal requirements for animals suspected of being infected with BSE or scrapie and for those confirmed as being infected. Under previous domestic legislation, equivalent powers were exercised under the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (No 2) Order, the Sheep and Goats Spongiform Encephalopathy Order 1998 and the Animal Health Act 1981.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/5">Powers to slaughter animals in Part VI of the TSE (England) Regulations 2002 are directly related to the enforcement and administration of EU legal requirements for the offspring of animals confirmed as being infected with BSE. Equivalent powers were previously in place under the BSE Offspring Slaughter Regulations 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/6">Thus, the powers afforded to a veterinary inspector must necessarily be wider than those needed to implement the compulsory BSE and scrapie monitoring and testing programmes covered by the new EU requirements and those previously set out in Part II of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (No 2) Order 1996. However, in no respects do the powers extend beyond the degree necessary to comply with EU legal requirements and consequently to protect human and animal health and ensure the continued reduction and eventual eradication of these diseases.
