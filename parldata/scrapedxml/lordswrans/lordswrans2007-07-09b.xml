	<p pid="b.191.5/1">There is no current evidence that food-producing animals form a reservoir of infection by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the UK, and the organism has not been detected in farmed livestock in the UK. Defra has initiated a study undertaken by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency to test S. aureus isolates obtained from bovine clinical submissions for MRSA. This project commenced in the autumn of 2006 and, to date, more than 500 samples have been tested, with no MRSA identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/2">The issue of MRSA in other livestock species was discussed at a January meeting of the Defra antimicrobial resistance co-ordination MRSA subgroup, set up to advise on how best the department can contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the role of MRSA in animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/3">Members felt that, at present, broadening the scope of work in this area should only be considered after analysis of the current findings relating to humans in the UK with MRSA infections. The particular strain of MRSA (ST 398) occurring in pigs in some other parts of Europe was not reported to have been detected so far in humans in the UK, and this was a key consideration in reaching the decision taken. However, the position will be kept under active review in future, taking into account the latest findings in humans and animals, as well as developments in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/4">The European Food Safety Authority is also looking at the issue of MRSA in food-producing animals and is considering what surveillance and other actions would be most appropriate for EU member states to undertake to address the issue. The UK is actively participating in the development of these proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.2/1">The department is developing a comprehensive national stroke strategy that will be going out for consultation shortly and will be published in late 2007. This will promote delivery of the newest treatments and improve the care that stroke patients receive. It will also promote public awareness and prevention for all ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.2/2">The department has also provided Section 64 grants to fund the following projects:</p>
	<p pid="b.200.2/3">The Afiya Trust's &quot;Stroke Awareness for Black and Minority Ethnic Communities&quot; project will target black and minority ethnic communities and run stroke awareness sessions within community settings.The Stroke Association's &quot;Blood Pressure Awareness: African Caribbean Communities&quot; project will promote a blood pressure awareness campaign within African Caribbean communities in England.The Stroke Association's &quot;Stroke Prevention: South Asian Communities&quot; project raised awareness of stroke prevention through the production of materials and the dissemination and distribution of these materials.The &quot;Coronary Artery Disease in South Asian Prevention&quot; project provides education about cardiac risk factors, psychological support, nutrition management, medications, weight management, lipid lowering medication, physical activity and blood pressure control for the south Asian population.In December 2004, the department produced a best practice guide for providing coronary heart disease services to south Asians. <I>Heart Disease and South Asians</I> was published by the South Asian Health Foundation (SAHF) in conjunction with the British Heart Foundation. In 2004, the department part-funded another SAHF report, <I>Prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of cardiovascular disease in South Asians</I><I>,</I> which aimed to convey this issue to a wide audience, enabling more people to understand the problems and take action to combat them. It included a chapter on cerebrovascular disease.In 2006, the Food Standards Agency provided a grant to the Stroke Association to create a survey to assess the eating habits and salt intake of African Caribbean, south Asian and Chinese communities. This aims to find out more about stroke awareness levels in relation to diet.</p>

	<p pid="b.201.5/1">In January 2005, the Government published Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care (DRE), a comprehensive five-year action plan for improving services for black and minority ethnic (BME) communities, alongside their response to the independent inquiry into the death of David Bennett. DRE has been designed to encourage more appropriate and responsive care, stronger engagement of BME communities with local mental health services, and better use of information and evidence. Progress has been made but there is more to be done, and implementation remains a priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.201.5/2">An important component of DRE is the annual &quot;Count Me In&quot; census of mental health inpatients undertaken by the Healthcare Commission and the Mental Health Act Commission. The results for 2005 and 2006 confirmed, among other things, that people from some BME groups are significantly more likely to be admitted to hospital and, in certain circumstances, more likely to be subject to compulsion in their treatment. The reasons underlying those results are complex and not yet fully understood; there is, for example, evidence suggesting a high incidence of severe mental illness among migrant populations globally and among BME groups in England specifically.</p>
