	<p pid="a.101.2/1">At the Lancaster House Constitutional Conference in 1979, the UK Government undertook to assist with land resettlement alongside other donors. No specific sum was pledged, but &pound;44 million has been provided to date; &pound;20 million was offered through the 1981 Land Resettlement Grant, which was closed in 1996 with &pound;3 million unspent because Government did not offer plans to use it; &pound;27 million was provided during the 1980s as budgetary support to help the Zimbabwe Government meet its share of resettlement costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/2">DFID has recently offered another &pound;5 million to continue help for resettlement working through civil society and private sector initiatives as part of a total of &pound;38 million development assistance. Further support for Government-led resettlement is dependent on a return to the rule of law, and to the principles agreed by government and donors at the 1998 Land Conference.</p>

The planned expenditure for the current financial year is the highest ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.5/7">While all the elements that make up the figures are not under our control, we expect to record an oda/GNP ratio of 0.30 per cent in calendar year 2001, in line with the Government's commitment to reverse the decline in aid spending during this Parliament. Further, the Government has stated that it will ensure the ratio of oda to GNP will rise to 0.33 per cent by financial year 2003-04.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.5/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced the establishment of Lord Laming's working group on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-31">31 January 2000</phrase> (Official Report, Commons, col. 425W). My noble friend Lord Laming has completed his report, and copies have been placed in the Library and printed paper office.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/2">I am very grateful to the noble friend Lord Laming and his colleagues on the working group, for their analysis and recommendations. Many of these recommendations build on the extensive change of the prison service programme being managed by the Director General. We accept all the recommendations made in the report, save where my noble friend Lord Laming or the Director General has advised us that further work is required in order to assess how best to take the recommendation forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/3">We have, therefore, today, announced that the right honourable Member for Fareham, and Chairman of the Newbridge Trust, Sir Peter Lloyd, has agreed to chair a review of the role of prisons' boards of visitors (Recommendation 16). Mr Patrick Carter, a non-executive Director of the Prison and Probation Services, has agreed to lead a review of the Prison Service's programme of Private Finance Initiative (PFI) prisons and market-testing (Recommendation 8).</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/4">The Director General has been asked to report back to my right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Home Office, Mr Boateng, at the latest by October 2000, with a more detailed action plan in response to Recommendations 4, 5, 9, 13 and 14. I have also asked the Director General and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons to take forward Recommendation 12.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/5">We welcome the report's focus on updating personnel policies, and the importance placed on succession planning, and the effective management of sickness absence and poor performers. These underscore the importance of major programmes of work already under way within the Prison Service. My noble friend Lord Laming has noted the leadership being given by the Director General and the Deputy Director General, and the report's recommendations regarding managerial accountability and the pivotal role of the area manager in improving performance built on recent reforms relating to regionalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/6">The Prison Service is in the process of modernising its information technology systems, and will be introducing service level agreements into all public sector prisons by April 2001. Work is also in hand to develop a more sophisticated means of linking performance with the allocation of resources. The Quinquennial Review of the Prison Service, conducted in 1999, reaffirmed its status as an Executive Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/7">My noble friend Lord Laming's recommendations are:</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/8" class="indent">1. The Prison Service must give the highest priority to developing succession management in order to avoid frequent changes of governors. They must ensure that governor posts are filled as quickly and appropriately as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/9" class="indent">2. The personnel policies and practices of the Prison Service should be brought up to date. Sickness absence should be robustly challenged. Mechanisms to deal with poor performance should be improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/10" class="indent">3. Staff training should be improved and be linked to quality standards and performance targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/11" class="indent">4. A critical examination of information routinely circulated and gathered should be undertaken. In future, information should not be gathered or sent unless its use has been defined and justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/12" class="indent">5. It is recommended that all instructions to governors, and requests for information, should be directed through the management line and should be prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/13" class="indent">6. The Prison Service should be clearly defined as an executive Agency and be required to perform as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/14" class="indent">7. The allocation of increased resources should be linked to defined objectives and outcome measures-systems must be in place so that every prison governor can demonstrate that resources are being used flexibly and to good purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/15" class="indent">8. The programme of PFI prisons and market testing should be reviewed to advise Ministers on how best to use the financial and management resources of the private sector to provide both greater choice and additional capacity to the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/16" class="indent">9. We believe that service level agreements should be developed for every establishment in the public sector. In each of these establishments, a contract compliance officer should be appointed to monitor day-by-day application. In many prisons, the extra cost would be covered by the better use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/17" class="indent">10. The Prison Service should operate to agreed national standards which are put into practice in each establishment. It is not a &quot;federal&quot; service and these core standards should be the basis for all evaluation of performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.5/19" class="indent">12. The Prison Service and the Chief Inspector should work to produce an agreed set of standards, to be approved by Ministers, against which the performance of prisons will be evaluated. The methodology for the inspection of prisons will be developed in relation to these standards. It should facilitate both objective assessment and comparison covering both value for money and quality of service delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/20" class="indent">13. The principle of managerial accountability must permeate the service and inform all practice and decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/21" class="indent">14. The principle of managerial responsibilities of area managers should be clearly defined and they should be held personally accountable for the performance of each prison in their area. Specialist staff should be relocated from headquarters to the areas to enable area managers to fulfil their new and demanding duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.5/22" class="indent">15. Links between prisons and community based agencies should be strengthened and coordinated more effectively. Prison and community based agency staff should be provided with training to enable them to work together more effectively. Community based agency staff should be able to convey any concerns they have about the prison to the governor or area manager.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.6/1">The Government value very highly the important role boards of visitors undertake as the watchdog of the Secretary of State and the independent and impartial advice they are able to provide on the standards of fairness and humanity with which those placed in custody by the courts are treated. The majority of boards work very effectively and provide a good service to Ministers and the public. However, in the light of changes within the Prison Service since the last major review of the role of the boards of visitors five years ago, we have decided that the time is right for a further review of the boards' role and we are pleased to announce that Sir Peter Lloyd has agreed to chair a Working Group to take the review forward. Sir Peter is currenty the Chairman of New Bridge, a charity which recruits and trains volunteers to visit prisoners and provides an employment service for ex-offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/2">A board of visitors is a body created by statute, and there is one attached to every Prison Service establishment in England and Wales. Board members are lay people appointed by the Secretary of State, who are empowered under the Prison Act 1952:</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/3" class="indent">&quot;at any time [to] enter the prison and. . .have free access to every part of it and to every prisoner and hear any complaints which may be made by the prisoners and report to the Secretary of State any matter which they consider it expedient to report.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/4">The Prison Rules, made under the Prison Act, set out general and specific duties. We are looking currently at ways in which to improve performance management in the Prison Service and how to ensure a greater involvement of the voluntary sector in prison issues. Against this background, it is right that we should look again at the context in which boards operate and see what can be done to improve the overall effectiveness of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/5">I have agreed with Sir Peter the following terms of reference for the Working Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/6" class="indent">&quot;The Working Group has been established to review the legal context in which BOV operate and the effectiveness of the existing structure, and to develop proposals for enhancing the performance of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/7" class="indent">The review will take account of the relevant recommendation made in the final report of Lord Laming's Targeted Performance Initiative Working Group. The main work of the review will be to consider in depth issues relating to:--</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/8" class="indent">the composition of and appointments to boards, including whether there should be any limitation on the overall period of service by members;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.6/9" class="indent">the duties, commitment and levels of performance expected of boards, the way in which they function and whether existing powers enable them to undertake their work effectively and raise with Ministers issues they need to be aware of;</p>

	<p pid="a.107.6/11" class="indent">the amount and quality of training provision for boards, and whether it is sufficiently well focused;</p>

	<p pid="a.107.6/13" class="indent">the way in which boards' views should be represented to Ministers and the nature and amount of support they require at national level.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.109.8/1">Agreement has been reached to set up a Pay Review Body to make independent recommendations to the Government on the pay of prison governors, prison officers and related grades for the Prison Service in England and Wales. This review body would operate on the lines of the five existing review bodies, which deal with 1.3 million public sector employees. Like the existing review bodies, it would have a secretariat from the independent Office of Manpower Economics.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/2">This establishment of an independent pay determination mechanism would be under the provisions of Section 128 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 as part of a comprehensive programme of improvement in prison service management.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/3">It is also my right honourable friend the Home Secretary's intention, when parliamentary time allows, to replace Section 127 with a reserve statutory power and a voluntary industrial relations agreement. Section 127, as it stands, makes it unlawful for officers of a prison to take industrial action. The voluntary agreement, which has been accepted by the Prison Governors' Association (PGA), the Prison Officers' Association (POA) and the National Executive Committee (NEC), will be put to a special POA delegates conference in August. This will mean that they have agreed not to induce, support or authorise industrial action. In recognition of this, we will provide them with a new disputes procedure which will include independent arbitration. The voluntary agreement, which will be legally binding, will give my right honourable friend the Home Secretary the power to seek injunctive relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/4">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary intends to use the provisions of the voluntary agreement instead of those in Section 127, while awaiting parliamentary time to effect the changes in legislation. However, it is clear on all sides that Section 127 would be used in the event of a breakdown of the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/5">Together, we hope these measures will create a new climate for industrial relations in the Service. They clear the way for more constructive dialogue on a wide range of issues by modernising the way that this key group of public sector workers deal with their employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/6">The remit of the Pay Review Body would also have the scope to make an independent determination in relation to the pay of prison governors, prison officers, night patrol officers and prison auxiliaries in the Northern Ireland Prison Service based on submissions made to it by that Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/7">The implementaton of this agreement and the delivery of the intentions we have outlined above are dependent on our being satisfied that the state of industrial relations within prisons is such as to enable the effective and efficient management of the Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.8/8">Such a state cannot be said to have been attained in the light of the current withdrawal of goodwill by the POA, but I will keep the situation under constant review.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.0/4">The table attached shows index levels for RPIX and the DETR house price index (the change in the depreciation component of the RPI is measured using the DETR house price index) back to 1975 which was the first year RPIX was published. The table shows the house price index to have more variability over short periods than the RPIX. This means it is difficult to draw long term inferences about the effect of housing depreciation on RPIX based on the effect of its inclusion in the index since 1995. A historical RPIX series cannot be recalculated with the addition of depreciation as the index would have to be re-weighted for all years and this could only be undertaken at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.6/1">The draft Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill and consultation paper will be published as a command paper during the Summer Recess. Before the publication of the printed version of the command paper, a typescript copy will be laid before Parliament. Copies of the typescript version of the draft command paper will be made available in the Vote Office and in the Printed Paper Office immediately after it has been laid before both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/2">A summary of the proposals which are to be included in the draft Bill is set out below.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/3">Draft Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill Part 1: Commonhold The nature and creation of a commonhold development</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/4">In England and Wales, there are two ways to own land, freehold and leasehold. Each has its advantages and disadvantages in particular circumstances. Freehold comes closest to absolute ownership. Leasehold confers ownership for a temporary period, subject to terms and conditions contained in the contract, or lease.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/5">A covenant is a promise contained in a deed, such as a deed passing ownership of property from one person to another. There are two types of covenant: the positive covenant, which is a promise to do something, such as to pay rent or to keep the property in repair, and the restrictive covenant, which is a promise not to do something, such as cause a nuisance to neighbours. For historical reasons, positive covenants cannot apply to freehold land once the first buyer of the property has sold it on. However, both positive and restrictive covenants apply to leasehold property.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/6">This means that, where it is desired to set up a scheme to allow for ownership of interdependent properties and for the management of the common parts and facilities, the scheme must, today, be based on leasehold ownership. There is no satisfactory scheme at present which would allow for freehold ownership in such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/7">As long term residential leasehold has become more and more widely discredited, pressure has grown for the Government to bring forward a scheme which would combine the security of freehold ownership with the management potential of positive covenants which could be made to apply to each owner of an interdependent property. That scheme is commonhold.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/8">Each separate property in the commonhold development will be called a unit. It might be a flat, or a house, a shop or a light industrial unit. The owner will be called a unit-holder. The body which will own and manage the common parts and facilities of the development will be called the commonhold association. The commonhold association will be a private company limited by guarantee, whose membership will be restricted to all the unit-holders within the development. The commonhold association will be registered at Companies House in the usual way and will have a standard set of memorandum and articles (M&amp;A) which will be prescribed by the Lord Chancellor from time to time. This means that all the unit-holders in a development will have two interests in the property of the commonhold; a direct interest in the unit or units that they own and an interest in the commonhold association which owns the common parts.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/9">The commonhold association with its common parts and the associated units will be registered at HM Land Registry. In order to register, the developer of the commonhold development or the sponsor of a converting development will be required to present to HM Land Registry the M&amp;A, and the Commonhold Community Statement (CCS), which will contain the rules and regulations of the particular commonhold. There will need to be a degree of flexibility to allow for unique features of a particular development. It might be necessary to provide for the upkeep of a bluebell wood as a site of special scientific interest, or perhaps make special arrangements for a sheltered housing component in a development. Allowance for this is to be made in the CCS where in addition to the prescribed requirements, those relating to the individual attributes of the commonhold development can be set out. These discretionary elements will be registered and form part of the documentation maintained by HM Land Registry.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/10">If it is necessary to obtain the consent of anyone with an interest in the land, those consents must be supplied at this stage and finally, a certificate will be required to confirm that the M&amp;As and the CCS comply with the relevant regulations. Once the required documents are produced to HM Land Registry, the commonhold will be registered.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/11">It will be possible for a unit to consist of two separate areas of land, for instance a flat with a garage in a detached block, or perhaps a shop with a separate storage unit. Units may be divided from each other vertically, as are terraced houses, horizontally, as are flats in a block, or may be free standing, as are detached houses or, often, light industrial units. However, where the divisions are horizontal, no part of the commonhold may be over or under any part of a building which is not part of the same or an associated commonhold development. Conversion</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/12">It will be possible to convert from some other status to commonhold but only if certain criteria are met. Details will be contained in regulations, but it will be necessary to obtain the consent to conversion of 100 per cent of the existing leaseholders and/or other owners of what would become units in the commonhold. Consent will also be required from the freeholder, whether that is a company wholly owned by the leaseholders, or some third party. If a third party is involved, it will not be possible to convert without having satisfied HM Land Registry that the freeholder's consent has been freely given or his interest brought out according to the scheme developed by Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) in their part of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/13">It is not intended that any scheme of conversion to commonhold should give rights to commercial leaseholders or rack rented commercial occupiers which would go beyond the scheme developed by the DETR for collective leasehold enfranchisement. DETR's scheme relating to qualifying buildings and tenants and rules relating to payments to existing landlords, where applicable, will be adopted so far as is possible, with the exception that to convert to commonhold will require 100 per cent consents. Thus rules will be substantially the same for both types of conversion. Details will be contained in regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/14">At the time of conversion all leasehold interests will cease to apply as will all terms of all leases and the units will be governed by the M&amp;As and the CCS of the commonhold association. Management of a commonhold development</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/15">It will be possible to add to and to diminish the size of the development by the purchase or sale of common parts provided that the specified majority of the members of the commonhold association is achieved at an appropriate meeting. There will be rules to govern the distribution of capital receipts arising from such a sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/16">The voting rights of unit-holders in the commonhold association, the size of the various types of majority required for particular purposes, the minimum requirements for the maintenance of accounts and the machinery for the setting and for the payment of the commonhold assessment, which will be substantially similar to service charges, will all be set out in the standard M&amp;As or the CCS.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/17">The M&amp;As or the CCS will set out the procedure for dealing with disputes arising within a commonhold. These are to be dealt with initially by use of internal procedures. Should these fail to settle matters, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) will be provided for. However, it is not intended to refuse access to the courts and tribunals as necessary, to ensure ECHR Article 6 compliance. The Bill will make provision for the making of regulations which will provide for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/18">The Bill will make provision for the CCS to set out the rules governing rights of entry of the commonhold association for inspection and its right to carry out works and to recover costs of such work for cases of emergency or to facilitate its obligations to maintain and repair. Winding up of a commonhold association</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/19">The rules governing the winding up of a commonhold association will be contained in regulations. The regulations will require that the CCS sets out the rules governing the distribution of any profit arising on a voluntary winding up and other matters relating to the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/20">The winding up of an insolvent commonhold association will be carried out, so far as possible, under the standard insolvency rules. Any deviation from those rules will be laid down in regulations. Part II Leasehold Reform</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/21">It is recognised that many existing leaseholders would not be able to convert to commonhold, or may not wish to do so. A range of measures is therefore proposed to help existing leaseholders. These reforms are intended to redress the uneven balance between landlords and leaseholders and give leaseholders a greater degree of control over the management of their homes which reflects the substantial investment they have made. They are also intended to prevent unreasonable or oppressive behaviour by unscrupulous landlords, and would provide flexibility to tackle any new forms of abuse that may arise in the future. Right to manage</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/22">A key feature of the proposals is a new right for leaseholders of flats to take over the management of their building without having to prove shortcoming on the part of the landlord and without having to pay compensation. This reflects the fact that the leaseholders normally have by far the greatest financial interest in the building. This new right is not intended to replace the existing right of collective enfranchisement. It would provide an alternative option for leaseholders who are dissatisfied with the management of the building. Some leaseholders may wish to have the opportunity to try managing the building themselves before committing themselves to buying the freehold. The proposals would enable them to do this and would assist subsequent enfranchisement if the leaseholders wish to do so. Collective enfranchisement</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/23">A number of changes are proposed to the collective enfranchisement provisions in the Leasehold Reform, Housing the Urban Development Act 1993. These are intended to meet the Government's commitment to make it easier for leaseholders of flats to buy their freeholds. The proposals would relax qualifying rules which have proved to be an unnecessary barrier to leaseholders seeking to buy their freehold. Changes would include the abolition of the residence test and the removal of the requirements that at least two thirds of the eligible leaseholders must participate in the process. The proposals would also reduce the scope for costly arguments over the price payable, including a requirement to seek permission to appeal against decisions of leasehold valuation tribunals.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/24">Comparable changes are proposed to leaseholders' rights to acquire a new lease of their flat under the 1993 Act, and to buy the freehold of their house under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. The existing residence test would be replaced by a requirement to have held the lease for at least two years. There would be special provisions to help personal representatives of deceased leaseholders. Service charges</p>
	<p pid="a.114.6/25">Major changes are proposed to leaseholders' rights in relation to service charges. Our intention is that leaseholders should have the right to challenge any charges payable under a lease. These would include the cost of improvements, which are a major concern to many local authority leaseholders, and charges for approvals or consents. The requirements for landlords to consult leaseholders would be strengthened and simplified. The threshold for consultation about major works would be related to the amount payable by an individual leaseholder, rather than the cost of the works as a whole. There would be a new requirement to consult before entering into contracts for the provision of ongoing works or services lasting 12 months or more. Disputes over compliance would be transferred to the leasehold valuation tribunals.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.0/32">(i) FWPS claims--Under certain circumstances, FWPS agreement holders may count some or all of their FWPS land towards their AAPS set aside requirements. The AAPS set aside payment rate (to which the FWPS payment is &quot;linked&quot; in these cases) fell below the FWPS rate for the first time in 1999, and the associated payments had to be restricted. Problems/delays were encountered both by the Information Technology Division in amending the payment system, and also by the RSCs in identifying the agreements/land involved. Regettably, this resulted in a significant number of Charter failures.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/33">(ii) FWPS applications--The FWPS is one of a number of measures which were notified under the new EC Rural Development Regulation (RDR), which took effect on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase>. The majority of &quot;failures&quot; reported relate to applications submitted on or after that date, which cannot be approved until the England Rural Development Plan (ERDP) has received Commission approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/34">(iii) The high failure rate for Agricultural Wages Inspections arose primarily because of difficulties at one RSC where most of the complaints were sent for investigation during a short period when the wages inspectors' time was already fully taken up carrying out IACS Arable Area Payments Scheme inspections needing urgent completion to protect the Department from EC disallowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/35">(iv) The relatively high failure rates for the ESA Scheme were due primarily to the introduction of new and complex EC Regulations, uneven workloads and staffing difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/36">(v) The number of claims processed for the Farm and Capital Grant Scheme 1991 is insignificant compared to most other schemes. Staffing problems at the two RSCs with the largest number of claims has distorted an otherwise excellent success rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/37">(vi) The 80 per cent response rate to complaints is explained by the fact that often cases require referral to HQ or the National Scheme Management Centres and thus take longer than 10 days to resolve. In all cases where the deadline was not met, a holding letter was issued to the complainant detailing the reason for delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/38">General Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/39">(i) The total percentage has been calculated by setting the entire number of applications or claims cleared within the target time against the total number received. Applications and claims not cleared due to reasons beyond our control (incorrect information supplied by applicant, etc.) are not included as failures to meet target.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/40">(ii) The Farm Conservation Grant Schemes 1989 Claims and Pilot NSA Claims have been omitted from the table since these schemes are now closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/41">(iii) 44 complaints were referred to the MAFF Adjudicator during the year. 10 of these were upheld and 4 were partly upheld, 27 were not upheld. 3 cases were dealt with outside of the Citizen's Charter Unit.</p>

I am disappointed to see that a number of departments and agencies failed to meet this year's target of 100 per cent. I have taken steps to remind all departments and agencies of the importance of paying suppliers' bills on time and meeting the target.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/3">I am particularly disappointed at my own department's failure to meet the target. It is unacceptable that the department which has overall responsibility for the Government's policy on prompt payment should itself fail to meet the target. My officials are introducing new measures designed to ensure that the DTI meets the target as soon as possible this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/4">The Government are committed to improving the UK's payment culture. Late payment is a serious problem, particularly for small businesses. Not knowing when the customers' bills will be paid means uncertain cashflow, increased borrowings, higher costs and reduced profits.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/5">Government departments and their agencies are required to monitor their payment performance and to publish the results in their departmental or annual reports. The following table lists, by department, the proportion of bills paid within 30 days, or other agreed credit period, of receipt of a valid invoice for financial year 1999-2000.</p>
