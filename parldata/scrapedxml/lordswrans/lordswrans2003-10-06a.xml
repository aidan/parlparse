	<p pid="a.1.2/1">We have not made any independent estimate but are aware, from assessments carried out by international agencies such as the IMF and World Bank, of the serious adverse impact on the Burkinabe economy of the conflict in Cote d'Ivoire and neighbouring countries. These impacts have been factored into programmes of assistance to Burkina Faso recently agreed by the two institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">Our direct response to the crisis in Cote d'Ivoire has focused on assistance (amounting to &pound;0.9 million) to internally displaced people and refugees of many nationalities, including Burkinabes, within Cote d'Ivoire itself. We also contribute via programmes of the EU who in May approved 5.74 million euros to assist vulnerable groups affected by the conflict. Of this sum, 2.1 million euros will be used to assist refugees and returnees to neighbouring countries such as Burkina Faso.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.0/2">Grant for tuition fees, and supplementary grants for living costs (e.g. dependants' grants for students with children and disabled students' grants) are available to all eligible students whatever their age. It is only loans for living costs (which have to be repaid) that are subject to an upper age limit on eligibilty. They are not available to over 54 year-olds (or over 49 year-olds who do not intend to enter employment upon graduation) only because the loan is written off at retirement age (65), and removing this age limit would leave many older graduates with inadquate time for repayment. Students over 54 who face additional costs whilst studying can apply for help from hardship funds.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.5/3" class="indent">I am very much aware of the fact that you, other peers, and many outside this House including many Gulf veterans, are very keen for your questions to be answered. I am also conscious of the fact that answering them is taking much longer than any of us would like and I can only apologise for the delay. This which [sic] has arisen partly because of the need to seek the advice of an independent Expert Group of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines and the Committee itself. I can assure you that your question has not been overlooked&mdash;the Secretary of State for Health, his predecessor, the Minister for Veterans and his predecessor, the Chief Medical Officer as well as myself and numerous officials have been involved at various stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.5/4" class="indent">Your question comprises several parts. You asked about the anthrax vaccine administered to personnel in 1991. Officials here and at the Department of Health have undertaken a considerable amount of work, the aim being to enable me to provide you with a full answer on the administration of anthrax vaccine offered to UK military personnel from 1990 to the present day. Work is almost complete and I expect to be able to write to you during the first week the House returns following the Conference Recess (ie the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="">6 October</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.4.5/5" class="indent">In my letter, I will also deal with your questions about pyriodostigmine bromide (Nerve Agent Pre-treatment sets (NAPS)) tablets and whether any other vaccines administered in 1990&ndash;91 had similar limitations (ie that they should be used alone). As you know, Service personnel were offered a range of immunisations to protect against disease. These included standard Service immunisations, immunisations for deployment to areas with specific health hazards, immunisations to help protect personnel against the effects of biological weapons, and immunisations for personnel in specific occupational or &quot;at risk&quot; groups. The information required to enable your questions to be answered was not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.5/6" class="indent">I am copying this letter to Lord Clement-Jones and Lord Williams of Mostyn. It will also be published in the Official Report, and my officials will arrange for a copy to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

Criminal legal aid is provided on the same basis in the two jurisdictions: that is whether it is in the interests of justice that the defendant is given legal aid. Civil legal aid is provided in Northern Ireland against a statutory test of whether there are reasonable grounds for bringing, defending or being a party to an action: whereas in England a funding code applies which sets out different tests for different categories of case.</p>

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has recently issued for public consultation a draft of a new planning policy statement (PPS7) concerning sustainable development in rural areas.

	<p pid="a.14.2/1">I understand that Surrey County Council's preferred option for the potential relocation of its County Hall is to a site in the Woking area. The relocation of County Hall would require planning permission. Surrey County Council has confirmed that Woking Borough Council would be the local planning authority that would determine any planning application for Surrey's new County Hall if the county council decide to relocate to Woking. However, the planning application may have to be referred to the First Secretary of State if the local planning authority proposed to grant planning permission for a development that would not accord with the development plan. If this were the case, the First Secretary of State would then consider whether the proposal raises any planning issues of more than local importance which might justify his intervention.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.8/1">Alstom's proposals are disappointing, but the decision is a commercial matter for the company and has been brought about by a major restructuring package affecting Alstom's worldwide operations as the company seeks to address continuing losses and a huge debt burden. However, it is important to note that many of the jobs affected are being transferred, rather than lost; for example, the sale of the transmission and distribution business, with 3,500 jobs out of the total of 5,000, which is expected to be finalised shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.8/2">It should be noted that Alstom's restructuring plan would also significantly affect the company's sites in other European countries, mainly in the power sector. Any UK job losses will of course be a blow to the individuals affected and their families. Regional bodies and local agencies are in contact with the company and will do everything necessary to help the individuals affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.8/1">It is for the courts to decide in individual cases whether a prison sentence is appropriate. Where imprisonment is the most appropriate punishment, it should be applied and we should, and are, developing our capacity to meet demand. There is already a range of demanding community sentences available to sentencers. In addition we are introducing tough new programmes such as the &quot;Intensive Control and Change Programme&quot; (ICCP) for 18 to 20 year-olds. ICCP, which was launched as a pilot in April, involves probation supervision and police surveillance, for 25 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.8/2">The Criminal Justice Bill will provide sentencers with further options. A generic community sentence will replace the current series of stand-alone orders and will provide sentencers with the flexibility to impose a package of requirements to meet offences of varying degrees of seriousness. Additionally the introduction of two &quot;intermediate&quot; sanctions&mdash;custody minus and intermittent custody, allowing offenders to retain employment and family contact will provide options short of full time custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">The Government strongly support inter-faith dialogue in the United Kingdom. My department provides core funding to the Inter Faith Network, which since 1987 has been linking inter-faith initiatives and developing good relations between people of different faiths in this country. Recently we have provided additional funding to the network to carry out a survey of local inter-faith activity and produce a good-practice leaflet. We welcome the activities of the many other well-established inter-faith initiatives operating in this country, and my colleagues have on many occasions met representatives of these and offered encouragement.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">The Community Cohesion Faith Practitioners Group, one of the many groups which my department has established to help us promote community cohesion, is looking at how faith communities can co-operate in local areas to address social problems. The present review of the Government's Interface with the Faith Communities, led by my honourable friend Fiona Mactaggart, is making good progress and is due to report at the end of this year. It is identifying more effective ways for relevant perspectives from faith communities to be taken into account when planning government policy. This should also have the effect of encouraging co-operation between faith communities in responding to government initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/3">Finally, we have taken the opportunity of occasions like the Millennium and Golden Jubilee celebrations to bring together religious leaders and young people from the different faith communities to discuss issues and explore their shared values. Noble Lords may recall the shared act of reflection and commitment by the faith communities of the United Kingdom, which took place in this House on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-03">3 January 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/4">This process will be continued though a number of mock Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings for young people, including many from the faith communities, which my department is planning in association which the Royal Commonwealth Society. We expect that up to six of these will take place around the United Kingdom during the month of November, with their conclusions being presented to the real Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Nigeria in December.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">The Criminal Records Bureau issues two levels of certificate to applicants, standard disclosure and enhanced disclosure. Neither level carries any predetermined period of validity. Disclosures are intended to be used at the point of recruitment or a licensing decision for a particular position. This is because a conviction or other matter could be recorded against the subject of a disclosure at any time after it was issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">Nevertheless, this does not preclude an individual from presenting his or her disclosure to another organisation after having used it for its originally intended purpose. However, given that there is no pre-determined period of validity associated with disclosures, it must be for the organisation concerned to decide whether it is prepared to accept a disclosure that was originally requested by another organisation.</p>

We and our EU partners have raised these cases with the Belarusian authorities.

	<p pid="a.24.0/1">Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a licence to export military list goods to Iraq. The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of &quot;arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions&quot;. Accordingly Her Majesty's Government consider it appropriate to grant exemptions for these goods to be exported on the basis that they are to be used by a private security firm in the protection of the British Office in Baghdad. The work of the British Office in Baghdad forms part of the authority's functions under resolution 1483 (2003). The export is consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis against the UN Embargo and Consolidated Criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.</p>

But an arms embargo remains and UNSCR 1483(2003) placed a ban on trade in stolen cultural property and requests member states to freeze and transfer certain Iraqi assets to the Development Fund for Iraq. The United Kingdom implements, in addition, sanctions imposed by the European Union in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burma, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former President Milosevic and the persons associated with him continue to represent a threat to the consolidation of democracy in the area of the former Republic of Yugoslavia), Libya, Sudan and Zimbabwe. In accordance with a decision of the OSCE, the United Kingdom implements arms embargoes on Armenia and Azerbaijan. The UK has imposed a unilateral arms embargo adopted by national legislation on Iran and a ban in relation to the sale of certain equipment to the armed forces of either side on the island of Cyprus. A list of sanctions regimes implemented by the UK is in the Library of the House. Annexed to this is a summary of additional UK restrictions on the export of strategic goods. These documents are also available on the FCO website, at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/sanctions">www.fco.gov.uk/sanctions</a> and are updated each time there are changes to sanctions regimes implemented by the UK, or to UK restrictions on the export of strategic goods.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.2/1">Last week we remembered the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, two years ago. In a few weeks, we shall be marking the first anniversary of the Bali bombings. The Government responded to these tragic events with practical support for the families of the victims beyond the consular assistance we would normally provide following the death or injury of British nationals abroad. We did so because of the exceptional nature of terrorism, in which individuals are random victims of attacks directed at society as a whole. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="">18 September</phrase> a package of measures designed to support the families of victims of future terrorist attacks abroad, which is based closely on what was provided for the families of victims of September 11 and Bali.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/2">These measures are:</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/3" class="indent">return economy airfares to the airport nearest the site of the incident for two members of the victim's family;</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/4" class="indent">accommodation for three to five nights;</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/5" class="indent">travel insurance as appropriate and where available;</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/6" class="indent">local travel including transfers from airport to local hotel;</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/7" class="indent">repatriation of bodies or remains;</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/8" class="indent">immediate medical expenses of those killed or injured;</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/9" class="indent">medical evacuation of those killed or injured to the nearest hospital; and</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/10" class="indent">return luggage costs of those killed or injured.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/11">The provision of the exact package, and the details of the assistance offered to the families will, of course, depend on the particular circumstances, including whether any of the costs are already covered by existing insurance policies. As a matter of course, we provide consular advice and support, both in London and at the site of the incident. We also endeavour to arrange insurance cover for family members where it would not otherwise be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/12">None of these measures can ever take away the pain and suffering which families will experience in these most horrendous of circumstances, but we sincerely hope they will at least remove some of the practical and administrative burdens from them, when trying to cope with the trauma of the incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.2/13">The question of what constitutes an act of terrorism remains a difficult one. In the case of September 11, Bali and the compound bombings in Riyadh in May of this year, we were all in no doubt that we were dealing with acts of terrorism. Where there is doubt as to whether a violent death abroad is the result of an act of terrorism, we will consider the circumstances carefully and sympathetically. In essence, this package of measures is designed to assist the families of members of the travelling and expatriate British public, who are inadvertently caught up in a terrorist incident; and where they are not covered by ordinary insurance policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">The FCO has been working to strengthen co-operation with British unions on issues of mutual interest overseas. As economic decisions are increasingly made in a global context, so British trade unions are more involved with international organisations and counterparts overseas. British trade unions have long played a wider international role in helping promote, among other things, democracy and human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">To identify areas of concern and to facilitate discussion, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the General Secretary of the TUC have agreed to set up an FCO/TUC International Advisory Council. This council will be led from the Foreign Office side by Dr MacShane, Minister for Europe, and will include participants from both the FCO and the trade union movement.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">To brief interested parties on this expanded co-operation, the FCO and TUC agreed to produce a leaflet setting down in pratical terms how British unions and the FCO are working together. This leaflet was circulated to delegates at the TUC General Congress last week. Copies of the leaflet, which have been placed in the Library of the House, will also be circulated to our embassies abroad and will be available on the official FCO website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">The Eurobus tour was not part of the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign, but an information awareness exercise. The aim was to inform people about the EU and its activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">In Estonia, no British Embassy staff toured on the Eurobus, nor handed out any material connected with it. In Poland, the British Embassy donated a bus to the Polish Government in May 2002&mdash;no financial assistance was provided. The bus had previously been used for an information campaign in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/3">These activities are entirely consistent with the UK's obligations under Article 41.1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Regulations 1961, which requires the non-interference of diplomatic staff in the internal affairs of the receiving state. The British Government have maintained throughout the accession campaigns in 2003 that it is for the citizens of the countries concerned to decide whether to join the EU.</p>

The populations of each local authority by age and sex were compared against the diagnostic ranges derived from rolled-forward population estimates and aggregated administrative sources (such as pensions data). These ranges gave a plausible set of values with which we would, prior to the Census, expect the ONC estimates to be comparable. Where the ONC estimates fell outside of the diagnostic ranges, extensive checks of the ONC results were undertaken with respect to sample sizes, outliers, etc. and action was taken if any issues were identified. Further information on the ONC quality assurance, and the data used to create the diagnostic ranges, can be found on the National Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/oncqualityinfo.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/onc quality info.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/10">It is important to note that the pensions data used for comparison was adjusted pensions data because the unadjusted pensions data had a number of problems, for example, many of the postcodes were missing, contained errors, or were out of date; there was a lag between people moving house and the records being updated; and there were several different forms of state pension, which lead to some duplication of records.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/11">ONS liaised with the Department for Work and Pensions and Oxford University to obtain 'clean' pensions data relating to May 2000, but some inaccuracies will undoubtedly remain. There is also a difference of almost a year between the date of the pensions information and Census day. These points should be borne in mind when making any comparisons.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">The Government offer lower duty rates for less environmentally-damaging fuels by offering duty differentials relative to the main road fuels. These differentials are intended primarily to reflect the relative environmental benefits of the fuels in question, but they also take account of other factors, such as costs of production and supply, and wider social and economic benefits, including fuel security and the potential to encourage the recycling of waste products. The primary environmental aim of the incentive for biofuels is to reduce greenhouse emissions, and for road fuel gases, to improve local air quality. The incentives also take account of the fact that, unlike biofuels, road fuel gases require a separate refuelling infrastructure and specially designed or converted vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">The UK has made annual repayments of principal and interest of around 138 million US dollars to the United States in respect of its Second World War loans. The payments were made in US dollars at the end of each calendar year except on six occasions. Payments were deferred, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, due to prevailing international exchange rate conditions and the level of the United Kingdom's foreign currency and gold reserves in 1956, 1957, 1964, 1965, 1968 and 1976. Consequently, repayment of the war loans to the United States Government should be completed in 2006.</p>

From April 2003, 75 per cent. of the total National Health Service budget is now allocated directly to primary care trusts. We have reduced management bureaucracy through the abolition of regional offices and the replacement of 95 health authorities with 28 strategic health authorities. The number of managers in strategic health authorities in 2002 was around 1,400 compared with 5,700 in health authorities in 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.8/1">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill provides for the Independent Regulator for NHS Foundation Trusts to make a code for determining the limit of borrowing by each NHS foundation trust, having regard to generally accepted principles used by financial institutions. The regulator is required to lay the code before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.8/2">In the course of developing policy on the financial regime for NHS foundation trusts, the Department of Health has consulted leading financial institutions on the financial metrics and ratios that it might be appropriate to include in such a code. These have been made available to NHS foundation trust applicants for planning purposes as they prepare their full applications. The metrics and ratios are currently under review and will be published shortly.</p>

Muscle for testing has been taken from BSE challenged animals at several time points after infection. The study was initiatied in 1996 and is projected to continue until 2013. The recipient animals are at various stages in the study, but none have been found positive for BSE infection.
