In the Strategic Defence and Security Review we set out our plans to deliver the helicopter capability to support Future Force 2020 through a mix of Apache, Chinook, Merlin, Wildcat and Puma helicopters. Any future helicopter procurement would consider the X3 during the assessment phase as a matter of course, but at present we have no outstanding requirement for a new type of helicopter, and no specific assessment is judged necessary for the Eurocopter X3.</p>

As part of this commitment, the banks will make available appropriate capital and resources to support &#163;190 billion of new credit to businesses in 2011, up from &#163;179 billion in 2010. If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more, including creating the balance sheet capacity necessary to do so. &#163;76 billion of this lending capacity will be available to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is a 15 per cent increase on 2010 lending of &#163;66 billion.</p>

This is why the Family Justice Review invited evidence on this issue. The panel received evidence from a wide range of organisations, groups and individuals which is helping to shape its recommendations. In addition, the Government published a consultation <I>Child Maintenance Reform: Strengthening Families, Promoting Parental Responsibility</I> in January this year. This consultation included questions on how support services can better support families experiencing relationship breakdown. Once the Family Justice Review Panel has issued its final report in the autumn, we shall give full consideration as to whether further assessment of the needs of parents, grandparents and extended family members who are separated from children is required.</p>

For example, the Government do not consider it proportionate or practical to extend criminal health and safety law, including inspections, to private households employing domestic workers. This would place a huge regulatory and administrative burden on individuals, and could have detrimental social consequences: for example, if increased burdens were to prevent elderly or disabled individuals from employing nurses or carers in their own homes. Given these difficulties, the UK would be unable to ratify the convention and consequently the decision was taken to abstain in the vote.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.5/1">We expect wireless broadband to deliver the same benefits as any other method of deployment and that a mixture of technologies including fixed, wireless and satellite will be required to achieve the Government's aim of 90 per cent of the population having access to superfast broadband and the rest having access to a connection capable of delivering at least 2 Mbps. Broadband Delivery UK's work conducted with the industry in summer 2010 to assess the costs of providing 2 Mbps service in remote and rural areas demonstrated that the precise mix will depend on local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/2"><I>Letter from Stephen Penneck, Director General for ONS, to Lord Kennedy of Southwark, dated July 2011.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking how many people in the 32 London Boroughs and the City of London have been paid the minimum wage in each year since its introduction up until the last year for which figures are available. (HL10673)</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/4">I am afraid that estimates for the number of jobs paid at the national minimum wage are not available below regional level. Accordingly, I attach a table showing the number of employee jobs earning less than the national minimum wage for London and the UK from April 1999 to April 2010, the latest period for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/5">A guide to measuring low pay and associated articles can be found on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?</a> vink=5837.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/6">Background Note</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/7">1. Estimates for the number of employee jobs paid below the national minimum wage are provided from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). Estimates of numbers of employees jobs paid at the national minimum wage are not released since the hourly rate used in the national minimum wage calculation is derived by dividing weekly earnings for employees by the number of hours worked. Since the rate is a ratio between hours and earnings the estimate of those working at a specific rate would be underestimated due to rounding issues in the calculation of the ratio.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/8">2. Figures are provided for the number of employee jobs for London and the UK as a whole paid below the national minimum wage in April 1999 to 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.2/9">3. The estimates for 1999-2003 are produced using the average of estimates produced using the Labour Force Survey and the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings to which the methodology developed in 2004 has been applied. Because these estimates are partly based on LFS data, the standard LFS policy for suppression of earnings estimates has been used. LFS earnings estimates of less than 30,000 people are not published because they have a 95% confidence interval of roughly +1- 12,000, i.e. 40% of the size of the estimate. This threshold should be borne in mind when using and interpreting the data in the table. For 2004 and later years estimates are based on ASHE data only. The ASHE methodology allows publication of smaller estimates than the old low pay methodology. Estimates are published as long as the coefficient of variation (the ratio of the standard error of an estimate to the estimate) is 20% or less. The quality of estimates is also indicated by their coefficient of variation, as summarised in the key. Exact coefficients of variation for the estimates for 2004 and subsequent years are shown in Table 1b.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.6/1">Through its Ticketshare scheme, the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) is charging a levy on high-end prestige ticket packages to fund donated tickets. LOCOG will provide 5,000 of these tickets to Sport England and the sports councils in the devolved administrations. Sport England has announced their plans to use some of their share of these tickets to support their Sportivate initiative; numbers remain to be determined. Sports councils in the devolved Administrations are now aware of this offer and we expect to hear back from them once they have been able to give it full consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.6/2">In addition, LOCOG will provide 50,000 Ticketshare tickets for schools outside London-across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These will be distributed to schools that have applied to join the London 2012 Get Set Network, so the distribution of tickets between the nations will be on the basis of the take-up of the scheme by schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.3/1">The spending review recognised the importance of social care in protecting the most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.3/2">Local authorities are responsible for decisions on how to allocate their resources. They are therefore responsible for assessing the impact of their spending decisions, which may include an equality analysis if appropriate.
