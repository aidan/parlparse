	<p pid="a.185.5/1">The rigorous application of strict export licence assessment criteria and maximum transparency in information exchanges on arms transfers are central to keeping arms out of the hands of terrorists and in tracing flows of weapons, particularly small arms. We therefore work closely with our EU partners on the operation of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and on the weapons collection and destruction projects funded under the EU Joint Action on Small Arms. There are regular EU co-ordination exchanges with the United States and Russia, as well as UK national contacts with both the US and Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.5/2">We also work for greater control of small arms at the UN and OSCE. We have consistently argued for small arms to be included in the Wassenaar Arrangement's information exchanges on arms transfers. In spite of our efforts, the Wassenaar Arrangement Plenary in December 2001 was not able to agree to this move, although Wassenaar has previously agreed guidelines on the transfer of MANPADS (Man-Portable Air Defence Systems) because of concerns about exploitation by terrorists. The 2001 plenary was, however, able to agree that one of Wassenaar's fundamental aims was to prevent arms flows to terrorists.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.5/1">Bullying and harassment have no place in today's work environment and are unacceptable whenever they occur. The Government strongly condemn such behaviour and believe employees should be able to work without fear of encountering bullying from their employers or anyone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/2">The adoption of best employment relations practice should help to create a culture where bullying becomes unacceptable. The Government have established the Partnership Fund which encourages participative and open cultures within organisations. There are a number of projects which are specifically focusing on the issue of bullying and more that include it as part of their overall culture change.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/3">Moreover, we are working closely with the Health and Safety Executive on the development of management standards. The first step is to undertake research to establish the real extent of the problem and how it manifests itself in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/4">There are a number of legal measures employees can turn to if the situation requires it. ACAS has produced a code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures developed in September 2000 which has a section relating to bullying. The code also offers advice to employees and employers in this and many areas of employment relations. The code can be taken into account in an employment tribunal and therefore carries weight.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-01-21a.189.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="189"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020121/text/20121w02.htm#20121w02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.189.5/1">The Department of Health commissioned independent assessors to lead a review of the inquiry report and other relevant information and make recommendations on whether or not any action should be initiated in respect of Dr Doyle. The assessors were Lesley James, former Vice-President of the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, and Sir David Carter, Vice-Principal of Edinburgh University. Their overall conclusion was that Dr Doyle responded appropriately to the information he was given by Dr Bolsin on <phrase class="date" code="1994-07-19">19 July 1994</phrase> about poor results following paediatric cardiac surgery in the Bristol unit, taking into account the context in which he was operating at the time. They concluded that, while it is possible with hindsight to question Dr Doyle's decision not to examine the detailed data he was given by Dr Bolsin, any criticism has to be balanced both against the prompt and positive action he did take in writing to Professor Angelini at the Trust, raising the concerns that had been drawn to his attention and seeking reassurances, and against the subsequent assurances he was given. The Chief Executive of the Department of Health, Nigel Crisp, has accepted their conclusions, including the recommendation that no disciplinary action is warranted and that Dr Doyle should resume his current duties in the department, working as the Senior Medical Officer providing advice on renal services and transplant services&mdash;which he has done.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-01-21a.191.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100688" speakername="Lord Williams of Mostyn" colon=":" colnum="191"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020121/text/20121w02.htm#20121w02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.191.0/1">Government policy in this area has been to encourage people to liaise with the police in a bid to make them more secure within their own community, or, if they have been obliged to move, to work towards their re-integration. This is because there is a tension between the Government's desire to help those genuinely in need and, by so doing, actually furthering the objectives of those trying to force them from their homes. Formalising the development of policy and the co-ordination of support activities, as the commitee advocates, would risk sending a signal to paramilitaries that, by working to alleviate the consequences of their actions, the Government were tacitly allowing them to continue with impunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/2">The Government are satisfied that the support necessary for victims of intimidation resettling in Great Britain is in place but that the committee is right to highlight the need for clear information to be available locally on how to gain access to that support. Citizens' advice bureaux appear to fulfil that function very satisfactorily; we are studying their guidance and, if it is considered that supplementary material or tailoring specific to the needs of victims of intimidation is necessary, we will pursue that with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.3/1">The Commissioner for Public Appointments' Code of Practice (CPA) makes clear that first re-appointments may be made, subject to certain considerations, without the need for an open competition. The re-appointments of the eight Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissioners were made in accordance with that code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.3/2">Ministers decided that it was particularly important in considering appointments to a newly established body such as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to strike a balance between injecting fresh thinking and providing continuity, especially while the commission was undertaking important, long-term projects such as the consultation exercise on the scope for a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.3/3">As there is no statutory requirement for the commission to be a particular size, the Secretary of State decided to re-appoint the existing commissioners and to strengthen the commission's existing ability to respond to the demands on its time and very heavy workload by appointing new members to the commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.3/4">Given the guidance on re-appointments from the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, it is not necessary or appropriate to compare the merits of those re-appointed with those who applied in 2001 to become members of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.</p>
