	<p pid="b.1.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/2" qnum="HL567">Whether, as part of the initiatives they are taking on Africa, they have had discussions with major United Kingdom-based companies operating in African countries about increasing transparency and reducing corruption; and, in particular, whether they have persuaded any of those companies to accord with the Publish What You Pay protocol.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.2/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) has discussed, and continues to discuss, the issues of increasing transparency and accountability in Africa with many UK-based companies. In particular, DfID regularly consults companies such as BP, Shell, Anglo-American, Rio Tinto, a coalition of investors lead by F&amp;C Asset Management, and numerous other companies on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/2">All of those companies are active participants in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which was launched by the Prime Minister in 2002, partly in response to the Publish What You Pay campaign. Twelve countries in Africa have either endorsed, or are implementing the EITI, and as such all oil, gas, and mining companies operating in these countries will eventually be required to make available details of all payments made to those governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/3">With the infrastructure sector, DfID and other government departments have recently initiated a private/public sector anti-corruption partnership to promote best practice in the sector. This partnership will help promote awareness of the UK law on bribing overseas officials as well as the procedures in place in the UK and in UK embassies and high commissions for reporting demanded bribes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/4">Separately, as part of the Government's efforts to raise awareness of the risks of foreign bribery and corruption, DfID has held information events for the UK business community in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, as well as other countries outside Africa.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.3/1">Climate change is the most important long-term threat we face. It does not respect national borders and demands a global response. Not all countries' responses come from the same perspective, but the United Kingdom's G8 presidency is an opportunity to agree on the need for urgent action to cut greenhouse gases, and to make real progress on the practical question of how we do this, now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/2">G8 negotiations are ongoing and will not be completed until the summit. In the mean time, as usual, the Government do not comment on leaked documents.</p>

This process includes specific criteria whereby we will not issue a licence where there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression or that the export may be used aggressively against another country. While we are unable to comment on specific licences, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, it should be noted that figures in the Strategic Export Controls Quarterly Reports 2004 for Ethiopia and Eritrea include transactions in support of international humanitarian missions, and goods intended for industrial use.

	<p pid="b.9.3/1">There is no doubt that violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in Darfur. We have consistently made clear that the perpetrators of these terrible crimes must be brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.3/2">The UK applies the definition of genocide given in the International Criminal Court Act 2001. Under the Act, &quot;genocide&quot; is defined by reference to Article 6 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, as certain acts &quot;committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group&quot;. This mirrors the language contained in the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, particularly Article 2. The UK, Canada and Germany are party to the Rome Statute and, together with the US, to the Genocide Convention. It is up to individual countries to choose how to interpret and apply these definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.3/3">The UK did not have sufficient evidence to judge whether the crimes perpetrated in Sudan were undertaken with the intent necessary to constitute genocide.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.3/4">For this reason, we pressed for the Secretary-General of the United Nations to establish an expert international commission of inquiry (ICI) to investigate reports, of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in Darfur in 2004, and to determine whether genocide had occurred. The ICI's report, issued to the Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>, concluded that the government of Sudan (GoS) did not appear to have pursued a policy of genocide in Darfur and that, while individuals may have done so, this was a determination which only a competent court could make. The conclusion that no genocidal policy had been pursued by the GoS in no way detracted from the gravity of the crimes committed, including crimes against humanity and/or war crimes. The UK played a leading role in sponsoring UN Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005) of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>, in which the Security Council referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC)&mdash;as recommended by the ICI.

	<p pid="b.10.2/1">The Government remain concerned by developments in Darfur and strongly support the African Union's (AU) mission in Darfur (AMIS). The UN Secretary-General has noted that where the ALT has been deployed it has made a positive impact and ceasefire violations had starkly reduced. The expansion of the AU force from, 3,300 to more than 7,700, will allow better geographical coverage of Darfur, and should improve the security situation. Given this, the government policy is to support AMIS expansion, including through NATO and EU assistance for airlift training and equipment. The UK has announced that it will provide a further &pound;19 million, which will be used primarily to purchase vehicles and equipment and fund (NATO co-ordinated) airlift support. The UK also stands ready to provide military and police experts in support of NATO and EU assistance. We do not believe there is a need for a NATO peacekeeping force, nor is there any support for this from African or NATO governments.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.5/1">We agree that the malnutrition problem in Ed Daein is grave. Two nutritional surveys carried out in the region show a marked deterioration in the situation. A September 2004 survey carried out in Ed Daein by Save the Children showed that 11.9 per cent of those surveyed under-five years old were suffering global acute malnutrition (GAM), with 1.3 per cent suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). A March 2005 survey by Tearfund, supported by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) showed that these rates had risen to GAM of 25.2 per cent and SAM of 4.3 per cent. GAM rates of 20 per cent or above or SAM rates of 5 per cent or above denote a crisis situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.5/2">Tearfund is providing intensive, clinical feeding to 190 children and providing additional high nutritive rations to 330 children in Ed Daein, though Tearfund expects that the figures will increase during the July to October hungry season. The World Food Programme (WFP) has also been distributing a supplementary ration, in addition to the general rations, in the area since the March assessment. The WFP vulnerability analysis and mapping team, in collaboration with the Italian NGO Alisei, has conducted a rapid needs assessment in the Asalaya area of Ed Daein. The results are expected shortly.</p>
