	<p pid="a.154.5/1">Further to the reply of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary in another place (House of Commons Official Report, col. 534W on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-08">8 December</phrase>), he has today appointed Sir Alan Budd as chairman of the Gambling Review Body. Sir Alan is Provost of The Queen's College, Oxford, and a former Chief Economic Adviser to the Treasury. The position is unpaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/2">We will make a further announcement on the membership of the review body in the next few weeks. We hope it will start work shortly after Easter, to report by the summer, 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/3">The terms of reference for the gambling review are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/4" class="indent">Consider the current state of the gambling industry and the ways in which it might change over the next 10 years in the light of economic pressures, the growth of e-commerce, technological developments and wider leisure industry and international trends.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/5" class="indent">Consider the social impact of gambling and the costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/6" class="indent">Consider, and make recommendations for the kind and extent of regulation appropriate for gambling activities in Great Britain, having regard to:</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/7" class="indent">their wider social impact;</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/8" class="indent">the need to protect the young and vulnerable from exploitation and to protect all gamblers from unfair practices;</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/9" class="indent">the importance of preventing gambling from being carried out in a way which allows crime and disorder or public nuisance;</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/10" class="indent">the need to keep the industry free from infiltration by organised and other serious crime and from money laundering risks;</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/11" class="indent">the desirability of creating an environment in which the commercial opportunities for gambling, including its international competitiveness, maximise the United Kingdom's economic welfare; and</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/12" class="indent">the implications for the current system of taxation, and the scope for its further development.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/13">Consider the need for, and if necessary recommend, new machinery appropriate for carrying out that regulation which achieves a more consistent and streamlined approach than is now possible and which is financed by the gambling industry itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/14">Consider the availability and effectiveness of treatment programmes for problem gamblers and make recommendations for their future provision, potential costings and funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.5/15">In conducting this review, the body should not consider changes to the National Lottery, but it will need to look at the impact on the lottery of any proposed changes, including an assessment of the potential effect on the income to good causes.</p>

I understand the elections to the Greater London Council were classified as local government elections. Prior to 1973 the election of councillors to the GLC was based on multi-member electoral areas, the largest of which was Croydon in 1970, with an electorate of some 240,000 electing four candidates.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.2/1">The Government have funded work since 1996 to explore non-chemical methods as alternative approaches to sheep scab control. This programme is based on findings from earlier published work funded by MAFF at the Royal Veterinary College. The earlier results showed evidence for an immune response in the blood of sheep affected with sheep scab mites. To determine the significance of this finding and to investigate the various biological process involved, funding was provided for a four-year collaborative research programme at &pound;350,000 to &pound;400,000 per annum. The results of these studies in 1999 show that the approach to the immunological control of sheep scab is complex and requires an understanding of a number of key elements if a vaccine is to be developed. A new three-year programme with funding continuing at &pound;350,000 to &pound;400,000 per annum has been approved which will focus on these key elements.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/2">The overall sheep scab research programme since 1996 has included studies on the factors influencing the spread of sheep scab, factors associated with infestation and those involved in the development of clincial disease. A report on the studies dated August 1999 is available from MAFF Chief Scientist's Group. This work has also shown that there may be some potential for the control of sheep scab by the use of a natural fungus that infects the mites. Further work to investigate the potential of this approach is built into the new three-year programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.0/1">The Health and Safety Executive sponsored a study by the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) in 1993 which considered levels of endotoxins in dipping baths before and after dipping and airborne concentrations of endotoxin to which workers dipping sheep were exposed. This was a pilot study to identify whether further research was needed. The results indicated that there was potential for worker exposure to endotoxin during sheep dipping but the airborne concentrations were lower than those reported in other industries such as wool processing. The report has been publised by the IOM.</p>
