	<p pid="a.19.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/2" qnum="HL3617">What plans they have with regard to the enforcement of fines imposed by the magistrates' courts.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-06-25a.19.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="19"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030625/text/30625w01.htm#30625w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.19.2/1">Too many fines are not paid. In the year 2002&ndash;03, an unacceptable 45 per cent of fines were not paid. In some areas the level of default was as high as 60 per cent. The authority of the courts must be enforced. We are announcing today a new approach to the collection of fines.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">First, fines will no longer be written off. They will be chased until they are paid, no longer being written off, as they often are, after twelve months.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">Secondly, we will make it easier to deduct the fine directly from the offender's pay or benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/4">Thirdly, if the offender really cannot pay, we will allow the fine to be paid off by unpaid work in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/5">Fourthly, where courts have been ineffective in the collection of fines we will allow the private sector to be brought into the collection of fines.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/6">Fifthly, we will introduce a new offence of failing to provide details of income and expenditure to allow deduction orders to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/7">Sixthly, we will consider allowing deductions for earlier payment, but we will increase the fines for late payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/8">Seventhly, we will work with the courts to ensure that there are incentives for those individual fine officers who collect fines effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/9">This seven-point plan will be driven personally by the ministers in DCA. They will intervene personally with any magistrates' courts committees that continue to perform badly.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/10">Fine enforcement is a priority. The DCA's job is now actively to ensure the courts are effective in fighting crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/11">A report on the annual performance data was placed in the Libraries of both Houses today entitled Fine Enforcement Performance in 2002&ndash;03. The report shows that performance overall was poor, with the 42 independent magistrates' courts committees (MCCs) failing to deliver the overall national target of a payment rate of 68 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/12">The Government commissioned an independent review, A Review of Magistrates' Courts Enforcement Strategies, which we are also placing in the Libraries of both Houses today.</p>

None of these countries is listed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a SARS-affected country requiring restrictions on international travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/2">SARS is a serious public health issue and the approach of the Department of Health Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) Northern Ireland has been to act quickly to strengthen its public health surveillance systems and make sure that the health service is prepared should a case occur in Northern Ireland. The department is represented on the national SARS taskforce, which itself works closely with the WHO. The taskforce agrees all relevant control measures and these are then implemented locally. As early as <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-14">14 March</phrase> the Chief Medical Officer, Dr Henrietta Campbell, contacted all relevant healthcare professionals with detailed information on the symptoms of SARS, and what to do if they encountered a case. Updated guidance based on advice from WHO has been issued at regular intervals since, both to professionals and to people travelling abroad. The department has established a SARS section on its website which is regularly updated. It has also provided and made arrangements for posters to be displayed at appropriate points in airports and seaports. There have been no SARS cases so far in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.8/3">In conjunction with the Centre for Communicable Disease Control (CDSC) (NI), the department is urgently developing a contingency plan for SARS or other emerging infection.

	<p pid="a.22.3/1">The Crown Prosecution Service will only bring a prosecution if there is sufficient admissible evidence to provide a realistic prospect of obtaining a conviction and a prosecution is in the public interest. It will continually review cases to ensure that such tests are met. In the appeal of Sally Clark the Court of Appeal focussed on the non-disclosure of potentially significant evidence by Dr Williams and the use and presentation of statistical data by Professor Meadow.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.3/2">The Solicitor-General and I have met the DPP to discuss the implications of the appeal. Since the written reasons of the Court of Appeal were made available in the case of Sally Clark, and following the acquittal of Trupti Patel, the Crown Prosecution Service has undertaken a number of measures. First, interim guidance has been sent to all chief crown prosecutors requesting that all cases be identified in which either Dr Williams or Professor Meadow are witnesses. The defence is then to be served with a copy of the judgment in the Sally Clark case and its attention is drawn to sections of the judgment touching on his evidence. Further and fuller guidance will be provided to prosecutors as soon as possible. This will apply to both present and future cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.3/3">With respect to previous cases in which Dr Williams has given material evidence, the Crown Prosecution Service is presently considering the implications of the Sally Clark judgment and is in discussion with other relevant agencies, including the police and Home Office. I intend to establish a group comprising these agencies to consider whether any cases resulting in a conviction in which Dr Williams has given important evidence require a more in-depth review.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.3/4">The Home Office Pathology Advisory Board will I understand publish new codes of practice and procedure for pathologists, which will take account of the judicial comments on the methodology employed by Dr Williams in the Sally Clark case. Once published, the codes will be distributed to pathologists.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.3/5">In its published judgment, the Court of Appeal raised no criticism of the Crown Prosecution Service for its handling of the prosecution of Sally Clark, neither did the judge criticise the CPS for bringing the prosecution in respect of Trupti Patel.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.2/1">Very substantial progress has been made with housing on Montserrat since the volcanic crisis. Currently, all except five persons (who are refusing shelter) are housed.

	<p pid="a.23.2/2">A final phase of DfID assistance for housing those who stayed on Montserrat during the crisis, making a further &pound;10 million available, has been agreed.

	<p pid="a.23.5/1">The humanitarian situation in Liberia has deteriorated significantly in recent weeks. Increased fighting between government troops and rebel opposition forces came to within 5 kilometres of Monrovia between June 6 and 10. This led to the displacement of 200,000 civilians into Monrovia. There are reports of cholera and measles in Monrovia, and there are already food shortages. UN expatriate staff have been evacuated. Following the ECOWAS-brokered ceasefire on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-17">17 June</phrase>, it is essential that, as soon as possible, the Liberian parties arrange access to all areas from which humanitarian agencies have been excluded by fighting.</p>

We have also allocated &pound;374,065 support to Merlin for the provision of emergency health care in Monrovia and other areas. This will supplement &pound;450,000 committed to Medecins Sans Frontieres for secondary health care provision in Monrovia in 2002. We expect to allocate the remaining balance to support other funding requests that strengthen the geographical and sectoral coverage of the relief programme. We are in regular contact with a number of organisations operating to meet humanitarian needs in Liberia, including Oxfam, Save the Children UK, Medecins Sans Frontieres and World Vision. We expect to receive and fund proposals from these organisations in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.2/2">Most third countries stopped import of live animals of susceptible species and their products when foot and mouth disease (FMD) was confirmed in February 2001. Since January 2002 when the OIE declared the UK free of FMD, MAFF/Defra has been working hard to reinstate these export markets. Significant progress has been made in respect of meat and meat products, but it has proven more difficult to persuade countries to reopen markets to live animals and genetic material.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/3">Defra is working closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, British Trade International and the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) to target the key markets that have been identified by industry and encourage those governments that have a ban in place to lift it and also agree the necessary certification.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/4">In addition to the import ban imposed as a result of FMD, a significant number of countries are still refusing to accept imports of UK animals, meat and products for other disease-related reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/5">The despatch of goods containing bovine material is subject to strict requirements, as laid down in the Bovines and Bovine Products (Trade) Regulations 1999, as amended. It is currently illegal to export cattle, beef or beef products from the UK unless they have been produced under either the date-based export scheme (DBES) (for beef from cattle reared and slaughtered in the UK) or the XAP scheme (using foreign origin beef). Tables 3-6 detail the latest information on other countries' bans on British beef.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/6">A top priority for the UK is to secure moderate BSE risk status (and the abolition of DBES), which will then enable the UK to trade on a level playing field with other member states. Now that the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) has amended the thresholds for categorising countries according to BSE risks we are looking to secure the benefits of moderate risk status as early as possible in 2004. We have written to the Commission to outline our proposals, stressing the great importance the UK attaches to this issue, and have been encouraged by the Commission's positive reception.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/7">Defra publishes lists of available export health certificates by country for specific meat and meat products on its website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/int-trde/prod-ex/certlist.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/int-trde/prod-ex/certlist.pdf</a>). The website also includes details of the restrictions imposed by third countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/8">Defra continues in active liaison with the industry to press all these remaining countries at all levels to lift their restrictions. Defra is unable to state when this will be successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.2/1">The Government have agreed to support the establishment of a database of all equines in Great Britain though this is not a direct obligation arising from the horse passports legislation. We are working closely with the equine industry to develop a database which meets the requirements of both government and industry. The Government have agreed in principle to fund the start-up costs of a database, subject to the further detailed work on costs and benefits that is now being undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.5/1">Our research has been inconclusive. We have found no evidence that the circular is still in force but equally no evidence of its cancellation. As the circular dealt mainly with the immediate tasks of the then National Parks Commission, it was probably cancelled long ago. It does not appear in the main current reference works and, even if still technically extant, it should certainly be regarded as defunct.</p>
