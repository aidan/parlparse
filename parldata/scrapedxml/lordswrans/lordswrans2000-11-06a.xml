	<p pid="a.121.2/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office is today publishing a consultation document which sets out proposals for an order under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, 1994, to deregulate certain aspects of the bingo industry. Our consultation document makes three specific proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">First, we propose the abolition of a requirement for licensed bingo clubs to notify the licensing authority of changes in their charges to players 14 days in advance. This part of our proposals will also have a small benefit for licensed casinos.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/3">Second, we propose to change the law so as to allow bingo clubs to have a mixture of jackpot and lower prize gaming machines. Finally, we propose to amend the law on multiple bingo--also known as the &quot;National Game&quot;-- so that it can offer more than one national, regional, and house prize.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/4">The Government believe that these reforms will benefit both the industry and its customers. The consultation document asks for responses by <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-16">16 February 2001</phrase>. Copies are being arranged to be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.5/3">The Commission for Racial Equality has produced a report which it believes meets both the requirements of the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Commission's own need to report on achievements against targets which are based on the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.5/4">However, since the Race Relations Act 1976 requires reports to be made in relation to the calendar year, and as soon as practicable after the end of the year, we have advised the Commission that future reports need to follow these requirements until such times as Parliament may decide to amend the Act.</p>

Since 1970 a system of licensing has been in operation whereby anyone wishing to acquire all but the smallest fireworks required a licence from the Secretary of State. Following a review in 1996 the law was amended whereby the requirement for a licence has since been confined to the larger display-type fireworks. The law remains under review as evidenced most recently by the Explosives (Fireworks) Regulations (NI) 1999 which, inter alia, proscribed mini-rockets, certain categories of air bomb and firework of erratic flight.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.1/2" qnum="HL4244">What are the sources of funding for ex-prisoners and for victims' groups in Northern Ireland; and what are the amounts of money supplied to them.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-11-06a.125.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="125"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001106/text/01106w01.htm#01106w01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.125.2/1">The NIO is responsible for match funding applications by ex-prisoners and victims' groups under Measures 4.4 and 4.6 of the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (Peace Programme). These measures aim to promote the social inclusion of those who are at the margin of social and economic life.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/2">In the five years in which the programme has been running, victims and ex-prisoners have received the following amounts under both Measures:</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/3" class="indent">Ex-prisoners: &pound;3.9 million</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/4" class="indent">Victims: &pound;2.4 million</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/5">The major source of funding for victims' groups is the Victims Liaison Unit in the Northern Ireland Office, which has, since it was established in June 1998, provided funding through a series of initiatives to support groups that are working with victims of the Troubles. To date, the unit has made available to groups:</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/6" class="indent">&pound;3 million through a core funding scheme administered by the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust;</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/7" class="indent">&pound;255,000.00 through a &quot;Victim Support Grant Scheme&quot; administered by the Community Relations Council;</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/8" class="indent">&pound;46,000.00 for a series of pilot schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/9">Victims may also, either on an individual basis or with the help of a victims' group, avail themselves of the funds and services provided by the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund. The fund, which is an independent charity set up by the Government, has, to date, received &pound;2 million from the Government, in addition to funds it has raised by its own efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/10">Ex-prisoners and victims have access to measures within the Peace Programme other than those match funded by NIO, and can access funding from other sources such as private trusts, the National Lottery Charities Board or other locally funded schemes. They may also obtain funding from departments within the devolved administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/11">Moreover, the NIO and Probation Board provide funding to the Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and Extern. There are voluntary organisations that provide a range of service to ex-prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">I have today placed copies of the Chief Inspector's Annual Report in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/2">The Chief Inspector reports a noticeable improvement in overall proficiency across the service. Magistrates' courts committees have faced up to hard decisions and shown determination in executing them. While further improvements are needed, such as in the management of performance through the monitoring of suitable indicators, magistrates' courts committees are demonstrating an increasing willingness to think strategically.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/3">Although most MCCs continued to show significant weaknesses in managing performance in case administration, all magistrates' courts committees inspected achieved average or better than average case completion times. There were also some encouraging signs of recent improvement. The Chief Inspector also noted that there had been good inter-agency work on the planning and implementation of the new Narey procedures and Youth Court Joint Performance Improvement Plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.2/1">The Petroleum (Consolidation) Act 1928 requires that anyone who keeps more than a minimal amount of petrol must obtain a licence from his local petroleum licensing authority. The requirement applies to all petrol filling stations. The Local Authority Co-ordinating Body on Food and Trading Standards (LACOTS) has issued a standard set of licence conditions. One of the standard conditions is that the licensee shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, take all steps necessary to prevent smoking taking place in any hazardous area where petroleum spirit is kept, handled or exposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/2">A further condition requires petrol filling station licensees to display notices stating &quot;No Smoking&quot; and &quot;Petroleum Spirit--Highly Flammable&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.3/2">We have carefully considered the extent to which changes needed to be made to the scheme, which was heavily oversubscribed after it opened in April 1999 as a much improved replacement for the previous conversion aid arrangements. We believe that the priority is to reopen the Organic Farming Scheme as quickly as possible, and accordingly we will begin accepting applications from <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-02">2 January 2001</phrase>, with the first new payments being made in April 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.3/4">Against this background, one change is being made to the scheme when it reopens, subject to parliamentary approval.

	<p pid="a.130.3/2">Clinical practice in resuscitation decision-making is one example of clinical decision-making which takes place in hospitals every day.

	<p pid="a.133.0/1">Selective influenza immunisation is recommended to protect those who are most at risk of serious illness or death should they develop influenza. This year, influenza immunisation should be offered to people with underlying ill health due to:</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/3">The measure of income used when looking at the proportion of either children or pensioners below different thresholds of income is net equivalised household income. The process of equivalisation involves the adjustment of household income to take into account variations in the size and composition of the households in which individuals live. It reflects the common-sense notion that, in order to enjoy a comparable standard of living, a household of two adults with four children will need a higher income than a person living alone. The income of the family is therefore adjusted downwards in relation to that of the single person in order to allow sensible income comparisons between the different household types. The adjustment made takes into account both the number of adults and also the number and ages of children living in a household.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.2/1">The &quot;Learning from Success&quot; conferences offered Ministers and officials the chance to listen to the views of head teachers from just over 1,500 schools. It was the most extensive interactive consultation exercise ever carried out with head teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/2">The conferences were held at five venues across England from 18-<phrase class="date" code="2000-09-22">22 September 2000</phrase>. The locations for each conference were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/3" class="indent"><phrase class="date" code="2000-09-18">Monday 18 September</phrase>--The Paragon Hotel, London;</p>

	<p pid="a.136.2/22">One of the most innovative aspects of the Learning from Success conferences was the use of keypad technology to involve every delegate, thereby giving them the opportunity to instantly register their views on a range of issues. Responses to questions were immediately displayed to the audience and the range of opinion explored.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/23">Results from the answer to the first keypad question &quot;What type of school do you work in?&quot; show that</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/24">91 per cent of delegates who registered an answer were school representatives. The invitations sent out to the conferences were addressed to the head teachers of schools, so the vast majority of school representatives were heads. The invitation letter did state that if the head teacher was unable to attend then he or she had the opportunity to send a member of their senior teaching staff in their place; therefore it is possible that not all school representatives would have been head teachers.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.2/1">The evaluation of the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment assesses employment practice in relation to recruitment, promotion, training and development, redundancy and retirement. Not surprisingly, few employers acknowledge that they discriminate unjustifiably on grounds of age. However, there is some evidence to suggest that companies are beginning to adopt more age aware policies, at least in the area of recruitment. For example, the second wave of the evaluation shows that during the company selection process, less than one in five (16 per cent) organisations report taking age into consideration. This is a reduction from the first wave of the evaluation, immediately prior to the launch of the code, when approximately one quarter (27 per cent) reported taking age into consideration when recruiting new staff. These results are based on survey findings at Wave 2, just six months after the code was introduced. Details of the findings can be accessed on the DfEE website at http://www/dfee.gov.uk/research/re-brief/RBX6.doc. Results of the full evaluation, based on research findings 16 months after the code was first issued, will be published by summer 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.2/1">Research by the National Foundation of Educational Research (NFER) in England and Wales (1997) found that children's attainment at Key Stage 1 was significantly related to their age, season of birth and length of schooling. More recent research (Tymms et al, 2000) shows that the gap tends to close during the primary years.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/2">At GCSE, research by Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR) published in 1998 found a statistically significant variation in pupils' examination performance according to the month of their birth. Similar work by OCR at GCE A level found this variation then diminished. We are not aware of any more recent research in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/3">Tymms et al (1997) considered that other factors such as school attendance, prior attainment and school attended are more significant for pupils' ultimate performance than the month of their birth.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/4">Current legislation requires that pupils start school by the beginning of the term following their fifth birthday. Many parents do choose to enrol their children before that. There are no plans to raise the age of entry.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.9/1">The majority of vehicles in DfEE, including the Employment Service, are disposed of at public auction. Reserve prices are set using commercially available guides. A very small number, less than 6 per cent, are sold to staff under a scheme that allows car users to purchase their &quot;company car&quot; at the end of its useful life. The same price is set whether the car is sold at auction or to the driver.</p>
