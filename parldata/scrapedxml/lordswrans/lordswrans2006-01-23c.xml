	<p pid="c.143.2/1">The Police Federation of England and Wales was established by the Police Act 1919, under which it has a statutory responsibility to represent its members in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency. There is no similar basis under which members of the Armed Forces could form an association along these lines.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.2/2">There are, however, a number of alternative processes in place to ensure members of the Armed Forces can express their views on matters which affect their service or their welfare. There are regular surveys to monitor welfare matters, and it is an integral part of the duty of our chain of command to look after the welfare and well-being of their people. Individuals have the right to complain about any matter relating to their service to the Defence Council. Further modernisation of the complaints process is being proposed, including the introduction of an independent element as part of the Armed Forces Bill.</p>

The National Screening Committee keeps this work under review.</p>

It is worth noting that prostate cancer is the only cancer with a Department of Health research target, and we are currently spending the promised &pound;4.2 million a year.

The &pound;5.1 billion figure in Table B22 of the 2005 Pre-Budget Report was rolled forward from the outturn data for 2004&ndash;05, which showed asset disposals continuing at a higher level than forecast by Lyons.</p>

	<p pid="c.149.5/1">The Government's intentions were set out on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-21">21 December 2004</phrase> in a Written Statement in the other place by Des Browne MP, at that time Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality. From late 2006, adults applying for a passport for the first time will be required to attend a short meeting before a passport can be issued. Applications will, as now, be sent in by post or through the check and send service. When the UK Passport Service has completed the checks needed to establish that an application shows a real identity that is eligible for a British passport, the applicant will be invited to make an appointment at an interview office. The key purpose of the interview is to ascertain that the applicant actually is the person whose details were given in the application. To do this, the interview will use questions based on information derived from the checking process. The genuine applicant will know the answers but a person attempting to use another's identity may not. This improvement in the process of establishing identity supports the improvements in passport security being introduced through the use of biometric technology. Since the announcement was made, preparatory work for implementation has continued and detailed plans will be announced in due course.</p>
