	<p pid="a.63.1/2" qnum="HL4179">Further to the Written Answer by Lord Rooker on 22 January (WA 195), whether they still expect the design and development of the central register of persons who have applied for or have been granted a shotgun or firearm certificate on the Police National Computer, as required by Section 39 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997, which came into force on 1 October 1997, to be completed by the end of May 2002 and for all work to be completed in November 2002; and, if not, whether they will set a new timetable for the implementation of this legislative requirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">I understand from the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) that development of the central register has been re-scheduled to take into account the work which was needed to implement the DNA database and other external factors. The transition from development to pilot operation will now start in September. The pilot operation will run from November to February 2003, with roll-out to all forces completing in May 2003. PITO continues to plan the delivery of a number of new applications on the Police National Computer in parallel to make the most effective use of skilled and technical resources. But it is possible that other work needed in relation to other urgent PNC projects on persistent offenders and on sex and violent offenders could have a further impact on these re-planned dates. The full impact cannot yet be assessed but could lead to a further delay of two to four months. maria</p>

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">Draft regulations have been laid in both Houses, together with a regulatory impact assessment and an analysis of the responses made to the draft regulations circulated in July 2001. The Government's objective has been to strike a fair balance between the owners of common land and those who have for many years driven across the land to get to their homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/2">The major change in the regulations is in relation to the compensation payable. This reflects the Government's view that the compensation payable in respect of older premises, already in existence when it became an offence to drive on common land, should be a relatively small amount. Owners of premises in existence on or above <phrase class="date" code="1905-12-31">31 December 1905</phrase> will pay 0.25 per cent of the value of the premises. Owners of those built between <phrase class="date" code="1906-01-01">1 January 1906</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1930-11-30">30 November 1930</phrase> will pay 0.5 per cent. Compensation in respect of all other premises remains at 2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/3">We hope that the regulations will be considered by both Houses before the Summer Recess and will then come into force as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">There is no evidence that the provision of contraception encourages sexual activity. Emergency contraception is a safe and effective method of preventing unplanned pregnancy and is considered to have the same safety profile for under 16s as for older women. As there is evidence that the method is most effective when the first dose is taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex, early uptake is vital. The provision of emergency contraception through National Health Service funded pharmacy schemes, including pharmacies within supermarket chains, is one of the ways in which local areas are seeking to improve access.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">Pharmacists providing emergency contraception to under-16s do so under the established legal framework for all health professionals. This involves assessing the young person's competence to understand the choices they are making and encouraging them to talk to their parents. Pharmacists are trained to ensure that young women are informed about and encouraged to visit local services that provide regular forms of contraception and condoms to protect against sexually transmitted infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/3">The Government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy recognises the importance of helping young people resist peer pressure to have early sex, while seeking to ensure that those who are sexually active have easy access to high quality contraceptive advice, including emergency contraception. Under-16s are at particular risk of unprotected sex. Although over a quarter are sexually active, they are less likely than older teenagers to access services and use contraception.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.5/1">Emergency hormonal contraception is a safe and effective method of preventing pregnancy when a woman has had unprotected sex or when she knows something has gone wrong with her usual method. Regular methods of contraception such as the pill or condoms should be the first choice to protect against unwanted pregnancy, but in emergency situations women should be able to access this product quickly and easily. Evidence from a World Health Organisation trial demonstrated that emergency contraceptive pills prevented 86 per cent of expected pregnancies when treatment was initiated within 72 hours of unprotected sex. However this rose to 95 per cent when the first dose was taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex. We therefore want to ensure the best possible access to emergency contraception for those that need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/2">Increased availability of emergency contraception should be seen in the context of a much wider programme of work we are undertaking to reduce the high number of unwanted pregnancies in this country through the Sexual Health and HIV Strategy and the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. This includes improving access to contraceptive services and the range of contraceptive products that are available.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">The Government's decision that the frequency of on-line draws for society lotteries should be restricted to one a day in any particular premises reflected the conclusions of the Gambling Review Body that without such a limit there would be opportunities for uncontrolled and excessive play carrying risks encouraging problem gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">The available research evidence is as set out in Chapter 17 of the review body's report. It is not specific to lotteries but relates generally to frequency of play and opportunities for re-staking.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/3">Excessive gambling is not necessarily simply a question of the money which the gambler spends or even of the relationship of such expenditure to the gambler's income. It is a matter also of the gamblers' ability to control his or her gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/4">Four submissions last autumn to the Government about the report of the Gambling Review Body expressed concern about frequent draw lotteries. The review body was independent of government. The sources of evidence given to it were listed in its report. The Home Office did not give evidence about lotteries or other subjects. The only information about the results of society lotteries with frequent draws which was available to the Home Office was supplied by Interlotto. This information related to ticket sales and not to the extent of play by individual participants. It was open to Interlotto to provide this, or such other material as it wished, to the review body in response to the review body's general invitation to submit evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/5">We have made no estimate of the potential loss to charities from controlling the frequency of online lottery draws and do not think that this would serve a useful purpose. The Government have made clear in A safe bet for success that we are committed to the success of the charity lottery sector and we shall be introducing legislation very shortly to increase their maximum ticket sales, prizes and ticket prices.</p>
