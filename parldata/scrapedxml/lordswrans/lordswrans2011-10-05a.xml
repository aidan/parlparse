	<p pid="a.210.5/1">The First Night service offered by PACT is duplicated to a large degree by information-gathering by the prison for input into the P-Nomis system at the point of reception. As a result of the need to ensure cost efficiency it was decided to review how the First Night service was provided at Holloway. PACT was the only bidder when the service was re-tendered; however, it did not represent value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.5/2">It was decided to provide the service in-house, which offers significant cost benefits, and discontinue the service provided by PACT. A three-month notice period was entered into, which finishes on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-31">31 October 2011</phrase>. From then, a variation of the First Night Service will be provided utilising existing operational staff resources at no additional cost. Holloway will be giving prisoners extra phone credit when arriving as a new reception, which will be at a minimal additional cost to the prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.5/3">Given the PACT bid did not represent value for money the Prison Reform Trust report did not form part of the considerations during this process.</p>
