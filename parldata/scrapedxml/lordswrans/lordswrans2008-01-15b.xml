	<p pid="b.244.0/1">The Home Office publishes a quarterly snapshot of people detained solely under Immigration Act powers on the last Saturday of each quarter, broken down by gender and people recorded as being under 18 at the time of the snapshot. The latest published information pertains to persons detained as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-29">29 September 2007</phrase> and is published in the quarterly web-based asylum statistics bulletin and in the annual statistical bulletin <I>Asylum Statistics United Kingdom</I>. These statistics exclude persons detained in prison establishments, police cells and those detained under both criminal and immigration powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/2">Children are detained in only two limited circumstances: first, as part of a family group whose detention is considered appropriate; secondly, when unaccompanied, while alternative care arrangements are made and normally only overnight. While the detention of families with children is very regrettable, it nevertheless remains necessary in appropriate cases in order to maintain an effective immigration control and to tackle abuses of the asylum system.</p>

	<p pid="b.245.0/1">As the then Home Secretary set out in his evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May 2006</phrase>, following the dismantling of routine embarkation controls beginning in 1994, no Government have been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally, and that remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.0/2">A clear goal has been set to reintroduce systems to count everyone in and out of United Kingdom (UK). The e-Borders programme, scheduled to commence in 2008, will strengthen and modernise our border control including providing an electronic record of all those entering and leaving the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.0/3">In the mean time, targeted embarkation controls continue to take place at major ports to identify failed asylum seekers and other immigration offenders who are leaving the UK, and the Border and Immigration Agency is reviewing its capacity to extend these.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.0/4">The total number of individuals arrested on enforcement visits between December 2006 and November 2007 is 10,662. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how many of those arrested overstayed their temporary residence, without looking at their case files. However, a proportion of these individuals will have overstayed their leave. The monthly breakdown of this figure is attached at Annexe A. These data are based on management information and are not a national statistic. They should be treated as provisional as they are subject to change.</p>

	<p pid="b.246.2/1">Ticket barriers are not being installed at railway stations for security reasons. Train operating companies are required to protect revenue under their contracts with the Department for Transport. This may include the installation of ticket barriers at stations.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.2/2">For security measures, the department aims for proportionate and effective measures at railway stations which still allow people to go about their day to day business. Security regimes for the railways have been developed in consultation with operators in full recognition of the open nature of systems; consequently they seek to be commensurate with the terrorist threat, effective, practicable and sustainable.</p>
