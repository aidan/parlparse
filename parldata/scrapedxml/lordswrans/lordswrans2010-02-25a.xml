	<p pid="a.315.5/1">It is not known how many fraudulently obtained passports there are in circulation. Passport fraud by its very nature is difficult to establish and measure. A UK passport has a validity of 10 years, and the level of fraud is unlikely to have remained the same over the 10 years. It would therefore be speculative and misleading to make an estimate on this basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.316.2/1">The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) closed its musical instruments gallery on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-22">22 February</phrase>, as part of the museum's ongoing refurbishment plans. The V&amp;A will instead display some of its musical instruments in context of its other collections within the museum. Objects from the collection will be displayed in the British galleries, the medieval and renaissance galleries, the furniture gallery (due to open in 2012) and the Europe 1600-1800 galleries (due to open in 2014).</p>
	<p pid="a.316.2/2">The museum has also agreed to the long-term loan of key objects from the V&amp;A's collection of musical instruments to the Horniman Museum in London, which has a nationally designated collection of musical instruments. The V&amp;A is also in discussions with several other institutions with significant musical collections, and expects to be making further loans.</p>
