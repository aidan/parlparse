	<p pid="a.43.2/1">We condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief and take every opportunity to urge states to implement laws and practices which foster tolerance and mutual respect. The Afghan Constitution (Article 2) provides for freedom of religion. Afghanistan is also a signatory to the six principal international human rights treaties including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedom of religion. We expect Afghanistan to live up to those obligations and believe individuals should be able to practise their faith or beliefs free from persecution and prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.6/1">The Paveway IV weapon system is currently expected to be available for operational deployment, to meet its initial operating capability (IOC), by the end of 2008. This compares with an original IOC date of December 2007. The Paveway IV IOC is defined as the integration of the weapon on a single platform, the provision of a defined number of weapon stocks, support arrangements, and trained ground and air crew. I am withholding details of the number of Paveway IV weapons that will be available at IOC. Its release would, or would be likely to, prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.6/2">There was no cost impact associated with the delay of the Paveway IV fuse as payment was linked to the delivery programme for operational weapons, the start of which was dependent upon the successful outcome of the operational evaluation (OPEVAL) trials. The MoD refused to accept delivery of, and therefore deferred payment for, the Paveway IV weapon system even though some elements had successfully completed the OPEVAL trials. This was done to generate the appropriate industrial incentive and ensure that the fuse reliability issues were rigorously addressed by the contractor.</p>

Training for support workers is therefore the responsibility of their employer rather than Jobcentre Plus. Access to Work advisers work with the customer, and where appropriate external assessors, to identify the exact requirements for support, including the level of expertise or knowledge that the support worker should have. The funding agreed for each individual reflects this and Access to Work encourages individuals to procure support from suitably qualified people.</p>

Reward arrangements for the SCS are managed centrally by the Cabinet Office and are based on recommendations to the Government made by the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB).

The Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, Universities UK and others have also lobbied against the decision.

	<p pid="a.47.3/1">Addressing pensioner poverty has been one of the Government's key priorities since 1997 and we are aware of the recent campaign by the Royal British Legion.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/2">The number of pensioners in poverty in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million in 1998-99 to 2.1 million in 2006-07 (as measured by 60 per cent of contemporary median income after housing costs). Once housing costs are accounted for, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/3">The Government have introduced a number of measures to reduce the levels of poverty in older people. Pension credit ensures that no one needs live on less than &pound;124.05 (&pound;189.35 for a couple) per week. We have successively raised the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit at least in line with earnings every year since its introduction. Our commitments in the Pensions Act 2007 to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee at least in line with earnings over the long term, and to reintroduce the earnings link to basic state pension from 2012, or by the end of the next Parliament, will help secure these gains into the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September</phrase>, the Government announced a new &pound;1 billion package of measures for people permanently to cut their energy bills. As part of this package, 11 million lower income and pensioner households are eligible for free loft insulation, cavity wall insulation and other energy efficiency devices. The Government already make winter fuel payments which provide a significant contribution towards winter fuel bills for those aged 60 or over. Additional payments to be made for winter 2008-09 mean that this year households with someone aged 60 to 79 or over 80 will receive up to &pound;250 and &pound;400 respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/2" qnum="HL5412">What are their total net receipts from the multiple sales of shares in QinetiQ; how much was injected into the pension fund prior to privatisation; what was the value of the land bank included in the company's assets; and what restrictions there are on the company breaking itself up.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-10-14a.48.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100844" speakername="Baroness Taylor of Bolton" colon=":" colnum="48"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81014w0001.htm#81014w0001.htm_spmin18">
	<p pid="a.48.2/1">When QinetiQ was formed in July 2001, the company paid the Government for its assets with a combination of shares and debt obligations in the form of loan notes. The proceeds raised from the privatisation are therefore the total from the sale of the shares and the repayment of these debts. Including the sale of shares when the company was floated on the stock market in February 2006 the net proceeds raised (after deduction of all costs including the pension indemnity) were &pound;576 million. A full breakdown of these proceeds including the split between share sales and debt repayments is contained in the National Audit Office report, the <I>Privatisation of QinetiQ</I>, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/2">In addition, the Government sold their remaining 19 per cent stake in QinetiQ on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-09">9 September 2008</phrase>. Net of costs this raised a further &pound;254 million. The total net proceeds to the taxpayer from all stages of the privatisations are &pound;830 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/3">When a minority stake in QinetiQ was sold to Carlyle in 2003, actuaries identified that there was a deficit of up to &pound;75 million in the QinetiQ pension fund and Carlyle sought to have the value of the business reduced by this amount. After negotiations, the Government agreed to reduce the value of QinetiQ by &pound;25 million and to provide QinetiQ with an indemnity capped at &pound;45 million. The indemnity was payable if the deficit remained at the time of any subsequent flotation or sale of the business. As stated in the NAO's report, this arrangement gave the Government an opportunity to benefit if the value of the assets in QinetiQ's pension fund increased. However, by the time of flotation the deficit had increased and the full &pound;45 million was paid into the pension fund. As a shareholder, the Government benefited from the resulting increase in the value of the company. In addition, the NAO calculated that by delaying the payment for three years its cost to the Government in real terms was reduced by &pound;11 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/4">When QinetiQ was formed in 2001, its assets included &pound;342 million of land and buildings which were used to support its continuing business. Given the specialist nature and location of many of these assets, this valuation was assessed in QinetiQ's accounts as being around &pound;113.8 million greater than the open market value of the assets if they were sold for other purposes. In addition, QinetiQ held surplus property, which was scheduled for disposal, which it had acquired from the Government at an open market value of &pound;98.3 million. Sixty million pounds from the sale of these properties was subsequently paid directly to the Government as part of the company's debt repayments. As shareholder, the Government also benefited from the proceeds raised from further property sales. At the time of QinetiQ's creation, clawback arrangements were put in place to ensure that the taxpayer benefited from the value of any property sales above a specified threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/5">Although QinetiQ can dispose of parts of its business, there are protections in place to prevent transactions that could be contrary to UK defence and security interests. This is in addition to the national security protections under the Enterprise Act.</p>
