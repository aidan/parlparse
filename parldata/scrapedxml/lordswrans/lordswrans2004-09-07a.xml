In Northern Ireland, primary schools in the grant-maintained integrated sector are funded directly by the Department of Education.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.0/2">The UK is funding Action Aid (&pound;157,680) to help increase both knowledge and awareness of the rights of women and women's participation in local governance in Afghanistan. Community-level women's groups are being established and small grants made available to help build the resources and confidence of women to work together to seek solutions to common problems. These activities are being supplemented and supported by training and information sharing at the provincial level and a nationwide research project looking at the role of women in local governance in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">DfID also funds government-led national development programmes, which are being facilitated by a range of local non-governmental organisations. An example is the National Solidarity Programme (DfID contribution was &pound;13 million over three years), which is building the capacity of hundreds of village development councils across Afghanistan and providing the resources they need to identify and address their own development priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.3/1">Under UNSCR 1483, the occupying powers shared joint responsibility for the actions of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), including management of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). Within the CPA, the DFI account was managed by the Comptroller's Office. Following approval the Comptroller's Office handled payments from the DFI and made disbursements on the basis of directions from the authorised DFI signatories (Administrator, Administrator's Deputy and Comptroller).

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">Improving adults' access to training, whether to develop their existing career or to move into an entirely new area, is one of the aims of the skills strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2">Our skills strategy set out further opportunities and reforms to enable individuals to retrain. It committed us to develop apprenticeships for adults to meet skills needs in response to employer demand. We and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) are working with sector skills councils (SSCs) that are either already licensed or expected to be so in the near future, to trial appropriate provision in a small number of sectors in England starting later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/3">SSCs are influential employer bodies, licensed by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, in consultation with Ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to tackle the skills and productivity needs of their sector throughout the UK. There are SSCs covering both plumbing (SummitSkills) and carpentry (ConstructionSkills).</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/4">SummitSkills aims to support employers and employees to achieve appropriate recognition of their plumbing skills. Mature apprenticeships will be introduced in some parts of the UK during 2004. The local plumbing training centre will be able to advise on the provision in each area. For Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland there are differences in provision and the local centre will provide specific guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/5">ConstructionSkills has identified addressing the issue of retraining adults as a priority but the work is still at a very early stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/6">The Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) programme was announced in 2001. These centres, which are based within colleges and other training providers, receive extra funding to enable them to develop high quality skills training to meet employers' current and future skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/7">There are now 260 centres offering adult learners a wide and diverse range of skills training for careers in many industries including construction (including plumbing and carpentry skills), which is currently served by 40 centres (15 per cent of the network). More centres will follow as the LSC is committed to creating a network of 400 centres by March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/8">From 2006, when the full network is in place, it will provide 40,000 qualifications and awards each year at levels 2 and 3, and 800 foundation degrees. It will have increased levels of employer engagement, with 20,000 employees benefiting from tailored provision paid for by their employers.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.5/1">These instruments cover broadly similar areas but they are worded differently and the covenant appears in some respects to have wider scope. For example, Article 26 of the covenant appears to have a significantly broader compass than Article 14 of the convention (which is confined to discrimination in relation to the convention rights). Interpretation of the scope and application of the rights contained in the convention is a matter for the European Court of Human Rights. The covenant comes under a Human Rights Committee appointed by the General Assembly of the United Nations.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.3/1">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) bases age assessments on physical appearance and available documentation. IND will always accept a full social services age assessment that also takes into account wider cultural and social factors. IND does not medically assess applicants to determine age, although it would consider a medical assessment prepared independently for an applicant by a consultant paediatrician.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/2">IND follows the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidance in its 1999 publication, The Health of Refugee Children&mdash;Guidelines for Paediatricians. The royal college has advised that medical age assessment is an &quot;inexact science&quot; and subject to a margin of error of as much as +/- five years. It exercises caution about using medical opinion in this complex area particularly if it is not supported by other wider ranging and more complete evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/3">and will consult with the relevant stakeholders if any changes are required.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/4">Cambridgeshire Social Services is bound by the provisions of the Children Act 1989. Its age assessments are conducted in accordance with published statutory guidance for the assessments of children in need known as the &quot;integrated children's system&quot;, which sets out the factors that should be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.3/5">Cambridgeshire Social Services usually aims to provide an age assessment within seven working days of receipt of a request from a legal representative. IND does not hold data on the length of time taken by social services departments to produce age assessments.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/1">The Government recognise the limited control they have over factors that may lead to an increase in the number of people applying for asylum in the United Kingdom. Concerted effort is required on a number of fronts. The work that the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) do to reduce poverty, human rights abuse and conflict in poor or badly governed countries helps to remove the conditions which produce asylum-seeking. The Government have also put in place a range of measures designed to tackle abuse of the system which have already contributed to a reduction of more than 50 per cent in the number of new applications when compared to the peak of October 2002. The Government will continue to seek further reductions in asylum intake through relentless implementation of such measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/2">The range of measures includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/3" class="indent">Juxtaposed Controls&mdash;the establishment of frontier control zones in key locations overseas to enable UK immigration officers to consider and decide the admissibility of passengers prior to embarkation to the UK. Such controls currently operate at Coquelles, Calais, Dunkirk, Boulogne, Eurostar stations in France and Eurostar stations in Belgium for direct services to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/4" class="indent">Deployment of new detection technology at key continental ports for the effective searching of vehicles before embarking on ships to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/5" class="indent">An informed visa strategy (including direct airside transit visas) designed to establish qualification for entry before arrival, and which is kept under regular review with requirements, imposed or lifted in response to immigration pressures and wider considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/6" class="indent">The expansion of the airline liaison officers network abroad offering advice and training to the airlines to control the number of inadequately documented arrivals by air.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/7" class="indent">Alongside this, a number of key initiatives are designed to reduce the attractiveness of the UK as an asylum-seeking destination including the non-suspensive appeals provision (NSA); the Harmondsworth fast track pilot; restricted access to NASS support (RANS).</p>
	<p pid="a.130.2/8">In addition measures in the Asylum &amp; Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Bill will ensure that asylum seekers do not benefit by destroying their documents to prevent removal and will help to make the appeals system faster.</p>

We will ensure that there are sufficient prison places for that group.

	<p pid="a.132.5/1">The first refugees to be resettled in Britain under the Gateway Protection Programme arrived from Africa in March 2004. So far a total of 69 have arrived and settled in Sheffield. Further groups will be received and located in a number of towns and cities in the course of the coming months, but it is not yet possible to give the precise numbers involved. Earlier delays to the programme arose as a result of administrative problems both in Britain and in Africa; these have now been settled for the most part. The Government remain committed to the Gateway Programme.</p>

Around 2 per cent chose to enlist in the Afghan national army (ANA) or police force as their reintegration option. A further 10 per cent will assist with de-mining. The overwhelming majority of demobilised personnel have elected to enter civilian society through vocational training, small business training or agriculture. The ANA has now expanded to four battalions consisting of around 12,000 personnel in total. ANA units regularly operate effectively alongside coalition forces on arms collection and counter-insurgency missions throughout Afghanistan.</p>

We continually review our own, and partners', efforts in this area, but we believe that a long-term plan already exists and is being implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.11/2">In the short term, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the US-led coalition are assisting the Afghan authorities to build a secure environment. NATO is currently implementing plans for expanding ISAF.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.11/3">In the longer term, sustainable improvement in security can only come through developing the capabilities of Afghanistan's own security and law enforcement institutions. The international community has made a long-term commitment to Security Sector Reform (SSR). The UK has been very active in this. We have committed &pound;70 million over three years from 2003&ndash;04 to assist the Afghan authorities in their efforts to combat the production and trafficking of illegal narcotics. The UK is also active in police reconstruction; reform of the Afghan National Army; the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process; and the justice sector. As the paper points out, provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) provide both short and long-term support, helping the Afghan authorities create a more secure and stable environment and thereby facilitating SSR. We fully support the PRT &quot;stabilisation&quot; model promoted in the paper, and the UK PRTs in northern Afghanistan have demonstrated what it can achieve.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.5/1">Patients are referred for overseas treatment by their acute trust with the agreement of the commissioning primary care trust or directly by their primary care trust. Acute trusts and primary care trusts use the services of the National Health Service overseas commissioning team at Guys and St Thomas' NHS Trust which sources suitable overseas providers, and procures treatment in Europe for the NHS. The overseas commissioning team also holds the contracts for treatment overseas on behalf of the NHS. The number of patients referred overseas directly by their primary care trusts has not been recorded by central monitoring. In total, however, 879 patients have been referred overseas for treatment since January 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">The report by the School of Dental Sciences at Newcastle University concludes that &quot;There was no statistically significant difference [in absorption of fluoride] between artificially and naturally fluoridated water, or between soft and hard water&quot;. For the subjects in the study, there were small differences in indices of bioavailability between the trials of the various types of water, but the results were compatible with the conclusion that the source of fluoride and the hardness of the water had no important influence on the bioavailability of fluoride. This conclusion agrees with the findings of the earlier study quoted in the report, <i>Chemistry and bioavailability aspects of fluoride in drinking water</i>, which concluded &quot;In terms of chemistry and bioavailability there is absolutely no difference between added and natural fluoride&quot;. Much of the evidence bearing on the safety of fluoridation of drinking water consists of epidemiological studies in populations exposed to fluoride occurring naturally in water supplies. The Newcastle study adds further confirmation that there is no evidence that the epidemiological findings relating to natural fluoride are inapplicable to artificial fluoridation.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">Studies in England have found no relationship between fluoride naturally present in drinking-water and any of the non-dental health outcomes considered, including mortality from all causes, tuberculosis, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, peptic ulcer, nephritis, nephrosis, congenital malformations, mortality from accidents/poisonings/violence, stillbirths, infant mortality, osteochondritis juvenalis of the spine, goitre, excessive accumulation of fluoride in bone, and hip fracture.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">We commissioned the bioavailability project as part of the programme of research with which we are strengthening the evidence base on fluoridation in accordance with the recommendations of the systematic review of fluoridation undertaken by the University of York.</p>

A draft of <i>Bioavailability of fluoride in drinking water&mdash;a human experimental study</i> was submitted for peer review to five eminent academic experts in this field at universities in Sweden, the United States and the United Kingdom. The comments of the reviewers were then passed to the researchers at the School of Dental Sciences at Newcastle University to help with their preparation of the final report. In addition, Professor Andy Renwick of the University of Southampton provided advice on the project and on the draft report as an independent member of the department's steering group.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.9/1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is the independent organisation responsible for providing national guidance on treatments and care for those using the National Health Service in England and Wales. The institute takes account of the best available evidence and consults widely when formulating its advice to the NHS. The consultees may include guidance producing bodies, such as the Royal Colleges. The Royal College of Physicians has produced clinical guidelines on the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and NICE will take these into account when formulating its guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.2/1">The Food Standards Agency advises that there is no evidence of a general decrease in acrylamide levels in food since the discovery of unexpected levels in April 2002. Some food processors have however identified ways of achieving reductions which are specific to their processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">There is at present insufficient scientific information on reliable methods of consistently reducing acrylamide while maintaining the safety and nutritional quality of food. A considerable body of research is in progress on this issue. The FSA is directly funding a number of research projects which will be reported over the next year. The agency is also taking a central role in the co-ordination of European and international efforts to develop an understanding of acrylamide in food. These activities will provide information for the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives evaluation of acrylamide in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.2/20">1 In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in these years is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in subsequent years.</p>
