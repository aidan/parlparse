	<p pid="a.32.6/2">Contraception is free for everyone on the National Health Service and is supplied by general practitioners and family planning clinics. There are a number of different contraceptive methods, with a method to suit everyone's individual needs. Methods available include long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) the contraceptive implant, which can provide effective contraception for three years, and the intrauterine system, which provides effective contraception for up to five years. Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, any woman having an abortion funded by the NHS must be given advice about, and supplies of, contraception before they leave the clinic, as set out in the national specification for abortion services.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/3">Access to reliable contraceptive methods should be readily available to reduce teenage conception, abortion and repeat abortion rates, particularly in areas where teenage pregnancy rates are high. Reducing unintended conceptions is an important issue and we shall be considering further how best to tackle it.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.5/1">No assessment has been made of the impact of the VAT rise on individuals earning under &#163;6,475. As individuals within households can pool their incomes together, any analysis at individual level can be misleading. Analysis published in the June Budget shows the impact of indirect tax measures to be in place in 2012-13 compared with those in place today across the household income distribution. This shows that households in the bottom income decile will face an increase in indirect tax of around &#163;190 per year on average (an increase of around 1.5 per cent of household net income).</p>
