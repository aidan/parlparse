	<p pid="a.71.2/15">Expenditure relating to official service residences is kept under close scrutiny. When it is practical to do so, we utilise staff from other residences in support of a function to maximise use of resources. Furthermore, civilian staff will be retained rather than a member of the Armed Forces, but dependent on the occupant and location of the residence, it may be in the interests of security to use service personnel.</p>

LACORS is now aware of approximately 46 applications to add or amend authorisations for live music, of which three were refused.

	<p pid="a.73.3/4">LACORS' request for information was not intended to discover the details of each minor variations application, but to establish whether or not the new process is being used successfully to vary premises licences and club premises certificates (including the addition or amendment of authorisation for live music).</p>

	<p pid="a.74.3/2">Community payback describes the work done by offenders to make reparation for their crimes. The work must benefit the community, and offenders sentenced to community payback undertake tasks such as picking litter and clearing graffiti. During recent weeks, there have been numerous examples of community payback being used at short notice to assist local authorities to clear snow from pavements. All members of the public have the opportunity to nominate projects to be completed by offenders undertaking community payback. Last year, over 62,000 offenders successfully completed community payback sentences and over 8.4 million hours were worked.</p>
