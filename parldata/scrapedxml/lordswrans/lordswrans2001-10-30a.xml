	<p pid="a.151.2/1">In light of evidence that some asylum applicants are falsely posing as nationals from countries with high grant rates of asylum or exceptional leave, we have decided to undertake a language analysis pilot at the start of November 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/2">The purpose of language analysis is to provide expert evidence which helps to identify the place of origin of asylum seekers. Language analysis is used in a number of European countries and the results are generally successful. We will be piloting the scheme to see how well language analysis works in the United Kingdom, and for the purposes of the pilot we will be covering asylum seekers of three nationalities where we believe the problem of false nationality claims to be most pronounced. Those nationalities are Afghanistan, Somalia and Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/3">The authorisation I made will enable staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, where there are objective reasons for doubting the nationality of a person claiming to be from one of these three countries, to request them to undertake a further interview which will be taped and sent to a language expert for analysis. Individuals may refuse to consent to this further interview but this refusal can be taken into account when determining whether the applicant has established the facts of their case. This may lead to their claim being refused.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/4">We will review the need for this authorisation once the pilot has been completed. In addition, the race monitor to be appointed under Section 19E of the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) will report to Parliament via the Secretary of State on the likely effect of authorisations made by Ministers and on how they are operated in practice by officials.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.5/1">Priorities for developing the GB rail network, including railway re-openings, are for the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), and will be set out in the SRA's Strategic Plan, which will be published in November. The SRA works closely with the Scottish Executive on proposals for investment in Scotland's railway, with Railtrack, and with other stakeholders involved in individual schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/2">The Railways Sponsorship Division of the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions is responsible for paying grant to the SRA to enable the SRA to carry out its statutory functions. The SRA can provide funds for railway re-openings, and the Scottish Executive also has powers to fund schemes in Scotland directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.5/3">As network controller, Railtrack is a key stakeholder in all infrastructure projects. The Government have made a funding agreement with Railtrack plc's administrator to ensure that Railtrack's network responsibilities continue to be fulfilled during administration. The administrator is working to prioritise those projects already programmed by Railtrack. The Government have stated their intention of putting a proposal to the administrator for a company limited by guarantee (CLG) to take over Railtrack's railway assets and its role as network operator. This successor company would continue to be responsible for smaller-scale enhancements, possibly including re-openings. Major enhancements may be taken forward and financed by project companies called special purpose vehicles, and would not then have to rely for their funding on the CLG. This approach should help ensure better use of resources, with projects delivered on time and within budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.1/2" qnum="HL823">Whether, with particular reference to Longannet Power Station, it is a perverse incentive that a railway re-opening project which reduces freight train mileage is seen as unattractive because the new shorter route would earn less in track access charges than the existing longer route; and whether this situation will change for Railtrack's successor.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/1">There is no such perverse incentive. The reduction in variable track access charges which Railtrack would receive as a result of freight operators being diverted to a shorter route are offset by a reduction in their variable costs. Fixed costs of the existing network (maintenance and renewal) are allocated to franchised passenger operators and will not be affected by freight operators using the new route. In addition, the freeing up of capacity on the existing route will enable Railtrack to offer new paths for passenger trains and earn an additional return from them.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.0/1">Past research estimated that the benefits obtained from the full EEVC proposals would be in the range of an 8 per cent reduction in pedestrian fatalities and a 21 per cent reduction in pedestrian serious injuries. Other studies suggest a wider range of possible benefits. However, we would expect the full benefits to be achieved only after the majority of cars on the road meet the requirements--some 10 to 15 years after implementation. In the early years following implementation the overall casualty reductions would be significantly lower.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.2/2">The net cost of disposing of abandoned vehicles is estimated to be between &pound;30 and &pound;50 per vehicle. The total annual net cost of their disposal would therefore be in the range of &pound;10 million to &pound;17 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.2/3">More up to date information on the number of abandoned vehicles removed by local authorities is being collected in the department's 2000-01 Municipal Waste Management Survey which should be published in July 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.8/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Environment is grateful for the opportunity to clarify the Answers he gave on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-11">Tuesday 11 July 2000</phrase> (H.C. Deb., <phrase class="date" code="">11 July</phrase>, cols. 496-7W) and <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-26">Monday 26 March 2001</phrase> (H.C. Deb., <phrase class="date" code="">26 July</phrase>, col. 565W). Until August 2000, the Edmonton incinerator mixed bottom ash and precipitator ash. From August 1998 to May 1999, this mixed ash was reprocessed and used in the production of concrete building blocks. This ash has also been used as an aggregate.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.8/2">As the reply to the first of these two questions said, neither the Department nor the Environment Agency routinely held information on the dioxin content of ash from incinerators. However, in July 1998 the Environment Agency was given an estimate of the dioxin content of the mixed ash, based on a 1997 analysis of the fly ash. My right honourable friend was not advised about this when he replied to the second of these Questions and regrets any consequent inaccuracy in his answer. He has written to both MPs and has placed a copy of the letter and the analysis in the fax in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.8/3">The Environment Agency is currently carrying out a full and thorough investigation into the destination of ash from incinerators, the environmental implications of its use and what steps may be needed in the light of these findings. This thorough investigation will establish the true picture for all municipal waste incinerators, its results will be made public and any necessary action will be taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.5/1">Universal Banking Services consists of two elements: access through post offices to basic bank accounts provided by financial institutions; and, for those who are unable or unwilling to use even a basic bank account, a Post Office card account (POCA) for the encashment of benefit and tax credits. For the basic bank accounts, the costs will be met by the banking industry. For the POCA, it would not be appropriate to disclose current estimates of the cost as this is subject to commercial negotiations between Consignia and the Paying Departments, and between Consignia and the potential supplier of the banking engine for POCA.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.5/1">The Social Exclusion Unit was set up to help improve government action to reduce social exclusion by producing &quot;joined-up solutions to joined-up problems&quot;. The unit has published reports on five key areas: truancy and school exclusions; rough sleeping; neighbourhood renewal; teenage pregnancy; and bridging the gap: 16 to 18 year-olds not in education, training or employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/2">The unit was reviewed in the summer of 1999. The review said that, while it was then too early to judge the impact on the ground of the unit's reports, external feedback and the group carrying out the review produced a broad measure of agreement that the unit had been a success so far and was well conceived. The quality of the unit's reports and analysis was widely praised; its recommendations were accepted as sound and were being implemented, and the unit was having a broader impact on raising the profile of social exclusion and pioneering new ways of working.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.5/3">The Prime Minister announced the results of this review in December 1999 and decided the unit would continue in existence. Since then the unit has worked closely with other government departments or cross-cutting units that implement its reports. The strategies in the reports are for the long-term but there is already strong evidence of real change. For example, numbers of people sleeping rough in England have fallen by 62 per cent since 1998; conception rates for under-16s in England fell by 7 per cent in 1999 compared with the previous year, and by 4 per cent for under-18s; the number of teenage parents out of education, training or work came down from 84 per cent in 1997 to 69 per cent in 2000; and numbers of pupils permanently excluded from school were down by a third in 1999-2000 compared to 1996-97.</p>
