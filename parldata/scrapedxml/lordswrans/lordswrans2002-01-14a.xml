	<p pid="a.129.0/1">Following the Italian Government's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-11">11 December</phrase> that they could accept the text of the European arrest warrant which emerged from the JHA Council on 6&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-12-07">7 December</phrase>, COREPER II (Ambassadors) on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-12">12 December</phrase> noted provisional agreement on the text of the European arrest warrant framework decision contained in document 14867/1/01 COPEN 79 REV 1, subject to the requirement to reconsult the European Parliament and national parliamentary scrutiny reservations from five member states, including the United Kingdom. The Laeken European Council on 14&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-12-15">15 December</phrase> welcomed this development in paragraphs 17 and 45 of its conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/2">The Government do not consider that this constitutes an override of the Parliamentary Scrutiny Reserve Resolution. Lord Brabazon's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-13">13 December</phrase> to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, Bob Ainsworth, following his appearance before the House of Lord Select Committee on the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-12">12 December</phrase>, appears to support this view. The letter states that, &quot;the Decision remains subject to a number of parliamentary scrutiny reserves, including our own. This does not in our view preclude heads of Government at Laeken drawing attention to the substantial progress which has been made on the text and emphasising the importance of the European arrest warrant. As has been said it will be a 'cornerstone' of judicial co-operation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/3">The text of the European arrest warrant framework decision was not formally submitted to the Laeken European Council, as the annex to the Laeken conclusions makes clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/4">The Government understand that the new opinion of the European Parliament may not now be available before February. The Council will need to consider this opinion before it can adopt the framework decision on the European arrest warrant.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/5">Article 34(2)(b) of the Treaty on European Union provides that framework decisions shall be binding upon the member states as to the result to be achieved but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of the form and methods and that they shall not entail direct effect. Implementing domestic legislation will therefore be required which will need to respect the framework established by the framework decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/6">The Government intend to implement the framework decision in its entirety in order to comply with their treaty obligations. This will form part of the Government's wider reform of extradition law and procedures in a Bill to be presented to Parliament shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/7">While the framework decision establishes binding rules in many areas, in some areas it leaves it open to member states to decide whether or not to apply a provision or to take a particular course of action. For example, under Article 2(4) member states may decide whether or not to apply the dual criminality test for offences not covered under Article 2(2). Other parts of the framework decision are designed to be implemented in accordance with national law. For example, Article 13 provides that all decisions relating to the detention of an indvidual should be made &quot;in accordance with the law of the executing Member State&quot;. It would be open to national legislatures to amend domestic implementing legislation within the confines of this discretion afforded by the Framework Decision without the member states being in breach of its obligations under the treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/1">I have no reason to believe that co-operation between the forces concerned is other than excellent, although clearly the police are not able to guarantee that there will be no delays to traffic at an event as popular as the British Grand Prix. The smooth flow of traffic at the Silverstone site should however be assisted by the improvements to access, circulation and parking arrangements announced last month by the promoters of this year's event, Octagon Motorsports Ltd. We understand that &pound;10.6 million will be committed to the completion of such improvements before the Grand Prix on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-07">7 July</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.141.0/1">If a non-British subject presents for registration at a general practitioner the following occurs. If they state they are to be in the country for less than three months, the GP completes a temporary services (GMS3) form. If they state they are to be resident in the country for over three months, the patient is registered with the GP using the GMS1 form. These forms are submitted by the GP to the local health authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/2">Only patients that generate a GMS1 form are issued with an NHS number by the NHS Central Register. The NHSCR always checks to see if the patient has already been previously issued with an NHS number.</p>
