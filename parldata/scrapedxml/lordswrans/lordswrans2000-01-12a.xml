	<p pid="a.117.2/1">Respect for human rights in Zimbabwe has improved since the low point of the Matabeleland atrocities in the 1980s. Zimbabwe has an active civil society and independent press (albeit harassed at times). However, there have been some serious lapses in the last two years which have coincided with the decline in the economic situation. The arrest and torture of the two Standard journalists in January shocked Zimbabweans as well as the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/2">Freedom of assembly is enshrined in the Constitution. The government has previously used emergency powers to ban strike action, although a Parliamentary Legal Committee subsequently declared the ban to be unconstitutional.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/3">Zimbabwe is a party to all the international human rights conventions except the Convention against Torture. Torture, mainly beatings, is regularly used by the police (understaffed and lacking in training) to secure criminal convictions. There is an independent judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/4">Where there is evidence of human rights abuses, we raise our concerns with the Zimbabwe authorities. In addition, we actively promote freedom of expression by training journalists in the UK. Earlier this year we held a conference on media freedom in Harare. We support a number of NGOs working with the Zimbabwe police to enhance their respect for human rights. We also support good governance projects, and provide equipment and research material to NGOs working to improve people's access to law. We are encouraging the Zimbabweans to accede to the Convention against Torture.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.5/1">The 1999 Assessment of the operation of the Wassenaar Arrangement was concluded at the Arrangement's annual Plenary in Vienna on 1-<phrase class="date" code="2000-12-03">3 December</phrase>. The agreed public statement on the Plenary is available on the Arrangement's website (<a href="http://www.wassenaar.org">www.wassenaar.org</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/2">We welcome the decision by Participating States to expand the scope of their reporting on their transfers of certain types of conventional arms. As a result, arms pillar reporting requirements in the Wassenaar Arrangement will now for the first time extend beyond those in the UN Register of Conventional Arms. We also welcome the Plenary's decisions to structure the information exchange on the basis of global and regional views--as a result of a proposal by the UK--and to mandate the introduction of a secure electronic information system. These steps will greatly increase the value and accessibility of information exchanged by Participating States.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/3">Despite these positive developments, we regret that proposals to include other types of arms in the reporting requirements, including small arms and light weapons, warships of 150-750 metric tonnes displacement and missiles of less than 25km range, were not agreed due to opposition from a small minority of Participating States. We also regret that the Plenary did not agree that Participating States should provide details of decisions to refuse the transfer of military equipment, or details of end-users in all denial notifications for dual-use goods. We continue to believe that these improvements would significantly enhance the ability of Participating States to identify potentially destabilising transfers or accumulation of conventional arms and dual-use goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.5/4">Throughout the course of the 1999 Assessment, most of which was taken forward in the Arrangement's General Working Group under UK chairmanship, the UK has been at the forefront of efforts to increase the effectiveness of the Wassenaar Arrangement. In particular we co-sponsored and lobbied in support of proposals for a substantive increase in arms pillar transparency. We will continue this year to work for the further expansion of reporting requirements, to include in particular transfers of small arms and light weapons. We will also consider the scope for expanding our existing commitment to volunteer details of our transfers of certain types of conventional arms which are not covered by the mandatory reporting requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.2/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-05">5 January 2000</phrase>, we have introduced an amendment to the Export of Goods (Control) Order to control the export to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of television cameras, transmitters, codecs and transposers, satellite earth stations and up and down link equipment and transmission link and relay equipment. All applications to export these goods will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.2/2">We have introduced the control because of our concerns that companies based in the UK may consider supplying this equipment to the state-run television company in the FRY. This company is a propaganda tool of the Milosevic regime and has been consistently used by the regime to defend and promote its repressive policies, most recently and noticeably during the Kosovo crisis.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.11/1">On <phrase class="date" code="1999-09-27">27 September 1999</phrase> the European Court of Human Rights delivered its judgment in a case brought by four ex-Service personnel of the United Kingdom Armed Forces who had each been discharged on the grounds of their homosexuality. The Government accepted the Court's judgment and asked the Chief of Defence Staff to set in hand an urgent review of policy in this area. That review has now been completed and I am able to announce the outcome today.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/2">Our priority has been to preserve the operational effectiveness of our Armed Forces, to respect the rights of the individual, and to take full account of the Court ruling. The Chiefs of Staff have been fully involved in the process of developing a revised policy and have endorsed the outcome of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/3">The review has judged that sexual orientation is essentially a private matter, but, because of the unique place of the Armed Forces in our society, standards of behaviour are rightly imposed on members of the Armed Forces that can be more demanding than those required by society at large.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/4">The MoD is therefore introducing a code of conduct to govern the attitude and approach to the personal relationships of those serving in the Armed Forces. This code will apply across the Forces, regardless of Service, rank, gender or sexual orientation. It will provide a clear framework within which people in the Services can live and work. Moreover, it will complement existing policies, such as zero tolerance towards harassment, discrimination and bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/5">The code has been developed by Service experts who understand fully the operational needs and day-to-day practicalities of the Armed Forces. The code recognises explicitly that:</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/6" class="indent">&quot;It is not practicable to list every type of conduct which might constitute social misbehaviour&quot;. Therefore, we have placed at the heart of the code what we call the Service Test, set out in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/7" class="indent">&quot;Have the actions or behaviour of an individual adversely impacted or are they likely to impact on the efficiency or operational effectiveness of the Service?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/8">In using the code, commanders will have to apply this Service Test through the exercise of their good judgment, discretion and common sense--the essence of command and the effective management of people. I am arranging for copies of the code to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/9">As all personal behaviour will be regulated by the code of conduct with the object of maintaining the operational effectiveness of the three Services, there is no longer a reason to deny homosexuals the opportunity of a career in the Armed Forces. Accordingly, we have decided that it is right that the existing ban should be lifted. As no primary or secondary legislation is required, with effect from today, homosexuality will no longer be a bar to service in Britain's Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.11/10">I am confident that our Armed Forces will adapt to this change in the professional manner for which they are rightly held in the very highest regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.5/1">The subject of the question relates to matters undertaken by Forest Enterprise. I have asked its Chief Executive, Dr Bob McIntosh, to arrange for a reply to be given.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/2">Letter to Lord Hylton from the Chief Executive of Forest Enterprise, Mr B McIntosh dated <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-20">20 December 1999</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/3">I have been asked to reply to your question about the sale of softwood thinnings by Forest Enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/4">Most managed forests are thinned several times during their life. Thinning allows the remaining trees to grow larger, which means that they are more valuable. Thinning is therefore a standard part of good forest management.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/5">The income from the timber from thinning usually more than meets the cost of the thinning, although early thinnings sometimes cost more than the timber is worth. Nevertheless, early thinning, like weeding, is often a worthwhile investment as it improves the quality and value of the final forest. It is therefore impossible to say whether particular prices for thinnings are uneconomic as this depends on how much the thinnings benefit the remaining trees in the forest.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/6">Of course, Forest Enterprise aims to sell all its timber at market prices. However, the world market in timber effectively sets these prices. Prices for timber are much lower than they were two years ago because of, amongst other things, the strength of sterling, the weakness of the Swedish Krona, the increasing supply of timber from the Baltic States, and the downturn in the Asian economy. These prices may seem uneconomic to some forest owners, but the income from Forest Enterprise's thinning operations has more than met the costs. Within this, of course, some individual thinnings made a large profit, while others were an investment for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/7">As regards the amount of timber sold each year, Forest Enterprise's Corporate Plan sets out the volume that we plan to sell each year, in line with our production forecasts. By offering this volume for sale every year, far from harming other softwood owners, we help to bring stability to the market, benefiting processors and growers alike.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/8">I hope that this has reassured you that our thinning operations are guided by long-term policies rather than short-term financial pressures.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Morley, represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the EU Fisheries Council in Brussels on 16-<phrase class="date" code="2000-12-17">17 December</phrase>, together with Mr John Home Robertson, Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs in the Scottish Executive, and Mrs Brid Rodgers, the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, the first Minister for the newly devolved administration to attend an EU Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/2">The Council agreed by qualified majority, with France voting against, the total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas to apply in 2000 in Community waters and for Community vessels fishing in waters where catch limitations apply. Details of the final TACs are given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/3">Following from the advice of fisheries scientists in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the Commission had initially proposed substantial cuts in many TACs, reflecting the poor state of some stocks, reduced recruitment to them or the need to bring fishing effort back to levels which will help to sustain the future availability of stocks. Working on the basis of the scientific advice but using some of the precautionary management options identified by the scientists, we were able to secure smaller cuts than originally proposed for a number of TACs including nephrops in Area VII, anglers (monk fish) in West of Scotland, the North Sea and Area VII, and in some flat fish TACs. As a result at the end of the negotiations, the total UK quotas agreed were some 95,000 tonnes higher in cod equivalent tonnes than in the Commission proposals. This increase reduces the estimated loss of quota value to the industry in 2000 from &pound;70 million to &pound;40 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/4">Recognising the need to take steps to promote the recovery of the badly depleted cod stock in the Irish Sea, they were able to secure a Council and Commission commitment to introduce a recovery programme, after consultation with a new regional group made up of fishermen, scientists, and administrators involved in this fishery. The Commission will for the first time use the emergency conservation powers available to it to bring forward measures closing those areas in the Irish Sea in which spawning cod congregate from February to April 2000, as a way of protecting the stock. This commitment to an EU recovery programme, which followed intensive preparatory discussions between us, the Irish and the Commission, sets an important precedent for regional co-operation under the Common Fisheries Policy and the involvement of the industry in the management decisions on stock recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/5">The Council also agreed on the closure from <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-01">1 January 2000</phrase> of the sandeel fishery off the Firth of Forth in the interests of protecting seabirds dependent on sandeels. This measure which is in line with scientific advice resulted from close co-operation between us, Denmark and the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/6">The Council further agreed not to reduce in 2000 the minimum landing size for plaice to 22 cm. As a result, we are pleased to confirm that this will remain at 27 cm.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/7">We successfully invoked the Hague Preference on all those stocks where it was in our overall interest to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/8">The regulation on TACs and Quotas adopted by the Council incorporates for the first time in a single regulation the outcome of all the Community's international fisheries arrangements for 2000 between the Community and Norway, Faroes, Greenland, and Iceland, and under the North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/9">The Council also adopted unanimously, with Portugal abstaining, the regulation applying control measures for Community vessels in 2000 required under the North East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/10">Commissioner Fischler confirmed that he would be meeting the Moroccan Minister of Fisheries on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-20">20 December</phrase> to initiate negotiations on a new fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco. He also made brief presentations on a Commission report on regional meetings, which will become available and be considered from January 2000, and the Commission's proposals for further amendment of the Technical Conservation Regulation, which includes provision for a three-year closure of the Firth of Forth sandeel fishery.</p>
