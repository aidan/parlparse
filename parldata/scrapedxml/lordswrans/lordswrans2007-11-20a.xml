	<p pid="a.51.1/2" qnum="HL168">What was the cost of (a) the work that took place to the main road outside the Palace of Westminster (Abingdon Street/New Palace Yard) during the Summer Recess, and (b) the arrangements made in this area for the State Opening of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">The main road outside the Palace was closed during the Summer Recess to enable Westminster City Council to undertake essential repairs to the road surface. The House Committee took the decision in June that this scheduled road closure should be used as an opportunity to move the Corus barriers further from the Palace as envisaged under phase 2 of the Corus security programme. Further work was undertaken during the five days immediately after State Opening to replace the temporary installation with the final barriers.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">The cost of the surface repair work was met by Westminster City Council. The road layout works and provision of components for the Corus barriers were undertaken by the parliamentary estate at a cost of &pound;835,395. Further costs may arise due to additional requirements such as extra signage. The arrangements made in the area for the State Opening of Parliament, including the removal and reinstatement of the barriers, cost &pound;70,100.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.5/1">Hearts and minds are at the core of the ISAF mission in Afghanistan, and providing a tangible improvement to the lives of ordinary Afghans is crucial to the success of the mission. The UK presence in Afghanistan makes a vital contribution by bringing together military and civilian experts to help to create the local security environment necessary for economic progress and by helping to fund and promote sustainable development. Overall, the security situation in Afghanistan is stable, although it is fragile in places, and there remains a threat from suicide attacks and local ambushes.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">From April 2006, older and eligible disabled people have been guaranteed free off-peak local bus travel within their local authority area. The Government provided an extra &pound;350 million in 2006-07 and a further &pound;367.5 million in 2007-08 to fund the extra costs to local authorities. This funding was provided via the formula grant system in line with the wishes of local government to have greater freedom and flexibilities in how they use their funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/2">The Government are providing local authorities in England with an extra &pound;212 million next year, which is based on generous assumptions about the probable cost impact of the new national concession. This funding will be provided by special grant reflecting the views of local government. The Department for Transport is currently consulting on the formula basis for distributing the special grant; the consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase>. In addition, we have announced that we will be providing local authorities with approximately &pound;30 million for the issuing of the national pass.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/3">The Government are confident that the extra funding being provided is sufficient to cover the total additional costs to local authorities of this improvement in the statutory minimum. Any discretionary local enhancements, such as peak bus travel, are funded from an authority's own resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/4">It is for local authorities to implement affordable local schemes taking account of their statutory obligations and their assessment of local circumstances and need.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/5">The policy on concessionary fares is a devolved issue and the different approaches taken in Scotland and Wales reflect very different circumstances from those that pertain to England. In England there is no single &quot;scheme&quot; but a statutory minimum concession, which local authorities can enhance if they so wish. This is consistent with the views expressed by local government during discussions over implementation of the national concession.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/6">The Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 includes powers to change the way in which the national bus concession is administered in the future. However, there are no plans at present to centralise the arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">Section 28 of the Equality Act 2006 gives the Equality and Human Rights Commission (the commission) the power to provide advice, assistance and representation to an individual who alleges that he or she has been a victim of behaviour contrary to a provision of the &quot;equality enactments&quot;. The &quot;equality enactments&quot; include all the main provisions outlawing discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase>, the commission inherited from its three legacy commissions all the legal casework where advice, assistance or representation was being provided. The commission also committed to continue supporting the funding programmes inherited from its legacy commissions for voluntary and community sector organisations for 2007-08, including law centres providing legal advice and support to victims of discrimination. In this year, the funding programme amounts to &pound;3,159,056. The commission is still in discussions on the exact level of funding that it will render to complainant aid services.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/3">In addition to the legal staff based in England, Scotland and Wales who have come from the three legacy commissions, the commission will build up its complement of staff in the legal directorate during the next few months to over 60 full-time equivalents. These staff will carry out three functions: legal policy, enforcement and casework and litigation (advice, assistance and representation). In addition, the commission's legal budget gives staff from the legal directorate the flexibility to buy in external legal services where necessary. The commission will continue to take on individual strategically important legal cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/4">The commission's funding and support services are only a small part of the total funding needed to support equality and human rights advice. Through its country and regional offices, the commission is in discussion with advice agencies and other funders on how best to work together to ensure not only that the equality and human rights advice sector is properly funded but that the funding is properly co-ordinated.</p>

The 2008-09 funding cycle will be an interim year while the commission develops an appropriate, fit-for-purpose grants programme to take effect beyond 2008-09 and to reflect the priorities of the commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2">Section 17 of the Equality Act 2006 is an extension of Section 44 of the Race Relations Act 1976 but also increases the types of organisation that can apply for funding. It is expected that under normal circumstances all the organisations currently in receipt of funding under Section 44 of the Race Relations Act 1976 will be eligible to apply for funding from the commission under Section 17. As long as the race equality council meets the new funding programme requirements and, where applicable, it has met the evaluation and monitoring requirements of its current contracts, it would be able to apply for funding beyond 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/3">Race equality councils are extremely important partners for the commission. The commission is working closely with them as well as other organisations in the voluntary and community sector to develop a full funding programme to meet the challenges of the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.0/1">Smarter choices measures include travel planning, public transport information and marketing, travel awareness campaigns, car clubs and car-sharing schemes, teleworking, teleconferencing and home shopping. They can reduce environmental impacts, improve health and reduce congestion. However, reducing congestion in turn improves economic productivity and health.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/2">The links between smarter choices and people's decisions to travel by car or public transport or to walk or cycle were explored in depth in <I>Smarter Choices, Changing the Way We Travel</I> (2004).

	<p pid="a.64.0/3">The links between congestion and productivity were discussed in detail in the Eddington study.

	<p pid="a.65.2/2">To ensure that the standard is met, school travel plans that are of the highest quality receive a capital grant from the Department for Children, Schools and Families.

Regional school travel advisers quality-assure a proportion of the plans submitted for consideration of a grant by each local authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.3/1">The OFT can offer general guidance on consumer credit licensing, but its advice cannot be taken as an authoritative view of the law. What is or is not regulated consumer credit business, within the meaning of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, is ultimately a matter for the courts. Whether or not a licence is required will be dependent on the individual circumstances applicable to the operation of each individual club. It is not possible to list all the specific circumstances that would require clubs to be licensed, since OFT cannot be aware of all the facts. Consequently, OFT would advise individual clubs to seek independent legal advice if they are in any doubt.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.3/2">However, if a club is carrying on business, allows payment of membership fees in more than four instalments and its agreements are not subject to any exemptions, it may need a consumer credit licence. Guidance on exemptions is available in the OFT publication <I>Regulated and Exempt Agreements</I> (OFT140), which is available on the OFT website at <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/advice_and_resources/publications/consumer_advice/money_credit_debt/oftl40">www.oft.gov.uk/advice_and_ resources/publications/consumer_advice/money_credit_debt/oftl40</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">Section 189(1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 defines &quot;consumer credit business&quot; as &quot;any business so far as it comprises or relates to the provision of credit under regulated consumer credit agreements&quot;. Whether or not a club is carrying on a business will be dependent on the individual circumstances applicable to the operation of each individual club. The main issue that clubs need to consider is whether their credit activity would be classified as &quot;occasional business&quot;. This will be a question of fact. In addition, clubs should be aware that they may still be classed as carrying on a credit business even if they are non-profit making or have charitable status. If individual clubs are in any doubt as to whether they are carrying on a consumer credit business, they should seek independent legal advice.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-11-20a.68.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="68"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71120w0003.htm#07112077000155">
	<p pid="a.68.2/1">We have promoted greater take-up of travel plans in four main ways: through best practice research, dissemination and provision of expert advice; through the funding of pilots and the evaluation of new techniques or approaches; through providing pump-prime funding to encourage local authorities to promote and invest in travel planning and to support the work of non-government organisations; and through fostering and supporting travel planning through tax incentives, local transport plans and the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">Major initiatives have included: &pound;140 million investment in the travelling to school initiative, which is working towards having travel plans in all schools by 2010; the three sustainable travel towns project, which has seen how walking, cycling and public transport use increased by at least 10 per cent while car trips have fallen by 10 per cent; the six cycling demonstration towns; and the National Business Travel Network to increase the take-up of travel plans among major businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/3">Our approach has been to encourage voluntary promotion and implementation of travel plans, rather than legislating to secure them. Research has shown that travel plans prove most effective and have greatest longevity when they generate a voluntary change in behaviour. However, with regard to new developments that are likely to have a major impact, we adopt a regulatory approach. In such cases, the granting of planning permission for the development to proceed is now generally linked with a formal requirement to prepare a travel plan. Enforcement for travel plans resulting from planning requirements is the responsibility of the relevant planning authority. We will shortly be publishing guidance on using the planning process to secure travel plans, which will cover how to ensure that enforcement is effective.</p>
