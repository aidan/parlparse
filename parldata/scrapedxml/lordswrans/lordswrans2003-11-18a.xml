	<p pid="a.279.3/3">The Home Secretary's decisions to detain these individuals were made on the basis of detailed and compelling evidence.

So long as the public emergency subsists, where a person is suspected of terrorism but cannot currently be removed and for whom a criminal prosecution is not an option, we believe that it is necessary and proportionate to provide for extended detention, pending removal.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.3/13">Dstl and the independent panel of experts overseeing this complex research programme recognise that it would have been impossible to devise a single schedule that would reflect the actual experience of all veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict. The schedule used reflects a valid &quot;worse case&quot; in that 10 vaccines were administered over a short time period with booster doses of some vaccines given 23 and 51 days after the first vaccines. Pyridostigmine bromide, the active ingredient of Nerve Agent Pre-Treatment Set (NAPS) tablets, was administered continuously for 28 days during the 51 day schedule. As environmental and other conditions pertaining at the time individuals received their medical countermeasures are not part of the Vaccines Interactions Research Programme, they do not form part of the &quot;worse case&quot; scenario.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.5/1">The Licensing Act 2003 provides for fees to be payable to the licensing authorities for discharging their functions under the Act, for example, for applications for premises licences or club premises certificates. The fees will be set centrally by the Secretary of State at a level which will allow for full cost recovery in respect of the administration, inspection and enforcement of the new regime. No additional funding will therefore be required. Where an exemption from the requirement to pay a fee has been granted by the Government, the associated costs will be met from central government funds.</p>
