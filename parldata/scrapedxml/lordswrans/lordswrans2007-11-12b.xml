	<p pid="b.1.8/1">The award to the University of Newcastle entitled &quot;Improving the efficiency of human Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer&quot; (SCNT) will examine technological improvements with the major aim of improving the efficiency of SCNT. This is an essential prerequisite for realising the potential benefits of this approach. For example, SCNT is considered to hold great promise for the development of patient-specific stem cell therapies, which may overcome the problems of immune rejection that would otherwise prove a barrier to the use of transplanted stem cells. The work is thus desirable for one or more clinically related purposes.</p>

	<p pid="b.2.2/1">The Medical Research Council (MRC) has not made an assessment of the work described in these recently published papers. Careful and validated research is still needed in this area, which the recent MRC awards to the University of Newcastle aim to address. These issues are a matter for the Medical Research Council and I have asked the MRC's chief executive to write to the noble Lord concerning his request.</p>

	<p pid="b.2.5/1">The House of Lords has pursued technological solutions to reduce paper and benefit from the speed, cost-efficiency and ease of electronic media. All House of Lords papers published by The Stationery Office are available in electronic form on the day of publication. Initiatives such as the distribution of notices by electronic mail, digital audio recording in the Chamber and in Committee Rooms, and a preference where possible for electronic distribution of documents, combine to present substantial savings and efficiency. Members and staff can also access committee information through the internet.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.5/2">The House purchases paper selected on the basis of value for money and reliability of service. Paper supplied to photocopiers and printers is 100 per cent recyclable. All waste paper from the parliamentary estate can be recycled by means of the recycling bins provided in every office.</p>
