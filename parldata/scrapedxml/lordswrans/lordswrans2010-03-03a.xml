Inadequate and poorly maintained slurry and silage storage facilities are the most likely reason for the increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.352.2/2">All foreign nationals subject to removal will be considered by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) under the early removals scheme (ERS), which allows for early removal up to a maximum of 270 days prior to the halfway point of the sentence, subject to the serving of a requisite period. Since 2007, the UKBA has removed in excess of 15,000 foreign national prisoners. Approximately 25 per cent of these removals occurred under the ERS.</p>

	<p pid="a.355.9/1">There are several provisions in British nationality law which provide for the acquisition of citizenship by a stateless person. These enable us to meet our obligations under the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.9/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="1983-01-01">1 January 1983</phrase> a child born in the United Kingdom will only be a British citizen if either parent is a British citizen or settled in the United Kingdom. The British Nationality Act 1981 therefore contains provisions by which children born here can register as British citizens, either once a parent becomes British or settled, or following a period of residence in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.9/3">There are also provisions by which stateless children born outside the United Kingdom after 1983 can be registered as British citizens if a parent holds a form of British Nationality.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.9/4">A person who has remained stateless since the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force is entitled to registration in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.9/5">There are no specific provisions in place to cover those who have come to the UK but do not hold the nationality of another country. Adults who have come to the United Kingdom as stateless refugees are able to apply for naturalisation in the same way as any other applicant, on the basis of a period of residence here. The residence requirements for naturalisation exist to allow a person to demonstrate a close and continuing personal connection with the United Kingdom, irrespective of their current nationality.</p>

	<p pid="a.356.5/1">Reliable information is not available, as individuals are not required to report their UK domicile status or residence status to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) unless either is relevant to their liability to UK tax within that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/2"><I>Non-domiciled UK residents</I></p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/3">Individuals who are resident but not domiciled within the UK (non-domiciles) do not need to inform HMRC of their non-domicile status unless it is relevant to their tax affairs in that tax year.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/4">In the majority of cases an individual's domicile status will make no difference to the direct tax they must pay in the UK. This is because an individual's domicile status is mainly relevant for income and capital gains tax purposes when an individual has foreign income or foreign gains, for example from overseas investment or employment. Where this is the case, UK residents may need to complete supplementary pages to the main self-assessment tax return. Many such residents pay tax on these income and gains on the arising basis so their domicile status is not relevant to their tax affairs. However UK resident individuals who are either not ordinarily resident or are not domiciled within the UK may use the remittance basis in respect of their foreign income or gains instead.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/5">Following the changes introduced in Finance Act 2008, many of these individuals will now have to complete a self-assessment tax return to use the remittance basis (with some minor exceptions for lower-income or migrant workers).</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/6">Prior to the Finance Act 2008 it was not always necessary for individuals using the remittance basis to complete a self-assessment tax return. Similarly those individuals who did complete a self-assessment tax return did not always need to say whether they were using the remittance basis because they were non-domiciled in the UK or because they are not ordinarily resident in the UK. In 2006-07, 86,000 individuals filed a self-assessment tax return on the basis that they were non-domiciled in the UK. This is the latest year for which data are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/7">UK residents who are non-domiciled may also make lifetime transfers into trusts with inheritance tax due at 20 per cent. To do so, they must inform HMRC of their domicile status. This information is not centrally collated by HMRC's systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/8"><I>Non-domiciled non-UK residents</I></p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/9">With some minor exceptions non-UK residents do not generally pay UK capital gains tax. They pay UK tax on their UK source income, although this may be relieved under a double taxation treaty. There is generally no need for such individuals to inform HMRC about their domicile status; the remittance basis is only relevant to UK residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/10">Some non-resident individuals will complete the non-residence pages of a self-assessment tax return and declare their non-resident status. There is usually no need for such individuals to declare their domicile status too, although on occasion some do choose to tick the non-domicile box. In 2006-07 30,000 taxpayers chose to declare themselves as non-resident and non-domiciled in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.5/11">These individuals will broadly fall into five groups: those who are not resident in the UK but have investments here on which UK tax must be paid; those who have returned abroad from a UK employment assignment and have to file to pay tax on their final year salary; those with UK-source self-employment income from business trips (particularly if they come from a country with which we do not have a double taxation agreement); those performing in the UK as non-resident artistes or sportspersons; and those who making claims under double taxation treaties.</p>
