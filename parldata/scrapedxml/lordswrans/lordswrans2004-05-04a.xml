	<p pid="a.95.2/1">The approved budget for 2004 for the Ulster-Scots Agency is &pound;1,704,000. This gives an increase of &pound;164,000 (10.65 per cent), on the approved budget for 2003. The budget was calculated on the basis of the 2003 budget with amounts due to inflation and the cost of additional staff. This is in line with the care and maintenance mode in which North/South bodies are operating. The Ulster-Scots Agency's policy of targeting social need is ongoing and the approved budget for 2004 should not impact detrimentally on this. Targeting social need is a cross-cutting theme that should be reflected throughout the agency's programme of work.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.3/1">The regulations for the Reservist's standard award are set out in SI 1997/309. Although the banded ceilings relating to that award were prescribed in 1997, they have continued to meet the needs of the vast majority of Reservists who have made claims for financial assistance under the regulations. Furthermore, those Reservists who believe that they would suffer hardship if they receive only the standard award are able to claim an additional hardship award. There is no ceiling for a hardship award. Reservists who are dissatisfied with the payments they receive from the Ministry of Defence may appeal to a Reserve Forces appeal tribunal. Of the 10,000 Reservists that have been called out since January 2003, only eight have submitted appeals regarding their financial awards. Of those eight, two were resolved to the Reservists' satisfaction before the date of the appeal hearing, two were found in favour of the Service authorities, one is ongoing and three have yet to be heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/2">Notwithstanding that the current regulations have satisfied the needs of the great majority of Reservists, we recognise that the current system is both time-consuming to administer and perceived to be intrusive by Reservists. Also, we recognise that the banded ceilings are being eroded by pay awards. We are therefore planning to introduce new regulations, but there is no intention or need to make them retrospective.</p>

Given the sensitive nature of removals, we need to exercise caution and take into account the safety and well-being of the individuals being removed. However, we are already taking steps to promote some enforced removals by putting some information into the public domain. This includes using the media to help promote certain removals, inviting members of the press to take part in some enforcement operations and publishing quarterly statistics on all areas of IND activity, including removals.

	<p pid="a.105.2/1">The government agency responsible for reviewing the efficiency of the administration of community punishment is Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation. Community punishment schemes in all 42 areas of the National Probation Service were reviewed as part of the performance inspection programme between 1999 and 2002. These inspections addressed the achievement of national and local targets, compliance with national standards, the organisation, nature and quality of the work undertaken by offenders and the satisfaction of those who benefited from that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/2">The currrent inspection programme is the effective supervision inspection which began in June 2003 and will eventually cover all 42 areas. This will focus on management arrangements in community punishment units, along with assessment of offenders and the suitability of work placements.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/3">Additionally, since the development of the enhanced community punishment scheme in 2003, the National Probation Directorate has developed a framework to assess how effectively this has been implemented in probation areas. A rigorous post-implementation review is currently underway with very encouraging results. Once the implementation phase is completed, areas will undertake an annual audit of their enhanced community punishment provision to ensure that quality is maintained.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.5/1">Litter clearance is a suitable activity for offenders sentenced to community punishment and has always formed a proportion of the unpaid work&mdash;currently standing at 7 million hours each year&mdash;performed by offenders on community punishment orders. It provides punishment of offenders in combination with reparation to the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/2">The enhanced community punishment scheme which was introduced in October 2003, and is now operational in all 42 areas which make up the National Probation Service, is designed in such a way that it also has a rehabilitative effect and the potential to reduce the likelihood of reconviction.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/3">Research indicates that certain qualities or features of placements appear to increase the rehabilitative impact of community punishment and the introduction of enhanced community punishment obliged local probation areas to re-evaluate all existing placements with a view to their capacity:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/4" class="indent">to provide demanding, purposeful work which the offender and the people who benefit from it see as a worthwhile contribution to the community;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/5" class="indent">to ensure contact between the offender and the members of the community who benefit from the work;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/6" class="indent">to provide opportunties for the offender to learn new practical and thinking skills, particularly in relation to employment; and</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/7" class="indent">to comply with health and safety requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/8">Where existing placements have not matched these criteria, it has usually been possible for areas to work with and support beneficiaries to ensure that the requirements can be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.5/9">The type of activity undertaken is much less important than whether the placement provides challenging and demanding work for the offender, enabling them to develop skills which will improve their prospects in the job market. As long as the beneficiary and the probation area work in partnership, it should be possible to provide a quality placement through a well run litter clearance scheme. Suffolk Probation Area, for example, is currently undertaking litter clearance on a number of beaches as well as for local councils. A number of their staff are currently working towards a City and Guilds qualification which is a legal requirement for the supervision of litter clearance on highways and this should enable them to expand their activities further.</p>

Although we are not, in the wider context of the Government's position on Zimbabwe, generally enforcing returns of such individuals at this time, we consider it entirely reasonable to expect them to leave voluntarily.

	<p pid="a.107.5/1">The Government's strategy for tackling specifically organised immigration crime is Reflex, the multi-agency forum established in May 2000 which brings together key law enforcement players under the chair of the National Crime Squad. Reflex has funded several successful initiatives since its inception that have contributed to the reduction of criminally-driven immigration to the UK and other EU states. In particular, two projects (Impact 1 and 2) developed the capacity of border guards in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro to identify forged documents, while a third project in Romania saw the establishment of a team focusing effectively on people trafficking and smuggling.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/2">Reflex also funds two immigration crime teams in the UK, bringing together the subject matter expertise of the Immigration Service and the investigative capabilities of the National Crime Squad to focus on serious immigration-related crime. A third team is to be established shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/3">Reflex activity in 2003&ndash;04 resulted in the disruption of 42 criminal groups and has identified &pound;3 million of assets for confiscation and/or seizure.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/4">The National Criminal Intelligence Service manages an expanding network of Immigration Liaison Officers (currently 12) operating in key overseas posts to work closely with law enforcement agencies in the host country with the aim of tackling illegal migratory flows to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/5">The UK has developed a network of liaison officers in key posts overseas to build our intelligence picture on organised crime originating outside the UK. We have developed sectoral strategies, for example on drugs and organised immigration crime, which work upstream to take operational action and to achieve disruption as close to source as possible. We continue to work with international partners, and with organisations such as Interpol, Europol and Eurojust to act against organised crime which crosses international borders. The establishment of the recently announced Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) will bring a new focus to bear on reducing the harm caused to the UK and its citizens by all organised crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/6">UK Immigration Service operates pre and on-entry controls to regulate entry to the UK. Several key measures have recently been introduced in order to enhance border security. They include:</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/7" class="indent">the introduction of juxtaposed controls at specific locations overseas by which means the admissibility of passengers is considered and decided prior to embarkation, resulting in improperly documented or those ineligible for entry not being allowed to proceed to the UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/8" class="indent">the expansion of the Airline Liaison Network overseas, which is designed to give advice and assistance to airlines in relation to the documentation and the prevention of the carriage of inadequately documented passengers to the UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/9" class="indent">the deployment of freight searching detection equipment in UK ports and overseas to target those who seek to enter the UK clandestinely; and</p>
	<p pid="a.107.5/10" class="indent">an informed visa strategy designed to establish qualification for entry to the UK prior to arrival.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">Citizenship is a matter of law, which is determined by the facts of a person's date and place of birth, those of their parents and the application of the provisions of the relevant legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">The British Nationality Status of Aliens Act 1914 determined in law that all persons born in the United Kingdom and Crown's dominions would hold the status of British subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">The British Nationality Act 1948 introduced the concept of citizenship and determined which British subjects would become a British subject, citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (BSUKC). The Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1949-01-01">1 January 1949</phrase>, and provided for all persons born in the United Kingdom and Colonies to become BSUKC by birth. Those born in a foreign or Commonwealth country who had a father born in the United Kingdom or existing colony would become BSUKC by descent. Other British subjects with a close connection with an independent Commonwealth country became British subjects, citizens of . . . (the Commonwealth country).</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">The status of British subject was retained by a small number of British subjects. In particular Irish citizens born before <phrase class="date" code="1949-01-01">1 January 1949</phrase> could elect to remain British subjects. British subjects born in British India before <phrase class="date" code="1949-01-01">1 January 1949</phrase> who did not become citizens of India also remained British subjects on <phrase class="date" code="1949-01-01">1 January 1949</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/5">The British Nationality Act 1981 provided for BSUKCs who had the right of abode in the United Kingdom to become British citizens on <phrase class="date" code="1983-01-01">1 January 1983</phrase>. It also retained the status of British subject for those who remained British subjects on <phrase class="date" code="1949-01-01">1 January 1949</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/6">British subject status only applies to those born before <phrase class="date" code="1949-01-01">1 January 1949</phrase> and cannot be passed to further generations by descent, as is the case with British citizenship. The status will fail to exist when the last British subject is deceased.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/7">All British passports are issued in the same format and are only distinguishable by the status shown on the personal details page, or in some cases where the passport holder is not a European national for passport purposes by the absence of &quot;European Union&quot; on the front cover.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/8">The major difference between the status British citizen and British subject is that British citizens are able to travel freely within the European Union whereas British subjects who are not European nationals for passport purposes, may need to obtain visas prior to travel. Individuals holding &quot;British Subject&quot; passports may be required by the immigration laws of the receiving country to obtain visas prior to travel. This is not a matter over which the British Government have any authority to intervene. The UK Passport Service therefore recommends that all travellers check with the travel agent or the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country they intend to visit if a visa is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/9">There are no changes envisaged.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.8/1">As a result of our efforts with the US and others in Afghanistan, that country is no longer a safe haven for Al'Qaeda (AQ). It is not always easy to distinguish AQ elements from other groups hostile to the current political process in Afghanistan. Extremists are undoubtedly attempting to establish bases there from which to operate, but successful military operations conducted by the coalition and units of the Afghan national army (ANA) are preventing them doing so. AQ operations worldwide have suffered disruption. AQ leadership is dispersed and operating under increasingly difficult conditions. Many key operatives and planners have been detained.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.8/2">The US-led coalition and NATO have now deployed a total of 12 provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) to help to extend the authority of central government at the expense of regional power-holders. The UK-led PRT in Mazar-e-Sharif helped to broker a ceasefire between two regional commanders in October 2003 and more recently played a key role in preventing factional unrest developing in Faryab Province, where a second UK-led PRT is now being established. The new PRT is already working with ANA and Afghan national police units sent to the area by President Karzai. PRTs have had a demonstrably beneficial effect on security in the areas they cover and this in turn helps to facilitate reconstruction.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.8/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-01">1 March 2004</phrase> my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development announced in his Written Statement (Official Report, Column 74WS) an increase of the UK's commitment, from &pound;200 million over five years to at least &pound;500 million over the same period. This funding is to support a range of reconstruction work, support for conflict prevention, and the counter-narcotics effort. A booklet outlining DfID's programme in Afghanistan has been placed in the Library of the House. International donors demonstrated their commitment to Afghanistan at the Berlin conference held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> by pledging 8.2 billion dollars of assistance over the next three years. This represents two-thirds of Afghanistan's requirements over this period. We hope that the full requirement will be met through more money becoming available from donors that were only able to make one-year pledges in Berlin.</p>
