	<p pid="a.45.6/1">The Minister of State for Universities and Science is responsible for innovation and science and research policy and funding for the Research Councils and for the Technology Strategy Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.6/2">The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Technology Strategy Board receive their grant-in-aid from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. BBSRC funds fundamental bioscience research, including work to understand the basic biology of stem cells. The MRC supports the full spectrum of biomedical research, including stem cell science. The Technology Strategy Board has a number of strategic programmes to incentivise technology innovation by UK business including in the area of stratified medicine and regenerative medicine.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.6/3">In keeping with the long-standing Haldane principle, prioritisation of an individual research council's spending within its allocation is not a decision for Ministers. Similarly, the Technology Strategy Board operates at arm's-length from Government with support for research and development directed to those areas which offer the greatest scope for boosting UK growth and productivity on the basis of business and academic strength.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.6/4">The Secretary of State for Health has overall responsibility for health strategy and policy and has duties and powers under relevant legislation. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Public Health has policy responsibility for matters relating to biotechnology, which includes haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, stem cell research and its regulation through the relevant regulators such as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the Human Tissue Authority and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Quality has policy responsibility for health-related research and development.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.0/1">This Government believe that EU membership is in our interests. The Single Market is the world's most important trading zone, generating total GDP of over &#163;10.5 trillion in 2009 and giving us access to 500 million consumers without the barriers of customs or tariffs. The resultant economic benefits for individuals are very real with approximately 3.5 million jobs, ie 10 per cent of the UK workforce, benefiting from exports to EU member states. The beneficial effect of EU trade on UK households is estimated at between &#163;1,100 and &#163;3,300 per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/2">EU membership also gives us better leverage internationally. Collective action gives us more negotiating power and allows us to better achieve our international security objectives on issues such as conflict prevention, stabilisation, climate change, human rights and development. For British citizens, the benefits of EU membership are many and varied, from free movement across EU member states, to the option to study and work within the EU without requiring a work permit, to the European Health Card (EHIC), which enables UK holiday-makers and travellers to receive free or reduced cost healthcare on temporary visits to EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/3">On this basis, and given the complexity and cost of measuring the many variables involved, the Government do not consider it appropriate to conduct their own cost benefit analysis of UK EU membership.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.6/1">There is no formally agreed definition of frontline police services. Consideration is being given, with the police service, to the establishment of a common definition. Although no fixed definition exists, frontline officers and staff are generally those directly involved in the public crime fighting face of the force. This includes neighbourhood policing, response policing and criminal investigation. Forces should focus on maintaining and improving frontline services, while reducing costs as much as possible in middle and back office support functions, consistent with supporting frontline services. Police forces can also maintain and improve frontline services by enabling frontline officers and staff to work more efficiently and effectively.</p>
