<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-11-22a.74.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="74"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo001122/text/01122w01.htm#01122w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.74.8/1">As a result of the spending review, the Science Budget has been increased by &pound;725 million over the next three years. This represents an increase in the Government's investment in science of an average of 7 per cent per year in real terms over the next three years. Once again the Government are making it clear that they regard a healthy science and engineering base as critical to the nation's well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/2">After taking advice from the Director General of the Research Councils, it has been decided that the Science Budget should be allocated as follows. A total of &pound;356 million is for investment in science and engineering research; of this, &pound;252 million is to be spent over three years on three high-profile programmes across the research councils. The three programmes are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/3" class="indent">Genomics: a &pound;110 million investment to increase understanding of gene function and related applications. This should lead to the development of new diagnostics, drugs and materials;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/4" class="indent">E-science: a &pound;98 million investment to solve key problems of processing, communicating, storing and accessing data across a range of scientific disciplines, with additional investment to develop core generic technologies. This investment is absolutely essential for large scale, modern science, but I expect it to have important industrial implications over the coming decade;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/5" class="indent">Basic technology: a &pound;44 million investment to build up the UK's technology capability. This has value in itself but will also act as the springboard for more advanced science.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/6">A &pound;1 billion Science Research Investment Fund (SRIF) will fund renewal and development: &pound;375 million of this will come from the Science Budget, &pound;300 million from the Department for Education and Employment and &pound;225 million from the Wellcome Trust. My department is currently discussing with other interested parties the basis for the allocating of &pound;900 million of this fund to universities.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/7">The remaining &pound;100 million of SRIF will be invested in research council institutes and large science facilities. The allocations I am announcing today to the research councils include &pound;32 million of this. The remainder will be allocated later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/8">There will be a new &pound;140 million Higher Education Innovation Fund to encourage exploitation of knowledge by higher education institutions. This will incorporate the current Higher Education Reach Out to Business and the Community Fund (HEROBC). This total includes around &pound;60 million from the Department for Education and Employment and &pound;80 million from the Science Budget. There is also &pound;20 million from the Science Budget for the University Challenge and Science Enterprise Challenge Schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/9">Thirty-four million pounds is being allocated to the research councils to fund increases in the basic PhD stipends from &pound;6,800 this academic year to &pound;9,000 in 2003-04. This represents an increase of 23 per cent in real terms over the period, following the Comprehensive Spending Review in 1998. It sends another clear signal that the Government believe that postgraduate research should no longer be seen as a Cinderella career choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.8/10">The detailed allocation is as follows. Further details are available in a report I am publishing today The Science Budget 2001-02 to 2003-04, which I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">The Minister of Defence is taking a number of steps designed to help those who participated as volunteers in trials at Porton Down. The Ministry of Defence is very grateful to all those whose participation in studies at Porton Down made possible the research to provide safe and effective protection for UK Armed Forces against chemical and biological weapons. Suggestions have been made that some Porton Down volunteers suffer unusual patterns of ill health because of their participation. The Ministry of Defence has seen no scientific evidence to support that belief but takes such suggestions seriously. Therefore we are:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.2/2" class="indent">Offering volunteers the opportunity for a thorough medical assessment if they have concerns about their health. This will be along the lines of the Gulf Veterans medical assessment programme and will use the same facilities at St. Thomas' Hospital, London. The data from these consultations will be analysed to explore whether patterns of ill health are associated with particular exposures;</p>

	<p pid="a.80.5/1">The British Antarctic Survey did not predict that the Antarctic ozone hole could be replicated over the Arctic within the next 20 years but did quote US research suggesting such an event might be possible. The Arctic is not prone to the consistently stable and cold conditions that promote ozone loss in the Antarctic, nor does the spring ozone depletion in the Arctic last into summer as it does in the Antarctic.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/2">The amount of ozone depleting substances in the stratosphere is decreasing slowly but if the stratosphere continues to cool over the next few decades, then it is possible that ozone levels over the Arctic could fall to the threshold level defined for an ozone hole in any individual year. Very low levels are unlikely to occur consistently year after year or to be as low as those observed in the Antarctic.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.5/3">A reduction in the level of ozone overhead increases the amount of harmful ultraviolet sunlight (UVB) reaching the surface and an increase in UVB can damage the skin and eyes and cause changes in the immune system. A year with significant Arctic ozone depletion would result in perhaps a 10 per cent decrease in the amount of ozone above the UK in the spring; this is the same as the average decrease in ozone that has already occurred over the UK since the end of the 1970s.</p>

The 1995 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that increased coral bleaching will occur as a result of an increase in average global atmospheric temperature.

	<p pid="a.81.5/1">In a 1996 report on a before and after study of traffic calming measures in selected 20 mph zone schemes that had been commissioned by my department, the Transport Research Laboratory said it had found that child pedestrian and child cyclist accidents had fallen by 70 and 48 per cent respectively overall. Local authorities have carried out many 20 mph schemes since then and have not required my department's prior approval to the speed limit since the powers were delegated last year. No national estimate has been made of the number of child deaths and injuries that have been saved as a result of such schemes but my department is convinced of their value. It therefore plans to allocate over &pound;3 million for local authorities to spend on 20 mph zone schemes in the current financial year, in addition to their existing programmes of measures to help reduce child road casualties.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.2/1">The Chief Medical Officer has not formed a task force to study Munchausen's syndrome by proxy. However, the Griffith's review (Review of the Research Framework in the North Staffordshire NHS Trust) recommended that the Department of Health convene an expert and inter-disciplinary panel to review methods of identification of children who have either had illnesses induced or fabricated by their carer, including the use of covert video surveillance, within the framework of the Government's interagency guidance for child protection Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999). In response to this recommendation, which the Government accepted, a steering group has been formed to develop draft guidance. It is intended that this guidance will be put out for public consultation in spring 2001 with a view to publishing the final document in summer 2001. External members of the steering group include representatives from professional associations covering nursing, paediatrics, social services, psychiatry, police and professions allied to medicine. The panel is chaired by a senior official from the Department of Health.</p>
