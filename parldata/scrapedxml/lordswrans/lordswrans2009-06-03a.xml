	<p pid="a.85.2/1">Returning officers are responsible for sending out postal ballot packs to service personnel after the close of nominations when the identities of candidates are known and the ballot papers can be printed. In practice, this works out to be 11 working days before polling day for European, local and general elections. I understand that in accordance with the Electoral Commission's guidance on the issuing of postal votes, returning officers prioritise the issuing of postal ballot packs to service personnel and overseas voters.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">We are aware that there can be potential difficulties in relation to returning officers being able to send postal ballot packs to service personnel and receive them back within this timescale and keep the position under review. In particular there could be difficulties getting post to those who maybe away from base or those who move location at short notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">The Ministry of Defence is also working closely with the Electoral Commission to ensure that service personnel have all the information they need so that, if they want to vote, they can. This includes advising service personnel that they can vote by proxy if they have any concerns about the practicability of voting by post.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.8/1">The department does not have data on the total number of United Kingdom residents that were treated in the Channels Islands under the bilateral healthcare agreement. One of the reasons the UK gave notice on the agreement was due to a lack of robust data underpinning the business case. Due to a perceived imbalance in the number of visitors being treated by both parties, under the agreement the UK provided the Channel Islands with an allocation to fund clinical referrals to the UK. This allocation totalled around &pound;11 million over the past three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.5/1">Through its global political agreement (GPA), the inclusive government have committed themselves to a package of reforms that will restore security and welfare to Zimbabwe's people and promote respect for human rights and the rule of law. Several aspects of the GPA remain to be implemented. We will support the Government in their continuing efforts to achieve these reforms, offering any assistance that promotes and strengthens positive change. We are in regular contact with the new Government to discuss how this can best be achieved, and we maintain a close dialogue on this with our EU and other partners. Civil society in Zimbabwe remains strong and has an important role in monitoring progress on reform, holding the Government to account. We continue to support civil society with advice and with significant levels of funding.</p>
