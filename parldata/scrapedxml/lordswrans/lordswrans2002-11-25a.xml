<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-11-25a.17.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="17"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo021125/text/21125w01.htm#21125w01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.17.8/1">The House of Lords has made decisions today in two cases that deal with the arrangements for the sentencing of adults convicted of murder. These judgments concern matters of fundamental significance for the criminal justice system and the role of Parliament and Ministers in formulating policy on the provision of adequate punishment for the quality and the protection of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/2">In the case of Pyrah and Lichniak, the House of Lords has confirmed that the mandatory life sentence of murder is compatible with the rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. This sentence will remain in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/3">The case of Anderson deals with the Home Secretary's power to set the tariff or minimum period a convicted murderer must remain in custody until he becomes eligible for release. This power has ensured ministerial accountability to Parliament within the criminal justice system for the punishment imposed for the most heinous and serious of crimes. When Parliament took its decision to abolish the death penalty for murder, this was the framework with which it was replaced. The House of Lords has not ruled that the Home Secretary's power is unlawful. All existing tariffs therefore stand. The House of Lords has declared instead that the Home Secretary's power to set tariffs for those convicted of murder is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The existing law and tariffs set according to it therefore remain until new legislation is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/4">The judgment will affect only the issue of who sets the tariff in each case. As is proper in a democracy, Parliament will continue to retain the paramount role of setting a clear framework within which the minimum period to be served will be established. The Government determined that there should continue to be accountability to Parliament for these most critical decisions. This is fundamental to our democracy and to the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/5">We need to study the judgment carefully before finalising our proposals, but we intend to legislate this Session to establish a clear set of principles within which the courts will fix tariffs in the future. These principles will be debated and agreed by both Houses of Parliament, and in setting a tariff, the judge will be required, in open court, to give reasons if the term being imposed departs from those principles. The Attorney-General already has powers in relation to unduly lenient sentences and it will be open to him to challenge any tariff which he does not consider to be consistent with these principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/6">These principles will set a framework within which judicial discretion, which is an essential feature of sentencing, will operate. They will be robust and comprehensive. We envisage that they will comprise a statement of the major guiding principles followed by a series of clear messages about the tariffs Parliament expects to be imposed for different categories of murder. The principles will provide entry points for particular categories of murder, which would be adjusted up or down in line with specified aggravating and mitigating factors. The principles will set out that for the most serious crimes&mdash;such as the sexual, sadistic murder of children&mdash;life should mean life. The principles will incorporate the same aggravating factors upon which previous Home Secretaries and the present one have based our decisions. These factors will include murder committed in the course of armed robbery or the murder of prison or police officers in the course of their duty as set out to Parliament by Leon Brittan in 1983. In the case of existing tariffs, these arrangements will ensure that any judicial reconsideration is on the basis of this same set of principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.8/7">We believe that coupled with the new arrangements for the determination of release of mandatory life prisoners by the Parole Board, under which the Home Secretary will have an opportunity to make representations on the impact of any future offending by the prisoner concerned, the provisions outlined will amount to a sensible and secure scheme for the management of life sentences generally. The new scheme will be compatible with our human rights obligations and will also ensure that Parliament has established the framework for dealing with the most dangerous and evil people in our society.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.2/1">The United Kingdom (UK) Government are seeking to deploy a variety of detection technologies to screen UK-bound freight at key European feeder ports and are currently installing equipment in Calais. The Immigration Service uses several types of equipment to detect clandestine entrants concealed in freight vehicles, each having its own particular strengths and weaknesses in terms of speed of use and effectiveness. By deploying a variety of technologies, including heartbeat detectors, passive millimetric wave imagers and CO <sup>2</sup> detectors, backed up by visual searches, search teams will be able to screen vehicles with the technology most suited to the type and level of traffic using the port while avoiding excessive delays to embarking vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">The effectiveness of the technology will depend to a large extent on the skills of the search teams using the equipment, but full training will be provided by the UK Government and the results will be evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">Controlled operational trials have confirmed that the technology and search systems that the Immigration Service is introducing are effective in detecting clandestine entrants. However, we have not reached the stage where we can be confident of detecting 100 per cent of people concealed in lorries. The checks being introduced are intended to supplement security measures adopted by vehicle drivers and port operators, not replace them.</p>

It is, however, the responsibility of local authorities to take action in response to flooding. They can call on the emergency services, and in some cases the Armed Forces, for assistance where appropriate. During the period of the recent 48-hour national firemen's strike, Green Goddess fire engines manned by the Armed Forces could have replicated assistance normally provided by fire brigades to the local authorities had it been required to save life. There was no requirement for the Armed Forces to hire pumping equipment because the Green Goddesses are equipped with capable pumps.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.2/1">The Government very much welcome the development of farmers markets and the benefits they bring and recognise the important role the National Association of Farmers' Markets (NAFM) plays in publicising markets and assuring standards. The Countryside Agency has supported NAFM with funding of &pound;110,000, which covered administrative and staffing start-up costs. We will continue to support NAFM where we can, but further core funding would fall foul of state aid rules which require such funding to be time-limited and degressive.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/2">The Countryside Agency is funding a business plan review for NAFM and is working closely with the organisation to put together a future funding strategy. There are also project funds available under the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) and the Agricultural Development Scheme (ADS). Both schemes are competitive and therefore offer no guarantee that a NAFM application would be successful, but they do offer the chance of continuing financial support, which would be compatible with state aid rules. lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.25.5/1">UK state pensions are uprated for pensioners living in the former Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia under the bilateral social security agreement with that country which has been in force since 1958. Following the break up of the former Yugoslavia, the agreement has continued to be applied to the now separate independent republics: the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia-Montenegro); Bosnia-Herzegovina; Croatia; Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The agreement provides that where a person would be entitled to a benefit which is covered by the agreement while in or resident in one country, it shall be payable to that person while he or she is in or resident in the territory of the other. This would include any annual uprating of benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.5/2">The UK has a social security arrangement with Canada, which first came into operation in 1960. It is limited in scope and is not reciprocal. Its provisions are limited soley to helping people coming to the UK from Canada to qualify for UK benefits by allowing periods of residence in Canada to be treated as periods when UK contributions had been paid in claims for UK benefits made after arrival here. It does not allow for the payment of Canadian benefits to former Canadian residents living in the UK or to former UK residents now living in Canada.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.4/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.28.4/2" qnum="HL136">On whose recommendation passenger lifts at most surface railways stations were closed to passengers but still available to railway staff because of the strike by firefighters starting 13 November; what risk assessment was made of the dangers to life caused by a defective lift compared with a railway or road accident; and, if the lifts were considered unsafe for passengers without the immediate availability of national fire crews, whether the railway employers were complying with their duties under health and safety legislation by allowing their own staff to use the lifts.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.5/1">Some surface station operators closed lifts as part of their mitigation measures during the period of the fire brigades' strike. Any such decision is a matter for the station operating company as the health and safety dutyholder.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.5/2">A variety of risk assessments were completed by the rail industry prior to the strike, including considering the failure of station lifts. Railway safety assessments considered that the risk of ceasing rail operations and forcing rail traffic onto the roads would present a significantly greater risk than putting into place identified mitigation measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.5/3">Mitigation measures in relation to lifts included emergency procedures for manual winding of the lift and calling out lift engineers, staff accompanying passengers using lifts and restricting lift use. If a station operator decided to close its lifts to passengers but make them available to staff, it would have needed to have assessed the risks of this under normal employee health and safety legislation, but the Health and Safety Executive's HM Railway Inspectorate is not aware of widespread use of any such &quot;closed&quot; lifts by railway staff.</p>
