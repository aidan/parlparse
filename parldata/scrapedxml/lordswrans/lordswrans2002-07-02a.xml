	<p pid="a.19.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">26 June</phrase>, UN International Day in support of Victims of Torture, the FCO launched phase 3 of the UK Anti-Torture Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">During the first two phases of the UK Anti-Torture Initiative, launched in October 1998 and December 2000 by my right honourable friend the Member for Livingston, the UK combined a global lobbying campaign for universal ratification of the UN Convention against Torture (at the time ratified by just over 50 per cent of UN member states) with a number of practical measures, including the publication and distribution of 20,000 copies in seven languages of a handbook giving guidance on reporting instances of torture, financial support for the UN's work with torture victims and the secondment of a senior UK police officer to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">Phase 3 will combine continued global lobbying with new practical steps. Since December 1998, 13 more countries have ratified the UN CAT. Our target is to secure another five ratifications by the end of 2003, bringing the total to 134 or 70 per cent. We will also be lobbying with EU partners for the adoption of the draft optional protocol to the CAT. The protocol is intended to help prevent torture by allowing both UN and independent national teams the right to inspect places of detention in signatory countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/4">New practical measures for phase 3 will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/5" class="indent">a new publication on judicial safeguards to provide judiciary and law makers worldwide with examples of best practice regarding judicial control of torture;</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/6" class="indent">support for the African Commission on Human Rights Special Rapporteur on Prisons in particular her monitoring role of prison conditions with regard to the prevention of torture;</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/7" class="indent">establishment of a visiting programme to UK for senior clinicians who work in countries where the practice of torture is widespread for work placements with leading NGOs involved in torture rehabilitation; and the FCO will also continue to provide financial support of &pound;175,000 per year to the UN Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture which provides urgent medical and legal support worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/8">Phase 3 will be the last stage of activity. After this, to consolidate efforts of the past three years to combat torture, the FCO is planning to mainstream torture work within the FCO's general human rights mandate and set up a panel of experts to advise on future strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">26 June</phrase>, the Privy Council made the Consular Fees Order 2002, which sets out the new fees for UK visas with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">17 June</phrase> Members in the other place approved the draft Section 102 order, made under the Finance (No 2) Act 1987, following a debate in the Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation on <phrase class="date" code="">11 June</phrase>. The Section 102 order provides the legal authority for the visa fee increase by allowing past deficits incurred in the costs of running the entry clearance operation to be taken into account when setting visa fees and for the cross-subsidisation of the costs of different entry clearance services.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/3">Most visa fees will go up by between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. The main increases are:</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/4" class="indent">Standard visit visa: up 9 per cent from &pound;33 to &pound;36.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/5" class="indent">The single entry visa has ceased to exist since the introduction in October 2000 of visas of leave to enter. The new standard visa for multiple entries valid for six months at &pound;36 is cheaper than the old six-month multiple-entry visa, which provided the same level of service at a cost of &pound;45.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/6" class="indent">Five-year multiple-entry visa: up 10 per cent from &pound;80 to &pound;88.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/7" class="indent">Settlement visa: up 8 per cent from &pound;240 to &pound;260.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/8" class="indent">In addition, the long-term non-settlement visa fee will increase by 50 per cent from &pound;50 to &pound;75.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/9">A new 10-year multiple entry visa priced at &pound;150 is also being introduced for the first time. There is growing demand for this kind of visa. Its introduction will provide an enhanced service to regular travellers to the UK, without compromising the integrity of the immigration control.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/10">The Consular Fees Order setting new visa fees is being made not only to cover current costs but also to recover past deficits of visa fees (from April 2000), caused by the increased cost of the entry clearance operation world-wide. It is intended that these increases will return the entry clearance operation to a self-financing basis by 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/11">We recognise that these fee increases will be unwelcome. However, we must make sure that the full cost of providing a visa service is covered by visa fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/12">To put these increases into context:</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/13" class="indent">These would be the first fee increase for visitor's visas since 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/14" class="indent">The proposed increases still keep UK visas within their service delivery agreement commitment not to increase visa fees in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/15" class="indent">The standard visit visa at &pound;36 is still cheaper than the old six-month multiple entry visa which provided the same level of service at a cost of &pound;45.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/16" class="indent">Applicants now get more for their money. Since October 2000, the standard visit visa has not only allowed people to visit the UK on multiple occasions during the validity of their leave to enter; they also benefit from an enhanced and speedier immigration process on arrival.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.5/17">UK visas is undertaking a range of measures to reduce costs and increase productivity. But these alone will not be sufficient to recover the deficit. The increases will enable UKvisas not only to recover past deficits but also to cover the increased costs of the provision of visa services.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">The Airwave service is being provided under contract by mmO2 Limited, which has to date provided the infrastructure needed to deliver the service to six forces in England and Wales. These forces are, with their migration status shown in brackets: Lancashire (complete), Greater Manchester (restarting in July 2002), North Yorkshire (complete), West Mercia (started <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-12">12 March 2002</phrase>), Suffolk (started <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-13">13 May 2002</phrase>) and Leicestershire (due to start Summer 2002).</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">Forces migrate to the Airwave service from their existing systems on a staged basis once the infrastructure, purchasing of terminals and officer training have all been completed. The Airwave contract defines this starting point as being the ready for service (RFS) date.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/3">Once a force has passed its RFS date, migration usually takes place on a division-by-division basis and can last several months.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/4">In view of the demanding requirements and the state-of-the-art technology being used, it has generally taken longer to install and integrate the Airwave infrastructure and equipment than was originally hoped. However, once the system has been optimised, it has been found to meet operational requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/5">Airwave provides substantial benefits compared to the existing analogue systems, including improved officer safety through an emergency button, secure encryption of all voice and data traffic, improved coverage, good quality clear speech, reduced interference and access to a comprehensive range of data services.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">The RAND report on acquisition options for the Type 45 destroyer has now been published. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">RAND is a very experienced and influential organisation and has been conducting analyses of military shipbuilding, the industrial base and competition issues for two decades. The Ministry of Defence commissioned RAND last year to carry out an independent study into a range of alternative procurement strategies for our future warship programme over the next 15 to 20 years, with particular reference to options for Type 45 destroyers. This followed receipt of an unsolicited bid from BAES Marine proposing that it should build all 12 ships planned for the Class. This differed from the Type 45 shipbuilding procurement strategy at that time, which envisaged Vosper Thornycroft building one of the first batch of three ships and competing with BAES Marine for later batches.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">Initial results from the study were used to help inform the MoD's decision to proceed with a revised procurement strategy for the Type 45, in which each of the two shipbuilders, BAES Marine and Vosper Thornycroft, will be allocated modules (or blocks) of the ship to build. The revised strategy was announced by my Right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-10">10 July 2001</phrase> (Official Report, col 675&ndash;85) in another place.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/4">RAND's analysis indicated that there would be roughly an even chance that competitive production of the Type 45 by two shipbuilders would yield about the same overall cost as sole-source production. Noting that a competitive strategy could lead to one shipbuilder building most of the ships, RAND also investigated alternative strategies to direct work to each of the two shipbuilders to keep both involved in building warships.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/5">The RAND results also suggested that, for strategies that directed Type 45 work to a number of shipyards, allocation of blocks is more cost effective that the allocation of whole ships because the workforce increase productivity as it gains experience of building the same blocks. Such a strategy will also have the advantage of keeping both shipbuilders in the Type 45 progamme and potentially available to compete for future warship programmes. In addition, the revised strategy is likely to provide better value for money in the longer term than the unsolicited proposal, if it enables competition to be pursued on other warship programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/6">Following the Type 45 decision, RAND continued its study, taking a broader look at the foreseeable balance of demand and supply in the warship building sector an the potential effects of different procurement approaches. The report does not make specific recommendations concerning procurement strategies for future programmes, although it has helped clarify issues regarding block production (which is likely to be employed for the future carrier). It also provides an indication of the size of workforce that will be required to sustain the future programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/7">RAND's work has already helped the MoD to arrive at a pragmatic solution for the Type 45. The report will also provide a valuable source of information for further study of the warship building sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.2/1">A joint Royal Navy/Warship Support Agency study team has recently completed a wide-ranging review of the base porting arrangements for Royal Navy warships and Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and the infrastructure required to support them. Their recommendations have been endorsed by Ministers and will be implemented subject to trade union consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/2">The three existing naval bases at Portsmouth, Devonport and Clyde are able to provide sufficient capacity to support the ships and submarines that are in service, on order or planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/3">The future aircraft carrier, the CVF, will be based at HM Naval Base Portsmouth. While it should be possible to berth two CVFs in Portsmouth simultaneously, for military reasons this may not be desirable. Options are therefore being considered to make use of an occasional stand-by berth for the high-readiness CVF. Further work on the design, operating patterns and manning are needed before a final decision can be made, although initial indications show that Southampton could provide such a facility if required:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/4">As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase> (WA 13), the batches one and two of Astute class submarines will be based at HM Naval Base Clyde, and the Trafalgar class will remain at Devonport.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/5">With regard to the remainder of the fleet, the T45 destroyers will progressively replace the T42 destroyers based at Portsmouth. The two new amphibious ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, will join HMS Ocean at Devonport, creating an amphibious shipping centre of expertise. The current arrangements for the Vanguard class nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines, frigates, survey ships and minor war vessels work well and will not be changed.</p>
