	<p pid="a.59.2/2">I have been asked by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to reply to your parliamentary Question about the arrangements made for cleaning horse manure from the cycle-ways and footpaths of the Royal Parks because this is an operational matter for which the agency is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/3">We use mechanical road sweepers to clean the cycle-ways and footpaths in the Royal Parks, as we do on the roads, because this is the most efficient method of cleaning them. However, in order to deploy our resources most efficiently, the frequency with which we clean any particular path or cycle-way depends on how heavily it is used.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.2/4">We only arrange for a mechanical sweeper to follow the mounted troops involved in the guard changes in St James's Park. This is because the roads in the park are particularly heavily used and because we know the timing of the troop movements. In other parks, horses are generally confined to the horse rides. The only horses that use the footpaths and cycle ways are the Royal Parks Constabulary mounted officers. Because they do not patrol regular routes at regular times we cannot arrange for contractors to clean up behind them in the same way, even if it were cost-effective to do so. We cannot legislate for those riders who occasionally use the roads and paths instead of the horse rides.</p>

A new more controlled regime to access such data is being introduced through Chapter II of Part I of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA).</p>

Agreements are in place between CSPs and law enforcement agencies that provide for cost recovery where a CSP is called upon to provide communications data. The agreements have been reached independently of the Government and take account of the fact that a requirement to provide communications data places operational and financial burdens on the CSP.</p>

It recommends that the committee should react flexibly to requirements and developments in the field of standards in public life.
