	<p pid="a.47.2/1">Over 27 years of civil war in Angola have made the systematic monitoring of HIV prevalence extremely difficult. With the arrival of peace in April 2002, the Angolan Government are now in the process of developing a national HIV/AIDS strategy which will include, among other things, a monitoring system. UNAIDS estimates that the current prevalence of HIV infection among adults (aged between 15 and 49 years) is about 5.5 per cent and rising.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.2/2">Global surveillance of HIV/AIDS is a joint effort of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the joint programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), in close collaboration with national AIDS programmes and a number of other partners. DfID supports WHO and UNAIDS both financially and through collaborative efforts to scale up co-ordinated and effective responses to HIV/AIDS.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.5/1">Until recently discussions between the international community and the Government of Angola on an effective public health strategy to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS have been limited. Although Angola developed its first national AIDS strategy in 1999, it was never effectively implemented. It was following the peace agreement in April 2002 that both the Government and donors began to focus greater attention on HIV. In November 2002, a National AIDS Commission, headed by President dos Santos, was established. The Ministry of Health, supported by UNAIDS, UNICEF and UNDP, has been tasked with preparing a national HIV/AIDS strategy, known as the Programa Estrategico Nacional (PEN). This process has only just begun and there has been no indication as to when it might be completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.5/2">Last year a country co-ordinating mechanism (CCM), comprising representatives from government, donors, multilateral agencies and NGOs, was set up to prepare an integrated proposal for support from the UN Global Fund for HIV/AIDS. However, the CCM failed to reach consensus on the details of the proposal and the deadline lapsed. Continued lack of agreement may prevent the CCM from submitting a revised proposal before the new <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase> deadline. In the meantime most bilateral donors continue to channel funding for HIV/AIDS prevention through UN agencies and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.5/3">DfID is currently consulting with key partners (UNAIDS, World Bank, USAID) with a view to better supporting an effective national response.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.2/1">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget that, with effect from midnight last night, this relief is extended to all non-residential property in qualifying areas. This represents a major boost not only to businesses investing in commercial premises but to the 2000 enterprise areas in which this relief is available, along with a wider package of measures which will ensure that these areas now benefit from investment which is long overdue. Individual home-buyers will continue to benefit from the relief on residential property where the consideration does not exceed &pound;150,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.2/2">The extension of the relief to all non-residential property was subject to approval as state aid, which the European Commission has given until the renewal of the relevant guidelines in 2006. This does not preclude the Government from applying for approval to continue beyond 2006. Any such decision will be taken on the basis of evaluation of the effectiveness of the measure in promoting the regeneration of the most deprived areas of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.5/4">The development of the proposals in the Government's White Paper Civil Registration: Vital Change published in January 2002, took full account of the impact of civil registration reform on the needs of society, families and individuals. The system of civil registration will continue to play a vital role in securing and protecting basic human rights by continuing to provide a child with a name and status in society and evidence of parentage. It will also continue to uphold the rights of individuals to access information about themselves and their families. The General Register Office, those commentating on the White Paper and those involved in earlier consultation have not identified any detrimental effects of these changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">Hilary Benn announced today a change to the home detention curfew (HDC) scheme that will provide earlier resettlement opportunities for lower risk offenders and help to deal with the pressures on the prison population.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/2">A draft order has been tabled under Section 34A(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (as amended) to change the requisite period that a prisoner must spend in custody before becoming eligible for HDC. This will mean that the maximum period a prisoner may spend on HDC will rise from the present three months to four-and-a-half months, according to sentence length. Since all prisoners must spend at least 25 per cent of their sentence in custody, this will mean no change in the maximum curfew length for prisoners serving between three months and under 12 months. Prisoners serving 18 months and over will be eligible for the maximum four-and-a-half month curfew period. Prisoners serving four years or more are not eligible for HDC. The order will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-14">14 July 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/3">Eligible prisoners who are assessed as suitable for HDC, and who have not already been released by the time the order comes into force, will be released in phases between <phrase class="date" code="">14 July</phrase> and the end of August if their new HDC eligibility dates fall prior to <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/4">It is extremely important to maintain public confidence in the HDC Scheme. So, at the same time as increasing the maximum curfew period, we will set a presumption that prisoners convicted of certain serious offences will not be suitable for release unless exceptional circumstances exist. Offences involving the death of the victim, attempted murder or threats to kill, serious offences involving the possession of firearms or offensive weapons, child cruelty and all racially aggravated offences will be subject to this presumption. This will also apply to prisoners convicted of any sexual offence who are not already statutorily barred from HDC.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/5">As at present, governors will release prisoners on HDC only if they pass a risk assessment and following a satisfactory home circumstances report. Public safety is of paramount importance and offenders will be released on HDC only where it is safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/6">Under the HDC scheme prisoners serve the remainder of their custody period at home under electronic curfew, usually from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. The scheme provides prisoners with a smoother and more effective re-integration into the community, enabling prisoners to be released from prison early while remaining subject to significant restrictions on their liberty.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.2/7">At any one time this measure will increase the number of prisoners serving the latter part of their sentence on an electronic tag by up to 1,000 prisoners. No further changes to the scheme are planned but, as always, the scheme will be kept under close review.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.5/1">The Ministry of Defence, with the generous support of the Royal Mail Group, plans to introduce a free postal service to Armed Forces personnel currently serving in the Gulf.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/2">From <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 17 April</phrase>, families will be able to post letters and packets of up to 2 kilograms in weight free of charge to BFPO addresses in the Gulf. Priority will be given to the delivery of letters, &quot;blueys&quot; and &quot;e-blueys&quot;, which are the primary means of communication for families. Packets will be delivered to the troops as soon as is practicable depending on the operational situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/3">This service is designed for close family and friends. Packets can only be accepted addressed to named individual service personnel. We would urge families to limit the number of packets they send so that the system works for everybody and does not become overloaded. Those who wish to show more general support to the Armed Forces serving in the Gulf should not use the system and we would encourage them instead to contribute to the UK Armed Forces Gulf Fund (details available at <a href="http://www.ukforcesgulffund.org">www.ukforcesgulffund.org</a> and 0800 107 0200).</p>
	<p pid="a.53.5/4">We are working very hard to implement the new system and need to put mechanisms in place to handle the expected increase in mail. We hope that families will be patient in the interim period, since we still need to get essential stores and equipment to the Gulf to support the front line.</p>
