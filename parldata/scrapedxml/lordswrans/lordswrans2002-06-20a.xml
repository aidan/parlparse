	<p pid="a.94.2/1">Since July 2000, the British High Commission has been running its sterling post account using the parallel rate of exchange and charging for some of its consular and visa services using the parallel rate. It has held charges for other consular and visa services at the official rate. Initially, the two rates were broadly similar. But since February 2001 the parallel rate has diverged increasingly from the official rate and the Zimbabwe dollar is now trading on the parallel market at around 10 times the official sterling rate of exchange. In financial year 2001&ndash;02, this resulted in an under-recovery by the FCO of around &pound;422,000 in consular fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">In order to regularise the position and avoid any future shortfalls in recovery, the British High Commission will charge for all consular and visa services at the parallel exchange rate with effect from midnight on 23/<phrase class="date" code="2002-06-24">24 June</phrase>.</p>

For example, this means that an interception takes place where an electronic mail message stored on a web-based service provider is accessed so that its contents are made available to someone other than the sender or intended recipient. Access to a stored communication by the exercise of a statutory power (e.g. under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) for the purpose of obtaining information or taking possession of a document or other property is also lawful by virtue of Section 1(5) (c) of the Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/1">We welcome the large number of comments on the agency's draft maps for part of the South East and the lower North West of England, which show the high level of public engagement in the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/2">The purpose of the draft map is to invite comments on whether land is correctly shown on the map as open country or registered common land. While a number of different suggestions have been made, Ministers have looked at the agency's approach and agree with the agency's view that the inclusion of other information, such as existing rights of access or restrictions on access under Ministry of Defence by-laws, would distract people from considering whether the land is correctly shown on the draft map. For example, land managers might fail to object to the classification of land as open country because military by-laws already restrict access. They would then have no further opportunity to object to its classification if the by-laws were subsequently revoked and the land were opened to access.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/3">The agency expects to draw up advisory maps which will show open country and registered common land in the context of other useful information, such as known substantial areas of excepted land, land subject to long-term restrictions and exclusions and land with existing rights of access which will help people to interpret the information shown on conclusive maps.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.0/4">The agency will look at the criteria for mapping open country (which are set out in its mapping methodology) as it proceeds with assessing the comments made to it on the draft maps for the lead mapping regions, including comments similar to those made by the noble Baroness. Any amendments to the criteria will be reflected in the provisional maps for these two regions and in the draft maps issued for subsequent regions.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.2/1">It is the Government's policy to encourage partnership between the maintained and independent education sectors. Through our independent/state schools partnership scheme we provide grants which foster a range of partnership activities between schools in both sectors, including partnerships which use shared sports facilities. Partnerships help to build bridges between the sectors and encourage schools to explore collaboration across a wide range of activities. We know that many independent schools have taken the decision to share facilities with maintained schools. We applaud these arrangements and hope that independent schools will reflect on their success and consider whether they could be extended. The Government's Plan for Sport, published in Spring 2001, acknowledges the independent/state school partnership scheme and the part that the independent sector can play in improving the provision of PE and school sport in all our schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.5/1">The Government's aim is to ensure that the limited spectrum available is distributed so as to satisfy as many viewers/listeners as possible and to avoid giving one religion an unfair advantage over another so that everyone's beliefs are equally respected. The Government's position is set out in the document The draft Communications Bill&mdash; The Policy which states that, where there is sufficient spectrum availability, restrictions on religious bodies holding licences will be removed (paragraph 9.3.3).</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/2">A local radio multiplex licence is the licence to operate a multiplex through which local digital radio stations are transmitted. In most areas there is only one local digital radio multiplex for independent local radio and the maximum number in London is three. Under these circumstances we have concluded that there is insufficient spectrum to allow local radio multiplex licences to be held by religious bodies. For clarification, however, the Bill does lift the prohibition on religious ownership of a local digital sound programme licence, which is the licence to operate a local digital radio station.</p>
