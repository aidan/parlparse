	<p pid="a.199.0/1">We see no reason why the provisions in Clause 113, which relate only to statutory schemes under the Bill, should inhibit voluntary agreements between local authorities and bus operators. My department has regular discussions with the Office of Fair Trading on competition issues affecting the bus industry, in particular stressing the importance attached by the industry to receiving appropriate guidance from OFT. For its part, the department is currently preparing good practice guidance on quality partnership arrangements, based on current experience around the country; we hope to issue that later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.3/1">Territorial, Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve Associations are now known as Reserve Forces' Cadets' Associations (RFCA) to better reflect their role. We can confirm that the implementation of the organisational improvements and efficiencies sought in the Strategic Defence Review is now complete--well ahead of the original schedule.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/2">No changes were made to the organisational arrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the administrative areas for which associations in England have responsibility now match those of the Government Office (GO) regional areas. To achieve this, the South East RFCA and the Eastern Wessex RFCA administrative areas, minus Dorset, have been amalgamated to reflect the South East GO region. Its responsibility extends to the Channel Islands also. It will be known as the South East RFCA, with a headquarters at Seeley House, Shoe Lane, Aldershot. The responsibility for carrying out the Eastern Wessex Association's functions for Dorset moves to the Wessex RFCA, whose administrative area will now reflect that of the South West GO region.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/3">These arrangements will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-01">1 October 2000</phrase>, following the laying of the Defence Council's Reserve Forces Act 1996 (Reserve Associations) Order 2000. They are reflected in minor amendments to the RFCA Regulations, details of which will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. We have also agreed with the RFCAs revised or amended Schemes of Association. Following consultation with their trade union representatives, arrangements for those association employees opting for redundancy have been agreed. These are broadly in line with civil service arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.2/1">The Independent Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, chaired by Dr Jeremy Lucke, has published its fourth annual report. The committee was set up in 1996 specifically to keep under review the care and welfare arrangements of animals used in defence research. We are placing a copy of the report in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/2">The use of animals in defence research is concerned with providing the Armed Forces with safe and effective protection against hazards encountered while conducting their duties, and is kept to the absolute minimum.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/3">The committee's report highlights the work being done by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency to ensure the welfare of all animals used for defence research purposes. The report provides assurances that all animals used in defence research programmes in the UK are regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The report also concludes that there is an effective ethical review process for the application of new licences which examines, amongst other issues, whether the use of animals can be avoided altogether in any new research procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/4">The Ministry of Defence continues to seek to find alternatives to the use of animals wherever possible. There is still much to be done in developing technologies that allow the use of animals in experiments to be further reduced. We welcome continuing scrutiny by the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee and aim to minimise the use of animals as far as possible, against the continuing requirement to research effective measures to counter the hazards faced by the Armed Forces in the conduct of their duties.</p>
