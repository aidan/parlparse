Contracts are made at national level only where there are clear and demonstrable benefits from aggregating demand, achieving economies of scale (undertaking work once-only on behalf of the whole of the NHS) and managing markets of strategic importance. Where the most appropriate levels of contracting have been agreed with NHS trusts, there would be a clear expectation that commitment is given to using these contracts to achieve best value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.6/1">What is referred to as the employment gap has been described in different ways. One approach expresses the number of persons in a particular group in employment as a percentage of all of persons in that group who are of working age. The latter includes both economically active and economically inactive persons. The report of the Task Force on Employability and Long-Term Unemployment (Department for Employment and Learning, December 2002) employs this approach and includes associated targets to reduce differences between groups. Relevant statistics from the Labour Force Survey are noted in the following table.</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.130.6/4"> <td></td> <td>% of Protestants of working age who are in employment</td> <td>% of Catholics of working age who are in employment</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.130.6/10">Source: Labour Force Survey Religion Report 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.6/11">Another approach is to compare a group's percentage share of the total economically active population with its percentage share of all persons in employment, the difference between the two also being referred to as the employment gap. Statistics from the Labour Force Survey are also available to show the extent to which Protestants and Roman Catholics are over-represented or under-represented in employment relative to their proportions among the economically active.</p>

A number of items have been sent for forensic examination and at this stage it is too early to provide details as to the origin and age of the weapons, timer power units and the other items seized. The police have stated that they believe the Provisional IRA was responsible. Two persons have been charged in connection with this incident and police inquiries are continuing.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.3/1">With the agreement of the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Transport, I wish to make an announcement concerning the Lord Chancellor's panel of independent inspectors. This follows informal consultations with relevant parties. From today I have asked the Planning Inspectorate Executive Agency to take on full responsibility for arranging for suitable inspectors to carry out public inquiries into proposed road schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/2">The Lord Chancellor has nominated inspectors for road scheme inquiries since acceptance of a recommendation in the 1978 White Paper on the handling of the 1970s roads programme. The Planning Inspectorate was established as an executive agency in 1992, bringing with it the high standards of impartiality, openness and fairness that are a hallmark of the work of the inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/3">The Planning Inspectorate has established a deserved reputation for the independent and impartial way it conducts inquiries. That is rightly regarded as key to the process of public participation at inquiry stage, which the Government recognise and value. I therefore have every confidence in asking the agency to take on the task of arranging for suitable inspectors to carry out road inquiries. And that confidence will, I know, be shared by all holding an informed view of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/4">The Planning Inspectorate places great importance on employing inspectors with an appropriate range of technical skills. Over the last few years it has recruited as inspectors a number of highly qualified and experienced men and women. Their expertise now covers a wide area, including planning, the environment, architecture, engineering, housing and transport issues. Such high quality recruitment is a continuing feature of the agency's profile.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/5">This change will provide greater flexibility for the Planning Inspectorate to manage resources more effectively, enabling it to deliver an enhanced service, while maintaining and improving quality.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.0/16">The Highways Agency underspent on its conventional expenditure programme (equivalent to the old cash expenditure) by &pound;24 million, in line with its forecasts.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.0/17">However, some technical accounting classification issues emerged in the first year of full resource accounting and the consequences of these came to light only after the end of the financial year. Regrettably this was too late for the department to seek proper parliamentary approval for the expenditure. As a consequence, this produced a resource overspend and a capital underspend against the voted provision within the departmental expenditure limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.0/18">More significantly, within the annually managed expenditure (which covers resource accounting and budgeting non-cash items such as depreciation and write downs) the Highways Agency failed to budget correctly for the depreciation of bridges and structures, for the write-downs required on opening new roads and for the creation of some provisions for future maintenance. These led to the overall overspend of &pound;314 million.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-04-02a.138.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100395" speakername="Lord Macdonald of Tradeston" colon=":" colnum="138"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030402/text/30402w03.htm#30402w03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.138.8/1">The transport segment of the Transport, Energy and Telecommunications Council was held in Brussels on 27&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Minister for Transport represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/2">The Council reached a general approach on a proposal further to accelerate the phase-out of single hull tankers and to ban the carriage of heavy grades of oil in such ships sailing to and from EU ports. The regulation will apply to all ships calling at or leaving Community ports and to all ships carrying Community flags anywhere in the world. The final date for phase-out of single-hull tankers is 2010, with an exemption until 2015 for certain vessels under specified conditions. A Presidency compromise date of 2008 was agreed for the coming into effect of a ban on carriage of heavy oil in tankers below 5,000 tonnes deadweight. The definition of heavy oils was agreed as those having a density at 15oC higher than 900kg/m <sup>3</sup> . We would have preferred a transitional period of 2010, and a definition of 950kg/m <sup>3</sup> , but these compromises are acceptable to the UK, so, together with other member states, we were able to support them as part of an overall package.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/3">The Commission presented its proposed directive on ship-source pollution and the introduction of sanctions, including criminal sanctions, for pollution offences. The Presidency concluded that the Council would return to the matter in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/4">The Council agreed a general approach on a directive to streamline the assessment of minimum vocational training standards for seafarers. The UK supports the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/5">The Commission outlined the content of its Communication on Maritime Security, which is expected shortly. It will include a draft regulation on security for ships and ports in the EU, implementing existing IMO obligations, and set out the Commission's future strategy including a directive on port zones and staff security in the second half of the year. The Presidency hoped that the Council would be able to take decisions on these issues at its June meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/6">Under AOB, Belgium and France urged action by member states to support an unlimited liability system in respect of oil spills arising from recklessness by ship owners and charterers. This went beyond the Commission's original proposal. Council had previously agreed that the proposed Supplementary Fund to the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPC) regime, to be adopted at the May 2003 IMO Conference, should have a limit of up to E1 billion. The Commission noted that, if the IMO failed to adopt this supplementary fund, the EU should adopt its own regime before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/7">Also under AOB, the Council discussed a paper for IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee in July, tabled jointly by France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the UK, proposing the creation of particularly sensitive sea areas (PSSAs) around our coasts. The proposal requires further work on points of detail, but there was support in the debate. The Commission stressed the need for consistency with the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/8">The Commission presented a progress report on the EU satellite navigation project, Galileo, and outlined the state of play on negotiations with third countries. A Commission mandate for negotiations with China about its involvement in the project was agreed on the condition that security arrangements would be the same as for Russia and the US. The Presidency looked forward to conclusions on integrating the existing EU EGNOS system in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/9">The second rail package, which includes measures to complete market opening for rail freight, promote interoperability and safety and establish a European Rail Authority, was agreed. The package brings forward full liberalisation of international freight from <phrase class="date" code="">15 March 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase> and requires liberalisation of domestic rail freight markets by <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/10">The Commission presented its proposal to improve safety in road tunnels following disasters in alpine tunnels in recent years. The directive will apply to all tunnels over 500m long on the trans-European road network and will stipulate technical changes, safety instructions for users and different management procedures. At least seven tunnels in the UK would be within scope. My right honourable friend expressed concerns about the costs and benefits of the proposal, which are shared by a number of member states, and about the potential adverse impact on traffic flow.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/11">The Council confirmed the common position it had reached at the special session held on <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase> last on extension of the ecopoints scheme for limiting alpine lorry transit traffic. In doing so the Council rejected the amendments proposed by the European Parliament in its first reading on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-12">12 February 2003</phrase>, which could result in a difficult conciliation. The issue is not one in which the UK has a substantive interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/12">On aviation issues, the Council debated the Commission's request for a mandate to allow the Commission to negotiate air service agreements with the US. Most member states were willing to give the Commission a mandate, but ony in return for greater certainty over future arrangements for the negotiation and implementation of bilateral agreements with third countries in light of the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice. The Presidency concluded that work would continue with a view to reaching agreement in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/13">The Council was asked whether it supported the broad aims of the Commission's proposed regulation on unfair pricing practices by third countries and where it could be improved to facilitate agreement at the next Transport Council. The Commission's proposal would allow Community measures to be applied to non-EU airlines found to be using state aid to price unfairly. Most member states agreed with the broad principles of the proposal but had specific concerns on the detail. The Presidency invited COREPER to consider the issues and submit a text to Council in June for common position.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/14">There was a unanimous political agreement on the proposal to improve safety standards of third country airlines operating to and from Community airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/15">Following discussion over lunch, the Presidency reported general support for the Commission's view that state assistance for European airlines during the conflict in Iraq should be limited and proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.8/16">No formal votes were taken at this Council.</p>
