	<p pid="a.93.5/1">There is a longstanding concession, outside the Immigration Rules, enabling overseas employers coming to the United Kingdom to bring their domestic workers with them, if they need to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/2">Changes to the conditions under which overseas domestic workers could be admitted to the United Kingdom were laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-23">23 July 1998</phrase>. The primary objective of those changes was to deal with concerns about reports of abuse suffered by such workers. Responding to those concerns while minimising scope for immigration abuse presented a difficult balance. We therefore undertook at the time to review the changes in the light of operational experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/3">Following this review, a number of changes are being made with effect from today which we shall include in the Immigration Rules at a suitable opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/4">In response to concerns raised by the employers of domestic workers, the level of duties needing to be performed by the worker will no longer have to exceed those set down in the International Labour Organisation's International Standard Classfication of Occupations.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/5">We remain concerned at reports of abuse of domestic workers accompanying their employers to the United Kingdom and have discussed with Kalayaan, the organisation that represents overseas domestic workers, how this can be prevented. We have decided to continue allowing domestic workers to change employer but will be asking any that do so to inform the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in writing, outlining their reasons for doing so, at the earliest opportunity. This will enable officials to monitor any possible abuse of the concession by either individuals or employers and, if detected, liaise with other departments to ascertain whether any action could be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/6">We are also clarifying what is meant in the concession by the meaning of &quot;household&quot;. Some United Kingdom-based employers have long argued that, although they reside here, they maintain a household abroad and therefore domestic workers currently working in their overseas residence should qualify under this concession. We will make clear that a domestic worker wishing to come to the United Kingdom is expected to have been carrying out domestic duties under the same roof as their employer for 12 months before applying for entry clearance, or in a household that the employer uses for himself on a regular basis and where there is clear evidence of a connection between employer and employee. The domestic worker will also be expected to travel to the United Kingdom with their employer, their employer's spouse or minor child.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.5/7">This definition should make it clear that the concession is not intended to allow employers who are resident here to recruit domestic workers from overseas. It will also benefit those employers who regularly divide their time between two houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.2/1">There has been extensive research into the reasons for women's under-representation in politics and the Government are currently considering whether they need to commission further work. The most recent study was published by the Equal Opportunities Commission in August 2001, entitled Women in Parliament: a comparative analysis. This concluded that the use of positive measures was the decisive factor in determining levels of women's representation. The Fawcett Society has also been working on a project studying the experiences of women in parliamentary selections. Interim findings note that experience in the UK and elsewhere in Europe indicates that it is only through the use of positive action mechanisms that women's representation can be significantly increased. Copies of the EOC document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.5/1">The Government are aware of a variety of methods used by other member states to increase the representation of women in parliament. Both the Constitution Unit at University College London and the Equal Opportunities Commission have produced work that highlights methods. The Minister for Transport, Local Government and the Regions has today introduced legislation so that the principle of reducing inequality in the numbers of men and women elected within political parties may be applied in the UK just as it is in many other member states. Many parties in countries such as Sweden, Germany and France use some form of positive action. Due to different electoral systems, examples of good practice cannot always be applied directly, and it will be for the political parties to choose what practices, if any, they wish to use.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.2/1">The Government are aware that women's representation in both the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament is significantly higher than in the House of Commons because of positive measures used in these elections by certain political parties. The Government have introduced legislation today in the other place to enable parties to use positive measures to seek to reduce inequality between numbers of men and women elected to all legislatures and councils in the UK and to the European Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/1">The Minister for Transport, Local Government and the Regions announced legislation to reduce the inequality in the numbers of women and men elected in the other place today. The Bill proposes to exclude from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 positive measures political parties may take to reduce inequality in the numbers of men and women elected when selecting candidates. Equivalent amendments will be made to the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, which covers Northern Ireland. The elections covered will be those to Westminster, to devolved bodies, to local government in the UK and to the European Parliament. The legislation will be permissive and enable parties to use positive measures to reduce inequality in the representation of women and men within that party in an elected body; political parties are therefore free to determine their own targets and monitor progress.</p>
