	<p pid="a.66.2/1">The photographing of passengers by Gatwick Airport is undertaken for immigration purposes and is not a requirement under the national aviation security programme. Gatwick introduced this requirement as a method for immigration control because departing domestic and international passengers are permitted to mix at the airport.

	<p pid="a.66.5/1">All criminal justice agencies are parties to a national agreement issued by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform in January 2007, which is designed to ensure that suitably qualified interpreters and translatorsare used wherever possible.

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">Criminal history checks for potential and existing approved driving instructors (ADIs) were introduced as independent verification of statements made during the application process to become registered or to renew registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/2">Prior to the introduction of these checks, the ADI registrar relied on self-declaration of criminal history to assess whether a person satisfied the statutory requirement to be &quot;fit and proper&quot;. The information coming to light during the checks allows for more informed decisions to be made to help better to protect the public, particularly the young and vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/3">The level of risk posed by driving examiners is lower than that from ADIs. DSA driving examiners are not regularly involved in caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children or vulnerable adults. Their contact with individuals tends to be a one-off, unlike ADIs who could have frequent and regular one-to-one contact while a person is learning to drive. As DSA employees, driving examiners are also subject to regular checks and supervision. Nevertheless, the DSA is considering the legislative framework under which it might seek criminal history disclosures for driving examiners.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">The Government do not collect information centrally on schools' compliance with their duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The department has received representations in relation to St Leonard's Church of England primary school which are being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/2">The discrimination duties schools have under Part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 mean that they must not discriminate against prospective disabled pupils in their admissions arrangements and should make reasonable adjustments to their admissions policies and procedures so that prospective disabled pupils are not disadvantaged by the school's admission arrangements. They should also make reasonable adjustments to the education and associated services they provide as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/3">However, the duty which schools have to make reasonable adjustments for pupils and prospective pupils excludes the need to remove or alter physical features. Instead, schools are under a duty to plan strategically to increase their accessibility, over time, including making improvements to the accessibility of school buildings. Schools fulfil this planning duty by producing an accessibility plan and implementing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/4">However, as the planning duties are duties to bring about general improvements over time, such as improving the physical environment of the school, the duties do not oblige a school necessarily to remove and alter specific physical features by any specific point in time during the overall period. This means that a school which is meeting its commitments under the planning duties might not always be able to admit every disabled child requiring alterations to the physical environment of the school unless it is possible to make reasonable adjustments that fall short of physical alterations.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/5">To support schools in meeting their responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Department for Education and Skills has published a training resource for schools and local authorities: <I>Implementing the Disability Discrimination Act in schools and early years settings</I>. This includes a tool to help them to develop, review and revise their accessibility plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/6">Under Section 28M of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), if the Secretary of State is satisfied that a responsible body has acted, or is proposing to act, unreasonably in the discharge of its duties under the relevant sections of the DDA (the preparation, resourcing, implementation and review of the accessibility plan), or has failed to discharge those duties, he may give that body such directions as to the discharge of the duty as appear to him to be expedient.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/7">Local education appeals panels consider claims of discrimination in relation to admissions to, and permanent exclusions from, local authority maintained schools. The Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal (SENDIST) hears all other claims about schools under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/8">More resources are going into schools to support children with SEN and disabilities&mdash;some &pound;4.5 billion in 2006-07. Total revenue funding for schools has increased nationally by &pound;1,440 per pupil in real terms since 1997. In addition, substantial funding has also been delegated to local authorities (LAs) through the schools access initiative&mdash;some &pound;620 million up to 2007-08. The grant element for voluntary aided schools is delivered through the locally co-ordinated VA programme. It is up to each local authority to decide its priority schemes within the criteria of support. All schools receive a devolved formula capital grant and it is for the governing body to decide its priorities (which can include access requirements) for spending that grant.</p>
