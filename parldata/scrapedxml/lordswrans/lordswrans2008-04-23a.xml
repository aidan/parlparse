Examples of progress include the training of police and law enforcement officers by the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC), increasing public awareness with the Blue Blindfold campaign, the establishment of an advice line for professionals likely to come into contact with child victims and the introduction of service level agreements with women's aid projects that expands available accommodation for victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation to other parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.2/1">For a polygamous marriage to be considered valid in the UK, the parties must be domiciled in a country where polygamous marriage is permitted, and must have entered into the marriage in that country. Provided the parties follow the necessary requirements under the law of the country in question, the marriage would be recognised in England and Wales. The law is drafted thus because the Government have no desire forcibly to sever relationships that have been lawfully contracted in other jurisdictions. This should not, however, be construed as government approval of polygamous marriage. The Government do not support polygamous marriage and support the law that prohibits parties from contracting polygamous marriages in this jurisdiction.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.5/3">Staffing requirements for all ports, including Heathrow, are calculated using a workforce planning methodology which takes into account information provided by port operators on scheduling, predicted passenger loads and nationalities, and estimates of transaction times. Staff are also re-deployed according to where the risk is highest.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.5/4">We have carried out a critical review of how our resources are deployed in order to achieve better value for money and identify efficiencies. This has ensured that warranted staff are deployed only on operational work and that non operational work is undertaken by non-warranted officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.5/5">Since March 2005 we have significantly increased the number of operational grades deployed nationally&mdash;by 35 per cent, in fact. This comprises inspectors, chief immigration officers, immigration officers and assistant immigration officers. The number of staff employed at specific ports will vary from day to day. Likewise, there are seasonal variations in line with passenger pressures and peak holiday periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.5/6">BIA is committed to increasing the use of automated technology to facilitate passengers through arrivals controls without compromising border security. An example is the IRIS immigration recognition system (IRIS). IRIS enrolment stations and gates are available at all four Heathrow terminals and to both Gatwick terminals. Two gates will be available at the new Heathrow terminal 5. As at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-07">7 March</phrase>, 181,460 people had enrolled on IRIS and 909,028 crossings had taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.5/7">A snapshot of operational grades at Heathrow on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-16">16 October 2007</phrase> shows figures of 849 and 829 immigration officers respectively. Recruitment is ongoing to further increase this number, with a total of 385 additional operational staff being recruited across Border Control.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.2/1">Canals in England are used for a broad range of activities, ranging from tourism to freight and water supply. The majority are, however, used predominantly for leisure and tourist activities such as boating, walking, cycling and angling and make an important contribution to tourism in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) takes its role of providing consular support to British nationals overseas seriously and their safety is our top priority. As with many other British diplomatic missions across the world, our embassy in Harare holds a civil contingency plan. The Zimbabwe contingency plan focuses on assisting the departure of British nationals from Zimbabwe by non-military means and is reviewed and updated on a regular basis. At present, we do not anticipate an assisted departure or evacuation, but we will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our plans accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.5/2">The FCO travel advice for Zimbabwe is under constant review. We are currently advising against all but essential travel to the whole country. We are also advising British nationals in Zimbabwe to avoid specific areas and to have their own contingency plan for how they would leave at short notice. A full copy of the travel advice can be found at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/travel/zimbabwe">www.fco.gov.uk/travel/zimbabwe</a>. If the situation in Zimbabwe deteriorates further, we will reflect this in our travel advice and provide appropriate guidance. To ensure that we can effectively communicate this information, British nationals in Zimbabwe are urged to register with our embassy in Harare.</p>
