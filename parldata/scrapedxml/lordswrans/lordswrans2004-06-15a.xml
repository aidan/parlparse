	<p pid="a.60.5/1">During the passage of the Freedom of Information Act, Ministers made the following commitments about the percentage of the costs of providing information payable by members of the public:</p>

	<p pid="a.60.5/3" class="indent">At the Lords Report stage of the Bill, the Home Office Minister made a similar statement: &quot;The Government have published their draft fees regulations.

	<p pid="a.60.5/9" class="indent">The then Home Secretary, Jack Straw, told MPs: &quot;The cost of complying with a request is the cost of locating information, plus disbursements, but authorities may charge only up to 10 per cent of those marginal costs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.5/10" class="indent">Lord Bach, speaking for the Government, told Peers during the Lords Report stage: &quot;The regulations will provide that the greater part of the costs of disclosing information under the Bill will be met by the public purse . . .

	<p pid="a.65.0/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase> pharmacists have been permitted to supply levonorgestrel 0.75mg to women aged 16 and over for use as an emergency contraceptive (the &quot;morning-after&quot; pill). There are no plans to review the decision which allows the supply of emergency contraception under these circumstances as there is no new evidence relevant to the criteria in the UK for Prescription Only Medicine status.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-07">7 May 2004</phrase>, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it had issued a &quot;not approvable&quot; letter in relation to a proposal to make a product for emergency contraception available without prescription in the United States (US). The letter also outlined the additional information that would be required to gain approval to market the product. In particular, the FDA was concerned about the lack of data concerning the use of the product among adolescents younger than 16 years old. In the US, unlike pharmacy availability in the UK, supply without a prescription is comparable to supply without the supervision either of a doctor or a pharmacist.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/3">The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) keeps the safety of all medicines under review. The MHRA will continue to monitor the safety of levonorgestrel 0.75mg and will review any potential safety issues in the light of any new evidence which may emerge.</p>

Alternative format copies can generally be made available within four to five working days and within a maximum of 10 working days of receipt of a request. Where departments can forecast a demand for copies in advance they are produced at the same time. Simultaneous publication online of government documents has allowed greater manipulation and has provided more flexible options for the visually impaired.</p>
