The department, therefore, approved the recruitment of 75 inspectors in October 2010. Furthermore, since February, the department has relaxed the recruitment controls for the CQC, and the hiring of inspectors is now the direct responsibility of the CQC.

	<p pid="a.301.2/1">Castlebeck is a provider of both care homes and independent hospitals. Before the new registration system under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 was implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October 2010</phrase>, these providers were subject to different regulations and requirements. Annual quality assurance assessments (AQAAs) were a requirement of care homes under the Care Standards Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.2/2">The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has advised that Castlebeck returned an AQAA a day late in October 2009. This was the only occasion the CQC is aware of where Castlebeck breached the guidance on producing an AQAA. The CQC decided that taking action against the provider would be disproportionate in this instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.2/3">Castlebeck hospital facilities were not required to submit AQAAs. Independent hospitals were required to complete an annual self-assessment.

	<p pid="a.301.5/2">The requirement to undertake a minimum of two inspections per year stopped on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, when new regulations under the Care Standards Act 2000 came into force. These regulations required:</p>

	<p pid="a.301.5/4">Whilst minimum inspection frequencies were set in regulations until the new registration system under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 was brought in, the Care Quality Commission (and its predecessors CSCI and the Healthcare Commission ) took a risk-based approach, carrying out more frequent inspections of poor services or where concerns identified possible risks.</p>
