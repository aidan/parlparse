	<p pid="a.81.0/1">Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are based on the Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act 1965 and reciprocal legislation in the Republic of Ireland. The European Commission's recent proposals for a European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between member states and the Government's proposals published in The Law on Extradition: A Review are similar to the backing of warrants arrangements between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. We do not believe that any of the provisions of existing extradition arrangements with the Republic of Ireland are inappropriate, but the mutual recognition agenda agreed at the Tampere Special European Council in 1999 has given rise to fresh thinking on concepts like dual criminality, specialty and the political offence bar to extradition. Some of the traditional bars to extradition, which appear in our reciprocal legislation with Ireland, have been relaxed or removed in the European Commission proposals.</p>

We have recently launched a leaflet that provides basic factual information for UK travellers on the transition to euro notes and coins in the relevant countries. Copies of the leaflet have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.2/2">The leaflet is a joint production with HMT and DTI. It will supplement the information already available on the FCO website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>).</p>

It is one of several sources of information the Inland Revenue has published about these provisions. The leaflet makes appropriate cross-references to these other sources where the information they provide may be of additional help. The other sources of information specific to this legislation include a section of the Inland Revenue website, at <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/ir35">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/ir35</a>; a dedicated helpline on 0845 303 3535; and a free opinions service as to whether a specific engagement is subject to the legislation.</p>

The Act also empowers authorities to require operators to participate in joint ticketing schemes, as well as enabling them to step in to provide proper passenger information, at the operators' expense, if existing arrangements are inadequate. We have also strengthened the powers of the traffic commissioners by making their financial penalty regime more flexible. We have introduced statutory requirements to ensure all new buses are fully accessible and have provided a major boost to capital investment through our funding of local transport plans. We have also provided &pound;46 million over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04 for our new Urban Bus Challenge competition The results of the first of the annual challenge competitions were announced on <phrase class="date" code="">2 November</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.93.3/1">The only formal meeting with my noble friend Lord Haskins in his capacity as Rural Recovery Co-ordinator during October took place on <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase> and involved officials of the department and of some of the regional development agencies. My noble friend Lord Haskins briefed Ministers on the progress of his work informally on several occasions during that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.3/2">It should be remembered that the main focus of his work was to look at the problems being encountered by the Cumbrian economy as a result of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. His work involved communicating with Ministers about aspects of that situation and his report is a summary of his conclusions at the end of his period of work.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/2" qnum="HL1007">Further to the announcement made by Michael Meacher, Minister for the Environment, that they will &quot;examine how best we can combat illegal logging, including export and procurement practices&quot;, and &quot;implement a progressive programme of work to improve current purchasing practice for timber and timber products&quot; (HC Deb, 28 July 2000, col. 947W), what action has been taken to fulfil this undertaking.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">Central government departments and their agencies have been instructed to actively seek to purchase their timber from sustainable and legal sources and to report their activities to Green Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">An interdepartmental working group is monitoring progress made by departments. This group recently commissioned a scoping study to examine the scale of timber purchases across central government and will produce guidance on verifying claims made by supplies for the source of their timber products. The Government have promoted their timber procurement policy to the wider public sector at conferences and seminars.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/3">At an international level, our focus has been on forest governance and corruption; these issues often impede the utilisation of forest resources and sustainable development. The UK was instrumental in organising a ministerial conference in Indonesia this year to address forest law enforcement and governance in East Asia. This produced the real prospect of bilateral agreements to secure more effective controls. A similar conference is planned to address the same issues in Africa next year.</p>
