	<p pid="a.207.2/1">From the information held centrally it is not possible to produce a reliable estimate of the impact that sentencing for the breach of ASBOs has had on the prison population.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/2">This is because proceedings for breach of an ASBO are often heard at the same time as proceedings for other offences. This may lead to defendants receiving a custodial sentence for breaching an ASBO concurrently with a custodial sentence for another offence. The Office for Criminal Justice Reform has separate disposal codes to differentiate between concurrent and consecutive sentences, but the distinction between them is unreliable.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.5/1">The department published a microgeneration strategy in March 2006. It contains actions to tackle some of the barriers preventing development of a sustainable market for microgeneration technologies and progress is underway on implementing all of these actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/2">Our key policies include:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/3">the &pound;86 million low carbon buildings programme, aiming to demonstrate the use of microgeneration technologies, and to introduce economies of scale in the industry, thereby reducing costs. Further grants are administered at the local level and by the devolved authorities;introduction of reduced VAT rates of 5 per cent for the installation of most microgeneration technologies; andcertification: the objectives of this are to assess the technical performance and safety requirements of components and systems. It is important to ensure safety for consumers, given the liabilities involved, and to build consumer confidence in microgeneration technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/4">The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 will give the powers to the Secretary of State from August 2007 to require energy suppliers to acquire electricity from microgeneration units. As announced in the Energy White Paper, all six major energy suppliers have now committed to publishing easily accessible export tariffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.5/5">Microgenerators of electricity are also eligible for renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) for every MW of renewable electricity generated. The microgeneration strategy outlines steps to make ROCs more accessible to microgenerators. Since April 2007, small generators can appoint an agent to act on their behalf for all the processes involved under the RO. The Government have also removed the need to have sale and buyback agreements to claim ROCs for electricity which they consume themselves.</p>

There will be times when it is necessary for a meeting of a Select Committee to be held at short notice and a meeting booked in the name of a Member moved to another venue in order to accommodate this. In this situation, the attendants do their utmost to provide the earliest possible notice and to provide the Member with an equivalent facility.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">The EC regulation on mobile roaming, while introducing average wholesale price caps that must be met by operators when they procure roaming capacity from one another, does not introduce absolute caps or fix prices in the retail market. Instead it introduces a tariff that has to be offered to all roaming customers (the Euro tariff) with maximum rates for incoming and outgoing calls made.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">The use of Article 95 as the legal base for this regulation is unlikely to set an unhelpful precedent which would allow the EU to fix prices. This is because of what the measure is actually trying to achieve and the distinct nature of the international mobile roaming market.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">The Government will continue carefully to consider on a case by case basis the suitability of Article 95 as a legal base for other EC proposals.</p>
