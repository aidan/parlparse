	<p pid="b.53.3/1">We welcome the Amnesty International report on children associated with armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the attention it draws to this important issue. Some progress has taken place since the Amnesty International report was compiled. Out of an estimated 30,000 children associated with armed forces, 19,054 had been demobilised when Amnesty International compiled its data (<phrase class="date" code="">31 June 06</phrase>). The figure is now 27,346 (<phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>). Demobilisation is ongoing, although at a very slow rate. Amnesty is right to demand more from the Congolese Government. We continue to push for the total demobilisation of all child soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.3/2">The UK has given &pound;15 million over five years to the World Bank-led multi-country demobilisation and reintegration programme (MDRP), covering DRC and neighbouring countries. We have also given &pound;3 million to the 2006 International Committee of the Red Cross appeal for DRC, which includes programmes for protection and reintegration of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.3/3">The disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) process in DRC is far from finished, and we agree with Amnesty International that there is much more work to be done to complete the complicated and sensitive task of fully reintegrating children. This is particularly so for girls linked with armed groups. We are talking to the World Bank about how to ensure that the DRC's national DDR body&mdash;CONADER&mdash;and international and national implementing organisations that specialise in this area continue to receive appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.3/4">Amnesty's report calls for the removal of school fees in DRC to ensure that opportunities for education are available to all, including vulnerable groups such as demobilised children. DfID is currently discussing a major project with the World Bank to increase access to primary education in DRC by helping to reduce these fees.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.2/1">The Government are incentivising the production and use of biofuels through a 20p per litre duty rate cut for biodiesel and bioethanol which has been extended to 2008-09. This has led to a growth in the sales of biofuel, and figures from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs give a total of around 21 million litres sold in July this year. This suggests a likely market share of around 0.5 per cent of road fuels for 2006, doubling that of 2005, produced from a variety of feedstocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/2">To further develop the supply of biofuels, a renewable transport fuel obligation will be introduced in April 2008 which will require 5 per cent of fuel sold in the UK to come from a renewable source by 2010. A number of companies are building biofuel processing plants in the United Kingdom which will use UK-grown crops, such as oilseed rape, sugar beet and wheat, as a feedstock. Farmers can claim the single payment for biofuel crops grown on set-aside land or where the &euro;45 per hectare energy aid payment is claimed for crops on non-set-aside land.</p>

Similarly at Harmondsworth and Yarl's Wood, if a written confirmation of a Medical Foundation is produced before the initial decision is made, claimants are released from detention and the DFT process.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.6/1">According to reports by the World Health Organisation (WHO) the percentage of underweight children in Gaza aged between nine and 12 months rose from 4.5 per cent in June to 5.6 per cent in August. Over the same period in Gaza, anaemia in children rose from 52 per cent to 70.5 per cent. In the West Bank, although August figures are not available, the percentage of underweight children aged between nought and 24 months rose from 3.4 per cent in January to 4.2 per cent in June. Anaemia in children rose from 43.9 per cent to 49.4 per cent over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.6/2">The European Union-led temporary international mechanism (TIM) is helping to alleviate the difficulties faced by many Palestinian families in Gaza and the West Bank. So far, around 40,000 vulnerable Palestinians identified as needing social hardship support have benefited from cash payments. The TIM is being expanded to provide cash payments to an additional 50,000 Palestinians, identified by the World Food Programme as in need of food aid. In addition, the lowest paid public sector workers have also received payments through the TIM, including 11,900 health workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.6/3">DfID is providing up to &pound;12 million to the TIM, of which &pound;9 million has been committed to specific programmes, including cash payments for poor Palestinians. DfID also made a contribution of &pound;15 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in April to support its vital role providing social support and other essential services to Palestinian refugees.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.6/4">However, aid alone cannot eliminate the suffering in the occupied Palestinian territory. The only way that life for the majority of Palestinians will improve is through progress towards peace with Israel. We hope that Hamas will commit to the quartet principles in order for the peace process to resume.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July 2006</phrase>, a fire occurred at the Iron Mountain storage facility at Twelvetrees Crescent in London. The Medical Research Council (MRC) head office and a number of MRC units use Iron Mountain to store inactive files and material off-site. Twelvetrees Crescent is one of a number of Iron Mountain's storage facilities used by the MRC and only a fairly small proportion of the MRC's records were stored there.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.5/2">The MRC lost records that had been created at its head office, the MRC prion unit, and the MRC national survey of health and development (NSHD). The head office records were a mixture of policy, administration, grant and transaction files. The records from the MRC prion unit contained the results of scientific research work conducted at a biological services facility that was closed down several years ago. The MRC NSHD material consisted of all the paper copies of information collected in 1989, paper copies from seven of the 13 data collections in the women's health study, and all the paper copies of data collected between birth (1946) and 1972 for 42 study members.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.5/3">Some of the head office records were of relatively short-term significance: these would have been routinely destroyed in future by applying internal records management procedures. Others would have been kept for longer periods and their loss now is an inconvenience to the business: it will be necessary to reconstruct some information (such as formal correspondence trails for a number of patent files) from other sources. A smaller number of records were of archival value and would have been transferred to the National Archives.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.5/4">The impact on the MRC prion unit of the loss of scientific research records is currently uncertain. Access has been lost to the MRC NSHD original questionnaires, although the primary data collected had been digitised. Consequently, new data cannot now be created from original sources and qualitative data cannot now be used.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.5/5">No specific project has currently been delayed or abandoned. However, for the MRC NSHD, two existing projects may be restricted by the loss of original material.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.5/6">MRC head office administrative costs have amounted to approximately &pound;5,000, and the cost of reconstructing correspondence trails and other paperwork is estimated at a further several thousand pounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.5/7">Neither the MRC prion unit or the NSHD have incurred direct financial costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.0/1">The UK welcomes this report which aims to raise awareness about childhood deaths caused by pneumonia and the actions required to prevent it.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/2">Pneumonia causes almost 20 per cent of under-five mortality worldwide, which is more than 2 million child deaths each year. This is more than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/3">Effective actions, such as awareness in recognising the signs of the disease and subsequent treatment with antibiotics to reduce these deaths are available but reach fewer than 20 per cent of children in need. Scaling-up treatment coverage is possible and at a relatively low cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/4">Child health is a priority for the UK but maternal, newborn and child health are linked and must be addressed together. There is global consensus that improving women's health and status is essential to reducing child mortality. This link is key to the UK's strategy in health.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/5">However, there is no one single &quot;quick win&quot; to making progress to achieving millennium development goal 4&mdash;reducing child mortality. Global efforts to prevent child deaths increasingly recognise the need for a fully functioning health service. A central requirement to this is a long-term and significantly increased financial commitment to countries to enable governments to address systemic challenges, including the human resource crisis, as well as providing drugs and vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/6">In 2005 at Gleneagles, the G8 and other donors pledged historic increases in their aid budgets to provide an extra $50 billion a year by 2010 with half of this going to Africa. In May this year, African heads of state set out their own plans to tackle AIDS, TB and Malaria and to improve basic health services. They called for the support of the international community, including long-term funding commitments, to help them plan for the long term. The UK is working with other donors to make sure they get this support.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/7">DfID's own recent White Paper recognises this and we are committed to providing 50 per cent of our direct support to developing countries' plans to improve basic services: education, health&mdash;including HIV and AIDS&mdash;water and sanitation and social protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/8">DfID is a major supporter of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) which seeks to ensure that all children are vaccinated. We are also promoting an advance market commitment (AMC) to develop a pneumococcal vaccine suitable for developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/9">DfID also contributes to the core work of the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) (&pound;19 million) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) (&pound;12.5 million).</p>

	<p pid="b.69.0/1">The period offenders spend on licence and subject to probation supervision is an integral part of their sentence. Conditions are placed on the offenders' licence in order to assist the probation service in managing the risk they may present to the community. The expectation is that offenders will comply with all conditions. If they fail to do so, they will be liable to recall. There are no plans to remove this liability, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the sentence and for public confidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.69.3/1">Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the courts. The Government have, however, developed the women's offending reduction programme, which was launched in 2004 and which focuses on improving community based services and interventions to ensure they are appropriate for women and to support greater use of community sentences for those who do not need to be held in custody. The drugs intervention programme and the Department of Health's women's mental health strategy support this work by ensuring that drug and mental health services in the community are appropriate and effective for women offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/2">We are also investing &pound;9.15 million in two projects to demonstrate how an integrated multi-agency approach in the community can be more effective at tackling the multiple needs of women offenders and avoid the use of custody. Baroness Jean Corston's review of women with particular vulnerabilities in the criminal justice system is due to report to Ministers in December and may suggest further action that could be taken to prevent women with vulnerabilities ending up in prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.3/1">We have no current plans to increase the fixed penalty level for contravening a weight restriction imposed by a local traffic regulation order under the relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. However, the penalty levels associated with all fixed penalty offences are kept under continual review by the fixed penalty procedures working group, with representatives from relevant government departments and criminal justice agencies. Where a driver is detected committing a fixed penalty offence the police will be guided by the principles of proportionality in applying the law. There is no automatic penalty for contravening a weight restriction imposed by a local traffic regulation order. Where an offending driver is detected the police will decide what action to take in the particular case. At present, offending drivers detected by the police can be dealt with by way of fixed penalty if the police offer that option. This gives offenders the chance to discharge their liability to be convicted by the payment of &pound;30. The police have the discretion not to offer a fixed penalty, for example, if they regard the offence committed as too serious. In that event they report the case for prosecution in the courts. The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of up to &pound;1,000.</p>
