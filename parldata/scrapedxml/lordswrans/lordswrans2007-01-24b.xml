	<p pid="b.236.0/1">In the last Bangladesh parliamentary election in 2001, women candidates won just six of 300 general seats (2 per cent). In response to this situation, Parliament passed a Bill in November 2004 to reintroduce 45 additional reserved parliamentary seats for women.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.0/2">These reserved seats do not represent geographical constituencies; rather, new women MPs are selected by the elected MPs, with a proportionate distribution of the new seats among the parties represented in the House. This law is valid for 10 years. The introduction of the Bill was contested by several women's groups who campaigned for these seats to be directly elected and for the number of reserved seats to be increased. There are no reserved seats specifically for women from ethnic minorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.236.3/1">The Government believe that, where possible, payments of housing benefit and local housing allowance should be paid direct to tenants, as are most other benefits and tax credits. To support financial inclusion we want people to have their housing payments paid into a bank account and to set up a direct debit or standing order to pay the rent to their landlord. This has the advantage of being a safe and secure method of payment and provides certainty for landlords that rent will be paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.3/2">The Post Office card account was designed to be a very simple account with very limited functions. It does not have the facility for the account holder to set up direct debit or standing order payments and is therefore unsuitable to receive payments of housing benefit or local housing allowance.</p>

I cannot anticipate the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review at this stage, either for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as a whole or for the British Library specifically.

	<p pid="b.237.5/3">Where ongoing unsatisfactory performance is identified, whatever the grade of the individual, departments and agencies are required to have procedures in place that should either result in a return to satisfactory performance or an exit from the service. The individual is informed of the areas were performance falls below the expected standards, what support they will receive to assist them to improve and the timeframe in which they will need to do so.

	<p pid="b.239.3/1">The witness statement provided by Sergeant Selman was excluded from evidence by the Judge Advocate. This ruling was in response to a submission by Sergeant Selman's counsel that the Royal Military Police had reasonable grounds by the time his statement was taken to suspect his involvement in an offence. That being so, he should have been treated as a suspect rather than a witness, and cautioned and interviewed under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The transcript of Sergeant Selman's interviews under caution was not excluded but the Judge Advocate ordered that those parts of the interview which related to the witness statement should be removed. Following this ruling the prosecution decided not to use the interviews of Sergeant Selman in evidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.6/1">It is normal practice to brief counsel who conducted the original trial to represent the Crown at any subsequent appeal hearing, unless it is clear from the grounds of appeal that the conduct of prosecution counsel was an issue. In this case the appeal was on two grounds: the first, based on new evidence about the complainant, which was conceded by the Crown; the second, based on non-disclosure by the Crown, which was not conceded by the Crown, and was not considered by the court.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.6/2">In view of the fact that counsel's judgment was in question and that this could have led to a conflict of interest, he should not have continued to be instructed on the appeal and new counsel should have been appointed by the Crown for the appeal.

	<p pid="b.240.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.5/2"><I>Letter to Lord Vinson from the National Statistician, dated January 2007.</I></p>
	<p pid="b.240.5/3">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking about the United Kingdom (UK) net contribution to European Union institutions and the UK deficit on trade in goods, services and income with the European Union. I am replying in her absence. (HL 1239)</p>
	<p pid="b.240.5/4">I have assumed that net contributions to the EU are equivalent to UK official transactions with European Union institutions. These, as included in the National Accounts, can be found in table 9.9 of the UK's <I>Balance of Payments Pink Book</I> (p. 149 of the 2006 edition), <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=1140">www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=1140</a>&amp;Pos=1&amp;ColRank=1&amp;Rank=272</p>
	<p pid="b.240.5/5">However, capital transfers are included in the total net contribution to the EU, outlined in the table detailed above, and I have assumed that these should be subtracted to calculate the net contribution on a current account basis. These capital transfers are UK receipts relating to the Agricultural Guarantee Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and other capital transfers from EU institutions. Data for 1997 to 2005 are available in table 9.9 of last year's Pink Book.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.5/6">Over the period 1997-2005 inclusive, the cumulative United Kingdom net contribution to European Union institutions, as I have defined above, is &pound;32.6 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.5/7">Data for the United Kingdom's goods, services and income balances with European Union member states can be found in Pink Book tables 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6 respectively (pages 135, 139 and 143 in the 2006 Pink Book). Please note that although the 10 accession countries joined the EU in 2001, I have calculated the cumulative deficits below with the 25 countries that were European Union member states in 2006. Please also note that prior to 1999, data are not available for some of the accession countries; consequently I have only calculated the cumulative deficits from 1999 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.5/8">Over the period 1999 to 2005 inclusive, the cumulative deficit on trade in goods, services and income with the EU 25 member states, excluding those with EU institutions and the European Central Bank, is &pound;80.1 billion. For the current account as a whole&mdash;that is additionally including current transfers&mdash; the cumulative deficit is &pound;80.7 billion.</p>
