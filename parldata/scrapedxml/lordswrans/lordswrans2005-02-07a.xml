There are various reasons why applications are not successful. In the case of the Community Fund's large grants programme around 5 per cent of applications fall outside the programme aims. In the case of Awards for All around 23 per cent of unsuccessful applications fail because other applications are given a higher priority for the limited funds available. Reasons for having a lower priority include a higher than average annual income or the applicant having already received one or more Awards for All grants.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.6/1">Kosovo will be a key issue for the international community in 2005. The UK's objective remains to find a solution to Kosovo's final status which will reinforce regional stability and be consistent with the principle of multi-ethnicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.6/2">The contact group will have a key role in monitoring and ensuring further progress against standards. It last met on 1 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February</phrase> in Pristina and further regular meetings are planned in the coming weeks and months in advance of the planned mid-2005 review of standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.6/3">Progress has been made on strengthening democracy, good governance and human rights in Kosovo. Elections in October 2004 were free and fair, despite the disappointing Kosovo-Serb turnout. Three new ministries have been formed to deal with local government administration, communities and returns and energy and mining. Progress has also been made towards launching pilot projects on decentralisation to ensure local government is devolved down to local communities. The security situation is much improved with a reduction in ethnically motivated violent incidents in the past nine months. We welcome the new sense of purpose and commitment shown by the Kosovo Government and look forward to further progress on standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.6/4">The UK Government have regular discussions with the Government of Serbia and Montenegro (SaM) on Kosovo. Most recently, during the visit of SaM President Svetozar Marovic and state union ministers to the UK, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister&mdash;together with my right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence and other Ministers&mdash;encouraged the Belgrade authorities to engage constructively with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the Provisional Institutes of Self-Government to help ensure Kosovo's immediate and long-term stability. We emphasised that the UK will work closely with all parties to help achieve a multi-ethnic solution to Kosovo's future status.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">Although three non-Muslim minorities (Armenians, Greeks and Jews) are recognised in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey does not formally recognise its minority communities under its constitution. Rather, the constitution is designed to afford the same protection, in terms of civil and political rights, to all its citizens&mdash;as citizens of Turkey.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">There is no single European model to guarantee the protection of minority rights in a member state. Some of our European partners, including Greece and France, adopt a similar approach&mdash;of non-recognition of minorities&mdash;as does Turkey.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">The UK will not, therefore, raise the need for recognition under the Turkish constitution of specific minority groups. Representatives of the Kurdish community in Turkey, including Leyla Zana, have made clear that they do not want to be recognised as a minority. We will, however, continue to urge the Turkish Government further to strengthen and protect the rights of all citizens of Turkey, including the three Lausanne minorities. We believe that any remaining concerns will be resolved during the accession negotiation process.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">The Turkish Government's programme of European Union (EU) harmonisation reforms has significantly extended the cultural rights of the Kurds in Turkey. The European Commission 2004 progress report acknowledges that &quot;despite the progress that has been made, there are still considerable restrictions on the exercise of cultural rights, including in the areas of broadcasting and education&quot;. The UK will continue to raise with the Turkish authorities the need for these restrictions to be lifted. We regularly discuss human rights issues including minority language education with our EU partners and the European Commission, and are confident that all remaining concerns will be resolved during accession negotiations.</p>

The Commission's 2004 progress report on Turkey notes that &quot;the major outstanding obstacles preventing IDPs from returning to their villages are the government sponsored village guard system; the problem of landmines; the absence of basic infrastructure; and the lack of capital and employment opportunities&quot;.

	<p pid="a.81.3/1">The current political parties law forbids the political use of languages other than Turkish in either written material or public speeches. Under this law charges have been brought against a number of individuals. The European Commission 2004 progress report on Turkey states that &quot;several provisions of the law fall short of European standards&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/2">The Turkish Government passed a new press law in June 2004 that is widely regarded as a great improvement on its predecessor. Significantly, it includes European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) provisions governing the freedom of the press, introduces fines where prison sentences had previously existed, and removes restrictions introduced after the 1980 coup. However, there are a few remaining concerns. The European Commission 2004 progress report on Turkey states that &quot;despite a decrease in sanctions in the new law, fines still constitute an excessive burden, especially on local media&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.3/3">We will continue to raise freedom of expression and freedom of the press with the Turkish Government. Affirmation in the Turkish constitution that international human rights agreements take precedence over domestic law now means that Turkey is bound to the provisions of Article 10 of the ECHR on freedom of expression.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.2/1">The European Commission is responsible for ensuring the full implementation of reforms in connection with European Union (EU) accession and will continue to report on this annually to the European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/2">The Turkish Government have set up a number of bodies and mechanisms to address the implementation of EU harmonisation reforms, including, in September 2003, the Reform Monitoring Group which played a key role in facilitating the start of private language education and broadcasting in Kurdish. As a result, implementation is improving, but more remains to be done to ensure the full and consistent application of the reforms passed. The UK will continue to urge the Turkish Government to do everything possible to improve implementation, and in support of their efforts, recently co-funded with the Ministry of Justice a programme to train over 8,000 judges and prosecutors in human rights and European law.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">The Government are concerned that there should be adequate housing provision in rural areas to meet the needs of local people. Planning policy guidance note 3 (Housing) advises that local planning authorities should make sufficient land available either within or adjoining existing villages to enable these local requirements to be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.2/2">Some local planning authorities have included policies in their plans aimed at restricting the occupancy and ownership of homes in rural areas. It is for local planning authorities in the first instance to frame and justify their plan policies. Such policies will be tested through the plan process in the light of the justification for the proposed policy, its likely effectiveness and any legal considerations. Once a plan has been subject to public consultation and an independent examination, before the plan can be adopted the local planning authority must give notice of its intention to adopt and the Secretary of State, my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister, has powers to intervene either by issuing a direction to modify or by calling in the proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.0/1">Since 1997, the Government have considered the issue of charities' irrecoverable VAT in two major reviews. We have decided that it would not be an affordable or efficient use of public resources to reimburse all 250,000 charitable bodies the VAT they incur; and also that there is no fair and principled basis on which we could decide that some charities would be reimbursed their VAT and some would not.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/2">Instead, we believe that help for charities is more effectively deployed through other government measures that are currently worth some &pound;3.3 billion per year to the voluntary and community sector, including tax reliefs worth some &pound;2.4 billion per year; including for example VAT reliefs for many goods and services that charities purchase in connection with their fundraising and recruitment, such as advertising, appeal letters and envelopes, collection boxes, and lapel stickers and similar tokens for the collection of donations.</p>
