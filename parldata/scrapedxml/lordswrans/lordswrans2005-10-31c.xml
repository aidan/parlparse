	<p pid="c.3.0/3">To date we have produced leaflets in partnership with the Portuguese, Polish and Lithuanian Governments and are still in talks with other governments. These benefited from input from the TUC, the CBI and other stakeholders and have been distributed widely in both the workers' home countries and the UK; for example, via citizens advice bureaux. In Poland, for example, they have been publicised on television and our embassy and the Polish authorities have worked hard to distribute them via job centres, recruitment fairs and other channels. The text of the leaflets is also available on the DTI website <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/migrant-workers.htm">www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/migrant&mdash;workers.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.6.5/1">Russia currently deploys strategic nuclear weapons in its land, sea and air-based systems. Russia has some 600 ground based inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), more than 200 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and about 700 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) in service, giving the capability to deliver over 3,500 warheads. Additionally, Russia could deploy between 3,500 and 5,500 non-strategic nuclear warheads. Under the terms of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) Russia is obliged to reduce the number of strategic warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by the end of 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/2">Despite the pending reductions in size of its strategic nuclear forces, brought about by economic constraints and treaty obligations, Russia continues to modernise its nuclear arsenal. For the land-based leg of its triad, it is currently deploying the new SS-27 (Topol M) ICBMs in silos; a road-mobile version of the SS-27 is due to be produced. Russian statements have indicated that some older missiles in the currently deployed ICBM force could remain in service until 2030. A new SLBM (Bulava) has recently been test-fired and will probably be deployed with a new class of submarine.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/3">China's strategic nuclear capability is its silo-based ICBM force, currently assessed as around 20 missiles strong. It also deploys larger numbers of nuclear-armed intermediate and medium range ballistic missiles, all of which are believed to carry single warheads.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/4">China is working on a range of new mobile nuclear delivery systems, a sea-based strategic missile, and potentially nuclear-capable ALCMs. The intention is to possess a strategic nuclear triad, enhancing the survivability and deterrent value of its strategic force.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/5">We do not make estimates of French nuclear capabilities. French nuclear policy has been set out by President Chirac, for instance in his speech of <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-08">8 June 2001</phrase> (available via <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/francais/interventions/discours-et-declarations/2001/juin/juin-2001">www.elysee.fr/elysee/francais/interventions/discours&ndash;et&ndash;declarations/2001/juin/juin&ndash;2001</a>.12666.html). Planned expenditures are set out in the draft Defence Programme Law for 2006, which is available via the French Ministry of Defence's website, at <a href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/sites/defense/base/breves/projet-de-loi-de-finances-pour-2006">www.defense.gouv.fr/sites/defense/base/breves/projet&ndash;de&ndash;loi&ndash;de&ndash;finances&ndash;pour&ndash;2006</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/6">The UK's nuclear weapons policy and posture was set out in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, which announced a reduction in our stockpile of operationally available nuclear warheads to fewer than 200 and confirmed that the single UK nuclear submarine on deterrent patrol would normally be at several day's notice to fire and has the capacity to carry up to 16 missiles. Decisions on the way forward for the UK's minimum nuclear deterrent capability are likely to be needed during the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>
