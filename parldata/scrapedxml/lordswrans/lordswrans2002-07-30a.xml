	<p pid="a.162.5/1">The Court of Auditors, through its annual report and special reports, plays a vital part in improving financial management in the EU. Details of recent measures and actions taken to improve financial management in the EU, including commentary on the 5 per cent error rate, are set out in the White Paper on European Community Finances published in July 2002: Statement on the 2002 EC Budget and Measures to Counter Fraud and Financial Mismanagement, Cm 5547. Actions by both the Commission's anti-fraud body, OLAF, and by member states to reduce irregularities are detailed in the Commission's report: Protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud (2001).</p>
	<p pid="a.162.5/2">The White Paper also sets out details on the introduction of activity based budgeting. This new budgeting system is designed to ensure that the allocation of EU funds is better linked to the pre-set political objectives and that the spending is properly monitored to ensure that the objectives are met. This should help to reduce waste as well as ensuring the moneys are spent for those activities for which they were appropriated.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.6/1">The Government's initial assessment of the implications for United Kingdom personnel of the Khamisiyah demolitions was published in December 1999 in a Ministry of Defence paper entitled: Review of events concerning 32 Field Hospital and the release of nerve agent arising from US demolition of Iraqi munitions at the Khamisiyah depot in March 1991.

	<p pid="a.166.0/1">The Ministry of Defence's Vaccines Interactions Research Programme is studying whether the combination of vaccines and tablets used to protect UK personnel during the Gulf conflict can give rise to adverse health effects. The results of the initial dose-ranging study were published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-21">21 January 2001</phrase>. The study did not report any remarkable findings with the combination of vaccines and pyridostigmine bromide pretreatment examined but helped to determine the appropriate vaccine doses for use in the subsequent study. The present study is using a small primate, the marmoset. The first two phases of the marmoset study found that the dose and panel of vaccines used in the dose-ranging study did not give rise to acute health consequences in the marmoset.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/2">An outline of the findings was presented at the Conference on Illnesses among Gulf War Veterans: A decade of scientific research in Washington DC in January 2001. Interim results from the third phase of the marmoset study will be submitted for presentation as a scientific poster to an appropriate conference later this year. This will report upon the effects of vaccines and pyridostigmine three months after administration. The majority of the practical work from the third phase of the marmoset study should be complete by August 2003. The study as a whole is expected to complete in December 2003 and cannot be speeded up because of the need to monitor the marmosets over a pre-determined period of time and to undertake key activities such as histopathology and statistical analyses. The final results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The timing of publication will be a matter for the journals' editors.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/3">The MoD hopes that results from related vaccines research work in mice being undertaken at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control will be available in the form of an abstract of work submitted for presentation at a conference in September 2002. The poster describing the marmoset work and the abstract of the mouse study will be available on the MoD's website (along with the published information to date) at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar">www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar</a>. High quality research cannot be hurried or skimped to meet any earlier deadline than we envisage.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.2/4">The Highways Agency had no closures over the past 12 months other than those for pre-planned works. However, we are aware of 4 occasions during that period when the A3 in the vicinity of the Devil's Punchbowl was closed by the police due to road accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/5" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-15">15 October 2001</phrase> the A3 was closed for 10- hours after a collision between an HGV travelling southbound and one travelling northbound. During the closure traffic was diverted by signing via the A325 and A31.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/6" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-02">2 April 2002</phrase> the A3 was closed for 12 hours after an HGV overturned and shed it's load. Traffic was diverted by signing through Thursley.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/7" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-14">14 May 2002</phrase> the A3 was closed for 1- hours after a car travelling southbound collided with a lorry travelling northbound. The police did not request a diversion.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/8" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-14">14 July 2002</phrase> the A3 was closed for 4- hours when a car travelling southbound collided with 2 vehicles travelling northbound. Northbound traffic was diverted via the A287 to Farnham and A31. However, we understand that the police varied this at one stage, directing traffic via the A287 to Haslemere. Southbound, light traffic was diverted by signing via side roads from Thursley towards Farnham, onto the A287 and back on the A3 at Hindhead. The police did not request a diversion route for HGV's.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/9">The responsibility for closing sections of a road or carriageway in the event of an accident rests with the police. The role of the Highways Agency and our Managing Agents is to provide assistance in setting and signing diversion routes or carrying out repairs to restore the road to a safe condition. The police have the power to vary the diversions at any time and there may of course be occasions when the police close a road without the Highways Agency's knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.2/10">I hope that this explains the position.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.5/1">The Strategic Rail Authority's freight strategy includes a framework for the development of premium logistics by rail. The premium freight market, including mail, is substantial and could make a significant contribution to the increase in rail freight envisaged in the 10-year plan. To that end, the Strategic Rail Authority would welcome growth of Consignia's business on rail. That and the provision of supporting interchange facilities in the Midlands or elsewhere is, in the first instance, a commercial matter between Consignia and its logistics suppliers. Consignia has not so far applied to the Strategic Rail Authority for a grant. Any such application would be considered according to the rules and processes for freight grants.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.6/1">The main south-east air transport consultation document (page 148) reports that the focus of economic appraisal of the airport development options has been to estimate the direct benefits to passengers, and that potential increase in productivity across the economy due to growth in the aviation industry was not estimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.6/2">A fare premium is applied in the modelling to price off all passengers at a congested airport; this is the same for all passengers. Benefits to passengers from increasing airport capacity are represented by a reduction in this fare premium. The fare premium at a congested airport is higher the less scope there is for switching to a less preferred airport, and higher too if alternative airports have less choice of flight timings.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that the aviation industry meets its environmental costs. Since civil aviation is a international industry, the Government's approach is to support multilateral action through ICAO to end the exception from tax for international aviation fuel. Unilateral action would create market distortions, such as tankering of extra fuel from abroad to avoid tax, and would have limited environmental benefits. In the consultation document, The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East, it is estimated that policies to meet the contribution of aircraft emissions towards climate change would reduce demand by around 10 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.2/1">The Government continue to regard the Oakington reception centre as a cornerstone in their overall strategy for processing asylum applications as speedily and fairly as possible. It operates together with a fast-track appeals process to bring those applications determined as unfounded quickly to the point of being returnable. The Government wish to build on this process still further in cases where the asylum applicant has been certified as manifestly unfounded and is detained at the end of the Oakington process. The chief adjudicator has agreed that hearings of appeals in such cases will be listed for hearing between six and eight days after they are received by the immigration appellate authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.4/2" qnum="HL5465">Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Whitty on 11 July (WA 105), why veterinary surgeons on both the supplementary and the temporary lists are subject to restrictions which result in their being unavailable to assist with the eradication of a foot and mouth outbreak; whether these restrictions would also bar them from participating in actions against other highly infectious diseases; and whether the restrictions should be amended.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.5/1">The Veterinary Surgeons Act 1948 established the current requirements for practice in the UK, including the requirement for all veterinary surgeons to have attended a course of study at a recognised university as a requisite for admittance to the Register of Members. The Supplementary Veterinary Register (SVR) came into force under that Act and provided for individuals, who had not attended a course of study at a recognised university, to continue to practice in certain restricted categories of employment. Further restrictions were imposed on individuals who were registered under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966, which replaced the 1948 Act. Those listed in the SVR are not members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (MRCVS) and the restrictions placed upon them preclude their being used as veterinary surgeons in FMD control and other notifiable disease control measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/2">Section 7 of the 1966 Act permits a person holding a foreign veterinary qualification to practise temporarily or otherwise subject to restrictions directed by council.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/3">It is granted in order that a person holding a foreign veterinary qualification may carry out acts of veterinary surgery in accordance with the duties of a specified position, in a specific location and who is responsible to a named MRCVS. It does not permit the temporary member to carry out any other veterinary procedure, except where that procedure would be permitted by a lay person. Such appointments are usually restricted to those in employed positions in veterinary schools and designated veterinary laboratories and research establishments or to those in full-time post-graduate education.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/4">It does not permit the temporary member to use the letter MRCVS, nor to sign prescriptions or certification, which requires the signature of a MRCVS.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/5">Those listed in the temporary register are not members of the RCVS and the restrictions placed upon them preclude their being eligible for employment as veterinary surgeons used in FMD control and other notifiable disease control measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.5/6">We are in the preliminary stages of modernising the Veterinary Surgeons Act. A Meeting with the RCVS has taken place. The issue of registration was a discussion point, alongside a number of other areas of the Act. We hope to consult on the proposals later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.2/3">I have been asked by the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport to reply to your Parliamentary Question about pedestrian crossings in the Royal Parks as this is an operational matter for which the Agency is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/4">The Royal Parks are primarily for the quiet enjoyment of the public, with priority being given to pedestrians. As such, it is our policy to reduce the impact of traffic in the Royal parks wherever we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/5">As the roads in the parks are not public highways, we are not obliged to use standard signage and road markings. Although we try and keep as close to the conventional versions as possible, we adapt road traffic features like pedestrian crossings so that they are appropriate to a park setting. This reduces the visual impact of the roads on the park landscape and makes it more obvious to drivers that they are not on an urban street.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.2/1">In the UK we currently have around 3.4 people of working age for every person aged state pension age and above. By 2030 this will have fallen to around 2.4.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/2">The UK National Insurance Fund is financed on a pay-as-you-go basis with current national insurance contributions financing a range of today's contributory benefits, including the state retirement pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.2/3">An increase in the birth rate would help to reduce any future demographic pressure on the National Insurance Fund. However, any increase in the birth rate would need to be sustained over the longer term as any one-off increase would generate future pressures on the National Insurance Fund.</p>
