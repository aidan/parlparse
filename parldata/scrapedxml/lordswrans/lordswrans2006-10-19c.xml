	<p pid="c.199.2/1">We are in regular contact with the Government of Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and other relevant UN agencies about their assessment of the drought and attended the most recent update meeting at the Ministry of Rural Reconstruction and Development. The initial drought appeal was launched to secure pledges of in-principle support, prior to a proper assessment of the scale of the drought. The assessment results, including the number of drought victims and food shortages, are due to be released this month. On the basis of this information, DfID will evaluate its support.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.2/2">Rural development is a key priority for DfID. We are a major donor in this sector and expect to spend around &pound;35 million this year. The Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Reconstruction and Development are key partners. Putting our money through the Government ensures that they have predictable funding, and allows them to respond to their own priorities, including the drought.</p>

	<p pid="c.199.8/1">DfID's anti-fraud and corruption policy provides a framework for all staff to be able to report, in strictest confidence, allegations, suspicions or concerns about fraud and other financial misconduct against the department's funds. All allegations, suspicions or concerns are reported to the head of DfID's internal audit department or posted to a special email address: fraud@dfid.gov.uk. Timely reporting is a requirement; however, should an informant feel unable to use these internal mechanisms, there are other whistleblowing opportunities available, for example Public Concern at Work and the National Audit Office. DfID's anti-fraud and corruption policy is available to all staff by means of a leaflet entitled <I>Fighting Fraud and Corruption</I>, a copy of which I have placed in the Library, and detailed information on the department's intranet.</p>

	<p pid="c.199.17/1">The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian Territories remains difficult, particularly in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians in Gaza receive only six to eight hours of electricity and two to three hours of water every day. Israeli Defence Force (IDF) incursions and air strikes continue. Palestinian homemade rockets are still being fired into Israel. Gaza's border crossings with Israel and Egypt have been mainly closed since late June, except for imports of basic supplies. DfID is keeping close track of the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza through the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA).</p>
	<p pid="c.199.17/2">With technical assistance from DfID, UN OCHA is producing a monthly <I>Humanitarian Monitor</I> report. According to the most recent report, poverty in Gaza now stands at 79 per cent, marginally up from 77 per cent a year ago. However, among families that depend on salaries or payments from the Palestinian Authority (PA) poverty has risen from 42 per cent to 49 per cent in the past year. Average food prices in August were 9.95 per cent higher than in July. Hospitals and health centres in Gaza continue to function, although at reduced capacity. Fourteen per cent of essential drugs are out of stock. More than 80 Palestinian homes and structures were destroyed, with 61 Palestinians killed and 146 injured in Israeli military activity during August. Internal violence among Palestinians caused 12 additional deaths and 55 injuries. Homemade Palestinian rockets injured 10 Israelis. The monthly <I>Humanitarian Monitor</I> is available at <a href="http://www.ochaopt.org">www.ochaopt.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.17/3">DfID has made up to &pound;12 million available to meet Palestinian basic needs through the temporary international mechanism. Also, &pound;9 million has been allocated to specific programmes to provide, first, essential medicines and health supplies; secondly, operations, maintenance and repair costs for water, sanitation and electricity services; and, thirdly, income for the poorest Palestinian government workers, including teachers, who have suffered a severe loss in income over recent months. DfID has also provided &pound;15 million to support Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the wider region, though the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</p>
