	<p pid="a.1.2/1">The United Kingdom ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. The reservation in respect of Article 22 in no way inhibits the discharge of our obligations under the convention. No child in the United Kingdom is in any way disadvantaged by the reservation. It is there to safeguard the right of the United Kingdom to determine its own immigration and nationality laws. We have carefully reviewed the reservation in the light of recent requests that it should be withdrawn. However, we are convinced that it remains necessary in order to maintain an effective immigration control.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.5/1">A preliminary environmental impact assessment (EIAR) has been produced and we expect that a resettlement action plan (RAP) will also be produced. The EIAR is not the property of the UK Government, and its release by ECGD would require the consent of the party who has supplied it to ECGD. Such considerations would also apply to the RAP when that document is produced in due course. todd</p>
