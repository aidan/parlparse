	<p pid="a.105.1/2" qnum="HL720">Whether the statement by Baroness Scotland of Asthal that &quot;The conclusions of the European Council were agreed by the heads of government at Nice and are politically binding (H.L. Deb., 7 February, col. 1235) applies to the French Presidency Report to the Nice Council on the European strategic and defence policy; and, if so, whether the United Kingdom is politically bound by the statement contained in the report, which reads &quot; . . . the entire chain of command must remain under the political control and strategic direction of the European Union throughout the operation, after consultation between the two organisations. In that framework the operation commander will report on the conduct of the operations to European Union bodies only. NATO will be informed of developments in the situation by the appropriate bodies, in particular the PSC and the Chairman of the Military Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.2/1">The Conclusions of the Nice European Council record the Council's approval of the Presidency Report on the European security and defence policy. The extract in question comes from the Appendix to Annex VII. This sets out &quot;suggestions&quot; by the European Union, on the basis of decisions taken by NATO at its 1999 Washington Summit, as to how the so-called &quot;Berlin Plus&quot; arrangements might be implemented by the EU and NATO.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.2/2">The &quot;Berlin Plus&quot; arrangements will enable the EU to have access to NATO assets and capabilities, including the use of NATO command options, for EU-lead operations, following decisions by NATO. The detailed arrangements remain to be worked out by the EU and NATO. However, once an EU-led operation was under way decisions on its political control and strategic direction would be a matter for EU governments. There would be intensified consultation between the EU and NATO before, during and after an operation. The elements of the permanent consultation arrangements have now been agreed by the EU and NATO.</p>

In addition we have made further contributions, totalling &pound;8 million, in 2000 to help cover UNRWA's budget deficit and to support the emergency appeal during the recent conflict. We also provide substantial technical assistance, to a value of &pound;700,000 in 2000. Funding is voluntary, rather than by assessed contributions, and as such there are no arrears. UNRWA is likely to face a budget deficit again this year and we have supported the agency's efforts to widen the donor base and have urged existing donors to maintain, and increase, their annual contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.8/1">The vast majority of drugs on the WTO Essential Drugs List are off-patent and are available at competitive prices from generic manufacturers. With regard to on-patent drugs, the UK Government believe that the TRIPs (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement provides WTO members with sufficient flexibility to implement domestic patent regimes that take account of their national circumstances. For example, the agreement allows &quot;compulsory licensing&quot; in situations such as &quot;national emergencies&quot; when governments may authorise production of drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.8/2">The UK Government believe the best way forward to be through negotiation with pharmaceutical companies, on price and licensing. The Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit's study is exploring a range of policy options to increase access to medicines, including tiered or differential pricing agreements, tax incentives and common purchase funds. The Department for International Development is setting up a commission on intellectual property rights to ensure that the interests of poorer countries are fully taken into account. We also continue to work with developing country governments to strengthen healthcare systems, without which the poorest will not be able to access appropriate and affordable treatment.</p>

We are already introducing measures that will make a difference to older people in employment, health, education and transport. Making legislation an effective way of tackling age discrimination is a complex task and our priority is to introduce age legislation in employment, vocational training and guidance. Legislation alone does not achieve the culture change that it is needed to end unfair age discrimination. The partnership approach of the Better Government for Older People programme has driven forward many improvements and reforms across the whole range of public services, which will help to effect a culture change. We want to build upon the success of that partnership approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.5/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/2" qnum="HL661">Why two cars, escorted by three police motorcyclists, drove southward in Hyde Park down the footpath and cycle track at 6.30 p.m. on Monday 5 February at a time when it was heavily used by both pedestrians and cyclists due to the Tube strike; who was being escorted; and why these cars could not have used the parallel Park Lane; and</p>
	<p pid="a.115.5/3" qnum="HL662">Whether cars are permitted to be driven on footpaths or cycle tracks in the Royal Parks; if not, under what legislation their drivers could be prosecuted for so doing; and by whom.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">Responsibility for the subject of these questions have been delegated to the Royal Parks Agency under its Chief Executive, William Weston. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given. Letter from the Chief Executive of the Royal Parks Agency, William Weston, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-26">26 February 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/2">I have been asked by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to reply to your Parliamentary Questions about vehicles using the footpaths in the Royal Parks because this is an operational matter for which I am responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/3">I am afraid that I cannot say why two cars escorted by the police were travelling through the park on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-05">Monday 5 February</phrase> or who was in them. Cars being escorted through the park in this manner are usually carrying people in a high security category and are escorted by the Metropolitan Police Special Escort Section. It happens rarely and they do not let us know when they are going to do so, both for security reasons and because they sometimes make a last minute decision to do so to avoid being caught in heavy traffic.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/4">The only vehicles allowed to drive on the footpaths and cycleways in the Royal Parks are those driven by Royal Parks staff and contractors on official business, those servicing the parks' facilities, and the Royal Parks Constabulary for operational reasons. We are aware that the Metropolitan Police occasionally use the park footpaths as a short cut, presumably for operational reasons, but we discourage this as much as we are able to because it could be a hazard to park users.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.3/1">A 1996 photographic guide to all the staff of the House is available in the Library. A new guide is in the process of preparation. Black Rod's Office provides a photographic guide to senior staff in that office and I understand that the Clerk of the Parliaments is considering the production of a similar guide to senior officials of the House. Dod's Parliamentary Companion provides a photographic guide to Members of the House and it would not be an appropriate use of public funds to provide a second such guide. Guides to Members' staff, party officials or civil servants would be for their employers to determine.</p>
