	<p pid="c.53.2/1">Westminster City Council, as a Trailblazer area, works with partners to tackle anti-social behaviour in Victoria Street and the environs of Westminster Cathedral. Westminster City Council has undertaken a number of initiatives to tackle anti-social behaviour, including, enhanced cleansing services, working on an exercise with local residents' groups, businesses and the Cathedral authority to &quot;design out crime&quot; and encouraging local businesses not to sell strong alcohol to those of vulnerable disposition. The area also has been designated as a controlled drinking zone which has proven successful in reducing levels of street drinking. A joint taskforce has been set up to tackle issues in relation to problems stemming from large numbers of people arriving in the area from EU accession countries. The Respect Taskforce receives regular updates from Westminster City Council regarding this progress. We would expect Westminster City Council to make public their work to tackle anti-social behaviour and I understand it plans to publish on its website a report of its work as a Trailblazer to tackle begging in the Westminster area for the period 2004&ndash;05 at the end of March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.53.5/1">The defence planning assumptions (DPAs) set out the military tasks that the Armed Forces should be able to perform in a form that enables long-term force structure planning and capability development to be carried out. Real operations will always differ to some degree&mdash;in terms of nature, scale, concurrency and endurance&mdash;from the DPAs. And the actual force structure will always reflect to some extent planning decisions taken when different assumptions were in force. In practice, the available force structure is used flexibly to meet actual operational demands, not to comply with artificial planning constraints.</p>
	<p pid="c.53.5/2">The DPAs are subject to routine review, taking account of historical analysis of past operations and assessment of potential future demands. The main elements of the current DPAs were set out in Chapter 2 of the Supporting Essays to the 2003 defence White Paper (Cm 6041-II). Any substantial revisions will be reported in the next defence White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="c.54.2/1">The Ministry of Defence welcomes the opportunity to submit a further paper of evidence to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) for its 2007 report, by which time we will be in a much better position to make valid comparisons between the position of our own nurses and those of the NHS as a result of &quot;agenda for change&quot;.

	<p pid="c.56.2/3">This incident was investigated by the AAIB (AAIB Bulletin 11/2005, ref: EW/G2005/20/05). A summary, from the AAIB bulletin is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.56.2/4">As the aircraft commenced its take-off run, the take-off warning horn sounded. The take-off was rejected, but while taxiing for another attempt, the pilots noticed a burning smell on the flight deck. When advised by the cabin crew that there was also a smell of burning and some smoke in the cabin, the commander stopped the aircraft on the taxiway and initiated an expeditious disembarkation using the forward passenger door only. An engineering investigation carried out by the operator's maintenance personnel and the engine manufacturer found that a piece of the right hand engine compressor inner support had become detached, causing damage to a compressor oil seal and allowing oil to contaminate the engine bleed air. The engine manufacturer is aware of the issues and is addressing them through component re-design and engine modifications.</p>

	<p pid="c.56.2/8">The CAA has the following information:</p>
	<p pid="c.56.2/9">Climbing through FL130, the nr1 cabin attendant reported an acrid plastic smell from the forward cabin air vent situated in the roof by the emergency exit sign. The nr3 cabin attendant confirmed the smell. There were no fumes in the flight deck (the air vent was closed and the flight deck door was kept shut). Emergency Check List actioned and aircraft returned. An uneventful approach, landing and taxi to stand were carried out with AFS (company) in attendance. AFS and engineering inspection carried out. Nr1 and nr3 advised of feeling sick with a taste in their throat and were taken to hospital for a check-up. Engineering investigation failed to reveal any faults or evidence of overheating, either within the galley area, where fumes were noted, or with the compressor section of the engines. However, it was noted nr1 water heater was found to be hotter to touch than the adjacent urn, with a distinct odour from the seal. Urn removed from the aircraft as a precaution and the aircraft returned to service. After initial observations and before the aircraft was released to service, both engines were inspected by borescope. No recurrence to date. The most probable cause was degradation of the urn seal.</p>

	<p pid="c.57.5/3">Future radio navigation needs will require better integrity and service guarantees; for instance, for safety-critical transport applications. Some augmentation systems are available now. The EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) wide area augmentation system is expected to be certificated for civil aviation use in 2007.</p>

We also have an ongoing programme of community engagement to discuss issues around knife crime. In addition, the connected fund is supporting local community groups working to tackle gun crime, knife crime and gangs. Many of the projects supported involve working with at-risk young people to provide training and mentoring, education, diversionary activities and other projects.</p>

	<p pid="c.63.0/1">A person who is not a member of the security forces may lawfully purchase, acquire or possess a firearm in Northern Ireland if he does so in accordance with the conditions of a firearm certificate granted by the chief constable under the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 or in circumstances where it is permissible to hold such a firearm without a certificate under Articles 77 or 78 of and Schedules 1 or 2 to the order.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.0/2">Records of firearms held under certificate are maintained by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and include the name of the holder, the serial number of the firearms and, in the case of handguns, the ballistic profile. The chief constable does not maintain similar records for those lawfully held firearms where a firearms certificate is not required.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.0/3">PSNI officers will conduct a risk assessment which will include a check to ascertain the presence of legally held firearms before engaging in any search activity.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.0/1">No medicines are licensed for the treatment of depressive illness in under-18s in the United Kingdom. A doctor may prescribe a medicine outside of its licensed indication if they consider it to be in the best interests of their patient. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised in 2003 that the majority of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) should not be used in the treatment of depressive illness in those under 18 years of age. Only fluoxetine (Prozac) has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in treating depressive illness in children and adolescents. Overall the balance of risks and benefits for fluoxetine in the treatment of depressive illness in under-18s is judged to be favourable.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.0/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued a guideline on the treatment of depression in children and young people in September 2005. This guideline took into account CSM advice and recommended that where an anti-depressant was considered appropriate, fluoxetine should be prescribed. NICE recommended that citalopram and sertraline could be considered where fluoxetine has not worked or has not been tolerated.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.0/3">A recently published study (Drug Safety 2005;28(12):1151-1157) which looked specifically at the effect of CSM advice on the prescribing of SSRIs for depression in children and adolescents found that the CSM advice had had a significant effect in reversing the rising trend of anti-depressant prescribing to children and adolescents in primary care.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.0/4">The data which were used in newspaper reports to suggest that over 80,000 prescriptions of SSRIs were to people under 18 in 2005 do not reflect prescribing to children and adolescents under the age of 18 for the treatment of depressive illness. These figures include prescriptions of SSRIs to 18 year-olds, and to those under 18 years for indications other than depressive illness (two SSRIs, sertraline and fluvoxamine, are authorised for use in children and adolescents under 18 years with obsessive compulsive disorder).</p>

	<p pid="c.75.2/1">Procurement negotiations for the offices being established to carry out interviews of adult first-time passport applicants are still in progress and confirmation of the availability of premises is awaited. An announcement of office locations will be made as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.2/2">Commercial contracts relating to the delivery and maintenance of the interview office network remain under negotiation. For reasons of commercial confidentiality, it is not possible to publish estimates of cost.

	<p pid="c.75.2/3">The establishment of the interview office network will create the equivalent of 464 full-time jobs. There will be opportunities for many of these jobs to be taken by people seeking part-time work. For this reason we expect the number of people to be recruited to be over 600.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.2/4">All the new interview offices are planned to be opened during the last quarter of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.2/5">In designing the proposed network, the social and transport costs of travel to interview were carefully considered, as well as the costs of setting up new offices, in order achieve an optimum balance. Many people will be able to minimise costs by choosing to be interviewed near their place of work or study. The additional costs of attending for interview are therefore likely to be minor in relation to the cost of the overseas travel which the passport will facilitate. There are no plans to provide assistance with such costs.</p>

We estimate that, once pension ages have been equalised, the annual saving if the state pension age was raised from 65 to 67 would be about &pound;7 billion in 2005&ndash;06 prices (see notes). This estimate takes into account changes to benefits paid to both pensioners and for those below state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.0/2">If normal pension age were to be raised to 62 for all employees who currently have a normal pension age of 60 within the three main unfunded public service schemes, those for the NHS, teachers and the Civil Service, the total estimated annual savings in the accruing cost of pensions would be approximately &pound;0.5 billion.</p>

Core services for SNEN partnerships are: vandalism, graffiti and other deliberate damage to property, noisy neighbours or loud parties, intimidation and harassment, abandoned vehicles, rubbish or litter lying around (including fly tipping), people being drunk or rowdy in public places, drug related anti-social behaviour, and street lighting. Wave one involves partnerships between police forces and local authorities in areas of Hampshire and Isle of Wight, Northumbria, Leicestershire and Rutland, South Yorkshire and South Wales. SNEN operators will deal with inquiries over the phone by giving advice and information where needed, arranging for action to be taken when appropriate or by directing the caller to a person or organisation who can help them. The service will operate around the clock and will put callers directly in touch with specially trained operators, employed by local authority and police force partnerships, for information and advice. The SNEN will complement rather than duplicate existing services and aims to improve the delivery of these services by facilitating a better co-ordinated response by local agencies.

	<p pid="c.82.0/1">My Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-09">9 January</phrase> followed consultation between relevant departments (including the Home Office, FCO, and the Department for Transport). It also reflected the fact that procedures at military air stations are consistent with Wider Immigration Service policies, to the extent that details of individuals who stay in the UK are passed to HM Revenue and Customs and the Immigration Service. These details are not necessarily retained by the MoD and where aircraft simply transit through the airfield, to refuel for example, and passengers do not leave the airfield, the name of the pilot and aircraft owner are recorded, but airfields are not required to record passenger details. Therefore we cannot determine how many passengers have passed through military airfields in the past five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.0/2">The issue of whether or not the Government have the right to passenger information is covered by immigration legislation in the form of paragraphs 27 (2) and 27 (B) of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Immigration Act and the subsequent orders, the Immigration (Particulars of Passengers and Crew) (Amendment) Order 1975 and The Immigration (Passengers Information) Order 2000. Carriers are not obliged to provide this information unless it has been requested by an immigration officer in writing. As these powers are exercised in accordance with risk on an intelligence-led basis, and wherever there is good reason in the context of the immigration control, the Immigration Service has no plans to exercise them in relation to these flights.</p>
