	<p pid="a.19.5/1">From <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase>, all British registered fishing vessels over 10 metres catching more than 2 tonnes of quota stocks have had to demonstrate an economic link with fisheries-dependent communities in the United Kingdom. This link can be demonstrated in a number of ways--for example, by vessels landing at least 50 per cent by weight of their quota catch into the UK or by employing a crew of whom at least 50 per cent are normally resident in a UK coastal area.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">In the first year of operation, over 1,750 vessels caught more than 2 tonnes of quota stocks and in almost every case achieved a satisfactory economic link, primarily through landings into the UK. Where a small number have failed to make the full list in 1999, they will be expected to make this up in 2000 and future years. The new arrangements have resulted in a significant increase both in the volume of landings made by foreign owned UK flagged vessels and in local expenditure on goods and services in the UK. They have also led to over 300 tonnes of additional quota being made available to fishermen in the under 10 metre fleet and non sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/3">A full report by the Fisheries Departments in the United Kingdom on the operation of the economic link measures and their impact in 1999 has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="">9 June</phrase>, Official Report, col. 392-393W, that Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons Sir David Ramsbotham's appointment was extended until the end of July 2001, when Sir Graham Smith, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation, is also due to retire.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">In response to a question in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="">27 July</phrase>, Official Report, col. 879W, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary told the House that a consultation exercise had been established to gauge public opinion on proposals, including the option of a joint Chief Inspector, designed to ensure that the inspectorates of prisons and probation support closer working between the two services while maintaining the independence and rigour of the inspection process. The consultation exercise ended on <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>. Copies of the responses to the consultation exercise will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/3">A majority of those consulted favoured some change--establishing terms of reference for the inspection of joint working between the criminal justice agencies and the sharing of inspectors between the inspectorates. In contrast, only small minorities were in favour of the status quo, or of the appointment of a joint Chief Inspector for prisons and probation.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/4">During the consultation exercise, a helpful scheme was put forward by Her Majesty's Chief Inspectors of Constabulary, the Crown Prosecution Service, Magistrates' Courts, Probation, and Prisons to inspect practice across their boundaries systematically. This scheme has much to recommend it and the consultation exercise also suggests that it will command broad support. It is therefore the option which the Government proposed to pursue, along with the arrangements canvassed in the consultation exercise for bringing the work of the inspectorates closer together.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/5">Both Sir David and Sir Graham have made significant contributions to raising standards in the prison and probation services respectively, and the Government are grateful to them for their work. In view of the retirements in July next year, both Chief Inspector posts will be advertised in the New Year.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.2/1">The Government are committed to action against hi-tech crime in line with our twin objectives of making the United Kingdom the best and safest place in the world to conduct and engage in e-commerce.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/2">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is making &pound;25 million available to the police in England and Wales over the next three years to initiate the implementation of a national hi-tech crime strategy to enhance the capability of law enforcement more effectively to investigate crime where new technology is used.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/3">The funding being made available will give impetus to the process of developing the skills within the police to undertake computer network investigations and forensic examination of computer systems. These are skills that are becoming necessary as criminals identify opportunities to use and misuse information and communications technology. It is important to ensure that the police have the proper skills and equipment to support them in this new activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/4">With those skills the police will, at the local level, be able to deliver improved service to the public to investigate reports of computer-related crime and to recover and analyse computer based evidence. The crimes concerned cover a wide spectrum from hacking and financial fraud to obscenity and the unlawful activities of paedophiles. The work of local units will be complemented by a multi-agency national hi-tech crime unit that will begin operation in April 2001. The national unit that will provide advice and support to local units, and to other law enforcement agencies across the United Kingdom, and deal with the most serious and organised hi-tech crime offences, including those which have a transnational impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/5">The Government's commitment to support the development of the capability of law enforcement was made by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister when he endorsed the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit report e-commerce@its.best.uk last summer. That report recommended that the Government improve the technical capability of law enforcement to investigate Internet crime and establish an internet crime unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/6">On <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>, the Prime Minister published the UKOnline Annual Report. The establishment of a national hi-tech crime unit was identified as a specific action, part of the Government's commitment to work with industry to ensure a safe and secure environment for e-commerce and to help people trust the Internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.2/7">I am pleased that, with the support of the Association of Chief Police Officers, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the National Crime Squad, we are able to make progress towards ensuring that the police both locally and nationally are better trained and equipped to deal with hi-tech crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.8/1">The Government have been concerned since they came to power to tackle the relatively low achievement of African Caribbean pupils in school. The Ofsted report, based on 1997 data, rightly draws attention to worrying evidence from a small number of local education authorities that the relative attainment of African Caribbean pupils worsens between the start and end of their compulsory schooling. However, it also shows that there have been absolute and relative overall improvements in their attainment at GCSE. We hope that further, more recent, evidence will show continued improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.8/2">The Government's drive to improve school standards, especially in literacy and numeracy, is delivering higher attainment by pupils of all backgrounds.

In 2001-02, the grant will support &pound;153.5 million of local expenditure--an increase of 4.5 per cent. We also plan to enhance ethnic monitoring of pupils' progress to allow individual pupil-level achievement to be linked to ethnic group data to ensure better targeted support for groups at risk of poor attainment.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.2/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Learning and Technology and Jane Davidson AM, Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning, represented the UK at the Council of EC Education/Youth Ministers in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="">9 November</phrase>. Education Ministers adopted a recommendation on mobility within the Community for students, persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and instructors and an associated Mobility Action Plan. The plan sets out a number of measures, which member states can select from according to national circumstances, to promote the mobility of teachers, academics, students and volunteers across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/2">Ministers discussed a preliminary draft report on the future objectives of education systems. Council agreed that the report, which is to be presented by the education Ministers to the Stockholm European Council in Spring 2001, should aim to identify objectives and priorities common to education systems within member states and facilitate the sharing of information and exchange of good and best practice at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/3">The Council adopted two opinions for the Employment and Social Policy Council on the Social Policy Agenda and draft employment guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/4">Ministers received reports from the Commission and Presidency on the conclusions of the Leiden seminar, organised by the Netherlands and French Presidency; on open methods of co-ordination and benchmarking of European education systems; follow-up to the meeting of the EU and Latin American Ministers for Higher Education in Paris on <phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase>; a memorandum on lifelong learning; progress reached in the implementation of the European Year of Languages 2001; the renewal of the United States-Canada-EU co-operation agreements in the field of education and training; and the outcome of the Blois seminar entitled &quot;Learn the history of Europe&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/5">Youth Ministers held an open debate on the follow-up measures which should be taken following earlier consultations with young people in Europe. Council agreed the importance of involving young people at European level and the need to create regular opportunities for consulting with young people--including those not affiliated to recognised youth networks--at both national and European level. The debate was part of the Commission's consultation process linked to developing a White Paper on the future of youth policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/6">Ministers received information from the Commission on the implementation of the Youth Programme and adopted a resolution on the social inclusion of young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.2/7">The Presidency and the Commission raised the issue of the potential dangers facing young sportsmen and women through over-training, drug abuse and commercial exploitation. The Commission urged the Council to consider taking action to tackle this.</p>

For our part, these legislative procedures were completed in 1996. In February this year we received formal notification from the Ukrainian authorities that they had done likewise, at which point we were able to complete the ratification process. The agreement has, however, been applied informally since the date of signature and under its provisions we have been exchanging road haulage permits with the Ukraine for the past four years to the benefit of UK hauliers.

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">As I announced in the House on <phrase class="date" code="">27 July</phrase> prior to Second Reading, the Government asked Mr John Steele to carry out a review into the proposed fund.

	<p pid="a.30.2/4">The Government will establish a trust to administer the fund, on the basis proposed, as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/5">The Government also accept the key recommendation that widows of police officers who were killed as a result of terrorist activity prior to <phrase class="date" code="1982-11-25">25 November 1982</phrase> should receive lump sum payments. They will look to see how these payments, along the lines proposed in Mr Steele's report, can be made without undue delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.2/6">The Government have already implemented the related recommendation, Recommendation 88, that the Widows' Association should be given premises and a regular source of finance to run their organisation.

	<p pid="a.34.0/1">I understand that the painting was intended to be an historical record of the House in November 1995. Every Member of the House was invited to be included in the painting, on payment of a subscription of &pound;150, and it was up to each Member to decide whether or not he or she wished to be included. Future generations of students and historians may well wish to take into account the point the noble Lord makes in his Question.</p>
