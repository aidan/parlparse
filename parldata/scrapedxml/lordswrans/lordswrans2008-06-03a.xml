This includes vehicles awaiting minor repairs, or currently in transit to theatres worldwide, but excludes any vehicles undergoing major repair or planned refit. Vehicles known to have been destroyed on operations have also been accounted for. Nine hundred FV430 vehicles are undergoing a major armour upgrade programme to become Bulldog vehicles, 500 of which have now been completed. Twenty-six per cent of unavailable Spartan, Scimitar and Sultan vehicles are currently either undergoing major overhaul or scheduled for refit. The remainder are awaiting a decision on disposal.

	<p pid="a.39.11/2">In Afghanistan, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is working with the Government to assist IDPs who wish to return to their place of origin.

We use risk mitigation measures where possible, but continue to provide assistance despite difficult conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/2">The UK Government have raised the specific case of the destruction of the Mu'qata at Nablus (location of DfID-funded project) twice with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The UK embassy's defence section in Tel Aviv gained an undertaking from the IDF's chief of operations that none of the locations in which the UK had invested would be subject to IDF attacks. The destruction of the Mu'qata was the subject of a letter of complaint to the head of the IDF's Strategic Planning and International Co-operation Division. No satisfactory response has been received.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.2/1">The screening in Manchester of the broadcast of the UEFA cup final in a public place on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-14">14 May</phrase> only took place with the consent of the local authority and under restrictions agreed with the police. It is therefore difficult to see what added control would have been available had the event been subject to the licensing controls under the Licensing Act 2003, or that such controls would have prevented the disorder that arose.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">It remains the Government's position that big-screen television broadcasts in themselves do not cause disorder, but that it is the consumption of alcohol at such events that can lead to problems. Decisions on whether big-screen events should go ahead are the responsibility of the local authority in consultation with the local police, who are involved at an early stage, and event organisers. It is already possible under existing legislation to control consumption and drunkenness in public places. Under the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, it is possible for a local authority to designate any area to which the public have access a place where alcohol may not be consumed. It is also an offence under the Licensing Act 1872 to be drunk in a public place. The Government are confident that the police and local authority in Manchester will ensure that safety and security arrangements provide a controlled environment at any future big-screen events.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/3">The Government therefore have no current plans to review the licensing of any form of entertainment not currently covered by the existing licensing laws.</p>

The NIO has a target for 2008-09 of no more than 8.5 days lost per member of staff. The departmental board has agreed an action plan for 2008-09 to achieve that target.

The Northern Ireland Office already has a series of effective policies and procedures in place which help achieve these aims. These include a welfare service and an independent confidential counselling service that is available 24 hours a day. During 2008-09, the NIO will also arrange a series of well-being events for staff and a programme of health promotion is under way.</p>

Whether a prisoner requires a programme, and if so, which one, will depend on the assessment of their risks and need. If a course is needed and cannot be undertaken in an establishment, prison staff are under instructions to prioritise indeterminate sentence prisoners with short tariffs, and transfer them to establishments where their offending behaviour needs can be addressed. The Parole Board takes into account a range of factors when considering release, and attendance on a particular programme is just one factor.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/1">Because schools are private places, no member of the public has an automatic right of access to a school.

Parents can meet school staff by appointment.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/3">Since 1996 police officers have had certain powers of entry to a school in order to search the premises and any person there for a suspected offensive weapon; the permission of the head teacher is not required but co-operation between the head and the police is advised in this and in other circumstances where the police seek access. Members of emergency and other organisations will usually enter schools by arrangement.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">The Government are not currently negotiating with the devolved Administrations about reciprocal arrangements for cross-border concessionary travel between England, Scotland and Wales. Local authorities in border areas retain the flexibility to provide cross-border travel for their own residents at their discretion.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/2">Discussions with the devolved Administrations took place at official level during the passage of the Concessionary Bus Travel Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/3">However, the complexity and cost associated with mutual recognition of bus concessionary travel passes in England, Scotland and Wales is likely to be considerable. There are issues around how operators will be properly reimbursed (given the differing arrangements in place), by whom, and whether the terms of the different concessions would have to be harmonised. These issues will be much easier to address once full smart ticketing is in place on all buses.</p>
