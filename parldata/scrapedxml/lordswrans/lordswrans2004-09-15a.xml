	<p pid="a.192.2/1">This matter was fully considered in the context of the production of the alcohol harm reduction strategy by the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit in March 2004, after the Licensing Act 2003 had been given Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-10">10 July 2003</phrase>. As the strategy makes clear, we do not think that the case has yet been made for imposing a compulsory levy on industry for the costs of policing and any other costs resulting from the development of the night-time economy. We believe that the right way forward is through voluntary schemes where they are necessary and can be justified.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.1/2" qnum="HL4158">Further to the Answer by the Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton on 8 September (HL Deb, col. 677), whether they intend to provide compensation to the owners of hefted hill flock lamb crops who have not opted for whole flock slaughter and whose lambs will only be allowed to be disposed of for slaughter when unfinished and not suitable for human consumption.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">Under the compulsory scrapie flocks scheme, where the approach of genotyping the flock applies, compensation will be paid only in respect of sheep of the susceptible genotypes that have to be killed and destroyed and cannot enter the food chain. It is not intended that compensation will be paid for sheep of genotypes that have to be slaughtered for human consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">However, where genotyping action has to be taken in a flock with a lamb crop on the ground, owners may be offered the option of having some or all of their lamb crop killed and destroyed without genotyping. In these circumstances, compensation would be paid for all lambs killed and destroyed.</p>
