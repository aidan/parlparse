	<p pid="a.65.3/1">The Government's intention is to achieve ratification at the earliest practicable opportunity. We have made considerable progress since the then Minister for Disabled People's Parliamentary Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-06">6 May</phrase> (Hansard ref col. 29WS) which identified the issues under consideration. I am pleased to says that no reservations or declarations will be required in respect of aspects of mental health legislation; choice of place of residence; and cultural services. The Ministry of Defence, Home Office and Department for Children Schools and Families are finalising the terms of their reservations and/or declarations in respect of service in the Armed Forces, immigration and citizenship and the provision of special education. My department is considering whether there is a need for a reservation in respect of Article 12 (legal capacity) and the review of arrangements for benefit appointees. Given the steps that remain, our ambition is to ratify this convention in the spring of 2009. The time from signature to ratification of similar conventions by the UK varies considerably, and is on average four years, but we plan to ratify this convention in two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.5/1">The earlier Question to which the noble Lord refers related to the financing of the European Community (EC) Budget and, specifically, whether there would be a shift from financing via national contributions, as now, to a system whereby proceeds from a direct ELI tax went directly to the Community.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.5/2">In that context, while a notional level of national value added tax (VAT) receipts is one element in determining member states' contributions to the EC Budget, how such contributions are actually financed is entirely a matter for member states to decide. There are no national tax revenues hypothecated to finance the EC Budget: all VAT receipts accrue to the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.5/3">As far as the structure and rates of specific taxes are concerned, these are generally a matter for member states. In relation to VAT, rules on some aspects of tax structure and minimum rates of taxation have been agreed by the Council of Ministers by unanimity with a view to ensuring the smooth functioning of the single market, in line with the provisions of Article 93 of the treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.5/4">The most significant obligations taken on by the UK in relation to VAT occurred in 1973, in the UK's accession to then European Economic Community, and as part of the 1993 package of measures relating to the completion of the internal market.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.5/5">Changes to EC VAT agreements are subject to the unanimous agreement of all member states. The Government have always made clear that the UK will not agree to any proposals that would harm our social objectives or undermine the fairness of the UK VAT system.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.0/1">The average grant per unit is a national figure and varies between regions and the type/size of home purchased. Average grant rates in London are considerably higher than those in other regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">For Croydon, five of the homes were three-bedroomed properties and one was a two-bedroomed.

	<p pid="a.71.0/3">In Southwark the average grant rate per unit for social rented schemes so far approved this year through the affordable housing programme is &pound;122,000. The four homes purchased were all two-bedroomed street properties and therefore available for letting immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/4">The Homes and Communities Agency in considering bids for funding through the affordable housing programme assess them against criteria including fit with regional and local priorities, deliverability, quality and design and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/5">We feel that refuge provision is an important issue and one we need to understand better. That is why we have commissioned research that will look at the provision of refuge places across the country. This will help establish how many bed spaces are available for those fleeing domestic abuse. It is hoped it will look at provision for different groups such as men; women; black and minority ethnic people; disabled people; lesbian, gay, bi-sexual or transgender people and more chaotic victims such as drug users, alcohol users and those leaving the sex trade.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">The time taken to process the seven appeals mentioned in my previous reply has been due to a number of reasons. For two of the appeals, those relating to Smalldale Head Quarry and Pole Hole Quarry, the principal reason for delay was the need for appropriate EIA regulations to be in place. For the remaining five appeals, various other reasons, such as reviews under the Habitats Regulations, were more important factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/2">The requirements of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) directive were first applied to the review of mineral planning permissions by regulations that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-15">15 November 2000</phrase>. A voluntary procedure was put into place for those applications and appeals that were not caught by the 2000 regulations. In most cases mineral operators co-operated and new conditions were determined.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/3">However, it eventually became apparent that in a small number of cases applications were being stalled because operators would not provide mineral planning authorities with the necessary environmental information. At the end of 2004 possible solutions to this problem were explored; and at the beginning of 2006 I agreed to enact a set of regulations that would apply the requirements of the EIA directive to outstanding applications and appeals not caught by the 2000 regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/4">The proposed regulations were subjected to wide and thorough consultation and careful legal scrutiny. In the event, appropriate and workable regulations proved to be very complex to draft, and despite the best efforts of all concerned it was not possible to enact them before July 2008.</p>

Under this agreement the Isle of Man transfers 75 per cent of the revenue raised from the withholding tax to the UK.</p>
