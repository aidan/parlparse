	<p pid="a.132.1/2" qnum="HL5339">How many times the Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet has met since it was set up last year and what progress has been made.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-16a.132.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="132"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020716/text/20716w02.htm#20716w02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.132.2/1">The then Home Secretary (Mr. Straw) announced the establishment of the Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-09">9 May 2001</phrase>. Since then, the full task force has met four times and most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-03">3 July 2002</phrase>. The work of the task force has been taken forward by a number of sub-groups which have met regularly and have been looking at the criminal law, law enforcement, child protection measures, public awareness, training and further developing co-operation between the industry and others on reporting and handling child protection issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/2">Members of the respective sub-groups have given freely of their time to support the aim we set last year: to make the United Kingdom the best and safest place in the world for children to use the Internet, and to help protect children the world over from abuse fuelled by criminal misuse of new technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/3">The task force has developed, run and now evaluated a successful national awareness campaign. Research had confirmed two key gaps: first, that parents are ill-informed about their children's use of the Internet and chat rooms; and, secondly, that young people give out their personal details without considering the consequences. Two campaigns were designed, one to target 14&ndash;16 year-olds and the other parents/carers of 11&ndash;13 year-olds. The media used included press advertising, cinema, radio, on-line and viral marketing from December 2001 until spring 2002. Independent evaluation of the campaigns shows significantly improved awarenss of the key messages in both target audiences. The task force is now considering that evaluation and how to build on the momentum created.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/4">The task force has also developed proposals for a criminal offence to tackle the &quot;grooming&quot; of children by paedophiles online or offline. This is intended to allow prosecution at an early stage when children are being groomed, before an existing sexual offence has been committed. In addition, the proposals include the creation of a new civil protection order relating to behaviour towards a child for an illegal or harmful sexual purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/5">Practical online child protection measures have been drawn up in a draft good practice document for service providers which deals with chat, instant messaging and web services. These encourge, among other things, clear and accessible safety messages and advice and user-friendy ways of reporting abuse. The drafts are being considered by the wider industry through the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA) and the London Internet Exchange (LINX).</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/6">Work is also in hand to develop a shared matrix for reporting and handling child protection issues and developing good practice for dealing with law enforcement requests for information from Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This is being taken forward, with the oversight of the task force, by the Internet Crime Forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/7">The task force will continue to work in partnership with the industry to consider the extent to which the criminal law currently covers unsuitable material being sent to children and all the forms of indecent representations of children; assess the new challenges posed by development of 3G mobile phones; and develop basic training materials for child protection staff on children's Internet use.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.2/8">In parallel with the task force, the United Kingdom has played a leading role in the development of a G8 strategy for protecting children from sexual exploitation on the Internet. The strategy, which is not yet finalised, will cover issues such as victim identification; intelligence gathering and sharing; location of suspects; enforcement tools and training; awareness building and prevention; and police working with industry and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>

	<p pid="a.133.2/1">Remediation of the dome site and its surroundings was carried out in stages. British Gas, the original landowner, carried out the statutory remediation, removing all substances which could be a danger or harmful to health. The second phase was carried out by English Partnerships, the Government's regeneration agency, to make the site fit for known planned developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/2">Both British Gas and English Partnerships employed WS Atkins as their remediation consultants, which secured the agreement of the Environment Agency and the Environmental Health Department of the London Borough of Greenwich to the remediation solutions which were carried out on site.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/3">The whole of the 300-acre Greenwich peninsula site now owned by English Partnerships has been remediated fit for its purpose. Any further remediation will depend upon the final use to which the land is to be put and will relate to the form of construction used.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.5/1">We are delighted that the Royal Society has today published the report of its independent Scientific Review of Infectious Diseases in Livestock. Copies will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/2">This report was commissioned by the Government following the unprecedented outbreak of foot and mouth disease last year. We are very grateful to Professor Sir Brian Follett and his committee for producing such a thorough and excellent report in such a short space of time. This is a very significant contribution to our work to strengthen our ability to guard against and deal with animal disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/3">We welcome the importance that the report places on the livestock industry in this country and Great Britain having animal disease free status. We are already taking action on imports and disease surveillance to protect this and the report's views on these matters will be of great assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/4">More widely, we intend to press ahead with an animal health and welfare strategy and will need to consider carefully the recommendations made by the report on research and development in the light of yesterday's spending review announcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/5">The report's recommendations will be of crucial importance in developing the Government's emergency preparedness for controlling animal diseases, and we will need to study these closely, in particular the recommended approach to vaccination against foot and mouth disease. The Government have never rejected vaccination as an option in the fight against foot and mouth. The report recognises that there are aspects of vaccination, in particular trade and technical issues, which are not yet resolved but which can and should be resolved. Even then, vaccination will not necessarily be a panacea and will not necessarily be right in all circumstances. The report notes that, even with emergency vaccination in place, culling would still be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/6">We welcome the Royal Society's endorsement of the need to take forward the work we have in hand on greatly improved contingency plan for foot and mouth. Its findings on biosecurity and animal movements will also be of particular importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/7">In taking work forward on the report, we will need to involve stakeholders, in particular the farming industry, who have a share in the responsibility for maintaining the animal disease free status recommended by the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.5/8">We intend to give a fuller initial response on the recommendations in this report when the lessons learned inquiry has reported on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-22">Monday 22 July</phrase>. It is also intended later in the year to issue a detailed reply to the recommendations in both these independent reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.5/1">My statement on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-27">27 May</phrase> (HL Deb col. 1040) and subsequent Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-26">26 June</phrase> (WA 146) were based on awareness that equity holdings vary between pension funds, dependent, for example, of the maturity of the fund and the investment policies being followed. But equity holdings are often substantial, ranging up to 100 per cent in some cases. Industry information on individual pension fund assets distributions can be found in the annual directory Pension Funds and their Advisers, published by AP Information Services. This includes details of 2,600 major occupational schemes. In the 2002 edition, a small minority of companies is listed in this publication as having a 100 per cent exposure to equities.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.5/2">It is estimated that, on average, between 70 and 75 per cent of all pension fund assets are invested in UK and overseas equities. This is based on industry data on pension fund asset distribution collected by Russell Mellon/CAPS, covering the period <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>. The market value of pension funds with a relatively high proportion of equity investments is more likely to follow stock market trends than the value of those with a lower proportion of equity holdings. The words used in my Answer on both <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-27">27 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-26">26 June</phrase>&mdash;&quot;a third or so&quot; and &quot;the same general order&quot;&mdash;were designed to offer a broad-brush assessment of the likely impact. They were clearly not intended to provide a precise quantitative estimate nor to imply that the effects of stock market falls on the value of some individual funds would equate to the impact on the value of pension funds generally.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.5/1">the Chancellor announced yesterday a significant increase in the combined budget for childcare, early years and Sure Start, rising to &pound;1.5 billion in 2005&ndash;06. This includes a more than doubling of investment in childcare by 2005&ndash;06, following an inter-departmental review of childcare co-ordinated by the Performance and Innovation Unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.5/2">The extra investment will support the expansion of childcare places across the country and the integration of good quality childcare with early years education, family support and health services through a network of children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.5/3">In keeping with this new focus on integration, responsibility for early years education, childcare and Sure Start will be brought within one inter-departmental unit based within the Department for Education and Skills. The Chancellor announced yesterday the PSA target for the new unit, which will be shared by the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.5/4">This new inter-departmental unit will report to a new Minister for Sure Start, early years and childcare who will be jointly appointed to the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions to ensure that our early years and childcare vision delivers on both our educational and employment objecitves. The Prime Minister has asked the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, who led the inter-departmental review of childcare to take on this role.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.5/5">The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, will report to a new cross-departmental ministerial group on Sure Start, early years and childcare. This group will be a sub-committee of MISC9, the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Children's Services. The focus on health has been vital to the Sure Start programmes already up and running. To ensure that this is maintained, the sub-committee will be chaired by the Minister for Public Health. The sub-committee's other members will include the Paymaster General and the Minister for Disabled People.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.5/6">The Secretary of State for Education and Skills will continue to speak on these issues in Cabinet. At junior ministerial level, the Minister for Disabled People will answer Questions in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister believes these new arrangements will ensure that an integrated approach is taken to the development and delivery of our early years and childcare vision.</p>
