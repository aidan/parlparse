	<p pid="a.249.5/1">The National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) is being designed to support automatic enrolment by meeting the needs of employers and individuals that existing pension providers find unprofitable to serve at low charge levels. NEST also has a public service obligation to accept any employer that wishes to use it to automatically enrol eligible jobholders into a workplace pension scheme. This means that NEST has to bear costs purely commercial pension providers do not face.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.5/2">In recognition of this, the Government have decided that the loan to NEST to fund its initial establishment costs should attract a rate of interest equivalent to the Government's own cost of borrowing. This will enable the scheme to deliver low charges to its members and be delivered at no overall cost to the taxpayer in the long run, while not being unfairly advantaged compared with other schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.5/3">The exact amount of loan finance required to establish NEST will depend on its final costs and the nature and size of its membership. The annual contribution limit is a key policy lever designed to ensure that NEST remains focused on its target market. It is only one factor that will influence scheme volumes and its effect on the NEST loan cannot be measured in isolation.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.5/1">The coalition agreement set out the Government's commitment to help reinvigorate occupational savings by encouraging companies to offer high-quality pensions to all employees and through introducing automatic enrolment. My department estimates that around 7 million people are not saving enough to provide the income they are likely to want or expect in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/2">The new employer duty requires employers to automatically enrol eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme. Workers will have information about automatic enrolment, the scheme their employer has chosen and the contributions they will need to make to remain in pension saving. Individuals will be able to opt out if they believe that pension saving is not for them and they will be provided with information about how to do this. Guidance to be issued by the Pensions Regulator will set out how employers must signpost their workers to an independent source of further information about planning and saving for retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/3">The Government recognise that for some people it may not be appropriate to re-direct money into private pension saving. Those on very low incomes will get a high replacement rate from state pension without additional saving. We have therefore included measures in the Pensions Bill 2011 to increase the earnings threshold for automatic enrolment. This will exclude those individuals most likely to achieve a high replacement rate without saving.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/4">It may reassure you to know that most people will be better off for saving. DWP analysis has found that over 99 per cent of people can expect to be better off in retirement having saved than if they had not. For over 95 per cent that improvement is greater than the cost of contribution, even after allowing for inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.5/5">The Government will consult shortly on options to simplify the state pension system. The intention is to reinforce the role of the state pension as a foundation for private saving by providing much greater clarity about what people will receive from the state when they reach state pension age.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.2/1">Inheritance tax receipts in 2009-10 were &#163;2,396 million, and this is published in the National Statistics table &quot;HM Revenue and Customs Receipts&quot; available on the HMRC website at: <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov">http://www.hmrc.gov</a>. uk/stats/taxreceipts/tax-receipts-and-taxpayers.pdf.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/2">Evidence on tax arising from potentially exempt transfers is limited, but the tax impact of potentially exempt transfers that are made within seven years of death is broadly estimated to be in the region of 10 per cent of receipts.</p>
