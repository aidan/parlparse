	<p pid="b.138.3/31">The figures for 1997&ndash;2001 were derived from the Children's Day Care Facilities survey. The figures for 2003 and 2004 were derived from the Ofsted database of registered childcare providers. There are no figures for 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.3/32">With the introduction of the National Day Care Standards and the transfer of responsibilities for registration and inspection of childcare providers from local authority social service departments to Ofsted in September 2001, childcare places were classified according to the type of day care provided: full day care, sessional day care, childminder, out of school day care or creche day care. Ofsted has produced figures based on this classification on a quarterly basis from March 2003. Its latest figures were published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase> in its report Registered Childcare Providers and Places, <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, which is available on its website, <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications">www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.3/33">All four year-olds have been entitled to a free early education place since 1998 and from April 2004 this entitlement was extended to all three year-olds. The free entitlement consists of a minimum of five two and a half hour sessions per week for 33 weeks of the year for six terms before statutory school age, which is the term following their fifth birthday.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.3/34">Some local authorities may additionally offer subsidised childcare places but this information is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.3/35">Figures for January 2005 show that all four year-old children receive some form of free entitlement. The figure for three year-olds is 96 per cent. This covers all maintained, private, voluntary and independent providers and represents 535,100 three year-olds and 568,300 four-year olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.3/36">The latest figures on early education places for three and four year-olds in England were published in Statistical First Release 43/2005 <i>Provision for children under five years of age in England&mdash;January 2005 (final)</i> in September, which is available on my department's website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/">www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.3/37">Changes in pupil figures may arise from changes to the underlying population in the local authority area and other factors. However, my department does not publish population figures for individual age cohorts at sub-national level because of the unreliability of the underlying population estimates. The Office for National Statistics publishes sub-national population estimates in five-year age bands.</p>

	<p pid="b.144.0/1">There are no circumstances where officials of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) or public bodies answerable to the Secretary of State DTI can search or enter the homes or business premises of UK citizens. The noble Lord may however wish to know that nominated officials of the Office of Communications (Ofcom) have authority, under powers derived from the Communications Act 2003 and in accordance with Section 15 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949, to enter premises; vehicles; vessels or aircraft, to investigate cases of suspected illegal operation of radio apparatus; for example, where such operation is causing interference to safety of life services. Ofcom officials also have powers under the Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (Amendment No.2) Regulations 2003 to enter any premises, other than premises occupied only as a person's residence, if they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is a contravention of the RTTE regulations. Ofcom is the independent regulator for the communications sector. It derives its powers from statute, rather than via delegation from Ministers and is answerable directly to Parliament.</p>
