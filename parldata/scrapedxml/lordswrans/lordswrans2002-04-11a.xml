	<p pid="a.109.2/1">The London Passport Office began issuing passports from Globe House in Eccleston Square, London SW1, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-04">Monday 4 June 2001</phrase>. After a phased transfer of all passport business, Clive House, Petty France, closed to the public on <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 26 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/2">Post Office Ltd was informed of the change of address at an early stage, the application form pack was reprinted and a leaflet was included to show the change of address. On cost grounds, all existing stock held by Post Office branches was not scrapped and it is possible that not all old stock has yet been exhausted. An option might have been to withdraw all application stock containing the Petty France address. But this would have been expensive and of little value in most of the United Kingdom as those in receipt of such forms would have had no intention of attending the London Passport Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/3">However, all application form packs should contain a leaflet showing current fees and advising that personal attendance at a passport office is by appointment only. Customers telephoning the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) 24-hour adviceline for an appointment are given directions to the office and advice on what they need to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.2/4">In addition to the application form package and the adviceline, information on the relocation was available from the UKPS website and through UKPS publicity placed in local media such as the Evening Standard and London Metro. Post Office Ltd was briefed by UKPS on the response for its counter staff to give customers wishing to visit the London Passport Office&mdash;namely, that customers should contact the UKPS adviceline for an appointment and information.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">The Government are opposed to &quot;racial profiling&quot;, which can generally be described as the practice of police and other law enforcement officers relying on race, colour or ethnic origin as the basis for subjecting persons to investigatory activities or for determining whether an individual is engaged in criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2">The Code of Practice (A) under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which relates to stop and search, makes clear that a person's race, age or appearance cannot be used alone as a reason for searching that person. It also makes clear that reasonable suspicion cannot be based on generalisations or stereotypical images of certain groups or categories of people as more likely to be involved in criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/3">In addition, a police force in performing its public functions, including its enforcement functions, would need to be mindful of its obligations under the Race Relations Act 1976. These would include obligations resulting from the amendments made to the Race Relations Act 1976 by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.</p>

Extradition requests are based on specific offences, such as murder, which do not necessarily disclose whether an offence is of a terrorist nature.

	<p pid="a.114.0/1">All government departments decide what to capitalise on the basis of accounting policies set out in the Resource Accounting Manual (RAM). These policies follow advice from an independent statutory body, the Financial Reporting Advisory Board (FRAB). A copy of the Resource Accounting Manual is available in the Library of the House and on the Internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/2">The Government agree that certain assets can be of considerable cultural and heritage significance. That is why the Government's accounting framework gives detailed guidance on how heritage assets should be accounted for. This makes it clear that heritage assets should generally appear in departments' balance sheets, both for transparency reasons and to encourage good stewardship of assets by the owner entity.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/3">However, departments are permitted not to capitalise or value non-operational heritage assets where, because of their special characteristics, valuing them may not be practicable or appropriate. This would apply where the cost of obtaining a valuation outweighs the benefits or where it is impossible to establish a sufficiently reliable valuation. Consequently, departments need not value paintings and works of art within heritage collections.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/4">It is typically the entity holding the assets which is solely competent to decide which are heritage assets. Departments are therefore required to attest annually to the ongoing heritage credentials of their heritage assets. In doing so they are free, but not obliged, to seek expert independent advice. The balance sheet treatment of all assets is subject to validation independently through the audit process.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">The European Directive on mineral oils duties structures requires organic and non-fossil fuels used as road fuels to be taxed at the same rate as the mineral oil for which they are substituting. The UK already charges excise duty on organic and non-fossil fuels for use as a road fuel but, where it judges there are sound environmental reasons for doing so, it takes advantage of the option of derogation to introduce duty incentives to promote the development and use of alternative fuels. For example, in Budget 2001 the Government announced a new lower rate of duty for biodiesel, to be set at 20p per litre lower than mineral diesel from later this year. In Pre-Budget Report 2001, the Government announced excise duty exemptions for pilot projects involving biogas, hydrogen and methanol.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/1">This is an historic day for international justice and for the human rights of every citizen of the world. Today, at the United Nations in New York, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Ireland, Mongolia, Romania and Slovakia deposited their instruments of ratification to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. These ratifications bring to 63 the number of states to have committed themselves to this landmark convention, and therefore activates the statute, which will enter into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/2">The ICC will try those individuals accused of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, irrespective of their rank or position. In future, tyrants will know that their actions are not beyond the reach of international justice. The victims of their crimes will, for the first time, be able to look forward to the prospect of real justice. The culture of impunity, which has shrouded human rights violations for too long, will be over.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/3">This Government have always been enthusiastic supporters of the court. It is our belief that the global rule of law is stronger than the local rule of tyrants. We played a major part in drafting the statute and worked hard to secure the passage of the International Criminal Court Act through this Parliament and the Scottish Parliament to enable us to be among the first 60 states to ratify.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/4">The ICC will be a permanent court acting as a permanent deterrent for all potential tyrants. In time, this will be the law which transcends borders and embodies global values. As ever with all institutions of the law, its practice will be as important as its founding principles. We are committed to ensuring that it does its job fairly and impartially. We hope shortly to nominate a British candidate to be one of the judges of the court.</p>

For these species, a self-completed import notification form must be presented to HM Customs prior to the arrival of the specimens, together with the relevant export permit(s) or certificate(s) of origin issued by the management authority in the exporting country. Both of these provide controls against illegal imports of wood, but it is for the management authority in the country of origin to decide whether the import has been legally logged.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.3/2">In 2001, a total of 1,044.716 cubic metres of Appendix III timber was imported into the UK from Brazil, all of which had a valid export permit. There were no imports of Appendix I or II timber.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.3/3">According to the most recent trade figures collated by the United Nations Environment Programme, in 1999 the UK imported 51 per cent of the total of timber imported to the EU from Brazil and in 2000, 56 per cent. The figures for total EU imports in 2001 have yet to be collated.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.0/1">Combating illegal logging requires effort from both timber producing and consuming countries. Timber producing countries are responsible for defining and enforcing the national legislative and regulatory frameworks that define legality.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) is working with a number of timber producing countries to help them improve governance and strengthen forest law enforcement. We are also working to develop capacity for the implementation of timber certification schemes in some producing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/3">Domestically, the UK is working to ensure that the import of endangered timber species is in full compliance with CITES, the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species. We are also implementing a new government timber procurement policy which seeks to ensure that we procure forest products only from legal and sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/4">The UK has shown leadership under the G8 Action Programme on Forests in promoting bilateral voluntary agreements with timber producing countries whereby countries work together to tackle illegal logging and associated trade. We are currently negotiating the first of these with Indonesia. We hope that bilateral agreements will lead to regional and, eventually, an international agreement that will have a big impact on illegal trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/5">Any changes in legislation that may be necessary would best be applied at the European Union level. UK legislation alone would probably be ineffective, as shipment of illegally logged timber could easily be re-routed via other European ports before entering the UK. Any additional legislation would also need to be enforceable, which would require co-ordinated action between timber producing and importing countries. The UK will, however, take advantage of the next European meeting on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade on April 22 to 24 to discuss EU policy on this issue. This process may result in a review of EU policy and legislation.</p>

The available testing technologies use DNA sequencing to identify those variations. In connection with the national scrapie plan, the Government have awarded contracts to two laboratories to install and operate automated genotyping facilities. A blood sample is taken from the sheep, which is identified by an electronic transponder linked by barcode to the blood sample tube. Internal and external quality controls operate at the laboratories.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.2/1">In line with scientific advice, the Government last year launched the national scrapie plan for Great Britain, whose objective is to eradicate scrapie by breeding genetic resistance to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies into the sheep flock. Participation in the plan is voluntary and it does not involve the widespread slaughter of sheep. The plan only requires participants to remove from the breeding flock (either by slaughter or castration) those rams with the genotypes that are the most susceptible to scrapie. So far the proportion of rams falling into this category has been relatively small (about 8 per cent). Where the requirement to remove from the breeding flock causes problems, veterinary advice is available and in exceptional situations appeals can be considered. Experience in other countries indicates that a policy based solely on widespread slaughter is unlikely to be effective in the long term in eradicating scrapie. The available scientific information suggests that scrapie does not promote a detectable immune response in the host. Development of laboratory tests which can identify animals incubating the disease is in progress but a practical technique is not yet available.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.5/1">My department consulted on amending Section of 7 of the Building Act 1984 in April 2000. This consultation arose from the Deregulation Task Force report for 1995&ndash;96 which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/2" class="indent">&quot;Anyone who wants to comply with the Building Regulations by a route other than that set out in the Approved Documents must prove to the Building Inspector that their alternative is compliant. We think that this burden of proof should be reversed. The current legal status of approved documents should be changed so that businesses can develop innovative ways of complying with the regulations without having to prove that they are not breaking the law. They should provide a safe haven, not a straitjacket&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.5/3">To test this assertion, the consultation proposed that the status of the approved documents should be changed to alter the burden of proof from developers to building control bodies. However, the results of this were inconclusive. While some respondents considered that the current legal status of the documents did inhibit designers and developers, others argued that they did not and that there would be a loss of necessary protection if their status were changed. As a result of this, we are considering how the approved documents could be changed to meet the concerns of all parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.2/1">This research was carried out by ICE Ergonomics Ltd on behalf of the Joint Aviation Authorities under funding from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and was aimed principally at harmonising European standards on the safety issues associated with seating. The main finding suggested that a minimum seat spacing of 29.4 inches is needed to accommodate the 99th percentile of passenger by body size, allowing 1 inch of knee clearance to the back of the seat in front. The report also recommended that in order to guarantee sufficient seated space a minimum foot clearance envelope is needed. These results were based on software modelling using anthropometric data and the research recommends passenger trials to validate the findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.5/1">The Northern Ireland Executive has taken the lead on the implementation of this recommendation, which focuses mainly on the areas of health and social security. In their draft programme for government, the devolved administration gave a commitment to put in place a cross departmental strategy to ensure the delivery of effective high quality services to victims of the Troubles. This strategy will be launced in the next few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.5/2">A co-ordinated approach is vital to ensure the needs of victims are properly addressed, and the Victims Minister, Des Browne, meets regularly with the Ministers in the devolved administration. As implementation of the devolved administration's strategy proceeds, government will continue to review their approach to meeting victims' needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.3/1">The furniture will continue in use for as long as it serves its purpose. Items that are no longer of use will be disposed of unless they are of particular historical significance. Items falling within the latter category include a roll-top desk used by Charles Fulke Greville when he was Clerk of the Council, which is on permanent display in the lobby of the Privy Council Office. The Privy Council Office is proud of its heritage and will not dispose of items that would significantly dilute its historical links.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.2/5" class="indent">(iv) Addressing legal problems&mdash;ensuring that public services are clear about how the law regulates data-sharing, together with consultation on possible options for legislative change.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/6">There are a number of recommendations in the report where we need a proper debate before final decisions are made. On those recommendations&mdash;set out in the report&mdash;the Government are seeking views from all interested parties. For the other recommendations, the Government want to see early progress in taking them forward as part of the strategy in delivering the overall objectives.</p>
