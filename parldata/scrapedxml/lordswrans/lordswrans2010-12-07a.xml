	<p pid="a.23.2/2">In respect of other Nimrod MRA4 programme costs, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has made estimates of savings that would accrue from measures considered in the Strategic Defence and Security Review for the purposes of formulating policy. Some of these have been published to help inform the public debate. In the case of the Nimrod MRA4 we estimate that around &#163;2 billion will be saved over the next 10 years, by not bringing the aircraft into service. Release of further detail may prejudice the MoD's negotiating position with its commercial suppliers. The MoD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed savings or updated estimated in-service cost figures at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">Further to my reply of <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-10">10 November</phrase>, the question of who is entitled to vote in any particular referendum will be considered and determined in the light of the subject matter. The franchise for each referendum is commonly set out in the primary legislation which establishes that a referendum is to be held.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">Citizens of Gibraltar are entitled to vote in European elections as part of the combined region of South West England and Gibraltar. However, for the purposes of the referendum on the Parliamentary Voting System, Gibraltarians who are resident in Gibraltar will not be entitled to vote unless they are also British citizens and are registered to vote in UK parliamentary elections as an overseas voter.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/3">The position is different under the European Union Bill in a case where any referendum would extend to Gibraltar under the provisions of that Bill. In that case Clause 11(1)(c) of the Bill provides that the persons who can vote in Gibraltar in the referendum are the Commonwealth citizens who, on the date of the referendum, would be entitled to vote in Gibraltar at a European Parliamentary election in the UK electoral region which includes Gibraltar.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.6/1">Over 300,000 UK companies currently operate elsewhere in the European Union (EU) and 78 per cent of business leaders consider that the single market has been helpful for UK business<sup>1</sup>. Benefits include access for British businesses to potential customers, reduced costs for businesses wishing to export to Europe or to set up European operations without having to re-register in each country, and an increased ability to sell products across Europe without having to get them approved separately in 27 different countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/2">Eight out of the UK's 10 main export markets are in the EU. Exports to EU member states account for 48.7 per cent of the UK's overall exports of goods and services in 2009, worth more than &#163;188 billion<sup>2</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/3">The single market has also been an important driver for competition across the EU with resulting benefits for consumers. The European Commission estimates that the extent of price variation in EU15 member states (those belonging to the EU before 2004) fell by 4.8 per cent between 1995 and 2005 and by 13.3 per cent in the EU25 member states (those belonging to the EU before 2007)<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, mutual recognition and standards harmonisation for thousands of products and services have ensured that consumers all over Europe enjoy high levels of quality and safety, thus increasing consumer confidence in purchases.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/4">In terms of investment, EU membership is assessed to have been an important driver of strong foreign direct investment (FDI), both inward and outward.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/5">EU member states are a big source of FDI for the UK, with 49 per cent of the stock of investment in the UK coming from these countries in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/6">This growth is most likely due to the development of the single market:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/7">market size is one of the most important determinants of FDI flows-a larger market gives firms an incentive to locate within it;this is particularly true for vertical FDI flows, ie the location of different stages of production in different areas (as opposed to horizontal FDI whereby firms open a subsidiary or affiliate in different areas); andthe effect may also be due to the benefits of agglomeration, for which the UK has traditionally been an important destination.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/8">Pain and Young (2004) estimated that withdrawal from the single market would imply a permanent loss of 2.25 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), largely through a reduction in FDI flows.<sup>4</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.32.6/9">A paper from the European Commission in 2007 estimated that over the period 1992-2006 the single market programme raised EU GDP by 2.2 per cent, creating 2.75 million jobs in the process. This estimate was used subsequently to infer the gains to the UK assuming that gains were distributed evenly across EU member states.<sup>5</sup></p>

	<p pid="a.35.3/1">European Union procurement legislation precludes public bodies from discriminating in favour of domestic products when procuring food, and Ministry of Defence (MoD) contractors are required to seek best value for money in the open market. However, where competitive, the MoD gives full consideration to procuring British produce. To this end regular and routine meetings are held between the MoD and other government departments aimed at assisting British companies better to compete for MoD food contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/2">For operational requirements, it is necessary to supply frozen fish and meat, including bacon, to military personnel serving on duty outside the United Kingdom. To procure frozen bacon from a British supplier would currently represent a significant additional cost to the MoD of approximately &#163;880,000 per annum.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.6/1">The ceasefire that brought the fighting between Israel and Hamas to an end in early 2009 remains fragile as this incident demonstrates. There remains a risk of rocket fire from Gaza and Israeli strikes against targets within Gaza. Restraint is vital-no-one wishes to see a return to the violence of early 2009. Additionally, there is a risk of significant internal violence within Gaza from splinter terrorist groups opposed to, and even more extreme than, Hamas. Foreign and Commonwealth Office Travel Advice sets out the risks (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/israel-occupied">http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/israel-occupied</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.35.6/2">The fragile situation underlines more than ever the urgent need for a return to normality in Gaza: opening the crossings to humanitarian relief and reconstruction materials, and revival of the economy through allowing exports and the movement of people is the best way of ensuring longer-term stability and the re-emergence of Gaza's business fraternity.</p>

Non-EU nationals wishing to undertake exchange visits to state-maintained schools are able to spend up to six months in the UK under the child visitor route. Independent schools are able to bring international pupils to the UK under tier 4 for academic year exchanges, as those students are paying full fees and are not being subsidised by the UK taxpayer.

	<p pid="a.50.5/1">Schedule 7 to the Traffic Management Act 2004 specifies the road traffic contraventions that are subject to civil enforcement. Only those contraventions set out in Part 1 of Schedule 7 have been brought into force. Regulations made under Section 144 of the Transport Act 2000 give approved English local authorities outside London the power to enforce an area of road that forms part of a bus lane if the locally made order provides that it may be used only by buses, a particular description of bus, or by buses or a particular description of bus and other class or classes of vehicular traffic. Local authorities in London have additional traffic enforcement powers, under various locally made Acts of Parliament.</p>
