	<p pid="a.132.5/1">There have been some recent developments in respect of immigration detention in Northern Ireland. Until early 2006 it had been the case that, where it was necessary to detain individuals in Northern Ireland, men were accommodated in the Working Out Unit, Crumlin Road, Belfast and women were accommodated at HMYOC Hydebank Wood. It is now the case that individuals in Northern Ireland who are detained under Immigration Act powers are no longer held in Northern Ireland. Such individuals are transferred to a detention facility in Great Britain either on the day of detention or within 24 hours. In the majority of cases individuals will initially be detained at Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre. We consider that the revised detention arrangements are better than those they replaced, which entailed the routine use of prison accommodation for detainees. Individuals who are transferred under the new arrangements will have exactly the same access to legal advice and representation as any other detainee. They will be informed about their right to legal representation and how they can access such representation within 24 hours of their arrival at a removal centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">The <i>Northern Ireland Road Safety Strategy 2002&ndash;2012</i> sets out objectives to improve road safety over a 10-year period and reinforces the Government's commitment to road safety in Northern Ireland. It identifies 164 actions focused on the main causes of deaths and serious injuries and aims to reduce by a third the number of people killed or seriously injured and, within that target, to halve the number of children killed or seriously injured (from the average for 1996&ndash;2000).</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">The latest verified figures, for 2004, demonstrate significant progress. By the end of 2004 the number of people killed or seriously injured had fallen by a quarter and the number of children by two-fifths. Nevertheless, the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads remains unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/3">New primary road traffic legislation, on which Department of the Environment (DoE) consulted from October 2005 to January 2006, will be introduced which includes, among other things, penalty points and greater fines for non-wearing of seatbelts, using a hand-held mobile phone while driving and careless and inconsiderate driving; and powers to seize uninsured vehicles, require a driver to undertake an impairment test for drugs and to make increased use of retraining courses for drink driving, careless driving and speeding.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/4">DoE will launch a new seatbelt campaign during 2006; a new <i>Highway Code</i> will be prepared for publication in 2007 and measures will be considered to improve the safety of novice drivers, including graduated licensing. DoE is also working towards the mutual recognition, in 2007, of driving disqualifications between the UK and Republic of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/5">Road safety is a significant factor in developing the vast majority of schemes funded from the Department for Regional Development's (DRD) roads service capital budget. Within that budget, the programmes specifically targeted at reducing collisions are the collision remedial and traffic calming programmes. In 2004&ndash;05, &pound;2,605,000 was spent on collision remedial schemes and &pound;2,549,000 on traffic calming schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/6">The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) continues to support road safety campaigns through focused enforcement. PSNI has lead responsibility for the roll out of safety cameras in Northern Ireland and future meetings of its project board of the Northern Ireland safety camera scheme will include representation from DoE and DRD.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/7">The key to achieving significant reductions in road casualties lies in responsible road user behaviour. Everyone must take personal responsibility for their own safety and the safety of others on our roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.5/1">In recent years the Government have made several important changes to the ways in which any risks posed by sex offenders in the community are managed. For example, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 strengthened the requirement on offenders to notify the police of their personal details and any changes to those details. We have introduced sexual offences prevention orders (SOPOs) to enable courts to impose prohibitions on offenders who pose a risk of sexual harm. In 2001 we placed multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) on a statutory footing, further strengthening them in 2003&ndash;04. Under MAPPA, the police, probation and prison services, supported by additional agencies including housing, health and social services, combine forces to manage the risk to the public posed by serious sexual and violent offenders. The result is more effective supervision and better public protection. These arrangements are being progressed by the National Offender Management Service and the MAPPA national steering group. This includes the national Risk of Harm Action Plan&mdash; to improve the timeliness and quality of risk assessment and management&mdash;and the MAPPA business plan 2005&ndash;08, which further formalises MAPPA, increases accountability and encourages the focus upon good practice and consistency.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.2/1">The notification requirements of Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which are often known as the sex offenders register, are an automatic requirement on offenders convicted or cautioned for certain sexual offences. The notification requirements are a management tool to ensure that the police and probation services are kept informed of the whereabouts of sex offenders in order to manage the risks posed by such offenders and also help in the detection of sexual crime. All offenders who are subject to the notification requirements are managed in the community through the multi-agency public protection arrangements. In support of MAPPA and the notification requirements we have spent &pound;11 million on ViSOR, the violent offender and sex offender register, an IT system that holds records on all MAPPA offenders and allows the prison, probation and police services to share information. We anticipate that a further &pound;4.5 million will be spent each year running the system and ensuring it continues to be enhanced in support of public protection activities.</p>
