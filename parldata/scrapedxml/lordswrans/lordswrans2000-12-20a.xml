An independent United Kingdom-wide evaluation of the complaints procedure is now in its final stages and due to submit findings to Ministers in early 2001. The NHS Plan made it clear that we will act on the results of the evaluation and reform the complaints procedure to make it more independent and responsive to patients, and this would, of course, include older people. The plan also sets out ways in which we will strengthen patient involvement in the National Health Service across the board through the creation of patients' fora, and the Patient Advocacy and Liaison Service, which will help patients raise concerns and have them dealt with quickly. In addition, regular surveys of patients' experience, both locally and nationally, will help to ensure that patients of all ages are placed at the centre of the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.9/2">Holocaust Memorial Day is focused on learning the lessons of the Holocaust and other more recent atrocities that raise similar issues. We took a conscious decision to focus on events around the Holocaust and thereafter, although we did examine requests to consider the atrocities and other events that preceded the Holocaust. Examples include the Crusades, slavery, colonialism, the victims of Stalin and the Boer War. It is always difficult to draw a line and wherever it is drawn it runs the risk of being misinterpreted.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.9/3">A particular focus on events around the period 1939-45 and thereafter should not be seen as failing to acknowledge, sympathise and respect the concerns about prior events.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.9/4">The massacres of Armenians in 1915-16 were an appalling tragedy condemned by the government of the day and now. We understand the strength of feeling about this terrible period and extend our sympathies to the descendants of the victims.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-12-20a.61.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100284" speakername="Baroness Hayman" colon=":" colnum="61"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo001220/text/01220w02.htm#01220w02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.61.2/1">In April 1998 the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales formed a small independent group to review existing policies and legislation in England and Wales concerning the management and conservation of salmon, trout, eels and freshwater fish. The Review Group submitted its report in February 2000, and the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Review was published in March. Interested individuals and organisations were then invited to comment on the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/2">Over 700 individuals and organisations sent in comments, and these have been taken into account in deciding the Government's response to the review. The great majority strongly supported the review's recommendations and conclusions, although concern was expressed about some individual recommendations--in particular, one relating to the coarse fish close season on rivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/3">The Government intend to respond to all the 195 recommendations in the review in relation to England, and this detailed response will be placed in the Library of the House and sent to all honourable Members who have expressed an interest in the review, after the recess. The National Assembly for Wales will be responding separately. In the meantime, I would like to outline the key elements of our response.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/4">The Government welcome the review, which they consider to be a major contribution to the development of modern policies on salmon and freshwater fisheries. They endorse the review's recommendations on the rationale for government involvement in the conservation and management of salmon and freshwater fish and accept the great majority of the review's recommendations relating to salmon and freshwater fisheries legislation. When parliamentary time permits the Government intend to introduce proposals for new salmon and freshwater fisheries legislation to implement the agreed changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/5">The review recommends a substantial increase in grant-in-aid to fund the Environment Agency's fisheries function. The Government have considered this recommendation with particular care. They note that pressures on the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food budget made it necessary to reduce grant-in-aid in England by &pound;1.5 million in 2001-02; grant-in-aid paid to the agency by the Ministry next year will therefore fall to &pound;3.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/6">The Government have, however, now decided, in the light of the review's recommendation, to increase grant-in-aid in England by &pound;3 million a year for the years 2002-03 and 2003-04; this will mean that grant-in-aid for each of these years will be set at &pound;6.2 million--an increase of 30 per cent on the level of grant-in-aid in the current year. It will be for the Environment Agency to decide how these additional funds should be spent, but the Government have identified two priority areas: conserving and restoring salmon stocks and improving controls over unauthorised transfers of coarse and non-native fish.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/7">Salmon stocks in England are currently at historic low levels and the agency will use the extra funds to further the implementation of the Salmon Action Plans on all 47 main salmon rivers in England, with the aim of increasing the number of rivers in which salmon stocks meet the conservation limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/8">Coarse fish imported illegally from outside the UK and unauthorised fish transfers can spread fish diseases to wild stocks; unauthorised introduction into waters in England of non-native fish species also poses a threat to native species and to biodiversity. The agency will aim to secure a significant reduction in the number of unauthorised transfers of fish.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/9">In allocating additional grant-in-aid to the Environment Agency, the Government accept the review's conclusion that the Environment Agency's fisheries functions continue to be funded from both grant-in-aid and rod and net licence income. They also endorse the Review Group's view that the agency's work on coarse fish and on trout should benefit from grant-in-aid, in particular when new work is being undertaken; it expects the agency to devote around one third of the &pound;3 million increase in grant-in-aid to work on coarse fish.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/10">As the Review Group points out, government spending on salmon and freshwater fisheries is not restricted to Environment Agency grant-in-aid; these fisheries also benefit substantially from other forms of government expenditure. Projects for habitat improvement and to develop salmon and freshwater fisheries are, for example, eligible for assistance under agri-environment schemes and the England Rural Development Programme. The Environment Agency and Sport England are continuing to liaise closely to identify any specific projects where two organisations can collaborate together.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/11">The review recommends that the existing phase-out of mixed stock salmon net fisheries should be accelerated by offering compensation to netsmen to encourage them to leave these fisheries on a voluntary basis as soon as possible. It also recommends that the Government should provide substantial pump-priming funds to launch the necessary compensation arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/12">The Government welcome the review's endorsement of their policy on mixed stock fisheries. They agree that it would be desirable to speed up the current phase-out, on a voluntary basis, and have decided to contribute to the cost involved. They will contribute a maximum of &pound;750,000 for this purpose, payable in the years 2002-03 and 2003-04. However, the Government share the Review Group's view that those who benefit from the phasing-out of mixed stock fisheries, particularly riparian owners and anglers in both England and Scotland, should contribute a major share of the cost. The Government's contribution to the costs of a compensation scheme will, therefore, be conditional on private interests raising a matching sum.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/13">The Government will discuss the details of the proposed compensation scheme with interested parties. They propose that the scheme should initially focus on the largest mixed stock fishery, the North East salmon drift net fishery.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/14">The review contains a number of recommendations on angling close seasons; these attracted more comments than any other changes proposed by the Review Group. A substantial majority of these expressed opposition to the recommendation that the coarse fish close season should be abolished on rivers. The Government endorse the general approach on close seasons proposed by the Review Group, and have already, in line with the group's recommendations, confirmed by-laws lifting the close season in most canals. As to the coarse fish close season on rivers, the Government agree with the Environment Agency's view that any change to the coarse fish close season on rivers should be based on science, that at present there is inadequate information on rivers and that no decision on lifting the close season should be considered until further evidence is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/15">The review makes recommendations on a variety of other matters that can affect the conservation of fish in freshwater, including agriculture, forestry, water abstraction, land drainage and flood defence, and predation, most of which the Government have accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.2/16">A number of the recommendations in the review relate to the duties of the Environment Agency. The Government note that the agency is currently subject to a Financial, Management and Policy Review. This will be a comprehensive review that will ask fundamental questions on the purpose, functions and organisation of the agency. In these circumstances, the Government have not yet reached a decision on the recommendations in question; they will determine their response to them in the light of the outcome of the FMPR.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">The Government considered carefully, in the light of the Flamborough judgment in 1996, whether payments made under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme for hedgerows and other field boundaries should continue to be paid where such features were subject to the pre-1840 inclosure awards. The Government do not have powers to intervene or enforce these matters. In addition, any work carried out in observance of this legislation may not necessarily be of the standard required by the scheme. The Government therefore took the view that payments for hedgerow and other field boundary work under the scheme should continue in view of the substantial benefits they offer to the English countryside.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.8/1">Although the British Transport Police (BTP) did not classify this accident as a Xmajor incident&quot;, any train derailment involving over 400 passengers at night, close to live overhead powerlines, must be treated as a serious situation. When attending any such incident it is not possible for the police immediately to determine the cause of an accident. It is important that the emergency services preserve the integrity of the scene as much as possible until criminal activity can be ruled out by expert technical examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.8/2">Passenger safety is the priority in dealing with such incidents. It was not possible to move the carriages still on the track and the train had to be evacuated at the site. A major factor in the handling of this incident by the Railtrack Incident Officer (RIO), the train operator and the British Transport Police (BTP), was that the passengers were in no imminent danger while seated on the train, which had heating and lighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.8/3">An evacuation route from the train was identified and prepared, which involved removing fencing, providing lighting and laying down tarpaulin over the undergrowth. It was also necessary to evacuate the train by a single door. However, this allowed for a controlled evacuation of passengers, with their luggage, to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.8/4">The passengers were then transferred by coach to a reception centre where they were informally interviewed by police and staff of the train company. The interviews had a number of purposes. They allowed the train operator's staff to ascertain individual destination requirements for onward journey by taxi, to provide follow-up welfare and compensation advice, and where necessary forward any items of luggage left on the train by passengers. Obtaining personal details is also essential for responding to the great many people who call the police and railway operators after any incident of this nature seeking information about friends and relatives on the train.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.8/5">Passengers were not asked whether they had derailed the train, but when obtaining their details the BTP enquired whether they had seen, heard or felt anything that might assist their investigation into whether any criminal activity, such as vandalism or obstructing the line, was the cause of the accident. This is routine procedure when handling an incident of this nature. The information obtained from passengers also helps to prevent fraudulent claims for compensation that tend to occur when such an incident receives widespread publicity.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">The feasibility study has not yet been completed. However, since my reply to your previous Question on this subject, HSE have been actively considering the technical and practical issues involved in conducting such a study. The outcome of these deliberations is now contained in a 15-page draft study protocol that has been sent for comment to the medical authorities on the Isle of Wight who would need to be involved in any study. The protocol will be made publicly available once this consultation is complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.2/1">No. My department asks local authorities to supply information on numbers of gypsy caravans on a standard, clearly defined proforma with guidance notes to assist completion. This helps to ensure both consistency and accuracy in returns. In addition, my department carries out validation checks on any marked discrepancies between year on year data. While completion of the proforma is voluntary, it is relevant to point out that the return rate from local authorities has run at over 98 per cent for the last seven years.</p>

Grants from the budget will be available, on a joint funding basis, for projects which have the support of their local community legal service partnership. My department is today issuing a consultation paper which will enable us to take account of the views of funders and providers of local legal services in finalising the details of the budget.</p>
