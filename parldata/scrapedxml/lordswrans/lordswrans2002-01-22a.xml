Planning is underway involving all criminal justice partners in London and Manchester. Details for the Manchester scheme were announced in a press notice issued on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-11">11 January 2002</phrase> and it is expected that particulars of the London scheme will be released soon.

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">In order to protect the parties' commercial interests, it is normal commercial practice not to reveal the details of contractual agreements such as that being entered into between English Partnerships (EP) and Meridian Delta Ltd (MDL). Revealing such details may compromise the Government's ability to achieve value for money, since the joint venture between EP and MDL will be negotiating third parties over the subsequent development of the land. This is true also of the pre-valuation and other appraisals of the value of the Dome site.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">We will review this position once contracts have been exchanged with MDL, and will make public as much information as is possible within these constraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/3">The National Audit Office is scrutinising the entire sale process, including valuations and value for money assessments, and will report to Parliament in due course. We have kept the NAO informed throughout, and will continue to do so.</p>
