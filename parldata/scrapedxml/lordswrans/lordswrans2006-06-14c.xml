Accordingly the taxable profits of farmers will not be affected by the timing of the receipt of single farm payments.

	<p pid="c.30.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>, the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) rolled out joint personnel administration (JPA) to 48,000 RAF service personnel throughout the world, on time and on budget. The event marked the culmination of five years' system design, development, integration and testing and bears testimony to a very strong partnering agreement between MoD and EDS.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/2">The current estimated total cost of the JPA project, including costs preceding full development and also its initial period of in-service operation through to the end of financial year 2008-09, covering both MoD and extramural costs, is &pound;269 million. JPA is expected to deliver savings in excess of &pound;100 million per year when fully in service.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/3">On JPA rollout to the RAF, there were a number of technical issues which had not manifested in the extensive testing carried out prior to its launch. These resulted in the system operating much more slowly than anticipated which greatly restricted the number of self-service users at any one time. Over the course of the following six weeks these early problems were overcome and users have had access to the full system functionality since <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-18">18 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/4">JPA performed satisfactorily on rollout to RAF professional HR administrators and has successfully delivered pay to the RAF with only relatively few discrepancies in the first month and many less in the second. Although the first few weeks following roll out have resulted in a significant number of inquiries and requests for rectification of problems from individual users, as well as some 14 pieces of ministerial correspondence on behalf of constituents, as at <phrase class="date" code="">9 June</phrase> there have been no formal grievances from individual users about JPA.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/5">In order to ensure alignment of JPA with defence information infrastructure (future) programme requirements, current plans are that JPA will be rolled out to the RN from October 2006 and to the Army from March 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.31.5/1">The police power to enter premises for the purpose of arresting a suspect is governed by Section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 and the accompanying PACE codes of practice. The power applies to the execution of a warrant for the person's arrest, an arrest in relation to an indictable offence, an arrest for one of the offences or other limited circumstances specified in Section 17(1)(c) of PACE. The constable must have reasonable grounds to believe that the person being sought is on the premises. Force may be used only in a reasonable and proportionate manner if the occupier and any other person entitled to grant access are absent, there are reasonable grounds for believing that alerting the occupier would frustrate the purpose of the search, if entry has been refused, or it is impossible to communicate with the occupier or other person entitled to grant access. PACE code B also includes information on the additional safeguards for the public that apply to the exercise of police powers to enter and search; including matters relating to the conduct of searches, notices to occupiers (which include information on claiming compensation) and securing premises. Copies of the PACE codes can be accessed on the Home Office website.</p>

	<p pid="c.33.8/1">As the income contingent repayment (ICR) scheme involves collecting student loan repayments through the tax system, repayments are calculated and deducted by employers from earnings along with pay as you earn (PAYE) tax and national insurance contributions (NIC). HM Revenue and Customs calculates and sends expected receipts from student loan collection to the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) each quarter and the money is used to fund expenditure on education. Borrowers' accounts with the Student Loan Company (SLC) are updated annually following receipt of year-end returns. SLC credits borrowers' accounts retrospectively to the tax year in which deductions were made from earnings so no additional interest is charged even if there is a delay in the repayment information reaching SLC.</p>
