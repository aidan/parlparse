The latest ONS release on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February 2006</phrase> (available at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">www.statistics.gov.uk</a>) showed that, on the output per worker basis, the productivity gap between the UK and Germany closed in 2002. This means that, on average, a UK worker now produces as much output as a German worker.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/2">There has been good progress from 1995 to 2004 in closing the productivity gap with France and Germany, on both the output per worker and output per hour worked bases for measuring productivity. The UK is also the only country in the G7 to have matched the impressive productivity growth rates of the US over this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/3">Improving UK productivity performance still further is key to the UK's response to globalisation, as competitive pressures on UK firms intensify. Moreover, productivity gains are likely to be the main source for continued improvement in UK living standards. The Government will therefore maintain their intense focus on productivity, with policies working across the five drivers of productivity: investment, innovation, skills, enterprise and competition.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.2/1">The Government have made no formal response to the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">Effective and well focused regulation can play a vital role in correcting market failures, promoting fairness and increasing competition. Society expects the Government to provide protection for the general public, consumers and employees consistent with the best international standards, and these expectations grow over time. However, the Government believe that inefficient regulation can impose a significant burden on business, and is pursuing a programme of reforms to deliver better regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">The UNHCR's position paper of February 2006 provides a broad assessment of the situation in Darfur and Sudan more generally and we do not dispute that it presents an accurate overview of the general humanitarian situation and the serious social and security problems inherent in Sudan. However, asylum and human rights claims are not decided on the basis of the general situation&mdash;they are based on the circumstances of the particular individual and the risk to that individual. We fully recognise that the precarious conditions in Sudan for those of non-Arab ethnicity originating from Darfur are such that there are individuals who are able to demonstrate a need for international protection. We do not however consider that each and every Sudanese national from Darfur who applies for asylum is in need of international protection. In cases where Sudanese asylum seekers from Darfur have been found both by the Home Office and the independent appeals process not to be in need of international protection, we will continue to enforce returns on a case-by-case basis. We therefore do not accept UNHCR's view that states should refrain from returning unsuccessful Darfuri asylum seekers to Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.2/1">Village shops are important to rural communities in providing goods and services, as well as crucial social contact. Some of these enterprises are successfully run by volunteers. They may be eligible for support from the Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES), part of Defra's England Rural Development Programme, where they have strong community backing and a business plan which establishes the need for the grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/2">The Government have also assisted local services by extending mandatory rate relief at 50 per cent. to include sole village public houses, petrol stations and village food shops under the village shop scheme. Qualifying premises are entitled to a 50 per cent. reduction in their business rates bills, and local authorities have the discretion to top-up all other non-domestic premises up to 100 per cent. provided the rateable value is &pound;14,000 or less.</p>
