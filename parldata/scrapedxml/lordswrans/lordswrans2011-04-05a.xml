We have not spoken directly to professional bodies because in each sector of the economy there is an enormous number and diversity of professional institutions and associations. But we are engaged in ongoing discussions with sector skills councils and the UK Commission for Employment in Skills about how professional bodies and guilds can be involved in developing professional apprenticeship routes-for example, through new higher apprenticeships at levels 4 and 5.</p>

	<p pid="a.345.2/1">The Financial Services Authority (FSA), alongside the Bank of England, is represented at the European Banking Authority (EBA) and has engaged actively at working level in the design of the stress tests. The FSA highlights that this year's test is a significant improvement on last year's, in terms of the stress scenarios, the toughness of the capital threshold, the consistency of assumptions and the strength of the peer review process, bolstering the credibility of the exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/2">The thematic review of liquidity is a further development on last year's exercise. The EBA, which was established at the beginning of this year, works alongside members' national supervisory authorities to carry out its work, and its decisions take account of this broader constituency. Some members took the view that the absence of a current common international standard for liquidity requirements could lead to a misunderstanding of published results, and also reflected on the formative nature of the work in discussions over whether the first set of results should be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/3">The EBA has already announced the decision not to publish the thematic review of liquidity. The detail of the capital stress test scenarios and methodologies has also been announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-18">18 March</phrase>. Advance notice of the detail of the stress tests is vital for both banks and national authorities to carry out the work and plan for and prepare other measures related to the stress tests. Last year's Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) stress tests clearly highlighted the risks to changing the scope of the exercise midway through the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.2/4">The Government strongly support a high degree of transparency with regard to banks' balance sheets, and a key part of the overall EBA capital stress tests is the disclosure of bank exposures, which will allow market analysts to run their own tests.</p>

	<p pid="a.347.5/1">The Government scheme to freeze council tax applied to all billing (shire districts, metropolitan districts, London Boroughs and unitary authorities) and major precepting authorities (county councils, fire and rescue authorities, police authorities and the GLA) in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.5/2">Local precepting authorities such as town and parish councils were not eligible for the scheme as there are some 10,000 such councils in England and the Government did not consider it practical or efficient to introduce a system for allocating central government grants to the parish sector. Furthermore central government has no power to pay grant directly to them or power to give grant to another authority to pass to a local precepting authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.5/3">Nevertheless, the overall rise in council tax this year will be 0.0 per cent on an average Band D bill in England. Thus average bills have been frozen, providing real practical help for families and pensioners with the cost of living. In real terms, this represents a cut in council tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.0/1">The Department for International Development (DfID) recognises the valuable work carried out by faith-based organisations in developing countries, especially their contribution in the areas of emergency and disaster relief, health, welfare and education. This was confirmed by the Secretary of State for International Development in his speech at the General Synod earlier this year, in which he announced that DfID would establish a steering committee to assist in developing a set of partnership principles for the department's work with faith groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/2">In 2009-10, DfID provided over &#163;36 million to faith-based organisations for their poverty reduction work overseas. Details of these allocations are summarised in <I>Statistics on International Development</I> (SID) 2010. A breakdown of costs allocated to these organisations through each funding mechanism can be viewed on DfID's external website. Figures for 2010-11 will be published in the next SID in October 2011. Faith-based organisations are required to compete for DfID funds using the same stringent criteria as other civil society organisations and, as with other types of organisations, they will be required to demonstrate how their work contributes to DfID's overall objectives. DfID does not provide forecasts of expenditure for work with civil society groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.3/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) manages a strategic programme fund for human rights and democracy, dedicated specifically to supporting human rights projects. In 2010-11, this fund allocated approximately &#163;5.07 million to human rights and democracy projects around the world. It supported work on equality, strengthening civil society, freedom of expression, abolition of torture and the death penalty, among other issues. Other FCO 2010-11 programmes also fund human rights projects where these help to realise their core objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.3/2">In 2011-12 the FCO will have a &#163;5 million Human Rights and Democracy Fund dedicated specifically to supporting human rights projects. In 2011-12 other FCO programmes may also fund human rights projects where these help to realise their core objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.3/3">It would be impossible to give a precise figure of how much FCO funding was spent on human rights programmes in 2010-11 or will be in future. This is because, (with the exception of the dedicated Human Rights and Democracy Fund), FCO programmes integrate their human rights activities with all other programme work. To unpick human rights allocations from within each fund and from within each individual project would require an enormous amount of work, and it would be hard to develop meaningful criteria which would allow us to do this effectively or efficiently.</p>

The figure of nine minutes that was quoted by the <I>Northern Echo</I> was at the upper end of the range of responses that were received. The appraisal work that led to the decision to take forward the Intercity Express Programme (IEP) modelled a seven-minute dwell for any manoeuvre involving coupling at one end and uncoupling from the other, and a shorter dwell for simpler coupling manoeuvres. The modelled time includes time for reconfiguring the train-borne systems as well as physical coupling/decoupling of locomotives and the additional increase in journey time because of the reduced approach speed into stations where coupling is to take place.</p>
