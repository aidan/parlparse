	<p pid="a.157.2/1">The Government are aware of comments attributed to Congressman Tauzin and others about the rules on the export of personal data to third countries set by the 1995 European Commission (EC) Data Protection Directive. The Government do not believe that those rules will impede transfers of personal data from the European Union to the United States. Last year's decision by the European Commission that the United States' safe harbour arrangements provide adequate data protection for the purposes of the directive, and the Commission's current work on the development of standard contractual clauses for data exports, are intended to facilitate such transfers.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">The Government's position has always been that reviewing the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) is a role which properly falls to government themselves to take on. To be meaningful, any such review must have command of the full picture, including the use by the United Kingdom's law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies of investigatory techniques which are, by their very nature, covert and sensitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">As indicated in the response to the report on e-commerce from the Better Regulation Task Force, the Government will keep Parts I and III of RIPA under review in order to assess the effectiveness of the provisions and their effect on business. As the Government noted in giving this undertaking, independent commissioners already have a statutory responsibility to oversee the operation of the powers in Parts I and III of RIPA and to report annually on how the Act is working.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/3">As the Government have also indicated, the technical advisory board to be established under Section 13 of RIPA, comprising a balance of industry and government representatives under an independent chairperson, will have an important role in assessing and advising the Secretary of State on any requirements placed on communications service providers to maintain a reasonable interception capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.6/1">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-06">6 March 2001</phrase> (Official Report, col. 121W) that the scheme for regulating immigration advisers under Part V of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 would be brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-30">30 April 2001</phrase>. We have now signed a commencement order to that effect. From that date, it will be a crimial offence to provide immigration advice or immigration services in the course of a business in breach of the requirements of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/2">It has never been the Government's intention that Members of Parliament should be subject to the regulatory scheme. Our advice is that Members of both Houses of Parliament, Members of the European Parliament, Members of the devolved legislatures, local councillors and their staff are not subject to the regulatory scheme when providing immigration advice or services in connection with their parliamentary and constituency duties. Immigration advice and services given in other circumstances, however, may be subject to the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/3">We have also signed two exemption orders under Section 84(4)(d) of the Act, which will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-30">30 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/4">The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Part V exemption: educational institutions and health sector bodies) Order 2001 will exempt certain educational establishments and a number of public sector health bodies from the prohibition on giving immigration advice on services unless qualified. While there are some small differences between various parts of the United Kingdom, the main bodies exempted under the order are:</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/5" class="indent">universities, colleges and other bodies authorised to award degrees;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/6" class="indent">colleges of further education;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/7" class="indent">finally registered independent schools;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/8" class="indent">the students' unions of all such bodies, as above; and</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/9" class="indent">National Health Service health authorities, trusts and boards.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/10">The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Part V exemption: eligible voluntary bodies and relevant employers) Order 2001 will give a temporary exemption from the prohibition until the end of January 2002 to:</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/11" class="indent">voluntary bodies which, by <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-30">30 April 2001</phrase>, have provided the Legal Services Commission with written confirmation of their firm intention to apply for the Community Legal Service Quality Mark (i.e. have committed themselves to apply for the Quality Mark); and employers and prospective employers of work permit holders.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.6/12">Although these orders exempt the bodies concerned from the general prohibition on giving immigration advice and services and the associated criminal sanctions for breaching the prohibition, the exempted organisations, nevertheless, have to comply with the code of standards published by the Immigration Services Commissioner.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.2/1">Modernising the criminal justice system is a cornerstone of effective crime fighting and in reducing the fear of crime. Capital Modernisation Fund investment in innovative departmental programmes is ensuring that crimes are detected, offenders prosecuted and victims supported more quickly, effectively and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">The Home Department has benefited from over &pound;220 million investment from Round 1 of the Capital Modernisation Fund, including &pound;150 million funding for a joint project with the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions to reduce vehicle crime and improve security on housing estates.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/3">It has also benefited from over &pound;162 million investment from Round 2 of the Capital Modernisation Fund, including &pound;25 million for the National Technical Assistance Centre to assist law enforcement agencies' ability to fight crime in the information age.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/4">Four million pounds worth of investment has already been secured from Round 3 of the Capital Modernisation Fund for the development by the Youth Justice Board of two small mother and baby units for girls under 18 which will enable sentenced or remanded young mothers to remain with their young babies where appropriate. The first unit should open by early 2003. A further &pound;18 million has been secured to fund the capital costs of the Youth Justice Board's expansion of the secure juvenile estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/5">We intend to announce details of further allocations to the Home Department from Round 3 of the Capital Modernisation Fund bidding process shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.2/1">The main proposals in the White Paper were to reform the law of corruption in the light of recommendations made by the Law Commission; to put beyond doubt that the crime of corrupting public officials extends to foreign public officials; to introduce a new offence of trading in influence; and to take jurisdiction over United Kingdom nationals who commit bribery offences abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/2">We received six comments on the White Paper, most of which were broadly favourable to our main proposals. The main points made by commentators, and the Government's reaction to them, are contained in a paper which has today been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/3">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has decided to make two changes to the scheme set out in the White Paper in the light of comments received. First, the legislation will include proposals for a new offence of trading in influence which will apply to both the public and the private sectors. As the extension of the offence to the private sector is a new proposal, my right honourable friend will listen most carefully to the arguments on both sides when the Bill comes before the House. Secondly, the legislation will extend not only to England and Wales but to Northern Ireland as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.2/4">My right honourable friend will bring forward legislation to implement the proposals at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.2/1">Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 (the 1996 Act) allows for the prosecution of employers who knowingly employ individuals without permission to work in the United Kingdom. A statutory defence against prosecution is available which requires that the employer obtains a copy of a document showing that the individual is entitled to take work.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/2">There were concerns that, in seeking to avail themselves of this defence, employers were unlawfully discriminating by making more checks on job applicants than the defence in Section 8 requires or by targeting checks on racial grounds. That is why we undertook, in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, to issue a code of practice to employers on how to avoid racial discrimination when seeking to apply the defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/3">In the light of that commitment, the Government have prepared a code of practice that sets out the responsibilities of employers under the Race Relations Act 1976 and the 1996 Act and describes how employers can use the statutory defence in a way that avoids racial discrimination. In preparing the draft code of practice and summary, we consulted the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and a number of other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/4">We propose that this code of practice should come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">2 May</phrase>. We plan to distribute copies to interested organisations, together with a summary, which should ensure that all employers can easily understand their responsibilities in avoiding racial discrimination. A copy of the code of practice has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.2/1">(a) Railway Safety is a new non-profit-making company limited by guarantee set up under the terms of its network licence. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Railtrack Group plc but operationally separate from Railtrack plc. The Rail Regulator enforces the requirements on Railway Safety and on Railtrack in connection with Railway Safety through Railtrack's network licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">The purpose of Railway Safety is:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3" class="indent">to lead and develop the existing long-term safety strategy for the industry;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/4" class="indent">to establish and review new and existing Railway Group Standards under the Railway Group Standards Code, enforced by the Rail Regulator;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/5" class="indent">to be an agent for change by raising safety standards through research, development, education and raising awareness;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/6" class="indent">to carry out independent assessment of Railtrack's train and station operators' safety cases prior to consideration by the Health and Safety Executive; and</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/7" class="indent">to lead, advise and support the industry through standard setting, leadership, promotion of best practice and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/8">The Chairman of Railway Safety is Sir David Davies. Its executive directors are Rod Muttram (Chief Executive), Aidan Nelson (Director, Policy and Standards) and Dr Matt Walter (Director, Safety Management Systems). Industry non-executive directors are Alison Forster (Operations and Safety Director, First Great Western), John Penney (Alternate Chairman, GT Railway Maintenance) and Gordon Sage (Director of Industrial Minerals, Rio Tinto). Independent non-executive directors are Tom Cox (Professor of Organisational Psychology), Sir Frank Davies (former Chairman, Health and Safety Commission), Richard Profit (Group Director Safety Regulation CAA) and Hans Ring (Director of Safety, Swedish National Rail Administration). Railway Safety is funded by Railtrack, which raises the costs through access charges approved by the Regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/9">(b) The Railway Industry Standards Strategy Committee (RISSC), set up under the Railway Group Standard Code, provides advice to Railway Safety on strategic standards issues. In particular, it advises on strategic issues which could result in significant changes to technology or working practices and potentially result in changes to Railway Group Standards with significant costs for those affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/10">Its independent chairman is Cliff Perry from AEA Technology Rail. The committee, which meets at least three times a year, reports to the Safety Advisory Board (SAB). Membership of the committee comes from across the industry (train and freight operating companies, rolling stock leasing companies and Railtrack). The Railway Inspectorate, the Rail Regulator and the Strategic Rail Authority all have observer status.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/11">The activities of RISSC are funded by Railway Safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/12">(c) Safety Advisory Board (SAB) is representative of the railway industry parties who may be materially affected by the safety policies and decisions of Railway Safety through, for example, the Railway Group Safety Plan or Railway Group Standards. The board brings together a wide spectrum of expertise from across the railway industry and focuses that expertise on providing advice and guidance to the board on its policies on strategic safety issues and on the prioritisation of Railway Safety's activities in relation to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/13">SAB is not empowered to direct Railway Safety, nor is it charged with determining safety policies or strategies in its own right.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/14">Railway Safety facilitates the SAB and its processes and provides the resources and information necessary for its operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/15">Formal membership of the SAB comprises individuals nominated by industry bodies representing the rail industry's various sectors. These representatives come from train and freight operating companies, infrastructure contractors, rolling stock leasing companies, trade unions, Railtrack, the Railway Industry Association, the Strategic Rail Authority and the Railway Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/16">Members are required to act collectively to promote safety rather than to represent specific company or constituency interests. They must ensure they have effective arrangements in place to communicate with their representative bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/17">SAB is chaired by Railway Safety non-executive director Professor Tom Cox and meets four times each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/18">(d) The need for system authorities comes from the need to get the best solution for complex interfaces in railway systems. The purpose of a system authority is to co-ordinate the development, installation and modification of a specific project. A system authority is a joint industry body which makes recommendations as to the best safety and economic approach resolving conflicting views along the way. Thus it is effectively a system architect. Recommendations are taken forward through existing channels such as Railway Group Standards. No system authority is yet fully in place but the wheel-rail interface authority is the most advanced. Similar systems authorities are being developed for TPWS and tilting trains. A railway group standard for the operation of system authorities is being developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/19">A members agreement for the wheel-rail interface system authority is being finalised. Membership would be split into five sectors to ensure that all interested parties are represented: Railtrack, freight train operators, passenger train operators, the Railway Industry Association representing the supply chain, and the rolling stock leasing companies. Each sector would elect a director and this group would elect a chair, who would be independent. The authority would also have a number of non-voting participants: the Strategic Rail Authority, the Rail Regulator, the Railway Inspectorate and Railway Safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/20">The funding arrangements for the first year are set out in the members agreement. It is proposed that two-thirds of the cost will be allocated to Railtrack and its suppliers and one-third of the cost will be allocated to passenger train operating companies and suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.3/1">A number of improvements have been made to lifeboat launching equipment since the First World War. The original manually operated systems, relying on blocks and tackle of natural fibre ropes, have been replaced by more efficient mechanical systems. Modern davits are fabricated in steel, rely on gravity for operation and are designed to minimise malfunction. Today, falls are constructed of steel multi-core wire ropes and the launching systems are designed with simultaneous release mechanisms to avoid the possibility of a boat hanging from the second set of falls.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-07">7 December 1999</phrase>, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) signed a memorandum of understanding with the Royal Navy. This recognised the components of the RN Seaman Branch training that meet the requirements for merchant navy deck officers as specified by the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended in 1995 (STCW 95), to which the UK is a signatory.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.6/2">The RN and MCA teams identified differences in the RN training when compared to the requirements for merchant ships. When these differences are made up, deck officer qualifications may be awarded following an Oral Examination before an MCA examiner of masters and mates.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.6/3">There is no provision for an RN officer to be granted a master's certificate without first holding an STCW officer of the watch certificate followed by a chief mate's certificate. However, an accelerated route has been agreed, recognising the high quality of the RN training and experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.6/4">Typically, the areas in which RN officers are required to undergo training, beyond that required for RN service, are cargo work, stability, medical care and shipmaster's business and law.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.2/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Mr Hill) represented the United Kingdom at the Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/2">The Council opened with a policy debate on the Commmission's second package of maritime safety issues. The Presidency presented a questionnaire focusing on the three elements in the package: improved ship monitoring, an additional compensation fund mechanism in cases of oil pollution and the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). The Commission hoped for common positions at the June Council. The United Kingdom stressed the importance of considering these proposals in the context of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and of existing member state competence, an approach shared by most member states present.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/3">On Galileo, the Council adopted an approach that established milestones for future significant decisions about the launch of the development (December 2001) and the deployment (December 2003) phases. My honourable friend was one of a number of Ministers to speak in support of this approach, which is intended to ensure that the project is based on sound financial management and private sector financing, as required by successive conclusions of the European Council. The decision milestones are necessary if Galileo is to deliver tangible benefits to the public and provide the taxpayer with good value for money. The UK also argued for more work to be carried out this year to meet UK and other member states' concerns about costs, management arrangements, the definition of the services and attracting private finance. This work will help the Council make an informed decision in December about the future of the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/4">The Council agreed a Resolution setting out priorities for further progress in integrating environmental issues into transport policy. The Commission said it would follow up many of these priorities in the forthcoming Common Transport Policy White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/5">There was a progress report and policy debate on the draft regulation establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Presidency sought views on the key issue of which aircraft should be covered, the mechanism of appointment of the executive director, and inspections of member states and investigations of undertakings. The UK joined other member states in expressing the views that only member states registered aircraft should be covered, that the executive director should be appointed by the agency's administrative board and that EASA should have the powers of inspection and investigation. The Presidency concluded that discussion should continue in the working group, aiming for a common position as soon as practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/6">The Council agreed Conclusions urging member states to be in a position to ratify the Montreal Convention on air carrier liability by <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase>. The Council also agreed a Decision for Community ratification of the Convention, to be deposited simultaneously with those of the member states. The Presidency hoped that a decision on a revision of Regulation 2027-97 would be taken in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/7">The Commissioner reported on her recent visit to the United States to discuss ways to limit aircraft noise in future. She felt the exchange had been useful and further technical meetings had since been arranged.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/8">The Commissioner also initiated a discussion on the state of the European airline industry, arguing that a Community mandate to negotiate with the US was a necessary precursor of airline consolidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/9">The Presidency presented a framework for the Community to negotiate on aviation environmental issues, particularly aircraft noise, in the run-up to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) General Assembly in September. This framework was agreed unanimously.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/10">Pending the First Reading of the European Parliament there was political agreement on the text of a Regulation requiring third country lorry drivers to carry a certificate of legal employment. The UK maintained a parliamentary scrutiny reserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/11">Following a Commission presentation, the Presidency confirmed that the directive on professional driver training would be discussed at the June Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/12">The Council debated a proposed amendment to the directive on weights and dimensions of heavy vehicles, requiring member states to accept the use of 15m buses. The Presidency presented a global compromise addressing delegations' outstanding concerns. At the end of the debate, the Presidency concluded that there was general political agreement but that the text of a derogation for the UK (addressing our concerns at the out-swing of these vehicles) would be remitted to Coreper for further consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/13">The Council adopted Conclusions on the Commission's recent recommendation on the maximum permitted blood alcohol level for drivers. The Conclusions underline the importance of progress on a range of drink drive measures including collaboration between member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/14">The Council discussed a proposed amendment to the directive on compulsory use of safety belts and child restraint systems. The text under discussion attempted to solve outstanding concerns on the detailed requirements for young children to use adult seat belts in the absence of appropriate child restraints. A number of member states had concerns about the proposals. The UK was among those taking the view that it required further examination. The Presidency concluded that the Council could not reach agreement and remitted the text for further consideration at the technical level, hoping for a common position in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/15">There was a progress report and policy debate on new proposals to update the procurement procedures for public transport services. The Commission hoped that the new regulations would be discussed in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/16">There was a discussion over lunch of the draft directive on the harmonisation of weekend lorry bans. The Commission emphasised the importance of harmonising the periods during which member states may impose bans and stressed that the proposal applied only to new bans and to the transport Trans-European Network. Consultation would be required on the imposition of new bans. The UK was one of a number of member states which supported the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.2/17">The Commission noted the success of the Ecopoints system in managing lorry transits through Austria. It would be maintained only until 2003. The Commission undertook to issue a report soon about operation of the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.0/1">Her Majesty's Government have issued guidance to help people responsible for events and attractions in the countryside decide how to operate during the foot and mouth outbreak. Expert veterinary advice provided to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is that most events may safely go ahead. It is for the organisers of events to decide what to do in the light of the guidance, and Her Majesty's Government are not responsible for the British Horseracing Board's advice. In general, however, excessive caution in cancelling events and closing rights of way, even where the risks of spreading disease are very remote, is seriously damaging the economy of rural England.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.6/1">Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) Regulations require those who are claiming benefits relating to unemployment to be actively seeking work.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.6/2">However, unemployed people who commit themselves to setting up their own business (including those young people being supported through the Prince's Trust scheme) are allowed a single eight-week period where they can be treated as actively seeking employment. This flexibility acknowledges that for some people self-employment is the most appropriate route back to work. It releases them from the requirement to seek employed earners' employment during this period so they can concentrate their efforts upon building and implementing their business plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.6/3">For the small number of clients who do not manage to complete their preparations in this time, they can continue to claim JSA as long as they are able to meet the basic entitlement conditions. Actively seeking employment and, indeed, short-term employment is not a barrier to the longer-term objective of establishing a business.</p>
