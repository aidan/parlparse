	<p pid="a.237.0/1">The main urban sections of the Connswater and Knock Rivers in east Belfast are already designated for maintenance by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Rivers Agency. Maintenance work is carried out as and when necessary to ensure free flow. Works, including channel clearance, in the Connswater and Knock Rivers are included in the agency's maintenance programme in the current business year. Any extension of existing designated sections would only be based on drainage need, and not amenity reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">Designation of watercourses within the terms of the Drainage (Northern Ireland) Order 1973 does not require public sector ownership of the watercourses concerned to enable necessary drainage works to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">The Rivers Agency's drainage remit does not enable it to carry out works solely for amenity reasons and therefore that agency has no plans to construct overhanging walkways in the vicinity of the Connswater River.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">Also, the draft Belfast metropolitan transport plan will contain an integrated range of proposals for walking/cycling, public transport, highways and management up to 2015. The work to develop the plan has not identified a pedestrian need that would justify the potentially high costs of constructing walkways overhanging the Connswater River in the vicinity of the Connswater shopping centre in east Belfast.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-11-17a.239.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="239"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031117/text/31117w02.htm#31117w02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.239.6/1">The United Kingdom's support for Security Council Resolution 1325 (SCR1325), three years after its adoption in October 2000, is now focused on implementing its provisions and ensuring that the necessary mechanisms are in place for monitoring its implementation. UK support has included:</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/2" class="indent">providing 150,000 dollars to the United Nation's Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) to develop and implement a training manual and integrate its use into DPKO's Best Practices Unit;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/3" class="indent">providing compulsory training to all UK military and police officers embarking on peace-keeping or similar overseas missions on gender, child protection and human rights issues;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/4" class="indent">actively searching for and subsequently deploying UK female officers to missions and other conflict prevention/resolution operations, the most recent examples being the deployment of two female police officers to Sierra Leone and a senior gender expert to Baghdad to work with the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA);</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/5" class="indent">developing a database of suitably qualified women based in the UK experienced in conflict prevention/resolution work, and willing to be deployed overseas;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/6" class="indent">continuing efforts in the UN Security Council to reflect gender perspectives in a meaningful way. The UK has argued for language in SCRs that establish or renew peace-keeping mandates as one concrete method of mainstreaming gender into the council's work. The UK is systematically looking for opportunities to ensure that gender concerns are properly addressed in resolutions, mission mandates and progress reports. Recent Security Council resolutions reflecting language taken from SCR1325 or its provisions include those on Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Cote d'Ivoire. We also repeated at the open debate of the Security Council on women, peace and security held on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-31">31 October</phrase> to mark the third anniversary of the resolution's adoption, the suggestion made at the same debate in 2002 that the council give thought to establishing a mechanism through which it can monitor its own progress on issues relating to women, peace and security;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/7" class="indent">welcoming the International Criminal Court's willingness to include within its remit certain crimes against women;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/8" class="indent">ensuring that those members of the various UK teams in Iraq, especially those working in or with the CPA, are fully briefed on the gender aspects of their work. The UK's Special Representative, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, on a recent round of briefing calls and meetings in London, met my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Minister for Women and Equality, and e-Minister in Cabinet (Patricia Hewitt), a representative group of Iraqi women, and representatives of UK non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including the Women's National Commission, active in the field;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/9" class="indent">funding through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool several initiatives relating to the implementation of SCR1325, including the United Nations Development Fund for Women's efforts to gather information on women's peace-building and gender justice initiatives, and work with the Urgent Action Fund for Women's Human Rights, an NGO that supports grass-roots activities in countries where there are multinational peace-keeping operations. It is our experience that small well targeted funding can make a big difference&mdash;for example, encouraging women to play an active role in Afghan politics by providing childcare facilities in the main Parliament building in Kabul.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.6/10">Future ideas include a series of briefing workshops, held jointly by the UK and Canadian missions to the UN in New York, for newly elected Security Council members, to build a wider body of support amongst member states for SCR1325 and the broader set of issues surrounding women, peace and security.simone</p>

The seven-strong US-led International Police Training Mission that has been providing both basic and specialised training in Kabul since June 2003 includes two UK police advisers. A further team of four UK police advisers deployed to Kabul in July to run a three-year, &pound;6.7 million pound programme to establish crime scene investigation units for the Afghan National Police. They are supported by additional visiting UK trainers and consultants.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.0/2">At present access to Ascension Island for civilians is by ship, or on RAF flights between Brize Norton and the Falkland Islands. The UK Government wish to improve access to Ascension Island, in order to provide an essential building block for its future economic development. The UK Government have therefore agreed with the US Government that the US &quot;Wideawake&quot; military airbase on Ascension Island may be used for a limited number of civilian charter flights every week.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3">It will be for airlines to decide on commercial grounds whether to take the opportunity to fly to Ascension Island. The UK Government will work closely with the Ascension Island Government to encourage airlines to fly there. A prospectus will be issued in early 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/4">The opening of the airfield is part of the modernisation process of Ascension Island. In 2002 a fiscal regime was introduced and the first-ever Island Council was formed. The Ascension Island Government are working to continue this process and are preparing a strategic plan providing a vision for the Island for the next five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.3/1">Over the past months it has become clear that the stability of Kosovo, and the Balkans is increasingly affected by a lack of a clear way forward on its final status within the terms of UNSCR 1244. The Contact Group has therefore designed a new approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.3/2">It is based on a review mechanism, conducted in consultation with UNMIK, the Contact Group and the PISG, to monitor Kosovo's progress on implementation of the internationally endorsed standards set by the UN. There will be quarterly reviews with a first opportunity for a formal assessment of progress in mid-2005, or earlier if sufficient progress has been made. If the assessment is positive then the UN Security Council will consider whether a process should be initiated for a final settlement as laid down in UNSCR 1244. In the event of a negative assessment, more work would need to be done on the standards, and a date set for a further review. The Contact Group's intention is not to express a view on final status itself. This would be premature. The aim is to advance standards, assess how much progress has been made on those standards, and judge whether or not such progress could justify addressing final status as UNSCR 1244 requires.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.3/3">This approach was outlined on 4 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-05">5 November</phrase> in Belgrade and Pristina by the United States' Under-Secretary for Political Affairs, Marc Grossman, with the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Kosovo Harri Holkeri and local Contact Group representatives. UNMIK has a key role in this strategy. SRSG Holkeri has our full support. EU High Representative Javier Solana has also welcomed this strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.2/2">The number of people sleeping rough on the piazza fluctuates on a daily basis. Westminster acknowledges that rough sleeping around the piazza continues to be one of London's most visible and troublesome hotspots. Westminster has recently (October) recommissioned street outreach services via a new rapid intervention team with a view to tackling the problem. The aim is to help vulnerable people into appropriate services that will enable them to sustain accommodation, to divert others new to the area, and bring about real reductions in people using the piazza to bed down at night.</p>

In the European Court of Justice case of Akrich, the court was asked to determine whether a member state could refuse to apply the Surinder Singh judgment to a British citizen who had deliberately moved to another member state with the express intention of creating an initial right of residence in the UK for their third country national spouse.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that stronger measures are in place to penalise people who traffic in human beings. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 introduced a new offence of trafficking for the purpose of controlling prostitution with a maximum penalty of 14 years. This offence came into force <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase>. More comprehensive offences covering trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation are included in the new Sexual Offences Bill, and an offence covering trafficking for labour exploitation will be introduced when parliamentary time permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/2">We are working to support the victims of human trafficking. A pilot scheme for adult victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation was launched in March this year. The scheme is being delivered in conjunction with Eaves Housing, and provides victims with an allocated support worker, access to short-term housing, counselling and health, translation and legal services. In addition, Project Reflex, set up in May 2000, brings together the key agencies to tackle organised immigration crime, including people trafficking. An example of the success of this initiative is Project Reflex Romania, which has identified 105 criminal organisations and arrested 67 persons, of whom 20 have faced charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/3">While we are committed to combating the trafficking of human beings, we feel that the proposed European directive on the short-term residence permits for the victims of trafficking will be abused. This in turn would have a detrimental effect on the resources available to investigate and prosecute those who are involved in this abhorrent trade. It would also undermine our efforts to remove those that have entered illegally, and have no legitimate right to remain. It is for these reasons we did not opt in to this directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/4">Notwithstanding the decision not to opt in to this directive, every effort has been made to shape the progress of the directive to overcome our concerns. It is of course still open to the United Kingdom to opt in once the directive is implemented, and we intend to review our decision fully at that point. The directive is still subject to French and Dutch scrutiny reservations, and will need to be referred back to the European Parliament before implementation.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.2/1">To qualify for charitable status an organisation must be for the public benefit. The Government intend that the Charities Bill we are preparing should make this explicit. Charging fees for services or facilities does not by itself bring a charity's public benefit into doubt. In most cases fees do not in practice restrict people's access to those services or facilities. But if a charity's services are only accessible to people able to afford high fees, its public benefit may come into question. The Strategy Unit's recent review of charity law recommended that the Charity Commission, as regulator, should look into charities charging high fees&mdash;including, but not limited to, charitable independent schools&mdash;to ensure that they meet the public benefit requirement. The Government have endorsed this recommendation.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.2/1">The detention of families with children is very regrettable but it is sometimes necessary as part of maintaining an effective immigration control and in removing from the United Kingdom those who have no lawful basis to stay. It does not happen in the vast majority of cases and, where it does prove necessary, it is kept to the minimum period possible, often for only a few hours or days prior to removal. It would not, however, be appropriate to set an arbitrary time limit on such detention. To do so would take no account of the circumstances of individual families and would serve only to encourage those concerned to frustrate immigration and asylum processes in the hope of reaching a point where they would be released.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.5/1">While it is not unlawful for such a political party to register under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, it is unlawful to discriminate on racial grounds. The Race Relations Act 1976, as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, makes it unlawful to discriminate against anyone on grounds of race, colour, nationality (including citizenship), or ethnic or national origin. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created nine new racially aggravated offences which carry significantly higher penalties. It is also a criminal offence under the Public Order Act 1986 to use threatening, abusive or insulting language or behaviour in order to stir up racial hatred, including distributing racist leaflets. I would hope that the law was powerfully enforced against any organisation that behaved in these ways.</p>

A pension and lump sum was also payable under Armed Forces occupational scheme arrangements provided that certain qualifying criteria were met. A minimum period of service by the spouse of 12 years (other rank) or 10 years (officer) was required for eligibility for a widow's pension though a gratuity was payable below this.

The qualifying criteria and levels of pension paid under the AFPS were generally significantly more generous than the pre-1973 occupational provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/3">In addition, widows in both groups are eligible for the full range of social security benefits, subject to the normal rules on entitlement and abatement. These fall into three main categories. Benefits may: be paid on top of the war widow's and occupational pensions (for example, state retirement pension based on the widow's own national insurance contributions, attendance allowance and winter fuel payment); or be reduced by the amount of the war widow's pension (for example, widow's retirement pension based on the late husband's contributions; carer's allowance); or take the war widow's and occupational pensions into account as income, with disregards for the war pension (for example, with respect to pension credit; housing and council tax benefits). The first &pound;10 of a war widow's pension is disregarded as well as all of the supplementary pension (&pound;60.97) paid to a pre-1973 widow. In the case of housing benefit and council tax benefit, local authorities have the discretion to apply a further disregard up to the full amount of any war pension in payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.2/1">I refer my noble friend to my Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-16">16 September</phrase>, (Official Report, cols. WA 166&ndash;167) announcing new Armed Forces pension and compensation arrangements. The &quot;balance of probability&quot; standard of proof will be used in the new Armed Forces compensation scheme (AFCS). This standard of proof is used widely elsewhere in occupational schemes and by the civil courts. The new scheme has been designed to ensure fair, evidence-based decision-making, with the standard of proof as only one factor affecting consideration of claims. Modern systems for keeping service and medical records provide a high level of confidence that reliable evidence will be available of how an injury or illness may have arisen. Equally, the causes and likely prognosis of ill-health and injury are now much better understood than when the current standard of proof was introduced in the war pensions scheme in 1943. Any individual who is unhappy with the outcome of a claim will have right of appeal to a fully independent tribunal. We are aware of no basis for the Royal British Legion's estimate of claim elimination rates and I can confirm that we expect no reduction in the costs of the scheme as a result of the changes in design. We are confident that the new scheme will be successful in ensuring compensation in all cases where there is reasonable evidence that a condition was linked to service, as well as providing a better focus on the more severely disabled.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.0/1">The Business Banking Code sets standards of good banking practice for banks and building societies for their services to small businesses with a turnover of up to &pound;1 million a year. The Banking Code Standards Board is responsible for the development, production and continuing revision of both the Business Banking Code and the Banking Code, which relates to personal banking. The codes are reviewed every two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/2">The Competition Commission reported on banking services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in March 2002. It made a number of adverse findings and the Office of Fair Trading has subsequently agreed a series of legally binding undertakings with the main clearing banks to remedy the problems identified. Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland Group have agreed to either pay interest on SME current accounts (at least Bank of England base rate less 2.5 per cent) or provide free money transmission services. The main eight clearing groups have also signed behavioural undertakings to cover a range of issues, including measures to increase transparency of bank charges; and, most recently they have agreed measures that will make it easier for SMEs to switch bank accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.0/3">The commission also recommended a series of informal remedies. These did not arise from adverse findings and so cannot be enforced under the Fair Trading Act. They cover issues such as the provision of services at agreed cost and compensation for errors. The British Bankers Association has agreed that amendments should be made to the code to cover most of these areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.2/1">The role of the designated premises supervisor under the Licensing Act 2003 is different from that of the licensee under the Licensing Act 1964. The 2003 Act introduced the roles of the designated premises supervisor and personal licence holder, in addition to the holder of the premises licence, for those premises authorised by a premises licence to supply alcohol. The 2003 Act sets out the duties, responsibilities and liabilities of such persons and their roles will be described in the guidance issued to licensing authorities. The guidance will not, however, alter the liabilities of the various roles as set out in the 2003 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/2">The term &quot;designated premises supervisor&quot; as used in the Licensing Act 2003, does not equate or seek to replicate the term &quot;licensee&quot; as commonly understood when discussing the Licensing Act 1964.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.5/1">Under the Licensing Act 1964 the triennial sessions, the Brewster Sessions, are required to be held to renew existing liquor licences. This is not therefore a new burden being imposed by the Government. We will not abolish the Brewster Sessions until the Licensing Act 2003 is fully implemented. This is because liquor licences will remain in effect until the second appointed day, at the end of the transitional period, which is likely to be at least one year after the Brewster Sessions held in February 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/2">If we had agreed to abolish the Brewster Sessions in February 2004 and make provision for liquor licences to be automatically extended until the end of the transitional period, this would have resulted in a small number of premises causing serious problems to the community being permitted to continue trading for at least a year longer than necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.5/3">Brewster Sessions, more generally, also provide an important forum for people to make objections and oppose applications for renewal and are used to make orders cancelling licences which are currently suspended. The Government agreed to provide grandfather rights for holders of liquor licences on the basis that it accepted the industry's argument that all the holders of existing alcohol licences would have been judged to be &quot;fit and proper&quot; by the licensing justices under the existing regime. Such judgments are subject to regular review at the Brewster Sessions. Under the &quot;grandfather rights&quot; established in the 2003 Act interested parties and responsible authorities (with the exception of the police) are not entitled to object to the grant of a premises licence when applications are made to convert existing licences with the result that it is important that the opportunity to object at the review at the Brewster Session in 2004 is retained.</p>

The directive prohibits filtered and baker's honey from including supplementary information referring to its floral or vegetable origin, regional, territorial or topological origin or specific quality criteria. &quot;Filtered&quot; honey consists of a blend of different honeys, which is subjected to a fine filtration process removing virtually all the characterising pollen needed to authenticate such claims. Baker's honey is not sold directly to consumers. It is used primarily in processed foods containing honey as an ingredient. There were no objections to this provision in consultations during negotiation of the directive and transposition.</p>

	<p pid="a.266.6/1">Under the &quot;Managing Radioactive Waste Safely&quot; programme, the UK Government and devolved administrations have asked the new independent Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) to oversee a review of the options for the long-term management of the UK's higher activity radioactive wastes. This review will involve an extensive programme of public and stakeholder engagement. The kinds of management options to be considered were discussed in Appendix 1 of the original Managing Radioactive Waste Safely consultation document published in September 2001, and include various forms of disposal and long-term storage. As part of its programme, CoRWM will evaluate all the options for long-term management against a set of common criteria that take into account public and stakeholder group views so as to recommend the best future policy. The committee has been asked to aim to provide its recommendations to government around the end of 2005. One of its first tasks will be to submit a detailed work plan for agreement with its sponsoring Ministers in Defra and the devolved administrations. It will be for CoRWM to decide whether or not it wishes to employ consultants to support them in their option assessment work. To date none has been engaged by the committee.</p>
