	<p pid="a.118.8/1">Independent epidemiological modelling has identified that the introduction of electronic identification (EID) and individual recording could reduce costs of managing an outbreak of exotic disease over the current UK system by up to 13 per cent, as a result of fewer infected premises and fewer animals being culled. It will also improve our ability to track individual animal movements.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.8/2">The direct financial benefits to the UK of implementing EID in accordance with EU law is a reduced risk of single farm payment disallowance and of EU infraction proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.8/3">There will also be management benefits for those farmers who want to make use of EID and gather individual performance data to make their businesses more profitable.

Civilian enforcement officers are bound by contracts of employment with Her Majesty's Courts Service and must adhere to any requirements that the contract refers.

However Her Majesty's Courts Service believes the certification process provides an increased assurance that staff working on these contracts are of sufficient quality and standing to carry out an important public function. The contracts stipulate that bailiffs employed by private bailiff companies which undertake work on behalf of Her Majesty's Court Service must be certificated.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.6/1">The current financial incentive mechanism for renewables, the renewables obligation, is not relevant to the distribution of allowances in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/2">Large electricity producers (LEPs) have received fewer EU ETS allowances in phase II of the system for three main reasons: first, because the power sector has faced the effort required under the cap; secondly, the LEPs have to contribute to allowances in the new entrant reserve (NER); and thirdly, the allowances available for auctioning in phase II have been taken from those previously allocated for free to the power sector. From 2013 there will be 100 per cent auctioning to the power sector in the UK, which will remove the issue of windfall profits as a result of passing through costs to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.6/3">Passing on the cost of EU allowances is a rational response from firms and it is also a desired response from the point of view of the effectiveness of the EU ETS.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.0/1">Recent international reviews analysing large numbers of evaluations of drug treatment programmes have concluded that, on average, drug treatment programmes reduce reoffending<sup>1</sup>. Drug interventions shown to be effective included: methadone treatment, heroin treatment, therapeutic communities, psycho-social approaches and drug courts. The most effective interventions to reduce drug-related crime seemed to be therapeutic communities, psychosocial approaches and drug courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/2">For offences committed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced the community order, which replaced all previous community sentences, including community rehabilitation orders (CROs) and drug treatment and testing orders (DTTOs), for adult offenders. Under the Act, the court may impose a community order with a drug rehabilitation requirement (DRR). No robust assessment has been made to date of DRRs' effect on reducing reoffending, however research<sup>2</sup> concluded that DTTOs can reduce spending on drugs and reoffending, although it was not possible to determine to what extent these changes were due to the DTTO or whether other factors also contributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/3">A community-based research study, NTORS (National Treatment Outcome Research Study), showed that, for every additional &pound;l spent on drug treatment, there was a return of at least &pound;9.50 in the cost savings associated with victim costs of crime and reduced demands being made on the CJS<sup>3</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/4">Similarly, research into a cohort of individuals entering the drug interventions programme (DIP) in the community found that offending levels were around 26 per cent lower in the six months following identification by DIP through a positive drug test in the custody suite<sup>4</sup>.</p>

The most effective interventions to reduce drug-related crime seemed to be therapeutic communities, psycho-social approaches and drug courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/2">The evaluations to date of drug treatment programmes in prisons in the UK are limited but suggest that these programmes can reduce reoffending<sup>2</sup>. For example, prisoners who completed the 12-step RAN programme had statistically significantly lower rates of reconviction after two years than a comparison group (40 per cent versus 50 per cent)&mdash;although there may be selection bias<sup>3</sup> here; for example, motivation to participate.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.0/3">The best available measure of drug prevalence in prisons is the random mandatory drug testing (rMDT) programme, which routinely tests prisoners chosen at random for a panel of drugs. The rMDT positives level shows drug use in custody declining since 1996-97, down from 24.4 per cent to 9.1 per cent in 2007-08<sup>4</sup>. For a number of reasons, MDT results cannot be a complete measure of the prevalence of drugs misuse in prisons. However, MDT results do provide a reliable and statistically valid way of measuring patterns and trends of drug-misuse<sup>5</sup>.</p>

The reoffending rate for all offenders who had undertaken interventions was 55 per cent, based on a two-year reconviction rate.

The HFEA informs me that with regard to Professor Alan Trounson, it has not considered the report of the Australian Senate.

	<p pid="a.133.2/1">Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 50/2008 &quot;Acceptable Activities in Prisons&quot; makes clear that prison governors and equivalents in contracted prisons are responsible for all activities that take place in their respective establishments and gives them a framework to make appropriate decisions. The PSI includes mandatory instructions that will lead to consistent standards that safeguard the reputation of the service by requiring greater scrutiny from senior managers.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/2">The Government recognise the contribution that creative activities can make, particularly for prisoners who find it difficult to engage in more academic or conventional programmes. We are committed to working with third sector organisations to provide a range of services in prisons, including those who provide arts and creative programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/3">However, prisons are places which are, rightly, under intense public scrutiny. It is essential that the National Offender Management Service is able to justify all aspects of prison life to the public. Before making a decision about whether a particular activity should be approved to go ahead, governors must consider both how an activity is likely to be perceived by the public and by victims and whether it meets the Prison Service objectives effectively, regardless of whether the event was made know to the public by the media. They must take appropriate and proportionate account of both public acceptability and effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.2/1">This is the worst cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe's history. It is a clear indication of the degradation of water, sanitation and health services under the failed and destructive policies of the Mugabe regime. The whole country has been affected and the outbreak is not yet fully under control and statistics change daily&mdash;as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-21">21 January</phrase>, 48,623 people had been affected, with 2,755 deaths. South Africa has seen almost 3,000 cases reported and 32 deaths, the majority of them attributable to the Zimbabwe outbreak. In other neighbouring countries there have been a handful of cases linked to Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/2">The international community is working hard to bring the outbreak under control, against a backdrop of country-wide collapsing health systems and the failure of the regime to grasp the seriousness of the situation. The Department for International Development (DfID) has made &pound;10 million available to support essential medical services, to provide cholera response kits and to make clean drinking water available in affected areas. We have also been actively engaged in supporting a World Health Organisation-led command-and-control centre to coordinate the international cholera response.</p>
