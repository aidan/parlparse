However, we are not complacent and the department continues both to monitor the outcome of research into theoretical risks from fluoridation and fund studies into its effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/3">Information is not currently available on the number of patients who undergo dental treatment because they are concerned about the aesthetic effect of dental fluorosis, but we are funding a research study on the measurement of fluorosis, which should enable estimates to be made.</p>

Guidance relating to education will be subject to a period of public consultation before being issued on a statutory footing in the autumn&mdash;which will make more robust the requirement to implement the guidance.

This guidance is being revised and will be reissued on a statutory footing. The Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 makes it clear that a person exercising public functions to whom guidance is given under the Act must have regard to it in the exercise of those functions. We would expect bodies that inspect and/or regulate healthcare professionals and education authorities to check that such responsibilities are being met. In the case of education, the Office for Standards in Education already makes a judgment on safeguarding and we would expect compliance with relevant statutory guidance to be considered in reaching that judgment. Should the Forced Marriage Unit become aware of any organisation not following the statutory guidance it will of course raise this with the relevant authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.5/1">Former UK resident, Mr Shaker Aamer is still being held in Guantanamo Bay. The Government requested in August 2007 that he be released from Guantanamo Bay and returned to the UK. The US has so far declined this request on the basis of significant security concerns that it has about Mr Aamer, and we are no longer in active discussions regarding his transfer to the UK. However, we continue to discuss his welfare with the US. Should the US position change, our request for his release and return stands.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.0/1">We regularly raise the issue of Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights with the Russian authorities and will continue to do so at every appropriate opportunity, including through the bilateral and EU/Russia human rights dialogues. The next EU/Russia human rights meeting is scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-17">17 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/2">Both the UK and Russia agree on the need for reform of the European Court of Human Rights to ensure it functions more effectively. The UK believes that Protocol 14 must be implemented to achieve this goal. We are disappointed that Russia is the only Council of Europe member state not to have ratified the protocol. We, in concert with the majority of Council of Europe member states, the EU presidency and other EU member states have called on Russia to ratify Protocol 14 swiftly.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.3/1">My noble friend, Lord Falconer of Thoroton made a Statement to this House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June 2007</phrase>. The estimated set-up cost of the Supreme Court remains at &pound;56.9 million. However, as is to be expected in a building of this age, some damage to the fabric of the building has been found, which we are investigating. I will make a Statement to the House when the full extent of the damage is known.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.6/1">HMRC maintains an ongoing dialogue with all large companies about their tax planning activities and where avoidance through artificial structures or artificial schemes is identified, HMRC will take robust action to counter this. Avoidance is unfair on the majority of taxpayers who do pay their fair share, and undermines the funding of public services.</p>
