	<p pid="b.217.2/1">The allocation of commons for hill farm allowance and single payment scheme purposes is based on the commons rights held by applicants. It is natural, therefore, that the Rural Payments Agency should work from the registers of such rights established under the Commons Registration Act 1965. However, a number of industry representatives have raised issues about the allocation of commons for SPS purposes and these will be considered further with those concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.26/1">In England, a cross-government national health inequalities strategy, <I>Tackling Health Inequalities: A Programme for Action</I>, is in place to deliver the 2010 health inequalities target to narrow the gap in infant mortality and life expectancy at birth. This is complemented by innovative programmes such as NHS Health Trainers, NHS Life Check, and Communities for Health which will examine new approaches to tackling health inequalities and are being implemented first in spearhead areas&mdash;the local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators, and the primary care trusts mapping to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.26/2">The spearhead areas contain 44 per cent of the black and minority ethnic population of England, despite containing only 28 per cent of the total population of England, based on the 2001 census population counts, so effective action to tackle inequalities in these areas is likely to have a disproportionate, and beneficial, effect on the health of black and minority ethnic groups in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.26/3">The National Health Service in England operating framework 2007-08 identified tackling health inequalities as a key priority for the NHS. Primary care trusts (PCTs) should continue to use needs assessment systematically to identify and address the specific needs of different groups in their local populations. PCTs should be working in partnership to commission services tailored to meet the needs of disabled people, people with learning disabilities, people from black and minority ethnic communities and people from different gender, sexual orientation and age groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.26/4">Incentives for the NHS and local authorities have also been aligned to encourage partnership working to deliver the 2010 target, with health inequalities a mandatory target for spearhead PCT local delivery plans for 2007-08, and for local authority local area agreements from 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.26/5">Further action will flow from the recent review of the infant mortality aspect of the target, <I>Review of the Health Inequalities Infant Mortality PSA Target, 2007</I>. This review considered the further action needed to narrow the infant mortality gap across a range of measures, including key interventions. It also highlighted the concern that some black and minority ethnic groups have higher infant mortality rates compared with the rest of the population. An implementation plan to carry forward the recommendations of the review is in preparation, and will be published in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.26/6">National support teams on health inequalities and on tobacco control will disseminate best practice across spearhead areas, and areas with high infant mortality rates, providing intensive support for those areas that need it.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.41/1">The majority of the provisions of the Bill deal with the same subject matter as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, which is reserved legislation. The Bill extends to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland except that provisions which amend existing legislation have the same extent as the legislation that they are amending. This particularly affects the amendments that are made to the Human Tissue Act 2004 which extends only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.41/2">Most of the powers to make secondary legislation for which the Bill provides are exercisable by the Secretary of State. Before exercising the power in Clause 73 to make consequential and transitional provision by order, the Secretary of State is required to consult the Scottish Ministers if an order contains provision which would, if included in an Act of the Scottish Parliament, be within the legislative competence of that Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.41/3">The United Kingdom Government are committed to full consultation with the new devolved Administration in Scotland on the potential implications for devolved interests of the provisions in the draft Bill. Similarly, the implications of the restoration of devolution in Northern Ireland will need to be considered. Department officials are also in contact with colleagues at the devolved Administration in Scotland and the relevant Northern Ireland department.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.44/1">The End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulations 2005 apply only to passenger cars and light vans, and the obligations on manufacturers to provide dismantling information set down in the End-of-Life Vehicles Regulations 2003 is similarly restricted to such vehicles. However, my officials are shortly to initiate discussions with the heavy commercial vehicle segment of the automotive industry, with a view to exploring the case for manufacturers to provide dismantling information. The International Dismantling Information System (IDIS) was voluntarily set up by vehicle manufacturers and I understand that the IDIS2 Consortium Steering Committee is prepared to consider including treatment data on heavy commercial vehicles in their database.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.47/1">Guidance on the control of marine minerals dredging from the English seabed is provided by the Government's marine minerals guidance note<I></I>1 and the new marine minerals guidance note 2. The latter provides guidance on the recently implemented regulations which transpose the environmental impact assessment directive and the habitats directive for such dredging in England and Northern Ireland. The Environment Impact Assessment and Natural Habitats (Extraction of Minerals by Marine Dredging) (England and Northern Ireland) Regulations 2007 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May 2007</phrase>, formalising a practice which was previously carried out on a non-statutory basis. The regulations provide for environmental impact assessments and appropriate assessments where required for activities associated with the marine aggregate industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.47/2">Natural England is working, in liaison with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science on a regional monitoring programme for plume effects from dredging and screening activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.47/3">Defra has also initiated additional research through the Marine Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF). This includes biodiversity and fisheries-related research, such as turbidity, screening and plume effects. Defra has arranged for the outputs of the MALSF to be collated into a book which will be launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-03">3 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.47/4">A number of studies have already been carried out on sediment plumes associated with aggregate extraction. The effects of plumes on fisheries and nature conservation features mainly centre around the potential for a fisheries resource (normally a spawning ground) or a conservation feature to be smothered by the settling fine material. During the preliminary site selection and environmental impact assessment, efforts are made to ensure that such sites and features are avoided where possible, or the impact is mitigated to avoid any adverse environmental impact on the resource or feature. Such mitigation would normally consist of timing restrictions of dredging and/or screening activity at a particular location. Consequently, general conclusions from research in such areas suggest that sediment plumes and increased water column turbidity as a result of aggregate dredging are localised, and background levels are returned to relatively quickly.</p>
