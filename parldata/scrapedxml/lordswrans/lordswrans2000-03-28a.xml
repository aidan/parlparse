	<p pid="a.65.5/1">It is notoriously difficult to predict trends in visitor numbers and expenditure by tourists one year ahead, and we would be unwise to try to do so for the next decade. We are not able to forecast the possible effects of exchange rates on the tourism industry in or out of the euro zone in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/2">We are working hard, however, to ensure that tourism businesses in the UK are fully informed about the euro and the introduction of euro currency. My department chairs a working group which seeks to raise awareness of the impact of the euro on tourism businesses and to disseminate information to the industry.</p>

The methodology of evaluation and monitoring will be developed by a researcher whom DCMS expects to appoint next month. DCMS will have initial findings from a sample of projects after 12 months and will also undertake some longer-term research. The research programme will continue to be discussed with an advisory group, and conclusions reached following the research programme will be published, including on the DCMS website, and shared with DCMS sponsored bodies, other departments, local authorities and the voluntary and private sectors.</p>
