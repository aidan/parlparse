	<p pid="a.211.2/1">Given the existing surplus of vaccine, Defra will not be underwriting the purchase of additional vaccine for livestock keepers in 2009; it will be for livestock keepers themselves to procure sufficient vaccine for their stock. This approach to vaccine supply, developed with the core group of industry stakeholders, has been adopted for two reasons:</p>
	<p pid="a.211.2/2">1. Around 12 million doses of vaccine remain in the supply chain from the 28 million bought for England in 2008. Defra is making this vaccine available to livestock keepers for use in 2009, and will go a long way to supplying likely demand in 2009.2. BTV-8 vaccine is expected to be readily available from three manufacturers who are supplying vaccine direct to the market. This was not the case earlier in the year when Defra had to stimulate supply by placing a firm order. Defra's actions have now stimulated the market to the degree that continued intervention by Defra is not necessary to ensure supply of additional vaccine, which can be delivered through the open market.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.2/3">However, Defra will monitor uptake regularly in 2009 and reserves the right to intervene in the event of supply problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">The Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (England) Regulations 2008 apply the sanctions necessary to ensure compliance with obligations imposed directly on livestock keepers and others by &quot;the Community TSE Regulation&quot;; namely, Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-22">22 May 2001</phrase>. These lay down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, as amended from time to time and as read with relevant Commission decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">Livestock farmers do therefore need to be aware of the requirements imposed upon them by this EU Regulation to ensure that they comply with the law. However, Defra provides guidance on these requirements both via its website and directly. For example, we recently wrote to all cattle keepers in England to explain the new requirements for testing fallen cattle for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and to remind them that it is a notifiable disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">The sanctions referred to are those that apply on summary conviction for the offence in regulation 17 of intentionally obstructing an inspector. These sanctions, consisting of a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months, have regard to the sanctions imposed on summary conviction for the similar offence of obstruction in Section 66 of the Animal Health Act 1981. These sanctions, imposed under Section 75 of the Animal Health Act, differ only in that the maximum term of imprisonment is six months, as opposed to three months. This is because the TSE (England) Regulations 2008 were made under the European Communities Act 1972 and are therefore subject to the restriction in Schedule 2 to that Act which limits the term of imprisonment which may be imposed on summary conviction for an offence created under the Act to three months.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.2/1">In 2006 Defra held a public consultation on the bird registration scheme (Schedule 4 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) to investigate the regulatory burden the scheme places on bird keepers.

	<p pid="a.214.2/2">Species of wild birds that are listed in Schedule 4 may be kept in captivity only if specimens are certified by a vet as being unfit to return to the wild.

	<p pid="a.215.5/1">We are not proposing to make any changes in relation to the status of British nationals within the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill. We have already made provision for those holding other forms of British nationality to register as British citizens. If a person lives in the United Kingdom for a period of five years, and meets certain residence requirements, he or she can apply for registration under Section 4(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981. Since April 2003, British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons have been able to apply for registration under Section 4B of that Act if they do not have any other nationality. The British Nationality Hong Kong Act 1997 also provides for the registration of those who would otherwise be stateless and are ordinarily resident in Hong Kong.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.5/2">In his citizenship review Lord Goldsmith noted that there are particular legal reasons why we need to retain the category of British National (Overseas) with links to Hong Kong, because of our treaty commitments. He also acknowledged that the status of British overseas territories citizen needs to continue in order to recognise connections to a particular overseas territory as well as to Britain.

	<p pid="a.215.5/3">We are of the view, however, that any changes to the status of those in these three groups at this time would still leave complications in the overall nationality framework, and that our earlier reforms and the passage of time will have the combined effect of reducing any current anomalies.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Justice announced the Government's intention to develop a number of intensive alternative to custody demonstrator projects. These aim to encourage diversion from custody by enhancing the supervision that offenders receive on community sentences while building sentencer confidence in their effectiveness. The projects are designed to use current legislation to maximise the use of the community order in those cases where the court may be considering custody but where the National Probation Service believes a community sentence may be more effective in reducing reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.5/3">The projects seek to develop learning and improve practice in the application of intensive community sentences as an alternative to short-term custody. There are seven projects across the country. The Derbyshire project started in March 2008; West Yorkshire in August; South Wales and Dyfed-Powys in September. The remaining three (Greater Manchester, Merseyside, and Humberside) are scheduled to begin in April 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.5/1">The decision to sign the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was reached in the light of our work towards ratification of the convention itself, and the outcome of the independent review into the UK's experience of ratifying the similar Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In response to that review, the Government said that they would consider the merits of signing any other individual complaints mechanisms on a case-by-case basis. In the case of the Disability Convention, while disabled people already have access to various domestic mechanisms for enforcing their rights, we considered that signing the Optional Protocol would underline the messages in the convention about respect for the human rights of disabled people. Signature of the Optional Protocol to the Disability Convention does not set a precedent for acceding to other complaints mechanisms which will continue to be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.0/1">The discrepancy concerning the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil in the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (RTFO) Order 2007 (No. 3072) means that any fossil fuel which is blended with renewable fuel before the excise duty point is excluded from the calculation of a supplier's obligation. The result is that less fossil fuel than was intended is taken into account in calculating suppliers' obligations, and therefore less renewable fuel is required to be supplied than was intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/2">Fossil fuel that is supplied to the consumer separately from biodiesel or bioethanol or is blended after it passes the duty point will be taken into account in calculating a supplier's obligation. It will be a matter for obligated suppliers to determine how they supply their fuels and meet their obligation under the RTFO scheme for the year 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/3">Any supplier of fossil fuel in the UK is subject to the obligation regardless of whether its Head Office is located within or outside the UK. A supplier can meet its obligation in three ways: through supplying biofuel; purchasing certificates from other suppliers of biofuel; or by buying out of its obligation. The 2007 RTFO order provides for the Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA) to require suppliers to report volumes of fossil and biofuel supplied and this information will be used to determine a supplier's obligation and if it has been met. Provisions in the Climate Change Act 2008 provide for information to be supplied to the RFA by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise to verify these reports. Information about how suppliers have complied with their obligation will be made available in the RFA's reports to Government and Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/4">The full effect of the discrepancy on the volume of biofuel supplied in the first obligation year (2008-09) will not be known until after the end of the obligation year. Following a consultation, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-28">28 January</phrase> the Government announced our intention to introduce legislation to slow down the rate at which the obligation increases until 2013-14. A draft order was laid in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-09">9 February</phrase> to amend the obligation levels specified in the 2007 Order and this sets a level of 3.25 per cent of total fuel supplied for 2009-10. We have proposed a higher level than the 3 per cent level proposed in the consultation and have taken into account concerns expressed by producers about the effects of the discrepancy on biofuel demand during the first obligation year as well as environmental concerns about biofuel levels.</p>

In light of the protections in domestic law that I outlined in my previous Answer (col. <I>WA 58</I>, <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-28">28 January 2009</phrase>), the mechanisms that already exist in international law for regular periodic examination of the UK's compliance with the ICCPR, and the findings of the review of our experience of individual petition under the Optional Protocol to the Convention for the Elimination of All Form of Discrimination Against Women&mdash;CEDAW (col. 11WS, <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-04">4 December 2008</phrase>), the Government do not consider there is sufficient evidence that additional practical benefit would be provided by accepting the right of individual petition in respect of complaints under the ICCPR.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.8/2">The Government do not consider it necessary to undertake a further evaluation in respect of the handling of individual petitions by the UN Human Rights Committee because of the nature of the UN monitoring committee processes (that they cannot, for example, give legal rulings) and because of the conclusions of the review on the CEDAW experiment.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.5/2">The main finding in the judgment is that the words &quot;place of meeting for religious worship&quot; in the Act connote a place of which the principal use is for people to come together as a congregation to worship God or do reverence to a deity. Apart from the Church of England and the Church in Wales, any faith or denomination which meets these criteria would be capable of recognition under the 1855 Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.0/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) spends significant sums of money in delivering its responsibilities of protecting the public and reducing reoffending. In addition to the ongoing costs involved in holding terrorist prisoners securely and running effective regimes, NOMS is taking forward a multi-disciplinary programme of work funded by the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT). Over the last three years OSCT has provided the following: 2005-06 &pound;65,463, 2006-07 &pound;140,535 and 2007-08 &pound;822,542. Funding of &pound;2.7 million has been allocated by OSCT for 2008 09.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.9/2">The Law Commission has a statutory duty to keep the law of England and Wales under review with a view to its systematic development and reform. This includes the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary legislation, including secondary legislation. However, the commission focuses its resources in this area of work on the repeal of obsolete primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.9/3">Individual departments also keep secondary legislation for which they are responsible under regular review and will revoke previous instruments which have become obsolete when new secondary legislation is introduced. For example the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/3538) completely revoked 26 instruments and 17 others insofar as they applied to England and Wales. If an enabling Act, or the enabling section of the Act, is repealed, instruments made under it will lapse unless they are saved. Secondary legislation may also become spent, either because it was expressed to have effect only for a limited period, or because it no longer has any effect. Many instruments therefore cease to have effect without the need for them to be specifically revoked.</p>

This study, which began in June 2007, is being undertaken at the Moredun Institute and is costing around &pound;100,000 per annum for three years. Furthermore, the Wildlife Ark Trust has raised &pound;250,000 of funding for the first stage of a programme which will last two years, to develop a squirrelpox vaccine for the red squirrel.</p>
