	<p pid="a.115.2/1">The current legislation provides that fingerprints taken from an asylum seeker should be destroyed as soon as reasonably practicable after they are granted indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. Until the introduction of the computerised fingerprint system in December 2000, it was not practicable routinely to weed and destroy prints. We are now taking a power within the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill which will allow such prints to be retained for 10 years. New functionality in the computerised fingerprint system will make it possible to identify and destroy prints after 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.8/1">We have today placed in the Library a copy of the proposals of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary for allocation of police grant for 2002&ndash;03. We intend to implement the proposals subject to consideration of any representations we receive about them and to the approval of the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/2">We are taking the opportunity to outline the wider provision for support for the police service. This includes not only total standard spending (TSS), supported by police grant and revenue support grant, but also provision for capital, specific initiatives (Crime Fighting Fund, rural policing, Airwave) and operational and administrative support directly provided by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/3">The total provision made in Spending Review 2000 for policing in 2002&ndash;03 is &pound;9,010 million. The overall increase on provision for 2001&ndash;02 is 6.1 per cent. It builds on an increase in 2001&ndash;02 of 10.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/4">The increase in provision directly available to police authorities for TSS, specific initiatives and capital grant and supplementary credit approvals is 5 per cent. In addition, there are increases in provision of services provided centrally for the police service&mdash;training, information technology, communications and scientific support.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/5">We propose to distribute the settlement as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.115.8/24">(1) Rounded to &pound; million.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/25">(2) The original 2001&ndash;02 provision has been adjusted for National Crime Squad (NCS) and the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS).</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/26">Total standard spending (TSS)</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/27">Police funding proposals within the Local Government finance system are being announced today by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. An announcement has also been made in the National Assembly for Wales. These proposals together would provide total standard spending on the police in England and Wales of &pound;7,777.199 million, an increase of &pound;209 million or 2.8 per cent on the adjusted TSS for 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/28">The National Crime Squad (NCS) and the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) perform a valuable role in the battle against serious crime as part of the overall policing service. The NCS brought together the previous regional crime squads into a single unit, providing direction and control and making it easier to deploy resources effectively to prevent and detect serious crime and tackle major criminals operating in one or more police force areas in England and Wales. The role of NCIS is to develop intelligence to combat serious and organised crime, providing both tactical and strategic intelligence and expertise for law enforcement, government and other relevant agencies at a national and international level. At present these services are financed mainly by a levy on police authorities set by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. From 2002&ndash;03 the services will be funded centrally. The new approach achieves transparency in the funding arrangements for the service authorities. Provision for the services in 2002&ndash;03 has been made from TSS. TSS for 2001&ndash;02 has been adjusted in the previous table to ensure comparability.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/29">The increase in TSS is 2.8 per cent, but increases for individual authorities vary. The formula used to determine the distribution of grant standard spending assessment (SSA) is again unchanged. The main reasons for differences between authorities result from changes in the data applied from one year to the next. These include changes in population, unemployment, projected pensions' commitments and the area cost adjustment.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/30">We propose that the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) should continue to receive additional funding in recognition of its distinct national and capital city functions. It has proved very difficult for the principal formula to take account of these special circumstances. As in previous years, a special payment of grant will be made to the MPS above that given through the principal grant formula. The amount has been set at &pound;197 million, which is included in the total provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/31">It is proposed to make a final year's special payment of grant to the following authorities for additional costs incurred as a result of changes in Metropolitan Police district boundaries in April 2002, as follows:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.115.8/34"> <td></td> <td></td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.115.8/39">TSS allocations are a mechanism for distributing grant. Provisional grants for police authorities in 2002&ndash;03 compared with the adjusted figure for 2001&ndash;02 are given in Table 2. Protection has been given to authorities which would otherwise have received a low grant increase over 2001&ndash;02 by applying a Xfloor&quot; or minimum increase of 2.3 per cent, in line with inflation. The associated TSS allocations are given in Table 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/40">The following items are not part of the annual grant settlement but demonstrate the wider range of support provided to police authorities. Special initiatives The main items are:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/41">Crime Fighting Fund (CFF): through the CFF resources are being provided for a programme of recruitment over and above forces previous plans. The programme has so far lived up to expectations: &pound;221 million is included in 2002&ndash;03 to continue funding around 6,000 recruits from 2000&ndash;01 to 2001&ndash;02 and to support a further 3,000 to be recruited in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/42">Rural Policing Fund: as in 2001&ndash;02, &pound;30 million is provided for the particular needs of more rural forces through the Rural Policing Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/43">Airwave: &pound;65 million will be available for the start-up operational costs of authorities taking Airwave in 2002&ndash;03 and to enable those forces who have the Airwave service to purchase additional menu services from BT.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/44">London and south east payments: &pound;33 million in total is provided for funding of free train travel for all Metropolitan and City of London officers; funding of 75 per cent of the cost of the increase of &pound;3,327 a year in London allowance paid to officers in the Metropolitan and City of London forces who were recruited on or after <phrase class="date" code="1994-09-01">1 September 1994</phrase> and who are not in receipt of housing emoluments, and an allowance for other forces in the south east. Police authority capital The main items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/45">We intend to increase provision of capital grant and supplementary credit approvals from &pound;157.43 million in 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;209.43 million in 2002&ndash;03. The increase is substantial, and police authorities will be asked to direct a significant proportion of the extra provision towards improvement of their estate, as well as providing for other capital assets such as vehicles and equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/46">Capital grants (up to &pound;76 million) for introduction of Airwave will be made available to those authorities taking up the radio communications service in 2002&ndash;03. Similar arrangements were made for 2001&ndash;02 and will be made for 2003&ndash;04. Centrally provided services</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/47">The main elements are CFF training costs (&pound;23 million); DNA expansion programme (&pound;61 million); the Airwave contractor's core service charges (&pound;50 million); and the National Strategy for Police Information Systems (&pound;27 million). Central administration</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/48">These include Home Office costs attributable to policing such as the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) and national police training facilities. Enhanced security since <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/49">Additional provision of &pound;30 million has also been made through the pre-Budget review for the police response during the current year to events of <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> in the United States of America. We are considering further any longer-term implications for policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/50">The settlement continues to take account of our commitment to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the police service. Future grant allocations will be considered in the light of police authorities improving efficiency by 2 per cent, reprioritising use of resources in favour of front-line policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.8/51">In addition to the resources which we have detailed specifically for policing, police forces share in and benefit from various wider programmes for crime reduction. For example, since April 1999, under the Crime Reduction Programme, over &pound;390 million has been invested in the running and evaluation of over 1,450 crime-fighting projects. These will provide an evidence base on what methods, employed by the police and their crime and disorder partners, are the most effective in tackling crime and its causes.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.8/1">Recording separated service for all service personnel is a key objective of the Armed Forces' personnel strategy, reflecting its importance in our efforts to manage the effect of operational tempo on the family lives of our people. The provision of systems to capture this information from a widely dispersed and highly mobile population is a difficult task and there are competing demands for the technical resources required. We have made a substantial investment in the development of this capability, and its coverage will be extended to all parts of the services as soon as it is practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.8/2">Since 1997, the RAF has provided a facility for its personnel to record periods of separation of three days or longer. The naval service commenced recording separation on a daily basis for the majority of its personnel in September this year. The Army conducted trials of a recording system in some of its units earlier this year and intends to implement a universal recording system as soon as the technical modifications to its personnel information systems can be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.8/3">The frequency and duration of separation varies very widely between the armed services, and people joining their chosen service do so with appropriate expectations. While this information is of great importance to the services in managing their people, it is in no way a benchmark for comparison with any other type of employment or even for comparison within the services. We do not believe it would be helpful to produce aggregated statistics for the amount of separated service undertaken by each individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.8/4">Although separated service can be a strain on service families, it should not be seen as a wholly negative factor. The prospect of overseas deployment is a very powerful attraction to potential recruits and the vast majority of service personnel relish the opportunity to put their skills to use on operations and exercises.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.9/7" class="indent">there should be a new strategy group comprising the council chief executives and the Director General of the Research Councils to achieve these aims, and to provide a framework for cross-council working at all levels;</p>
	<p pid="a.126.9/8" class="indent">with a clearer identity and mission, the councils as a group will be able to develop closer links with the other major science funders, including the funding councils, government departments and the major charities;</p>
	<p pid="a.126.9/9" class="indent">they will also be able to work more closely with other key stakeholders, including the universities and the business and public service organisations which use their research and trained people;</p>
	<p pid="a.126.9/10" class="indent">to capitalise on these stronger relationships and closer working, and to ensure delivery of key objectives, the research councils and DTI need to develop a stronger strategic framework for science and a long-term strategic road map towards which the full range of players in science can direct their efforts.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">Our focus on standards is having a positive impact in schools. Pupils in general and boys in particular are more engaged and motivated through structured lessons, the greater interactivity between teachers and pupils and the pace of lessons advocated by the national literacy and numeracy strategies in primary schools and the key stage 3 strategy in the early years of secondary education.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">In recent telephone surveys, 87 per cent of primary headteachers polled said that pupils were positive about the literacy hour, and 36 per cent said it was closing the achievement gap between boys and girls; and 81 per cent of primary heads also said the numeracy strategy had improved pupils' attitudes to mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/3">Early piloting work in key stage 3 is showing similar perceptions, with over 70 per cent of headteachers reporting that the strategy had improved pupils' motivation and engagement. Boys have shown improvements in this year's national curriculum tests for 14 year-olds: in English there was an increase of 1 per cent on last year and in science an increase of 5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/4">And boys are doing better at key stage 4: they have improved by 2 per cent in their attainment of five or more grade A*-C GCSEs in the three academic years since 1999.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.3/1">The Government published the Transforming Youth Work consultative document in March 2001, which recognised several issues concerning recruitment, training and retention of good quality youth workers. We have embarked on a review of qualification training with key external partners and stakeholders. The review will consider a comprehensive strategy for the selection, recruitment, training, retention, and employment of a well qualified workforce.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/2">The responsibility for the employment of youth workers rests with the employing body (usually a local authority or voluntary sector organisation) and as such they are subject to a range of statutory employment requirements, including procedures for checking the background of applicants through guidance provided by the Criminal Records Bureau and by the use of its disclosure service.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/3">The recruitment of Connexions personnel to work directly with young people is subject to the satisfactory completion of rigorous vetting procedures. These personnel are also required to follow codes of conduct in line with the Home Office guidance Caring for young people and the vulnerable? , intended to protect young people from sexual abuse and avoid situations where allegations of abuse, whether justified or unfounded, could be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/4">Where learning mentors are recruited as part of the Excellence in Cities programme, the guidance is that schools and local authorities should make sure that all applicants for learning mentor posts are thoroughly checked to ensure they are suitable to work with young people. This includes undertaking police and other background checks.</p>
