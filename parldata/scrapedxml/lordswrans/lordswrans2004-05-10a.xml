	<p pid="a.3.2/1">Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) requirements are defined in terms of aircraft performance, which are the product of many factors, including weight, drag, and engine thrust. At current engine thrust and drag values, the Short Take Off/Vertical Landing variant of the JSF is some 3,300 lbs overweight to meet its stipulated performance levels. Work is in hand in the United States to examine options to ensure that the overall performance requirements are met, addressing all possible options including a significant reduction in aircraft weight. This work will not mature in detail until early 2005, although an interim assessment of likely outcome in summer 2004 will enable performance against the United Kingdom's key user requirements to be preliminary evaluated at that time.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">The main form of no win, no fee arrangement permitted in England and Wales is a conditional fee agreement (CFA) which was introduced in 1995 and reformed in 2000. CFAs are providing access to justice for thousands of people with meritorious claims, are helping to increase early settlement and providing defendants with a system in which they are more likely to recover their costs in successfully defended cases. There has been satellite litigation concerning CFAs and related legal costs issues which prompted the Government to undertake a review of the CFA arrangements. This review, which is near completion has found that the current legislative arrangements are unnecessarily complex, may be difficult for many consumers fully to understand and provided scope for technical challenges by defendants. We plan to address this by bringing forward by the summer proposals to simplify the secondary legislation. This should help to ensure that the simple concept of no win, no fee translates into simpler agreements that are easier to undertstand and work even better for the consumer, are more straightforward for legal representatives to use and are more resistant to technical challenge.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.11/1">The Pension Protection Fund is just one of the measures the Government are taking to improve protection for members of occupational pension schemes. Its purpose is to strengthen protection for the pensions of individual scheme members by being funded through a levy on schemes, but in such a way as to avoid overburdening levy payers.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.11/2">Rather than being charged directly to individual scheme members the Pension Protection Fund levy will be charged to the defined benefit pension fund via the scheme's trustees. In this way, the levy will represent a debt on the employer in the first instance, although trustees will be left to judge how the levy could be shared as they see fit among employers and employees as one of the overall pensions costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.11/3">We appreciate that the PPF levy represents an additional cost for business, but we are seeking to minimise this cost and ensure the levy is calculated in the fairest possible way, and are confident that the benefits will outweigh any burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.11/4">Furthermore, the PPF forms part of a substantial and balanced package of measures seeking to ease the financial and administrative burden on employers while offering a sustainable system of protection to individuals. In this way, it is hoped that possible savings made elsewhere through simplification measures will contribute to reducing the effect of the PPF levy on business overall.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.3/1">The UK was closely involved in support of the UN Secretary General's efforts to broker a Cyprus settlement. An integral element of the UN Secretary General's comprehensive proposals was the demilitarisation of the island and progressive withdrawal of foreign troops (both Greek and Turkish)&mdash;ultimately leaving just 950 Greek and 650 Turkish troops. Unfortunately the plan has not been accepted by both sides&mdash;therefore there is no agreement on early withdrawal of Turkish troops. We continue to believe the UN Secretary General's proposals offer the best prospect for a fair, just and viable future for the island. We see no other possible basis for a settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.5/1">We welcomed Prime Minister Sharon's announcement that he intends to withdraw all settlements from Gaza and a number from the West Bank, and to order a significant military redeployment, as a significant step consistent with the road map route to the two-state solution. The dismantling of settlements would be a real step forward, in line with phase I of the road map, which calls for settlements to be frozen and outposts dismantled.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.5/2">Withdrawal of settlements and the Israeli Defence Force from Gaza would be beneficial to the Palestinians in practical terms, improving freedom of movement and releasing agricultural land. We have urged the Israelis to withdraw fully. If they do, it would also stimulate renewed international support to enable the Palestinian Authority to built its capacity to deliver services. We are working with the Palestinians to ensure that they can make the best use of Israeli withdrawal to improve the daily lives of the Palestinian population.</p>
