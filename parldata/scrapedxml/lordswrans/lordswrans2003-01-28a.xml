This work will examine the sewage collections system in the Connswater area, as well as how sewage is treated, and will identify potential solutions to control discharges of storm sewage and problems with sewage related litter in the Connswater River.</p>

We believe that the work involved (essentially internal modifications to the radar and communications buildings) will not amount to development within its definition in the planning Acts or PPG7, and therefore will not require any formal planning consultation. We are, however, in touch with the North Yorks Moors National Park Authority, as the relevant local planning authority, and have undertaken to provide it with full evidence to substantiate this case as it becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.3/1">This year the Homelessness Directorate is providing funding for two hostels in Liverpool and 41 hostels (includes three rolling shelters) in London. This includes direct payments and payments via local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.3/2">Hostels (including those not funded by the Homelessness Directorate) with residents receiving housing benefit, will also receive transitional housing benefit via the Supporting People Programme to pay for the element of housing costs which provide housing-related support services.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.11/1">Following a consultation exercise carried out between December 2001 and July 2002, we propose to lay regulations before Parliament, so that people conceived as a result of sperm, egg or embryo donation will be able to obtain more information about their donors in the future. The information will not identify the donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.11/2">We hope that donor-conceived people are all part of loving families, but we also understand that at some point in their lives they may decide they want to know more about their genetic origins and we think it is right that they should be able to ask for non-identifying information.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.11/3">We propose that the regulations enable the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to provide non-identifying information about donors to donor-conceived people aged 18 or over who request that information and who were born after the HFEA's register came into effect in 1991. In practice the information would be available from 2010 (18 years after the register came into operation).</p>
	<p pid="a.150.11/4">To enable standardised information to be available in the future, we will seek approval for the regulations to require the HFEA to collect standardised non-identifying information with immediate effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.11/5">We will also explore the possibility of setting up a pilot scheme for a voluntary contact register for donor-conceived people aged 18 and over.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.11/6">The summary of responses to the consultation exercise is on the Department of Health's website at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/consultations">www.gov.uk/consultations</a>.</p>
