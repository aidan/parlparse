	<p pid="a.265.5/1">The mayor's London Plan (February 2004) and early alterations to the London Plan (December 2006) set out the extent of planned growth for the London region to 2016 as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.5/2">housing growth at the rate of 30,500 homes per annum to 2016; andemployment growth of 636,000 jobs from 2001-16.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.5/4">For the south-east, current housing targets for the period up to 2016 are set out in the regional planning guidance for the south-east (RPG9, March 2001). The average annual rate of housing growth set out in the RPG9 equals to 28,050 net dwelling completions per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.5/5">We have commissioned the British Geological Survey to research and report on the economic, social and environmental costs of moving away from the managed aggregate supply mechanism in England. Among other issues, this research will assess whether moving away from the system would constrain major development planned in London and the south-east, as well as in other English regions.</p>

	<p pid="a.266.2/1">Local authorities are not required to have an allotment policy in order to dispose of allotments. However, in planning terms, they are required to undertake an audit of existing green spaces and make an assessment of community need for green spaces, including allotments. Existing open space should not be built on unless an assessment has been undertaken which has clearly shown the open space or the buildings and land to be surplus to requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.2/2">Furthermore, allotments are additionally protected in law. Statutory allotments are protected via Section 8 of the Allotments Act 1925, which requires that local authorities seek the Secretary of State's consent for disposal or appropriation to another use. Consent cannot be given unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that:</p>
	<p pid="a.266.2/3">the allotment in question is not necessary and is surplus to requirements;adequate provision will be made for displaced plot holders, or that such provision is not necessary or is impracticable;the number of people on the waiting list has been effectively taken into account; andthe authority has actively promoted and publicised the availability of allotment sites and has consulted the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.2/4">We therefore have no plans to change current procedures to dispose of allotments.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.2/5">We also encourage and work with local authorities to develop local green space strategies, which should include provision for allotments.</p>

The Ethnic Minority Citizenship Unit was disbanded in 1999 and re-established in 2005, when it was resourced from within existing BCG resources.

	<p pid="a.269.3/1">There were 406 cases of parental or guardian child abduction handled by our Child Abduction Section from January 2004 to December 2006. Of these cases, 149&mdash;37 per cent&mdash;were resolved satisfactorily. We did not keep these statistics prior to the establishment of the Child Abduction Sectionin 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.3/2">These statistics cannot provide a full picture of the international child abduction from the UK, as many cases are not brought to the attention of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The figures are taken from our consular database, which is a working instrument used by us to handle casework rather than to record child abduction statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.5/1">London boroughs' progress on the waste aspects of local planning documents is kept under regular review. Planning for waste management facilities is a top priority and officials have regular engagement with boroughs to ensure progress is maintained. A majority of boroughs' revised local development schemes&mdash;which set out the boroughs' proposed timetables for plan-making&mdash;have been signed off by the Government Office for London, and the remainder of LDS revisions will be signed off shortly. This ensures that the borough waste planning document programme is as up to date as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.2/1">Departments and public bodies varied in the level of Welsh language service which they were providing or planning to provide prior to the 1993 Act. Since they would have been accommodated within existing budgets, it is not possible to make an assessment of any additional costs flowing specifically from the requirements ofthe Act.</p>
