	<p pid="a.271.3/1">The cost of installing and generating electricity from wind energy is very site specific. Analysis carried out for the 2005 review of the renewables obligation&mdash;RO&mdash;showed that costs can vary from less than &pound;50/MWh to &pound;80/MWh depending on location. Further analysis of costs has been carried out in the context of proposals to amend the RO. This will be published alongside the energy White Paper later this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.3/2">At the end of 2000 there was 388MW of installed capacity in the UK. This rose to 1,963MW at the end of 2006 (source: BWEA) and is now over 2GW. In Germany there was 6,112MW of installed capacity at the end of 2000 rising to 20,621 MW at the end of 2006 (source: Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety).</p>

	<p pid="a.279.2/1">The energy White Paper published in May 2007 set out estimates of the investment requirements in the electricity and gas sectors over the period to 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/2">It concludes that, if we are to maintain levels of electricity generation capacity equivalent to those available today, around 20 to 25GW of new power stations will be needed by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/3">Current forecasts of gas demand also imply that we will need to increase our import capacity by 2020 by an extra 12bcm to 24bcm&mdash;equivalent to 15 per cent to 30 per cent of the 2006-07 import capacity.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.2/1">Departments and public bodies varied in the level of Welsh language service which they were providing or planning to provide prior to the 1993 Act. Since they would have been accommodated within existing budgets, it is not possible to make an assessment of any additional costs flowing specifically from the requirements ofthe Act.</p>
