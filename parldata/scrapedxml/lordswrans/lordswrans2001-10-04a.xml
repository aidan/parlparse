There is no devolved statutory duty to fire authorities but the partnership is required to consult chief fire officers in the strategy-setting process.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.2/2">Guidance was issued to partnerships by the Home Office when the Act came into force. This promoted the active involvement of the fire service and other agencies in the work of partnerships. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.6/1">In England there are currently 21 appointed days each year when it is required, by command of Her Majesty the Queen, that government buildings fly the Union Flag. The St George's Cross may be flown in conjunction with the Union flag on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-23">23 April</phrase> each year. English Heritage sites fall outside the definition of government buildings and they can fly flags whenever they wish. However, they choose to follow the government rules on flag flying and fly flags on the appointed days.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.6/2">In Scotland the Scottish Executive issues a list of flag flying days that closely mirror the English guidelines. These rules apply to buildings of the Scottish Executive and its agencies. Historic Scotland choose to follow the Scottish Executive guidelines but with a special dispensation to fly both its own house flag and the Saltire on other days.</p>
