	<p pid="a.8.0/1">Data showing the number of cautions, prosecutions and convictions for various alcohol offences from 2005-08 are provided in the attached table. Data for persistent sales of alcohol to children are shown under offence code 14398, for purchasing alcohol underage under offence codes 14382 and 14316, for alcohol sales to a drunk under offence codes 14374 and 14375 and for making/attempting to purchase alcohol on behalf of a child under offence codes 14383 and 14317. The data for the persistent sales offence came into effect in 2008. Court proceedings data for 2009 are planned for publication in October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/2">The court proceedings database holds information on defendants proceeded against, found guilty and sentenced for criminal offences, the statutes under which proceedings are brought or the circumstances of each case. It is not possible to identify from this centrally available information whether the offence proceeded against involving selling alcohol was on-trade or off-trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/3">Additionally, penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) are also available for these offences and the information is provided in the attached table 2.1.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.5/1">The original ministerial announcement of funding to the Council for the Regulation of Forensic Practitioners (CRFP) in 1999 was expressly subject to the CRFP's performance, particularly the condition that it became self-financing through registrants' fees and there should not be a long-term reliance on grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/2">By the time the CRFP closed, this goal of a self-funding independent accreditation body had not been achieved and the company was facing a long-term shortfall of funding, because the registration income did not match the expenditure and would not have matched it, irrespective of whether the government grant had been continued or not. This was likely to become considerably worse because of the withdrawal of support for the registration process by police forces and the long planned ending of grant in aid in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.5/3">The grant was latterly provided by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), which in 2008 jointly commissioned with the CRFP an independent analysis of the CRFP's finances. Following this, the CRFP's financial situation, as detailed above, was clear and further commitment of public money to the CRFP would have amounted to a long-term commitment to funding the company without full public control, which would not have been a justifiable or sustainable approach. The NPIA decision to cease grant in aid in 2009 was agreed with Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">The main risks of cross-infection in primary dental care arise from transmission from patient to patient by reusable instruments of blood-borne viruses (BBV), particularly hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Spongiform Encephalitis Advisory Committee (SEAC) has also raised concerns about the potential for the creation of more cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease related to primary dental care. We do not collect data on these risks because the incubation periods of BBV diseases are so long, and the number of dental treatments so frequent, that it would be impossible to relate an individual infection to a specific course of treatment. However, it is estimated that in the United Kingdom there are about 83,000 people with HIV, over a quarter of whom are unaware of their infection, 180,000 with chronic hepatitis B (the level of undiagnosed infections is unknown), and 250,000 people with chronic hepatitis C infection, about a half of whom are unaware that they are infected.</p>
