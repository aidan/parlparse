	<p pid="a.119.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-24">24 November 1999</phrase> (Official Report, col. 105W) the Solicitor-General announced in another place that the Code for Crown Prosecutors would be reviewed to take account of the Human Rights Act. The aim of the review is to ensure that the Code for Crown Prosecutors is relevant, clear and accessible, properly considers the rights and interests of victims and reflects the exercise of the statutory functions of Crown Prosecutors. The review will take into account legislative changes since 1994, particularly the Human Rights Act, changes to the structure of the CPS and procedural changes to the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/2">The review team has now been established and will be writing to organisations and individuals with an interest in the code asking for comments. The review team also invites views from the general public, who may write to their local Chief Crown Prosecutors or write to or e-mail CPS Headquarters. Information on the code and the review can be found on the CPS website at <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk">www.cps.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/3">It is important that the code supports the CPS's commitment to excellence of decision-making, improving victims' and witnesses' experiences of the criminal justice system and pursuing a partnership approach within the criminal justice system while maintaining its independence in decisions on casework.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/4">The Solicitor-General and I welcome this review and will be taking a close interest both in its progress and any major issues that may arise.</p>

The provision of such invalidated information outside its context and without suitable peer review would run contrary to accepted scientific procedures, encourage misinterpretation, add to costs and impede rather than facilitate constructive research.

	<p pid="a.123.5/1">Ethics committees exist to review any proposed research projects involving human subjects with the aim of ensuring that the dignity, rights, safety and well-being of all actual or potential research participants are safeguarded. Such committees will consider the potential impact of any such research on the subjects both in the short term and, where relevant, in the long term. The Government believe that the goals of research, however important or time critical, should not be permitted to override the health, well-being and care of research participants.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.5/2">As researchers make headway and results in due course start to emerge from this study, they will at the same time need careful interpretation before any conclusions are published. Findings from the study will have to be subject to the normal processes of validation and peer review by the relevant scientific experts, including the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.5/1">The Government are aware of the legal opinion obtained by Justice from David Pannick QC and Helen Mountfield. We believe that there are considerable doubts whether Section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986 (otherwise known as Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988) is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Clause 91 of the Local Government Bill amends, but also reaffirms, the provisions of Section 2A. By extension, this amendment makes it doubtful whether the Bill is compatible with the ECHR.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.5/2">The Government have already said that they intend to remove Clause 91 of the Bill and in its place provide for the repeal of Section 2A of the 1986 Act. In our view, the Bill will then be compatible with the ECHR.</p>
