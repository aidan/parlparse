	<p pid="a.141.2/1">The Minister responsible took advice not only internally but also from a number of fire services. Another removals centre was designed and built in the South East at the same time as Yarl's Wood and the advice from the local fire service was that sprinklers were not necessary. It was therefore decided that a review of fire safety precautions and the use of sprinklers should be conducted before any final decisions were made on the use of sprinklers in removals centres.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.5/1">In a reply on <phrase class="date" code="1999-02-03">3 February 1999</phrase> in the other place, the then Home Secretary, Jack Straw, accepted in full the recommendations in the report to him on The Review of Security Service Selection Criteria by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, as chairman and on behalf of the Advisory Council on Public Records. The Home Secretary also placed a copy of that report in their Library. For the convenience of the Members of this House, I have arranged for a copy of that report to be put in our Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.5/2">The criteria for extended closure of records is set out in full in the Public Record Office publication Access to Public Records, Second Edition, September 2000. This publication is available via the Internet at the address: <a href="http://www.pro.gov.uk/recordsmanagement/access/Access2.htm">http://www.pro.gov.uk/recordsmanagement/access/Access2.htm</a>. I understand that the Security Service did not open files on war criminals as such, as its concern was with Nazi espionage, sabotage, subversion and the like. At the end of the Second World War, the service shared with the United States authorities the reports of its interrogations of German intelligence officers and agents. Most of these reports, and their associated records, have been released to the Public Record Office. Only a few of these records also related to war crimes and all of those so far found have been released. Within the limits of its resources, the service has helped those with a particular interest in history to review specific records selected for release. The noble Lord may wish to write to the service giving details of the records he has in mind.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.9/1">Since the announcement of the Veterans Initiative and the appointment of my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence as Minister for Veterans Affairs one year ago, we have made substantial progress towards meeting the objective of the iniative: to build-up a partnership with veterans' organisations and other government departments to develop an integrated response to veterans concerns, focused in particular on the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.9/2">We have been considering how we can improve the service offered to our veterans from within the department. Capitalising on the transfer of the War Pensions Agency to the Ministry of Defence in June of last year and on its excellent record for customer-service, we have decided that the War Pensions Agency should provide a special focus for our support to veterans and that accordingly, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">2 April</phrase>, it should be renamed the Veterans Agency. As a first step towards giving substance to this change of name, the Veterans Agency will, from the end of this month, provide an integrated web-site and free-phone helpline that will be the first point of contact for veterans seeking advice and information. For the longer term, we will also be looking at the future development of the War Pensioners Welfare Service, and in particular at the possibility of expanding partnerships with the charitable sector to improve the support delivered in this area by offering a better co-ordinated service.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.9/3">Working through the Veterans Forum and Ministerial Task Force, we have agreed an action plan and nine working groups, made up jointly of representatives of the veterans' community and of interested government departments to take work forward. These are now addressing the particular concerns identified within the initiative's core themes of partnership, identity, recognition and care. This work includes developing new resettlement training for the most vulnerable of our service leavers who are at greatest risk of social exclusion, the development of material for the new key stage 3 and 4 scheme for citizenship to be part of the national curriculum from September 2002, improving communication between government and veterans, recognition of veterans' achievements in more recent years and problems faced by the veterans charities' care home. The working groups will be reporting their progress to my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence in time for the next meeting of the Veterans Forum and the Ministerial Task Force in April and May respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.9/4">We are also taking steps to address two of the particular concerns that veterans have raised about the war pensions scheme. From this April, the provisions for war widowers will be equalised to bring them fully into line with those currently available to war widows. Further, we plan to introduce measures from August that will guarantee that a war pensioner can return to unemployability supplement within the first 12 months of starting work.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.9/5">We place a particular premium on the partnership that we have been building with the representatives of the veterans organisations and are pleased to acknowledge the considerable part that their positive response has played in enabling us to take this initiative forward. We look forward to building on this partnership to develop and deliver a significant programme of further improvements for the future.</p>

We also added &pound;0.754 million to the general grant for 2002&ndash;03 through the Local Government Finance Settlement to reimburse councils for the costs of local access forums. General grant is distributed to councils through standard spending assessments (SSA) which take account of various broad social and economic factors such as population. Local authorities' responsibilities under the CROW Act 2000 are within the Environmental Protective and Cultural Services SSA Block.

	<p pid="a.151.5/1">Today we are announcing the outcome of the first stage of the current review of English Partnerships (EP), together with appointment of the new chair of the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/2">The new chair of English Partnerships is to be Margaret Ford. She has extensive experience in economic development and of working with government organisations within the UK and internationally. She has particular experience of leading organisations though periods of considerable change. We are confident that Margaret Ford is the right person to lead EP into its new role.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/3">EP will become the Secretary of State's expert adviser on brownfield regeneration, managing a national portfolio of strategic sites and managing demonstration projects. EP will work with national, regional and local partners, especially the RDAs, and the private sector to identify strategic brownfield land and prioritise and facilitate its development. There is a continuing remit for EP as a national public sector body and as a vital component of the Government's programme for achieving an urban renaissance.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/4">To sharpen the organisation's focus on brownfield regeneration, we intend EP progressively to transfer its non-strategic Commission for the New Towns (CNT) landholdings to other appropriate bodies, for example the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/5">In the spirit of the two Green Papers we published last year setting out fundamental changes to local government and the planning system, EP will relinquish the use of its planning powers in the former new town areas, bringing control over the development of these areas under the democratic control of their local councils. This will be a staged process.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/6">As part of stage two of review, we want to resolve the problems that have arisen in the past from the dual statutory function of the former Urban Regeneration Agency and the Commission for the New Towns. This will give EP a common purpose and help it in taking forward its changed agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.5/7">I am today placing in the Library of the House the report on stage one of the review, including the KPMG consultation report and key areas to be addressed in stage two. There is still important work to be done and we will continue to listen to and work with the widest range of interested organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.2/1">New business recovery and recycling targets for packaging waste in 2002 under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) have been agreed by the Government. Subject to the approval of Parliament, these are as follows: Recovery 59 per cent Material-specific recycling 19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 were made to enable the UK to meet its obligations under the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste, in particular the recovery and recycling targets in article 6 of that directive. The first targets that we and other member states had to achieve in 2001 under the Packaging Waste Directive were that at least 50 per cent of packaging waste be recovered, at least 25 per cent recycled and 15 per cent of each packaging material recycled.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/3">On the assumption that the UK met these targets last year (and final figures are not yet ready), the targets I am proposing today should allow almost 5 million tonnes of packaging waste to be recovered in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4">The department has, as was indicated in the recent consultation paper on targets for 2002, reviewed the figures that were used to develop the targets for 2002 in that paper and in light of the changes in the amount of packaging data reported by businesses obligated under the packaging regulations and the estimates for the tonnages expected to be obligated in 2002, the Government have decided on a recovery target of 59 per cent and a material-specific target of 19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/5">As in previous years, the national targets for next year need to be seen as leading on to higher targets and the ones proposed by the Government should allow the UK to plan a smooth upward curve towards higher recovery and recycling targets over the next few years.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-30">30 March 2001</phrase> (HC, Deb col 832W) my right honourable friend the Minister of State for the environment informed the House in another place that the Government had decided to boost the opportunities for competition in public water services in England and Wales. We proposed that the incumbent water companies would remain vertically integrated statutory undertakers, while new entrants would be licensed for production and retail activities. Since then, Defra has undertaken further detailed work on the future framework, in close collaboration with other government departments, the National Assembly for Wales and the three principal regulators of the water industry: Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/2">Competition can deliver benefits for customers through keener prices, more innovation and improved service quality. But competition must be consistent with the Government's wider policy objectives for the water industry. It is important for the framework and scope of any further competitive activity to be tailored to the particular circumstances of the industry and the needs of its customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/3">After thorough consideration, we propose to extend competition for non-household customers that use large quantities of water. Market entrants will be authorised to enter into common carriage agreements with statutory undertakers to supply premises which use more than a specified threshold of water per year. We propose that this should be set initially at 50 megalitres, based on the evidence currently available. Work is under way to assess the likely effects of lower threshold levels both in terms of increasing competitive opportunity and the Government's wider policy objectives for the water industry. Views will be invited on the threshold in a forthcoming consultation paper. This further analysis, the views received in response to consultation and consideration of the implications for all customers will inform any final decisions on the initial threshold to be introduced in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/4">Any subsequent lowering of the initial threshold will be considered once we have the benefit of practical experience to draw on. We would consult publicly on any proposed change and the same considerations would apply as in the case of the initial threshold. From the outset, new entrants to the industry will be expected to co-operate with the statutory undertakers in preparing and implementing water resource, security and emergency planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/5">We have considered very carefully whether to introduce competition now for household customers. We have concluded that extending competition to the domestic water sector, while at the same time seeking to ensure that the Government's public health, social and environmental objectives continued to be met, would require a complex and costly regulatory regime which would still leave substantial uncertainties. The added complexity would militate against effective competition and the extra costs would have to be borne mainly by customers. In our view, these drawbacks are likely to outweigh the potential benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/6">Household and other customers can continue to rely on the present system of comparative competition operated by Ofwat to encourage water companies to improve efficiency and their services. Average household customers are now paying 13 per cent less than in 1999, a reduction of &pound;33 in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.2/7">We shall be publishing a consultation paper with further details of our proposals later this year. As previously announced, our intention is to introduce a water Bill to bring these changes into effect. The draft Bill also contains proposals to put customers at the heart of the regulatory process, including setting up an independent consumer body to be the voice of consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.2/2">The main business of this Council was a debate in preparation for the forthcoming European Council in Barcelona. The Spanish Presidency issued its own conclusions. The UK supported the key themes of improved co-ordination of economic and employment policy and the importance of aligning the new European employment strategy with the Lisbon goal of full employment. Member states recognised the need to integrate disadvantaged groups, particularly older workers, into the labour market to achieve this goal and acknowledged the vital role played by lifelong learning in achieving the Lisbon targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/3">Council also held an open debate on violence against women which formed the basis of Presidency Conclusions for Barcelona. There was consensus on the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to this issue, with broad agreement on the use of good practice guides and annual awareness raising campaigns at a European level. The fortcoming Danish Presidency will take forward this work in the context of the Council's annual follow-up of the member states' implementation of their commitments under the Beijing Platform for Action, including discussions on the necessity for, and potential scope of, indicators in this field.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/4">The Presidency sought an outline position on the proposal for a directive updating the existing directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to asbestos, pending the adoption by the European Parliament of its first reading opinion. After a debate, which hinged on a proposal to include a general ban on asbestos within the directive, the dossier was remitted to COREPER for further work.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/5">The Council also heard a progress report on negotiations for the draft directive supplementing the proposed regulation for a statute on a European co-operative society in respect of employee involvement. Work will continue on this dossier in COREPER.</p>
