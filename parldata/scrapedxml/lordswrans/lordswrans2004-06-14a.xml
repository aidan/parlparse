Members agreed that illegal imports did not require further investigation by the committee at present, although it agreed to keep a watching brief on developments in relation to action on illegal imports.

The report explains that Australian studies on actinic keratosis suggest that less than 1 per cent of such lesions progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma per year and some of these cases may regress if ultraviolet sunlight is avoided. Some patients with multiple actinic keratosis may go on to develop squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

Cancer Research UK has distributed a poster of photographs to all general practitioners and practice nurses to assist in its identification showing among other skin cancer lesions, actinic keratosis. The ultraviolet collaborative stakeholders group will continue to consider all issues of health concern relating to the ultraviolet radiation.</p>
