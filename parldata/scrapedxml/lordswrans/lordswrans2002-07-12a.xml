	<p pid="a.110.0/1">As a result of the significant increase in intelligence work following the events of <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>, the need to augment the Defence Intelligence Staffs and other headquarters organisations by some 55 reservists continues. It is therefore necessary to call out compulsorily a second tranche of intelligence specialists to relieve the majority of those called out last February who now wish to resume their civilian employment. The individuals involved in the second tranche will primarily come from the Territorial Army, but a small number will also come from the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. They will commence their appointments in mid-August. We recognise the essential contribution made by these reservists to the operations against global terrorism and are grateful to them, their families and their employers for their support.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.5/1">No incentives are designed specifically to attract teachers away from the independent sector. All qualified teachers who enter or re-enter the maintained schools sector will benefit equally from the improvments to the pay and working conditions of teachers that her Majesty's Government's reforms are bringing about.</p>

It will also enhance access by Members of the public to this uniquely rich national resource. The new body will report to the Lord Chancellor.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.5/1">I understand from Torbay Council that prior to installation the operators were required to undertake a detailed technical analysis, including wave testing of the proposed installation, to ensure it had an appropriate design life, would be adequate for the conditions it was to function in and would achieve a suitable level of wave attention. Under the terms of its lease, MDL is the responsible body for its inspection and maintenance. No inspections of the installation have been carried out by Torbay Council. The council is however undertaking a review of its arrangements for inspection under health and safety legislation following the introduction of new requirements by the HSE earlier this year and this will lead to a new risk assessed regime.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">This information is not held centrally. In November 1999 the Treasury published a Statement of Best Practice on the use of consultants in government. This represents a set of principles that should apply to many areas of consultancy but is not binding on departments and has no status in law.</p>
