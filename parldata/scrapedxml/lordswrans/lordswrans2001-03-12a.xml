In addition, the Union Learning Fund, which has supported many successful union-led learning projects, will transfer to the LSC from April 2002.</p>

They will vary between type of provision and the amount institutions invest in their internal quality assurance. In 2000, a report commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Better Accountability of Higher Education), based on a study of two institutions and other unpublished work, estimated that the higher education sector has incurred costs in the region of &pound;45 million in QAA reviews. Quality of teaching is a small part of the reviews for the QAA.</p>

It found that institutions do not maintain any systematic cost or value data but concluded that the efficiency of the accountability regime could be improved. The Quality Assurance Agency has overhauled its review mechanisms and from September 2001 will use a method which will significantly reduce the amount of work carried out by institutions for reviews which include assessment of teaching quality.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.5/1">The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, as amended, allows the use of speedometers that meet the requirements of EC Community Directive 75/443(97/39) or ECE Regulation 39. Both the EC Directive and the ECE Regulation lay down accuracy requirements to be applied at the time of vehicle approval for speedometers. These requirements are that the indicated speed must not be more than 10 per cent of the true speed plus 4 km/h. In production, however, a slightly different tolerance of 5 per cent plus 10 km/h is applied. The requirements are also that the indicated speed must never be less than the true speed.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.5/2">A vehicle meeting these requirements would not be able to travel at a greater speed than that shown on the speedometer and a driver could not, therefore, inadvertently exceed speed restrictions. Her Majesty's Government have no plans to introduce instrument tests.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.8/1">We are extremely grateful to the HSE and to TRL for their speedy consideration of the factors involved in the tragic accident at Great Heck near Selby on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-28">28 February 2001</phrase>. HSE and TRL will be continuing their investigations, but it is becoming apparent that there was nothing the railway industry could reasonably have done to prevent the train collision. It also appears that there were no technical matters connected with the road infrastructure that would help explain why the vehicle left the M.62 in the first place. The road surface appears to have been adequate and the safety barriers more than met the current standards. We will, of course, have to await the report of the police into the incident. But in the interim my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister has asked the HSC to convene and lead a working group that will look at the circumstances of incidents where vehicles have blocked rail lines and whether there are features in common that might have been preventable. In parallel, the Highways Agency will be reviewing its standards for safety barriers.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.6/1">During the 10 year period 1990-1991 to 1999-2000, there were 18 cases of poisoning reported under the Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) which can be attributed with certainty to organophosphates.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/2">This number is likely to be a considerable underestimate of the actual number of cases of organophosphate poisoning, as RIDDOR is known to be subject to serious underreporting and, furthermore, it is not always possible from the information provided to attribute a poisoning to a specific substance.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/3">A better (but still incomplete) indication of the extent of alleged organophosphate poisoning is available from the reports of cases assessed by the Pesticide Incidents Appraisal Panel (PIAP). PIAP considers all ill health incidents reported to the Health and Safety Executive or a local authority which are allegedly due to the use of pesticides in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/4">During the 10 year period 1990-1991 to 1999-2000, PIAP assessed 152 incidents, involving 198 people, where the pesticides used included an organophosphate active ingredient. In 58 of these incidents, involving 87 people, PIAP assessed the ill health reported as having a &quot;confirmed&quot; or &quot;likely&quot; link to pesticide exposure.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/5">It was not part of the research carried out at the Medical Toxicology Unit (MTU) to compile statistics relating to the numbers of acute and chronic cases of organophosphate poisoning diagnosed as a result of information from the unit or clinical consultations with MTU medical staff.

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">UN Security Council Resolution 1344 (2001), imposing mandatory UN sanctions in relation to Liberia, was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-07">7 March</phrase>. The resolution was co-sponsored by the UK and US in response to the findings of the UN Expert Panel on Sierra Leone on violations of the Sierra Leone arms embargo and the link between the trade in diamonds and arms. The Security Council determined that the active support provided by the Government of Liberia for armed rebel groups in neighbouring countries, and in particular the RUF in Sierra Leone, constitutes a threat to international peace and security in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/2">The new measures are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/3" class="indent">an embargo on the export of arms and related material to Liberia, and a ban on the provision to Liberia of related technical assistance and training;</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/4" class="indent">a ban on the import by UN member states of any rough diamonds from Liberia, whether or not such diamonds originated in Liberia;</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/5" class="indent">a travel ban on senior members of the Liberian military and their spouses and any other individuals providing financial and military support to armed rebel groups in countries neighbouring Liberia, as designated by the UN Sanctions Committee;</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/6">The diamond embargo and the travel ban will enter into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-07">7 May</phrase>, unless the Security Council determines before that date that Liberia has complied with its demands. These include the key demands that the Government of Liberia should cease all financial and military support for the RUF and should cease all imports of Sierra Leone rough diamonds in breach of UN sanctions.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/7">The arms embargo and the ban on the provision of related technical assistance and training, which entered into force immediately upon the adoption of the resolution, are established for a period of 14 months. The other measures will be established for a period of 12 months. At the end of this period, the Council will decide whether the Government of Liberia has complied with its demands and, accordingly, whether to extend these measures for a further period.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/8">The resolution lifts the former arms embargo imposed on Liberia by UN Security Council Resolution 788 (1992) in response to concerns regarding the civil war in that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/9">New Orders will be made to implement the new measures in the UK, the Crown Dependencies and the Overseas Territories under the United Nations Act (1946) and by other legislative and adminstrative means as necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.5/1">The report by His Honour John Gower QC and Sir Anthony Hammond KCB QC was delivered to me on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-05">5 December 2000</phrase>. I have lodged a copy of the report in the Library, and copies of the report are available on request to the Solicitor for HM Customs and Excise.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/2">The report concludes that the Customs and Excise Solicitor's Office should retain its prosecution function but that in exercising this function, including the giving of advice to investigating officers, it must be truly independent and be seen to be so. To that end, the report has also concluded that in relation to the prosecution function the Solicitor should be accountable to the Attorney-General rather than to the Commissioners and that the solicitor/client relationship between the Commissioners and the Solicitor should cease in relation to this function. Where cases are referred to the Solicitor's Office with view to prosecution, the decision on whether to do so will rest with the appropriate lawyer after consultation with, where necessary, an administrator on matters of policy and public interest. These recommendations are supported by a number of associated recommendations on detailed structural and financial aspects.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/3">The Government have carefully considered all these recommendations. They accept all the recommendations in principle, but, given the significant resource implications associated with some recommendations, have opted for a phased approach to implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/4">The Government have had particular regard to the need to ensure that adequate resources are made available to the Solicitor's Office to enable it properly to conduct the large and complex drugs and other prosecutions which were the main focus of the report, and which are conducted by the Special Casework Division of that Office (SCD). They have therefore decided to afford this area of work the greatest priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/5">Accordingly, it has been decided that, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>, Customs and Excise will invest sufficient extra resources in the Solicitor's Office to enable it to implement the recommendations in the report which bear directly on the cases conducted by the SCD. This will mean that, taken with additional resources already provided to the Solicitor's Office in relation to the Butler Report, the number of staff working on those cases in the SCD will almost double.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/6">These additional resources will enable Recommendation 10 of the report (the attendance at conferences with Counsel, and attendance at hearings in the Crown Court) to be implemented quickly in relation to all SCD cases, and in over 60 per cent of the cases conducted by the Solicitor's Office in total. The implementation of the remainder of that recommendation will be subject to local trials to evaluate the benefits and costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/7">Recommendation 15 (the conduct of magistrates' courts proceedings), will not be implemented immediately and will also be subject to such local trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/8">The report concludes that Customs and Excise lawyers are dedicated professionals with valuable skills and expertise, and the Government believe that making the changes in accountability, responsibility and resourcing referred to above will ensure public confidence in the Solicitor's Office as a prosecuting authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.5/9">To enable detailed consideration to be given to the implementation of the remaining recommendations in the Report, particularly where these have structural and budgetary implications, the change in accountability will have effect on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.5/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today published a consultation document entitled The Law on Extradition: A Review, and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/2">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced the review to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-02">2 March</phrase> last year in the course of his statement on Senator Pinochet. It is the outcome of an exercise started in 1997 to consider the legislative requirements of two European Union conventions on extradition. However, it developed into a much more extensive inquiry, following the adoption at Tampere in October 1999 of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions by the member states of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/3">The consultation document makes far-reaching proposals in relation to all aspects of current extradition law and practice. The greatest changes are proposed in respect of the United Kingdom's procedures for dealing with extradition requests received from member states of the European Union and Schengen states. Our present procedures for dealing with extradition requests from these states contain cumbersome controls and outdated requirements, some of them derived from 19th century extradition legislation. Such procedures are no longer necessary, nor do they provide an efficient means to deal with the growing difficulties caused by organised and international crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/4">For these extradition partners a simple backing of warrants procedure is proposed. This would replace the current multi-staged system, in which all extradition requests are examined by both the Secretary of State and the courts, with a single, streamlined hearing before a district judge (Sheriff in Scotland). The documentation required to support an extradition request would also be significantly simplified, to reduce the current burdens placed on our European partners in their efforts to bring fugitives to justice. The proposals retain a statutory right of appeal, in order to ensure that fugitives' rights are protected; but also propose that the grounds for appeal be tightened to eliminate time-consuming delays where fugitives appeal on grounds which are not relevant or are more properly for consideration by the court of trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/5">The simplified requirements of a backing of warrants scheme would put the mutual recognition principle into practice in the field of extradition. Mutual recognition may be defined as the judicial decisions of one jurisdiction being recognised as valid in another, with the minimum of formality.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/6">The review recognises that, while major reforms are required to our extradition procedures in respect of out closest neighbours, there is also a clear operational need to reform the procedures for dealing with requests from our extradition partners outside the European Union. Here, a final decision in the case by the Secretary of State would be retained, but there would be a significant reduction in the present duplication of my role and that of the courts in deciding cases, with the aim of making extradition quicker and simpler, while protecting fugitives' fundamental human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/7">The consultation period for the review proposals is three months. Copies are being made widely available to people and organisations with a professional interest in the subject. Members of the public will be able to apply for a copy from the Home Office, or obtain one from the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/oicd/jcu/jcu.htm">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/oicd/jcu/jcu.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/8">Many of the proposals in the document will require primary legislation to implement, which would take place when the legislative timetable allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/9">We welcome comments on the proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.2/2">The Gaming Board and the Home Office review gaming fees and the fees for society and local authority lotteries every year. The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee have made recommendations about how these fees are set. They have called for the creation of a more reliable basis for determining the costs of the relevant licensing and police authorities and achieving their full recovery, and for the elimination of cross-subsidies among and between the various gaming industry and lottery sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.2/3">The Government have accepted these recommendations and acted upon them. The amended fees in the four orders are based upon estimates by the Gaming Board for Great Britain of the cost of each service and demand for it during the financial year 2001-02.</p>
