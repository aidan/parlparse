While Ranger is comparable in size and weight to the Mastiff and Ridgeback vehicles deployed in Afghanistan, it was not available when competitions were run for these capabilities. The department does not currently have a requirement for another vehicle of this size. In the event that future operational requirements are identified for a vehicle of its type, the Ranger could be considered, and assessments carried out, alongside other vehicles of a comparable capability. Ranger was put forward for the light protected patrol vehicle requirement, but was significantly too heavy for the capability. If the Ranger is the subject of export interest the Ministry of Defence will be ready to consider assistance in the usual way.</p>

Decisions will not be made until spring 2011 at the earliest, and in some cases not until later in 2011. Full implementation will then take several years.

	<p pid="a.451.6/1">The Government announced in May 2010 that government payments to child trust funds would reduce and then stop.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.6/2">Government payments at birth were reduced by the Child Trust Funds (Amendment No. 3) Regulations 2010, which were made in July 2010. The Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill, which is currently before Parliament, will end eligibility for child trust funds for children born from January 2011 onwards, and therefore end the remaining government payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.6/3">At the Budget in June 2010, the Government set out the expected Exchequer savings from this measure, as shown in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.451.6/6"> <td>2010-11</td> <td>2011-12</td> <td>2012-13</td> <td>2013-14</td> <td>2014-15</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.451.6/7"> <td>&#163;320 million</td> <td>&#163;540 million</td> <td>&#163;550 million</td> <td>&#163;560 million</td> <td>&#163;560 million</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.451.6/10">The savings in 2010-11 are lower than for later years because the changes are being made part of the way through the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.6/11">The &#163;540-million Exchequer saving in 2011-12, the first full year of savings, divides approximately as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.451.6/12">&#163;220 million in respect of payments of &#163;250 for every child at birth, and &#163;70 million for additional payments of &#163;250 to children from lower income families; and&#163;190 million in respect of payments of &#163;250 to children turning seven, and &#163;60 million for further payments of &#163;250 to children from lower income families at age seven.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.6/13">The estimated cost of continuing child trust fund payments with a &#163;50 voucher for each newly born child is &#163;40 million a year. This figure assumes that there would be no additional payments to children from lower income families, and does not take account of administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.6/14">The Government have made no estimates of the effect on employment at existing child trust fund providers as a result of the changes set out above.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.6/15">However, existing child trust funds will remain in place, and the Government will introduce a new tax-free savings account for children born after the end of child trust fund eligibility. The Government are also working closely with existing child trust fund providers to look for ways of easing the financial impact on them. Regulations have been laid that will allow providers to choose not to accept new child trust fund business, while continuing to operate their existing child trust fund accounts. The Government also intend to relax the requirements for annual statements on child trust fund accounts, so that providers will not be required to send statements for all accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.6/16">The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) provided an updated assessment of prospects for the UK economy on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-29">29 November 2010</phrase>. This forecast incorporated the OBR's assessment of the impact of policy changes announced in the spending review. The OBR's forecast for employment is at the UK level and is therefore not produced to the level of detail requested in this Question.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.0/1">We welcome the Israeli announcement that they intend to withdraw troops from the northern part of Ghajjar. As I said in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-18">18 November</phrase> this is a positive development, and a sign of progress in the region. We call on Israel and the UN to work together to agree practical measures to implement this proposal as soon as is possible. It is important to note that there are a number of other issues still outstanding. We call on all sides to fulfil their full responsibilities under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, and would welcome progress on the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP), including on an Israel-Syria peace deal, which would address the occupation of the Golan Heights.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.2/1">We agree that Israel's system of check points and the processes for moving through them are confusing and frustrating. This applies both to check points between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories and to check points within the West Bank, which seriously impede freedom of movement for Palestinians. We are also concerned at the way check points are used to change facts on the ground. In particular we are concerned about increasing restrictions on West Bank Palestinians seeking to access East Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/2">The noble Lord may be aware of reports that Israel plans to transfer overall responsibility for the operation of check points to the Crossing Points Administration (CPA). It is too early to judge what effect this will have on the daily lives of Palestinians needing to pass through check points, but early indications are not entirely positive. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and raise with Israel the importance of easing restrictions on movement and access for ordinary Palestinians.</p>

Allocations to primary care trusts this year (2010-11) rose by 5.5 per cent and the recent Spending Review committed that NHS funding would rise in real terms in each of the following four years. However, the constrained rate of growth in funding means that efficiency savings of up to &#163;20 billion will be required over the next four years in order to meet rapidly rising demands and improve the quality of care. The NHS is responding to this challenge through the Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) programme, by identifying new ways to increase productivity and efficiency while delivering better quality services to patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.468.8/2">Earlier this year, LOCOG placed the contract opportunity for the production of the medals on CompeteFor, the online service for firms across the UK to bid for London 2012 contracts. LOCOG is unable to restrict aspects of contracts by geography in its tendering process, as that would give rise to competition law issues. However, LOCOG promoted the opportunity to the UK production industry to ensure that the best of UK companies were in a position to bid for the work. LOCOG is in the final stages of the tender process and will make an announcement when this is concluded. So far, 98 per cent of 2012-related contract opportunities have gone to UK-based firms.</p>
