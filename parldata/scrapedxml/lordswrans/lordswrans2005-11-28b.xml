	<p pid="b.1.2/1">The Bill will provide for the offences which Army and Royal Air Force commanding officers may deal with summarily to be slightly extended, while there will be a reduction in the theoretically very wide summary jurisdiction of Royal Navy commanding officers. Our aim has been to harmonise the list of offences to include those which Royal Navy commanding officers can appropriately, and do in fact, deal with summarily at present. The Armed Forces Bill will also remove the power of commanding officers to dismiss a charge for any offence, without any form of hearing. Commanding officers will instead be able to discontinue, without a hearing, proceedings in any case which they can deal with summarily; unlike the present power of dismissal, this will not prevent further proceedings being brought within the service system.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.5/1">The Government value the contribution made by the thousands of private voluntary and independent (PVI) providers in delivering high quality, flexible early education and childcare. A thriving PVI sector is vital to the Government's long-term aims to deliver flexible, integrated services for children and families, promoting choice and diversity.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.5/2">PVI sector providers will continue to play a significant part in delivering the commitments set out in the Government's 10-year childcare strategy to progressively increase and deliver more flexibly the existing free entitlement for three and four year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.5/3">As a first step, from April 2006, the minimum free entitlement will be increased to 38 weeks in all settings. This will secure a level playing field between maintained and PVI providers, ensuring, for the first time, that all children receive the same entitlement regardless of the setting their parents chose. Additional funding is being made available to all local authorities to ensure that PVI providers are funded to deliver the increased offer. This levelling of the playing field should act to decrease any advantages it may be felt that schools hold over other providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.2/1">The Citizens for Europe Programme is a proposed EU funding programme which would run from 2007 to 2013. It will replace the current programme to promote active European citizenship (civic participation) which began in 2004. The programme is still being negotiated by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament and therefore its content has not yet been agreed. However, the proposed overarching objectives of the programme are to give citizens the opportunity to interact; to develop a sense of European identity based on common values; and to celebrate the diversity of our cultures. Citizens will be targeted both directly and via civil society organisations. The programme will be established under Articles 151 and 308 of the EC treaty. The Commission has proposed a budget of &euro;235 million (&pound;159 million). However, a decision on the programme's actual budget will not be made until an agreement has been reached on the EU budget as a whole for the next financial perspective.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.2/2">If adopted, the programme would not have a council but it would probably have a management committee. The Commission proposes that such a committee should decide implementation arrangements for the programme. These might include the selection procedures and criteria for each call for proposals; and procedures for monitoring and evaluating the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.9.11/1">A considerable number of files relating to the activities of the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre (CISDIC) also known as the &quot;London Cage&quot; have been available to researchers at the National Archives (TNA) for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.11/2">Just one Ministry of Defence file on the subject is currently listed as retained in department, plus a number of sensitive pages extracted from a file already released. Retained files are currently not available for review as they were stored in the MoD's central London file store in an area where asbestos was discovered in the spring of 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.11/3">All the records affected have been safeguarded, and have been relocated to a facility on the outskirts of London. A project will commence shortly that will progressively permit access to the information contained on all affected files, after which it will be possible to review the status of the files and consider the possibility of release.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.11/4">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has identified 11 files on the subject which are not already available to the public, eight of them have been cleared for release and will shortly be transferred to TNA.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.11/5">Three further Foreign and Commonwealth Office files have also been cleared for release, but only after certain extracts have been made, in accordance with Section 40, &quot;Personal Data&quot;, of the Freedom of Information Act, as the information is deemed sensitive personal data under Part 1, Section 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998. The redactions contain photographs of prisoners at the camp and it is possible that some of these individuals may still be alive. These files, once the redactions have been made, will also be transferred to TNA.</p>
