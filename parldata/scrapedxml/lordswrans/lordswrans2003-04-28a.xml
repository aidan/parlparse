It seems unlikely that the court of any other state would consider itself to have jurisdiction over persons held at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

In addition, we regularly lobby on individual cases including through the FCO Freedom of Expression Panel, via EU demarches (e.g. on Grigory Pasko in Sept 2002), and during our bilateral talks (e.g. on Valentin Danilov and Igor Sutyagin in March 2003).

	<p pid="a.66.2/1">A computing coding error has been identified in Army strength figures prepared by the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) since <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>. From that date a number of untrained soldiers have been recorded against the trained Army strength. As a result Army strength figures previously announced and included in DASA publications have overstated the trained strength of the Army during that period. However, the combined strength of trained and untrained personnel has been correctly reported in all publications. It is the breakdown between trained and untrained strength that is affected by this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-01">1 February 2003</phrase>, whole Army strength (comprising UK Trained Army Personnel, Gurkhas and Full Time Reserve Service) stood at 101,750. Army recruitment and retention initiatives are producing gains to whole Army strength in line with forecasts. The trend over the past 12 months has been encouraging with Army strength increasing by over 1,300 trained personnel. A table comparing the figures issued in error with the corrected figures follows: lynne</p>

	<p pid="a.73.5/1">Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-08">8 January 2003</phrase>, prevents the provision of support to asylum seekers unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that their asylum claim was made as soon as reasonably practicable after arrival in the United Kingdom. Exceptions include families with children and those who can show they would suffer treatment contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Those with care needs continue to be supported by local authorities under the National Assistance Act 1948.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-19">19 February</phrase>, Mr Justice Collins gave judgment in six test cases. He found that the Section 55 decision-making process was flawed, largely on the grounds that there had initially been insufficient investigation of the circumstances in which entry to the United Kingdom was achieved, to give the claimant the opportunity to rebut a suggestion of incredibility and to set out fully the reasons for decisions. He also decided that there will normally be a real risk that to leave someone destitute will violate Articles 3 and 8.1 of the ECHR, and that inquiries should be made to try to establish whether any support is likely to exist. This effectively shifted the burden of proof to the Secretary of State, rather than the asylum applicant, as Section 55 had originally intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/3">The Home Secretary appealed against the decision of Mr Justice Collins and the Court of Appeal gave judgment on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-18">18 March 2003</phrase>. The Attorney General made it clear that the appeal was being made on the basis of the key legal principles, not on the basis of the six individual cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/4">At the Court of Appeal, the appeal was dismissed, as expected, in relation to the six cases, the judgment found in favour of the Government on several key issues of legal principle:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/5" class="indent">The court's decision makes it clear that the burden of showing an asylum claim was made as soon as reasonably practicable is on the asylum seeker, the ECHR does not require state support to be given automatically to all destitute asylum seekers who have failed to make their asylum claims when required to do so, and Section 55 is not incompatible with the ECHR in any respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/6" class="indent">The court found against the Government on procedural fairness and drew attention to a number of areas where they considered improvements could be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/7" class="indent">The Home Office has already changed the procedures for making Section 55 decisions to meet the court's main concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/8">The Government will not appeal to the House of Lords against the Court of Appeal decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/9">The Court of Appeal judgment means that the Government can continue to operate Section 55 as Parliament intended. It gives renewed legal backing for the Government's policy to tackle abuse of the asylum system and send a clear message to those who are abusing the system that they will not be supported at public expense.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/10">The key legal issues have been settled by the Court of Appeal and the Government can, therefore, uphold the robust and and fair asylum support system for which Parliament legislated.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.0/1">The Government's planning policy on town centres is set out in: Planning Policy Guidance Note 6 (PPG6): Town Centres and Retail Developments (June 1996); that parliamentary Answers given by the then planning Ministers, Nick Raynsford on <phrase class="date" code="1997-12-05">5 December 1997</phrase> and Richard Caborn on <phrase class="date" code="1999-02-11">11 February 1999</phrase> (the Caborn statement), together with Mr Caborn's contribution to a debate in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-11">11 March 1999</phrase>; the Government responses to Select Committees in July 1997 and May 2000; PPG11: Regional Planning (October 2000); and PPG13: Transport (March 2001).</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">The policy has operated successfully since 1996 but there is increasing evidence of differences in interpretation. This statement sets out the policy and how the First Secretary of State intends to operate it when determining planning applications and appeals. He expects local planning authorities to apply the same policy when determining planning applicants. Policy Tests</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3">The purpose of the policy is to sustain and enhance the vitality and viability of town and other existing centres by focusing retail, leisure and other key town centre uses which attract a lot of people within those centres. PPG6 emphasises the plan-led approach to promoting development in town centres, both through plan policies and the identification of locations and sites for development. It sets out a number of tests that must be satisfied if applications to develop retail or leisure facilities are to be successful. The Caborn statement further clarified the application of the test of need and the sequential approach as applying to proposals to develop at edge of centre or out of centre locations which are not in accordance with an up to date development plan strategy that is itself consistent with PPG6.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/4">In summary, applicants must: demonstrate that there is a need for the development; having established that such a need exists, adopt a sequential approach to site selection; consider the impact on nearby centres; and provide evidence on the site's accessibility by a choice of means of transport, as demonstrated by a transport assessment (see PPG13), the likely changes in travel patterns over the relevant catchment area, and any significant environmental impacts. All these tests apply equally to proposals for extensions as well as to new developments. Need</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/5">Proposals which would be located at an edge of centre or out of centre location and which are not in accordance with an up to date development plan strategy, or are in accordance with the development plan but that plan is out of date, is inconsistent with national planning policy guidance, or otherwise fails to establish adequately the need for new retail and leisure development and other development to which PPG6 applies, should be required to demonstrate both a retail need for additional facilities and that a sequential approach has been applied in selecting the location for the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/6">Some applicants have sought to make a distinction between quantitative and qualitative need for new retail facilities. PPG6 does not make this distinction although evidence on both has frequently been presented at planning inquiries. The First Secretary of State accepts that need can be expressed in quantitative and qualitative terms but considers that evidence presented on need is becoming increasingly and unnecessarily complicated. He therefore places greater weight on quantitative need for new retail provision to be defined in terms of additional floorspace for the types of retail development distinguished in PPG6, which are comparison and convenience shopping. Where both comparison and convenience goods are proposed to be sold within the same development, the First Secretary of State will expect to have evidence on the need for each type of goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/7">Regeneration has also been argued to be a component of the need for additional retail floorspace. There is no government guidance that supports this interpretation. The First Secretary of State considers that the contribution that a proposed development might make to the regeneration of a site or its area could be a material consideration to be taken into account in determining an application, but does not consider it to be an aspect of retail need.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/8">Equally, the net additional employment created by a proposed development is not an indicator of retail need but may be a material consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/9">For the avoidance of doubt, the First Secretary of State does not regard regeneration or employment creation as aspects of retail need for the purposes of the tests set out in PPG6 and the Caborn statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/10">The principles outlined above apply also to leisure uses. Sequential Approach</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/11">PPG6 seeks to promote sustainable development by locating major generators of travel in existing centres, where access by a choice of means of transport, not only by car, is easy and convenient.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/12">PPG6 requires a sequential approach to be adopted in selecting sites for new development. Both local planning authorities and developers should be able to demonstrate that all town centre options have been thoroughly assessed before less central sites are considered for development for key town centre uses. This means that the first preference should be for town centre sites, followed by edge of centre sites and only then out of centre sites in locations that are accessible by a choice of means of transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/13">In providing evidence that they have complied with this guidance, applicants must demonstrate flexibility and realism in terms of the format, design and scale of their development, and the amount of car parking, tailoring these to fit local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/14">The First Secretary of State will follow the approach set out in the Government's response to the Environment Select Committee in 2000. Where a class of goods is capable of being sold from a town centre location, that is the preferred location for the retail development and he will expect to see flexibility in the scale and format of a proposed development to meet that objective. A retailing format that can only be provided at an out of town location is not regarded as meeting the requirements of this policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/15">The First Secretary of State does not consider that developers and retailers always take sufficient account of this element of planning policy and further considers that this is potentially undermining the Government's objectives for town centres and its policies to achieve development that makes efficient and sustainable use of land and reduces social exclusion. He will look for evidence of, for example, more efficient design and layout, greater use of multi-storey developments, more efficient car parking provision, mixed-use development and opportunities for home delivery services. Where development consists of defined elements, such as a retail warehouse park or a grouping of retail or leisure uses, the First Secretary of State expects developers and retailers to consider the degree to which constituent parts of the development could be accommodated on more central sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/16">In applying the sequential approach, the relevant centres in which to search for sites will depend on the nature and scale of the proposed development and the catchment that the development seeks to serve, as set out in the Caborn statement. The scale of such proposals should also be appropriately related to the centre and catchment that the development seeks to serve. The First Secretary of State therefore wishes to make it clear that development that would serve a wide catchment should be located in a centre that serves a similar catchment area. Bulky Goods</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/17">PPG6 recognises that some types of retailing, such as large stores selling bulky goods, may not be able to find suitable sites either in or on the edge of town centres. The First Secretary of State considers that it rests with developers and retailers to demonstrate that a majority of their goods cannot be sold from town centre stores. He does not consider that developments involving the sale of bulky goods are exempted from meeting the policy tests in PPG6 and subsequent clarifications. Revised PPG6</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/18">The First Secretary of State will be issuing revised planning policy guidance for town centres and retail developments for consultation in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.3/1">A proposal was submitted to my department in January 2003 by the Shipbuilders and Shiprepairers Association (SSA), acting in conjunction with the Society of Maritime Industries (SMI) and the British Marine Federation (BMF), for a further grant towards their Marine Industry Improvement Partnership. This application was very much at a conceptual level and contained no details of the number of companies to be assisted, nor the amount of grant being sought (although another related submission to the steering group of the Shipbuilding and Marine Industries Forum indicated that grants in excess of &pound;5 million were likely to be requested).</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2">This proposal has subsequently been discussed at meetings of the steering group of the Shipbuilding and Marine Industries Forum, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-18">18 March 2003</phrase>, as well as at a meeting held on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase> of the SSA's steering group, which is managing the current &pound;2.8 million grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/3">The SSA, SMI and BMF attend the Shipbuilding and Marine Industries Forum and officials of my Marine Unit attend both the Shipbuilding and Marine Industries Forum and the SSA's steering group.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/4">My officials have pointed out to the SSA that, before consideration could be given to further grants, the SSA would have to provide my officials with a full economic evaluation of the outcomes of the existing grant compared with the targets which were offered by the SSA in their first grant application. This evaluation has yet to start. More generally, the emphasis for DTI's entire business support programme for industry has been evolving over recent months in response to feedback from key stakeholders. I lead the Innovation Review, which will set out a strategy and action plan to improve innovation performance in the UK. In parallel with this, the implementation of the review of DTI business support is leading to a small number of new products clearly targeted at enhancing UK competitiveness. As a result, a smaller number of new business support products are being developed which will be broad, flexible and targeted at the needs of the customer, while aimed at driving up productivity through strategic investments in four key areas of activity: innovation, enterprise and best practice, investment and skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/2">Jobcentre Plus has a standard procedure for indicating to tenderers why their tender has been rejected. This is done on a pro forma which has been developed for use in all procurement competitions that Jobcentre Plus holds. The standards for tenders are clearly stated when the competition is called. Potential tenderers are able to seek clarification of these procedures at pre-tender meetings or from contract teams. Providers are also invited to discuss the reason for rejection so that they can meet requirements in future tenders.</p>
