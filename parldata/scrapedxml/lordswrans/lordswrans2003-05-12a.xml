	<p pid="a.3.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-28">28 April</phrase> I undertook to provide further detail on opium cultivation in Afghanistan if necessary. This was contained in my letter to the noble Lord on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-29">29 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/2">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, reported that the level of cultivation in 2002 was 74,000 hectares (compared to 91,000 hectares in 1999, 82,000 hectares in 2000 and 8,000 hectares in 2001). The UNODC is in the process of carrying out the 2003 survey. Its results will be published in the autumn. In March 2003, the UNODC published an Opium Rapid Assessment Survey for Afghanistan. This gave an early insight into the pattern of opium poppy cultivation for the 2002&ndash;03 growing season but did not predict the level of opium poppy cultivation for 2003 or beyond. It did find however that there was a trend for farmers to cultivate opium poppy in increasingly remote and inaccessible areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/3">President Karzai signalled his determination to rid Afghanistan of drugs by banning the production, processing and trafficking of drugs in January 2002. A compensated eradication programme to tackle the 2002 opium poppy crop followed this, which the UK provided financial and logistical support for. The Afghan authorities believe this led to the destruction of 17,300 hectares of opium poppy, nearly 25 per cent of the poppy crop. This was the figure I referred to in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-28">28 April</phrase> (Official Report, Col. 445).</p>

	<p pid="a.9.0/1">The Home Office asked the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to assess the health and safety aspects of the TETRA technology. A report was published by the NRPB's independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation in July 2001. The report concluded that, &quot;Although areas of uncertainty remain about the biological effects of low level RF radiation in general, including modulated signals, current evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the special features of the signals from TETRA mobile terminals and repeaters pose a hazard to health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/2">Other countries in the European Union use a variety of systems for emergency communications. Like in the United Kingdom, older systems tend to be based on analogue technology, while more recent systems are digital.

	<p pid="a.11.0/1">Quality is at the heart of the Government's agenda for the National Health Service. NHS organisations have a statutory duty to improve the quality of health care they provide. Quality improvement is supported by: clear national standards for services and treatments; local delivery of high quality health care, through clinical governance underpinned by modernised professional self-regulation and extended lifelong learning; and effective monitoring and inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">Clinical governance provides NHS organisations and healthcare professionals with a framework through which they are accountable for continuous quality improvement. The NHS Clinical Governance Support Team (part of the NHS Modernisation Agency) provides programmes to support the implementation throughout that service. The Commission for Health Improvement reviews clinical governance arrangements in NHS organisations, including the education, training and continuing personal and professional development of staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">The Government are committed to ensuring that standards of professional clinical competence are maintained and developed, and are working in collaboration with the professional and regulatory bodies to develop a shared framework for post-qualification learning. It is intended that the framework should be available in July 2004. Over the next three years, an extra &pound;96 million will be made available locally to support local strategic learning and development plans and ensure that trusts deliver continuing professional development effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4">The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill currently before Parliament, retains the duty of quality for NHS bodies, and additionally provides for the Secretary of State for Health to publish standards for the provision of NHS healthcare. The Bill also enables the proposed Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI) to advise the Secretary of State on changes which it thinks should be made to the standards for the purpose of securing improvement in the quality of healthcare. The Bill proposes that CHAI will review each year the provision of healthcare by NHS bodies, and in so doing will take into account the standards set by the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.2/2" qnum="HL2571">What action they are taking following the article in Nature (Vol 421 pp 691-2) which argues that the dose response to most toxins, including ionising radiation, is hormetic, which means that the body's response to low doses is almost always beneficial rather than harmful.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.3/1">The hormesis theory described in the article in Nature is highly controversial. There is little evidence to support claims that exposure to low doses of toxic chemicals such as cadmium, dioxin, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nor ionising radiation, has a beneficial health effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/2">The approach adopted by government departments/agencies when assessing the health risks arising from toxic chemicals is based on the assumption that for most chemicals there is a dose below which no harmful effects would be expected; that is, that there is a threshold dose. This is used in estimating safe levels of exposure. However, in the specific case of chemicals that affect the genetic material of the cell (DNA), and which may then go on to cause cancer, the prudent assumption is made that there is no threshold, and any exposure may increase cancer risk, albeit this increase may be very small at low dose levels. This is in line with the advice from the relevant, independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on the Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC).</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/3">A similar approach is taken with regard to ionising radiation, since this may produce cancer by affecting DNA. Again this is in line with advice from the National Radiological Protection Board, and from the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE).</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/4">The COC is currently in the process of updating its guidance on the risk assessment of chemical carcinogens and the Nature article has been referred to it for consideration in its deliberations.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.2/1">There have been no specific surveys among disabled people. However, the voluntary body Antenatal Results and Choices is represented on the United Kingdom National Screening Committee's (NSC) antenatal screening sub-group. The aims of the antenatal screening programme are to enable parents to make informed choices about the future of the pregnancy. The decision should be made when the best interests of the woman, her partner, the future baby and the family have all been considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/2">Abortion is only legal in Great Britain subject to the Abortion Act 1967, as amended. Termination on the grounds of foetal abnormality is permitted where &quot;there is substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&quot;. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline Termination of Pregnancy for foetal abnormality (1996) states that the woman, and her partner, need to be given enough information and time to help her understand the nature of the foetal abnormality and the probable outcome of the pregnancy in order that she can make an informed decision as to whether or not to proceed with the pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.2/3">The Human Genetics Commission has stressed the importance of balanced information for parents in their work with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and will be working with the NSC to ensure that this work informs plans to implement national antenatal screening programmes. Representatives from disability groups were included on the recent HFEA working group on pre-implantation genetic diagnoses.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.6/1">The publication of the Stewart report in May 2000 provided a comprehensive review of the possible health effects of radiofrequency (RF) exposure from the use of mobile phones. Experimental and epidemiological studies gave no indication of a risk of cancer on the basis of evidence available. The expert group did, however, note the limited amount of time that phones had been in use and the need for more research.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.6/2">Over the last few years a number of review groups for example in Canada, the Netherlands and France as well as the Stewart group have assessed the possible health effects of exposure to RF radiation, as from mobile phone masts. In all cases the conclusion has been that the epidemiological evidence currently available does not suggest that RF exposure causes cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.6/3">A recommendation in the Stewart report was that there should be a further comprehensive review of the science related to possible health effects of exposure to RF radiation within three years. The Government asked for this review to be carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and the board of NRPB asked for this to be undertaken by its independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation. This review is nearing completion and will be finalised by the end of 2003. It will include a review of the totality of scientific evidence related to concerns about the risk of cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.6/4">The main on-going epidemiology (human health) study related to the use of mobile phones is the Interphone study being conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This combined series of multi-national case-control studies has greater power to provide definitive information on this subject than any previous or individual study.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.6/5">Results from the Interphone study are expected in 2004 and more information about this study is available on the web site <a href="http://www.iarc.fr/pageroot/UNITS/RCA4.html">http://www.iarc.fr/pageroot/UNITS/RCA4.html</a></p>

	<p pid="a.19.2/1">The report of Sir Donald Acheson's Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health, published in 1998, contained the finding that &quot;Although death rates have fallen and life expectancy increased, there is little evidence that the population is experiencing less morbidity or disability than 10 or 20 years ago&quot;. This finding was largely based on morbidity data from the Office for National Statistics General Household Survey which show the prevalance of both long-standing and limiting long-standing illness increased steadily through the 1970s and early 1980s and that since the mid-1980s there has been no clear trend over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.2/1">We are publishing today a report by Her Majesty's Inspector of Anatomy, Dr Jeremy Metters CB, into the case of the late Mr Cyril Mark Isaacs whose brain was removed following a coroner's post mortem in 1987 without the knowledge or consent of his widow.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">The inspector found that Mr Isaac's brain was retained as part of an arrangement whereby the coroners' office in North Manchester would identify brains suitable for a research programme at Manchester University. The inspector also found evidence that brains were removed from adults in other locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/3">The Secretary of State for Health asked HM Inspector to undertake this investigation following concerns raised by Mr Isaac's widow, Mrs Elaine Isaacs. We wish to pay tribute to Mrs Isaacs for bringing this case to public attention and to say how much we regret the distress that has been caused not only to her and her family but to others whose cases are mentioned in the inspector's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/4">The events described in the report relate to unacceptable practices some years ago. Since then, and particularly in the light of other reports, including those into events at Alder Hey and Bristol, we have made considerable steps to improve arrangements relating to any removal, retention and use of human organs and tissue from adults or children. In doing so, we have worked very closely with many statutory, professional, family, voluntary and other bodies. We are grateful to them for helping to change the culture and practice in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/5">The report makes a number of specific recommendations with implications for the National Health Service, coroners, universities and medical researchers. We shall consider these carefully in the light of action already taken in this area and then respond more formally. Following extensive consultation, we have recently published an interim framework of guidance and other materials to reflect transparent new systems founded on consent. Steps have been taken to modernise the practice of pathology and to improve the management of joint NHS and academic posts. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is considering the report of the fundamental review of the coroner's system. We have also consulted on changes to the law on human organs and tissue, which is outmoded and inadequate. We shall introduce new legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/6">We appreciate that some people may be concerned about organ retention in the light of the inspector's report. We have therefore asked the Retained Organs Commission to put specific arrangements in place for anyone who wishes to make an enquiry. A helpline has been established (0800 838909).</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/7">It is important that public confidence in medical research is not adversely affected by the findings in the report. Good quality research is essential if we are to meet today's public health challenges seriously. Our recently published interim statement on the use of human organs and tissue sets out clearly our expectations within the current law. This should help to reassure the public, as well as those who need to use organs and tissue for purposes that serve all our interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/8">We are grateful to Dr Metters for investigating this matter in such detail and for producing such a helpful and comprehensive report. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.0/1">The qualifying areas for the exemption were identified by reference to the most recent national indices of deprivation at the time the original legislation was introduced. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the indices refer to electoral wards or divisions. In Scotland the index uses postcode areas. The regulations use wards and postcode areas accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.3/1">The definition of &quot;markets&quot; for the purpose of applying competition law is a matter for the relevant competition authorities to determine on a case-by-case basis when considering whether a competition problem may exist.
