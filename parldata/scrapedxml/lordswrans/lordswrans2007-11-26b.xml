	<p pid="b.95.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/2" qnum="HL337">Whether they have assessed the proposal to police the illegal sale of alcohol to underage drinkers in Northern Ireland by the systematic use of underage children as police decoys; whether this tactic constitutes entrapment; and whether they have implemented such a tactic anywhere else within the United Kingdom.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-11-26b.95.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="95"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71126w0001.htm#0711264000029">
	<p pid="b.95.2/1">Information received from the Northern Ireland Office states that it is currently progressing new legislative powers for test purchasing the sale of alcohol to under 18 year-olds. This legislative power is to be included within the draft Criminal Justice (NI) Order 2007. The draft 2007 order has been issued by the Northern Ireland Office for public consultation, which is due to conclude on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase>. It is anticipated that the legislative powers for &quot;test purchase operations&quot; will extend to off and on licence premises, including off licences at supermarkets.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/2">The use of under 18 year-olds within test purchasing operations authorised by police will require written parental consent and be subject to strict guidelines, controls and procedures that avoid any risks to and ensure the welfare of under 18 year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/3">The police welcome the proposed test purchasing powers as it will assist in addressing not only the sale of alcohol to under 18 year-olds, but also the closely linked problems of youth disorder and alcohol fuelled anti-social behaviour as a result of underage drinking.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/4">Test purchasing legislative powers for the sale of alcohol to under 18 year-olds have been used for some time in England and Wales. Over recent years there have been a number of Home Office sponsored test purchase campaigns including tackling underage sales of alcohol (TUSAC) campaigns in October 2006 and more recently from May to July 2007. The advice to participating forces is to work in partnership with local trading standards officers and to refer them to the LACORS national guidance on test purchase.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/5">Parental consent has to be obtained for young people to participate in a campaign and a full risk assessment has to be undertaken in all cases. Details of this can be found in the attached guidance which also includes a section on entrapment.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/6">A copy of this guidance has been forwarded to the noble Lord and copies provided to the Lords Library. Alternatively it can be accessed through the following link at <a href="http://www.lacors.gov.uk/lacors/ContentDetails">www.lacors.gov.uk/lacors/ContentDetails</a> .aspx?id=8056.</p>

In such a circumstance, nuclei would be taken from the cells of the person to be treated to generate the stem cells that would then be developed into the type of cell to be used for treatment. In this case, because the material to be used would have been derived from the person being treated, it is unlikely that the recipient would reject the implanted tissue. There is a huge body of evidence to show that when foreign tissue is injected into a person, the person raises antibodies against it and will reject the implanted tissue.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.3/2">Local authorities are required to carry out regular reviews and assessments of air quality in their areas against objectives in the national air quality strategy, which have been prescribed in regulations. Where it is found that these objectives are unlikely to be met, authorities must designate air quality management areas (AQMAs) and prepare and implement remedial action plans to tackle the problem. Defra requires local authorities that have AQMAs to produce an action plan between 12 and 18 months following designation of their AQMA, as set out in policy guidance LAQM.PG(03). Authorities have been required to take account of the guidance in carrying out their duties since February 2003.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.4/2" qnum="HL249">Why employers who have paid the lower &quot;contracted out&quot; national insurance contributions for an employee are then required to pay the higher full rate if the employee chooses to remain at work beyond state pension age.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.5/1">Reduced rate employer and employee national insurance contributions (NICs) are payable in respect of individuals under state pension age who have contracted out of the state second pension. Once individuals reach state pension age they no longer pay NICs or accrue further entitlement to the state second pension. Employer NICs are therefore payable at the full rate for individuals working beyond state pension age, regardless of whether they were previously contracted out.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.5/1">We have received a number of representations about our decision but our policy not only responds to the challenge in the Leitch report to increase the proportion of the workforce with higher level skills from under 30 per cent now to more than 40 per cent by 2020 but is also fairer to both taxpayers and students who have not yet entered higher education. The overall effect of these changes on the income of individual institutions will depend on how successful they are in attracting students who meet our priorities, but no institution will lose grant in cash terms as a result of these changes. The future can be a bright one for the Open University if it develops new approaches to attract more of the millions of people who have not yet obtained a first higher education qualification and all the benefits it brings.</p>
