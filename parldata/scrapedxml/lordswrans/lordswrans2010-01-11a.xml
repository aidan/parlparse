	<p pid="a.128.8/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> the Freedom of Information Act has enabled the public greater access to official information held by over 100,000 public authorities. The Ministry of Justice publishes annual reports on the operation of the Act in central government and quarterly statistical reports on the performance of central government monitored bodies and their handling of FOI requests since the Act came in to force.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.8/2">A total of 171,000 requests have been dealt with under the Act by central government monitored bodies during the period January 2005 to September 2009. Eighty-nine per cent of these requests were answered within time, that is, a response was provided within the standard deadline or a permitted deadline extension was applied. Of those requests where it was possible to give a substantive decision on whether to release the information being sought, 62 per cent were granted in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.8/3">In January 2009 the Dacre review of the 30-year rule recommended that the Government should consider a reduction to the 30-year rule-the point at which government information is usually opened to the public at an archive or other place of the deposit. The Government have accepted that there should be a reduction to the rule. Any such change would require amendments to the Freedom of Information Act. We are currently considering our response to the review and will publish it in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.5/1">The Government share the concern of the Organisation of Islamic Conference that individuals around the world are victimised because of their religion or belief. We all need to do more to eliminate religious intolerance and to ensure that those who incite hatred or violence against individuals because of their religious beliefs are dealt with by the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/2">But the Government cannot agree with an approach that promotes the concept of &quot;defamation of religions&quot; as a response. This approach severely risks diminishing the right to freedom of expression. We believe that international human rights law already strikes the right balance between the individual's right to express themselves freely and the need for the state to limit this right in certain circumstances. International human rights law provides that only where advocacy of religious hatred constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence should it be prohibited by law.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/3">We believe that the concept of &quot;defamation of religions&quot; puts in danger the very openness and tolerance that allows people of different faiths to co-exist and to practise their faith without fear. It risks changing the focus of international human rights law from examining how countries promote and protect the right to freedom of expression to censoring what individuals say. If this happened, people might feel unable to speak out against human rights abuses or hold their government to account. It is also inconsistent with the international human rights legal framework which exists to protect individuals and not concepts or specific belief systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.5/4">For this reason the UK, along with our EU Partners and other like-minded countries, voted against the resolution put forward by the Organisation of Islamic Conference at the 64th session of the UN General Assembly on Combating Defamation of Religions.</p>

Submissions may also include evidence of public engagement activities directly beneficial to higher education undertaken by the museum/gallery (for example, work contributing to public understanding of the research process and its outcomes)&quot;.</p>
