	<p pid="a.120.2/1">The Freedom of Information Bill contains a provision in Clause 4 which permits the Secretary of State, by order, to bring within the scope of the Bill private organisations which exercise functions of a public nature. Before making such an order the Secretary of State will be required to consult every person to whom the order relates or persons appearing to him to represent such persons.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/2">Before reaching a decision whether to make an order under this provision, the Secretary of State will, among other things, wish to determine whether designation of a body as a public authority, as defined in the Bill, will lead to information being obtained which is not otherwise available from another public authority and the regulatory burden which would be imposed on the private organistation.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/3">In the case of private organisations operating in regulated sectors of the economy such as Railtrack plc, it is intended that information relating to its public functions which would be disclosable under the terms of the legislation would be available from the regulatory authorities. In the case of Railtrack plc, this will be the Office of the Rail Regulator and the Health and Safety Executive. If legislation regulating the flow of information contains unjustified statutory bars to disclosure, these will be amended by an order made under Clause 74 of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/4">Therefore, the Government are satisfied that it is not necessary to designate Railtrack plc as a public authority for the purposes of the freedom of information legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.2/5">With regard to other companies which we intend should be subject to the Freedom of Information Bill, I refer the noble Lord to the list attached to the reply I gave on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-20">20 April</phrase> (Official Report, cols.

	<p pid="a.122.2/1">Schedule 2 to the Terrorism Bill lists organisations which are currently proscribed under either the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 or the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996.

	<p pid="a.122.2/2">The proscription powers in the 1989 and 1996 Acts can only be exercised against organisations concerned in terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland.

	<p pid="a.122.2/3">However, the Terrorism Bill provides for the first time a power to proscribe organisations concerned in other forms of terrorism. The Government are considering which organisations involved in international terrorism might be added to Schedule 2 once the Bill is in force.

This compares to a capital expenditure profile in the review of &pound;6.5 million, &pound;14.3 million, &pound;20.9 million, &pound;1.2 million and &pound;5 million in the first five years and &pound;24.4 million in total in the following five years.

	<p pid="a.128.0/1">Records are not retained at RAF Little Rissington for longer than one year. The number of launches in 1999 was 4,232, all of which were by the Air Cadet Volunteer Gliding School using self-propelled gliders. The level of activity in previous years would have been at the same level and the Air Cadet Volunteer Gliding School plans to continue at this level for the next five years. The RAF is considering a proposal to allow the RAF Gliding and Soaring Association's Bicester Gliding Club and the Joint Service Adventurous Training (Gliding) Centre, both currently based at Bicester, to relocate to RAF Little Rissington The annual flying activity of JSAT(G) is estimated in the region of 4,500 aerotow launches and 300 self-propelled flights during weekdays. A further 9,000 winch launches and 900 aerotug launches would be made by the RAFGSA, which operates seven days a week during the period of March to the end of October.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.2/1">The estimate of &pound;4 billion in backdated pension costs comes as a result of a ruling by the European Court of Justice.

	<p pid="a.137.6/1">The cost of creating a new hospital bed place in a new hospital is approximately &pound;325,000, excluding value added tax at current prices. The cost includes the capital construction cost, equipment costs and professional fees incurred, as well as a proportion of the costs of the supporting services within the new hospital such as operating theatres, outpatient departments, accident and emergency services, catering, office accommodation, public areas, pharmacy, pathology and radiology. It does not include the running costs necessary to make the bed operational, such as staffing, linen or cleaning. A new bed in an existing hospital would be considerably cheaper.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.6/2">The total average cost to the National Health Service of training a new non-specialist nurse is &pound;33,000 over three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">The Government have published new guidance, Safeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution--Supplementary Guidance to Working Together To Safeguard Children. It establishes that the primary law-enforcement effort must be against those who coerce children into and abuse them through prostitution. Children involved in prostitution should be treated primarily as victims of abuse. The guidance sets out an inter-agency approach, based on local protocols, to address this type of abuse. The identification of a child involved in prostitution, or at risk of being drawn into prostitution, should always trigger the agreed local area child protection committee procedures to ensure the child's safety and welfare and to enable the police to gather evidence about abusers and coercers. The guidance forms an important part of the Government's strategy to combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Copies of the guidance will be placed in the Library.</p>
