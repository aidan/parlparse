Changes to the Type 23 frigates' operating patterns, and a more efficient maintenance regime, enable the Royal Navy to provide the required capability with fewer ships than was necessary in 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.5/1">The Privy Council has made an Order in Council, the Consular Fees (No.2) Order 2002, which gives authority for a revision in passport fees. The revision will take effect on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-21">21 November 2002</phrase>. The fee for a standard 32-page passport will increase from &pound;30 to &pound;33, while the fee for a 48-page passport will remain at &pound;40. The fee for amending an existing passport will increase from &pound;18 to &pound;22.50. The cost of a passport for a child will increase from &pound;16 to &pound;19. The additional charges for those making use of the guaranteed fast track and premium services available from the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) counters remain unchanged at &pound;30 and &pound;45 respectively. The fee for a collective passport, for organised trips for schools and youth groups, will decrease from &pound;42 to &pound;39. The order also increases fees for passport applications made overseas to British consular posts. There will be an increase from &pound;49 to &pound;54.40 for a standard 32-page passport, an increase from &pound;60 to &pound;65.20 for a 48-page passport, an increase from &pound;29 to &pound;34.70 for a child passport and an increase from &pound;30 to &pound;33.90 for an emergency passport.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.5/2">Passport fees are set at the level needed to cover the costs of passport issuing, including, in this case, the recovery of certain deficits accrued before 1999 and the costs of providing overseas consular protection services which are not covered by other fees. The changes set out in the order follow a careful review of costs to ensure that the fee for each type of passport service closely reflects the production costs and past deficits accrued by that service and bears its share of the cost of consular protection services. In relation to the cost of travel abroad, the new fees still represent very good value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.2/1">Public authorities listed in Schedule 1A to the Race Relations Act 1976, as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, are subject to the duty to promote race equality. These include police authorities. The duty requires public authorities, in carrying out their functions, to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good race relations between persons of different racial groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/2">People are free to assemble and to express views with which the Government may profoundly disagree so long as they do not breach the law. Decisions about how to police public assemblies are the responsibility of individual chief police officers. But we would expect these policing functions to be carried out in compliance with the duty.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.0/1">These questions were addressed in an article in the spring 2001 issue (No 103) of Population Trends <sup>1</sup> , which is available in the Library and from the National Statistics website: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/Product.asp?vink=6303">www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/Product.asp?vink=6303</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2">In this article future trends in population size, age structure and support ratios (the ratio of people of working age to those of pensionable age) were considered under a variety of different assumptions about future fertility and net international migration. (Net migration is the difference between the number of immigrants and the number of emigrants.) Assumed mortality improvements were taken from the then current principal national population projection produced by the Government Actuary's department.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/3">In the current national population projections, the population of the United Kingdom is projected to continue to increase until around the year 2040 and then to start to decline. In theory, a number of different combinations of future fertility and net migration levels could prevent the total population, and the working age population, from declining in size. For example, the article concluded that with the then current fertility assumptions from the principal, national population projection, annual net inward migration of 145,000 persons a year would produce approximate stability in both total population size and in the size of the working age population in the second half of this century.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/4">The effect of different levels of net migration on support ratios is a more complex issue and is discussed fully in the article in Population Trends 103.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">This was the first meeting of the new Council formation as reconfigured at Seville. Its relatively light agenda was weighted towards employment and social policy issues. There were no consumer affairs dossiers on the agenda, and only one health item was tabled. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, accompanied by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Employment Relations and the Regions, represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">The key discussion centred on the review of the European employment strategy (EES). The Council endorsed the opinion of the Employment Committee and Economic Policy Committee on the future of the EES, which makes more explicit the linkages between the EES and achieving the targets set at Lisbon in 2000. The Employment Committee will now draft an opinion on streamlining the Employment Guidelines and Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Discussions will continue at the December ESPHCA and it is expected that the new strategy will be signed off at the spring Council in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/3">The Presidency presented two progress reports without discussion: on agency work, which is likely to appear on the agenda for December's ESPHCA; and on a revised proposal for a directive protecting workers from the risks of exposure to electromagnetic fields and waves, which was remitted for further technical work. The chairman of the Social Protection Committee reported that the committee would agree new objectives on social inclusion at the end of October 2002. These would be approved at the European Council in Copenhagen in December. The chairman also drew attention to two reports for the 2003 spring Council: on long-term care for the elderly and the recently submitted national strategy reports on pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/4">The Council held a brief debate on gender and marginalisation in the context of national action plans on inclusion (NAPs incl). The Presidency called for more work to be done on appropriate indicators. All member states agreed to give greater prominence to gender in the 2003 round of NAPS incl.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/5">In relation to health issues, the Council discussed the advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products elements of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The Council agreed on how to proceed in light of the forthcoming negotiating round (the fifth) of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body in Geneva (14&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-10-25">25 October 2002</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/6">Under any other business, the Presidency outlined how the Council would follow up the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development with a letter to the President of the General and External Affairs Council. There would be Council conclusions in December. The Commission presented its plans for a communication on the rights of disabled people and for a conference on trafficking in humans.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/7">Over lunch, Ministers had a political discussion on the proposal for the replacement of the Standing Committee on Employment with a tripartite social summit on growth and employment.</p>

At the local education authority level the best such proxy available is provided by receipt of income support. The measure is based on a 100 per cent count of claimants at a point in time and our investigations have shown that it is robust and that claimants can be accurately assigned to local education authorities.</p>

Therefore, a planning application would not be required to keep a helicopter and to take off and land the helicopter within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse provided that the use is incidental to the domestic needs or enjoyment of the occupants of the house. If the use of the helicopter is more than incidental and amounts to, for example, a commercial operation, then a planning application for change of use of the land may be needed.
