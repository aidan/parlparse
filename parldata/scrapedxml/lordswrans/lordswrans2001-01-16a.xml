</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-01-16a.123.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="123"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010116/text/10116w01.htm#10116w01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.123.2/1">We remain fully committed to defence diversification--the &quot;spin out&quot; of defence technology to the civil sector for wider benefit. The Defence Diversification Agency (DDA) has made a very successful start in delivering that policy objective since its establishment in 1999. The implementation of our Public Private Partnership proposals for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) will make a further and very substantial contribution to defence diversification. It will be in the interest of &quot;NewDERA&quot; to exploit opportunities for the &quot;spin-out&quot; of defence technology to the civil sector. At the same time we shall want to ensure that the Defence Scientific and Technical Laboratory (DSTL), the part of DERA to be retained in the MoD, also contributes fully to defence diversification activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/2">Since the DDA currently operates as part of DERA, some reorganisation over the next few months is inevitable. Responsibility for the agency, we propose, will be transferred from DERA to MoD headquarters, from where it would continue to facilitate the achievement of our defence diversification objectives. It would ensure that opportunities for &quot;spin-out&quot;, and also the &quot;spin-in&quot; of civil technology to the MoD, are disseminated and exploited, and that industry is assisted with its own diversification planning. A major part of diversification activities would in future be undertaken from within NewDERA and DSTL, by existing DDA staff operating from their current locations, continuing the work that they do now, and transferred to NewDERA and DSTL for that purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.2/3">We shall work closely with industry and other stakeholders to ensure that the DDA continues to secure our policy objectives. Detailed new arrangements will now be worked out and we shall consult about the staffing implications in the normal way. In the light of experience of the new organisation, we shall consider further the establishment of a Defence Diversification Council.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-01-16a.126.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100325" speakername="Lord Irvine of Lairg" colon=":" colnum="126"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010116/text/10116w01.htm#10116w01_spmin5">
	<p pid="a.126.2/1">The final evaluation report has been published today, and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. I am grateful to Professor Walker and her team at Newcastle University for the very detailed and informative report they have produced.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="1999-06-17">17 June 1999</phrase>, Official Report col.WA39, the Government announced that it would await the final evaluation report before deciding the way forward on Part II.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/3">The research has concluded that none of the six models of information meeting tested over a two-year period is good enough for the implementation of Part II on a nationwide basis. It has shown that, for most people, the meetings came too late to save marriages and tended to incline those who were uncertain about their marriages towards divorce. Whilst people valued the provision of information, the meetings were too inflexible, providing general information about both marriage saving and the divorce process. People wanted information tailored to their individual circumstances and needs. In additon, in the great majority of cases, only the person petitioning for divorce attended the meeting, but marriage counselling, conciliatory divorce and mediation depend for success on the willing involvement of both parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/4">The report has suggested testing a further model designed to address the majority of the shortcomings identified in the pilots. However, this new kind of meeting would not solve the underlying problems associated with compulsory information meetings, in particular the timing of the meetings in the divorce process and their inability to engage both parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/5">Furthermore, in the Government's view, the problems with Part II are not limited to the provisions on information meetings. The new procedures would be complex and likely to lead to significant delay and uncertainty which would not be in the best interests of the couple or their children. There are concerns that its provisions would prove unworkable in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/6">The Government therefore do not believe Part II would fulfil the principles of Part I of the Act, to which they remain committed. These principles include saving saveable marriages and, where marriages break down, bringing them to an end with the minimum distress to the parties and children affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/7">The Government are not satisfied that it would be right to proceed with the implementation of Part II and propose to invite Parliament to repeal the relevant sections of the Family Law Act 1996 once a suitable legislative opportunity occurs. This decision does not affect section 22, in Part II, relating to the funding of marriage support services, which is in force and will remain so. In addition, while it is not possible to implement separately the provisions at sections 9(3) and (4) of Part II, the Government are sympathetic to the needs of Jewish women who are denied a religious divorce, and are considering the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/8">The Government will draw on the evaluation report and build on the initiatives already under way in their efforts to support marriage and stable relationships and to reduce the damaging impact of family conflict and relationship breakdown on children. They have taken forward a wide range of measures over the past three years to help families, including establishing the new Children's Fund and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, improving maternity and parental leave arrangements, and increasing funding for marriage and relationship support to a total of &pound;5 million per annum by 2002-2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.2/1">The final report of the Civil Justice Reform Group was published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-16">16 June</phrase> with a consultation period until the end of September. My original purpose in establishing the group was to ensure a reform programme tailored to Northern Ireland's needs and informed by those with practical experience of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/2">I am very grateful to Lord Justice Campbell, who chaired the group, and to the other members for their work. I am also grateful to those who responded during the consultation period. Broadly, I accept the report's main direction and its principal recommendations. There are notable departures from arrangements in England and Wales but I am satisfied they are appropriate in the Northern Ireland context.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.2/3">There are a few technical recommendations in relation to expert evidence on which I do not share the views expressed in the report. These will require further consideration and of course there are other points of detail to be looked at closely during the implementation process, but overall I am of the view that the report's recommendations represent a major step forward in the reform of the civil justice system in Northern Ireland to make it as accessible, economic and efficient as possible. Implementation will begin as soon as possible with an increase in the small claims jurisdiction early this year followed by an approximately two-year rolling programme of subordinate legislation and operational changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.5/2">We have today, therefore, issued a consultation paper setting out proposed alterations to the code. These proposals reflect in particular the importance of councils consulting with their local communities, that individual councillors can take decisions, and that referendums, petitions and mayoral elections can take place under the Local Government Act 2000. A copy of this paper has been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
