	<p pid="d.143.11/1">Aquaculture in England consists largely of the cultivation of trout in freshwater and bivalve molluscs (for example, oysters and mussels) in marine sites, although production is relatively small in relation to the UK as a whole and to other member states.</p>

In addition, and related to shellfish aquaculture, the department has sponsored a research project assessing the ecological impact of using wild mussel seed in mussel culture. We have also commissioned a project which aims to develop best practice in movements of shellfish stock for aquaculture (to avoid further distribution of introduced pests).</p>

We are working with a range of partners to bring forward a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly first committee this autumn, which will start a formal UN process. We want to make good progress, but this must be at a pace that will take other countries with us. Our latest round of global lobbying clearly indicated that, while there is good support for the start of a UN process beginning with the formation of a group of governmental experts, there is at this stage only very limited support for moving straight to an open-ended working group. We shall continue to work closely with a wide variety of partners in the run-up to first committee.</p>

	<p pid="d.154.0/1">Four Iraqis were alleged to have been made to walk into the Shatt Al Basra Canal: the deceased, Mr Hanoun and two others who appear not to have been known to Mr Hanoun and did not come forward as witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="d.154.0/2">Mr Hanoun provided an initial statement to the Royal Military Police, which was recorded in English with the aid of an interpreter. The statement had the usual declaration on it that the statement was true to the knowledge and belief of the witness and that he made it knowing that if it was tendered in evidence he would be liable for prosecution if he wilfully stated in it anything that he knew to be false or did not believe to be true. It was unclear, following evidence at the trial, whether the statement was ever read back to him before he signed it and there was no addendum at the bottom of the statement that had been signed by the interpreter to indicate that this had been done.</p>
	<p pid="d.154.0/3">The Royal Military Police Special Investigations Branch (SIB) then took over the case and video interviewed Mr Hanoun, assisted by a locally employed SIB interpreter. In the UK a detailed examination of the translation took place when a written transcript of the interview was prepared (it became apparent that there were significant inaccuracies with the interpretation that had taken place at the time the interview was conducted). Further written statements were taken from Mr Hanoun with the benefit of an interpreter and this process was recorded on to tape and the translations checked.</p>
	<p pid="d.154.0/4">All recordings and videos were provided to the Army Prosecuting Authority together with transcripts. The tape recordings and video of Mr Hanoun's witness interviews were not played to the court other than very small excerpts. While a full transcript of those interviews was available and used in cross-examination it was not produced to the court.</p>

In addition to the material collated by the investigating team, the prosecution disclosed to the accused documentation prepared in respect of the compensation claim (made by the family of the deceased and supported by Mr Hanoun), which provided slightly different accounts that were at odds with the witness statements. Extensive cross-examination drew out the inconsistencies between the accounts that had been given and emphasised the inconsistencies that there were in Mr Hanoun's evidence.</p>

	<p pid="d.156.5/1">The relevant criminal legislation to which Lord Bassam of Brighton referred was reviewed as part of the <i>Proceeds of Crime&mdash;Consultation on Draft Legislation</i> which was published and a copy placed in the House Library in March 2001 (Command Paper 5066). New and strengthened powers on the restraint and recovery of criminal assets were subsequently introduced in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="d.156.5/2">Under the Act, suspected criminal assets can be restrained at the point of commencement of a police or other law enforcement investigation rather than at point of charge. This measure helps to prevent the potential dissipation of assets. In the international context, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order will help facilitate the repatriation of stolen assets, in response to a request from an overseas authority, by enabling assets situated in England and Wales to be restrained at an early stage. The order came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase> and makes similar provisions for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="d.158.2/1">I am advised by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) that the outsourced recruitment providers, the Consensia Partnership, apply the <i>National Recruitment Standards&mdash;Medical Standards for Police Recruitment</i>, Home Office Circular 59/2004 for the assessment of all candidates.</p>
	<p pid="d.158.2/2">This guidance specifically takes account of the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the application of which applied to police officers from <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>. As a result it is unlawful to exclude candidates automatically on the basis of a medical condition or disability.</p>
	<p pid="d.158.2/3">While the employment decisions are for the PSNI, the recruitment assessment process for those with insulin-treated diabetes ensures that each case is considered individually and on its own merits. This includes a thorough medical assessment process, including seeking medical reports from the individual's diabetic specialist. Thereafter, a report is forwarded with recommendations to the PSNI.</p>
	<p pid="d.158.2/4">At that stage the PSNI considers each case at a PSNI disability panel before coming to a decision regarding employability.

We have produced specific guidelines on handling forced marriage cases for police, social care services and education professionals, to which the noble Lord might wish to refer, and are developing guidance for health professionals. These are available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/forcedmarriage">www.fco.gov.uk/forcedmarriage</a>.

	<p pid="d.166.2/1">At the Gleneagles summit on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>, G8 leaders endorsed an aid package of $3 billion per year for three years to help build the Palestinian economy, if certain conditions were met. These conditions included movement and access between Israel and the Palestinian territories and a process of establishing a development plan for the Palestinian territories.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.2/2">Hamas's victory in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections in January 2006 pre-empted any implementation of the Gleneagles commitment and the context has now shifted significantly. Although the Gleneagles commitment is not off the table, many donors, including the UK, have suspended direct aid to the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. Until Hamas meets the three principles set out in the quartet statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> (recognition of Israel, renunciation of violence and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations) direct financial and technical assistance to the Palestinian Authority cannot be resumed. However, development assistance continues outside the Palestinian Authority. The EU is working urgently to set up a temporary international mechanism to meet Palestinian basic needs. Many donors, including the UK, are planning to channel money through this mechanism.</p>

	<p pid="d.166.5/1">The UK works closely with the UN mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the Kosovo Government and other international organisations seeking to improve the judicial system and tackle organised crime and corruption.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.5/2">The UK provides around 65 police officers to UNMIK to assist with law enforcement in Kosovo and provided expertise and equipment to increase the effectiveness of the Kosovo Organised Crime Unit (now called the Directorate of Organised Crime). We have provided witness protection equipment to the local district courts in order to enable them to secure a victim's testimony and also specialist IT training for the Kosovo Police Service. In addition, the Department for International Development is working to strengthen the new Ministries of Justice and the Interior. Our contribution in supplying the witness protection equipment was recognised by Soren Jessen-Petersen, UN special representative in Kosovo, in his recent report to the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.5/3">We also contribute almost 19 per cent of the funding to the EU's external assistance programme to the western Balkans&mdash;the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme. Between 2005 and 2006, CARDS has allocated &euro;143.5 million to Kosovo and &euro;11.6 million is devoted to justice and home affairs issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.5/4">The instrument for pre-accession replaces CARDS from 2007 as the EU's financial instrument which streamlines all pre-accession assistance within a single framework. The EU has not yet reached a decision on the financial allocations for any of the countries covered by the instrument.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.5/5">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also paid for an official from the Department for Constitutional Affairs to go to Kosovo last December to carry out an assessment on the Kosovo judicial system.

Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum 2002 provides an interpretation of Article 33(2) of the 1951 convention. Under Section 72 a &quot;particularly serious crime&quot; is one for which the person concerned has received a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years, or has been convicted of an offence specified by order of the Secretary of State, whatever the length of sentence imposed. An automatic presumption is made, which is rebuttal, that such a person poses a danger to the community.</p>

These conclusions also emphasised the need for EPAs to take into account &quot;all parties' respective political choices&quot; and stressed the importance of the scheduled review of EPAs, as outlined in the Cotonou agreement, scheduled to take place later this year.

Rendered incontinent, they are often rejected by their husbands, thrown out of their homes and excluded from community life. DfID is therefore committed to promoting the rights of girls and women, particularly their sexual and reproductive rights. DfID is also committed to the elimination of harmful practices such as early marriage and female genital mutilation which can significantly increase the risk of fistula.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.5/4">DfID bilateral expenditure on maternal and reproductive health has increased by 42 per cent over the past three years to &pound;243 million. DfID targets some funding through NGOs to tackle obstetric fistula. For example, DfID has provided a grant of &pound;558,000 to the Engender Health and Women's Dignity Project to combat obstetric fistula in Tanzania and Uganda, and &pound;140,000 to the Obstetric Fistula in Africa Project. To complement our country-level support, DfID channels funds through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). DfID provides &pound;20 million a year core funding and in 2004, &pound;10 million specifically for reproductive health supplies. DfID also provides an annual contribution of &pound;19 million to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and &pound;12.5 million to the World Health Organisation (WHO), whose programmes support work on women's empowerment and maternal and reproductive health.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.5/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-27">27 June 2006</phrase>, the UNFPA will be launching a high-profile media campaign on obstetric fistula. I will attend this event on behalf of the Secretary of State for International Development.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.5/6">The UNFPA has chosen to locate the campaign in the UK to maximise the political commitment of the UK to addressing the millennium development goal targeted at improving maternal health.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-06-28d.176.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="176"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060628/text/60628w10.htm#60628w10_spmin2">
	<p pid="d.176.2/1">There is close liaison with the German Government, police and civil authorities at federal and local levels covering governmental, police, judicial and other co-operation. Detailed arrangements are in place to minimise the risk of significant English football disorder during the World Cup. The cornerstone of this is tough football banning order legislation which prevents known-risk fans leaving England and Wales during the tournament.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.2/2">The World Cup control period begins on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-30">30 May</phrase> and continues until <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-09">9 July</phrase>. All individuals subject to a football banning order will be required to report to a designated police station and surrender their passport on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-30">30 May</phrase>. Thereafter, they will be required to report on the day of each England game to ensure they have not attempted to travel.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.2/3">Compliance will also be enforced through an extensive police ports operation, which will take place at air, rail and sea ports during the World Cup control period. It is rare for individuals to breach the conditions of their banning orders and no banning order subject attempted to travel to Euro 2004. During a control period if the police decide that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the individual does pose a risk to public order they can prevent the individual travelling. This prompts a football banning order court hearing within 24 hours. During the Euro 2004 control period, police at ports used this procedure to serve notices which resulted in the imposition of 55 banning orders.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.2/4">An English police delegation will be deployed in Germany to support police operations in venue cities and other locations where English fans gather. This delegation includes police spotters, intelligence and liaison officers. The English police working in venue cities will include a small number of uniformed officers deployed to provide reassurance to England fans and liaise between fans and host police. They will not have police powers.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.2/5">In addition, uniformed English police officers with powers will work with the Federal Police in airports, trains and railway stations. This will include British Transport Police officers experienced in policing travelling English football fans. Large numbers of England fans will travel to Germany via transit countries. To ensure continuity of police information and support, English police liaison teams will be based in a number of transit countries, including the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Belgium, France, Poland, Denmark, Austria and Switzerland.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.2/6">No detailed costings are available at present. Much will depend on the length of time the England team is in the tournament.</p>
