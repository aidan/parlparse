In short, expenditure on official entertainment must be modest. Due consideration must be given, at all times, to whether that official entertainment is necessary, appropriate, cost-effective and an admissible charge against the defence budget.

The annual cost of running the vessel is about &#163;1.7 million (including fuel costs). This is at present offset by a fishing licence income varying between &#163;700,000 and &#163;1 million per year.

	<p pid="a.309.3/1">The UK Renewable Energy Strategy document set out scenarios for deployment of renewable electricity needed to meet the UK's share of the EU renewable energy target. The central scenario presented in the strategy suggested that the UK might need around 29 per cent electricity demand to be produced from large-scale renewable sources by 2020. The strategy and accompanying analysis is published at <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/res/res.aspx">http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/res/res.aspx</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.3/2">The analysis of the impact of increased renewables on the electricity generating market was undertaken by Redpoint/Trilemma (2009). The modelling does not estimate the number of additional plant, but estimates that total generating capacity will increase from 81 GW in 2008 to 100GW in 2020 (GB figures), with fossil fuel capacity estimated at around 58 GW in both 2008 and 2020. This reflects around 15GW fossil fuel new build over that period, offset by a similar level of plant retirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.5/15">Current evidence suggests wind generation in the UK generally faces lower capital costs and higher operating costs than solar photovoltaic generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.5/16">Projections of future electricity generation costs are subject to considerable uncertainty. They require underlying assumptions to be made regarding technological learning rates, deployment trajectories, available resource types, supply chain capacity and so on. Technological learning and economies of scale tend to exert downward pressure on costs through time, while supply chain constraints and declining availability of the best resource may tend to exert upward pressure on costs.</p>

The delegations discussed the latest legal and policy developments relating to the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Both delegations set out their respective positions on sovereignty and the UK also set out how the UK needed to bear in mind its treaty obligations with the US and our ongoing need of BIOT for defence purposes. There was mutual discussion of fishing rights, the environment, continental shelf and future visits to the territory by Chagossians.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.2/2">We welcome the prospect of further bilateral discussions with the Mauritians on BIOT. However, Government policy remains that they have no doubt about the UK's sovereignty over BIOT but that they will cede the territory to Mauritius when it is no longer needed for defence purposes. And, following the judgment in the House of Lords in October 2008 in the Judicial Review of the 2004 BIOT Orders in Council which upheld the validity of the BIOT (Constitution) Order, the Government's policy remains that no one has a right of abode in BIOT and permission is needed for anyone visiting the territory. The Government are not, therefore, seeking to facilitate the resettlement of the Chagossians on BIOT.</p>

	<p pid="a.319.5/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has overall responsibility for the security arrangements for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, in accordance with the guarantees given by the then Home Secretary to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2004. I am the Minister with direct responsibility for Olympic security.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.5/2">This work is being carried forward by the Olympic and Paralympic Security Directorate (OSD), part of the Office for Security and Counterterrorism (OSCT) within the Home Office. The Olympic Security Directorate is accountable to the senior responsible owner (SRO) for the Olympic security programme, who is also based within OSCT. Other bodies such as the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) all have major roles and responsibilities in planning and delivering security for the Games.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.2/1">The Olympic Village has been designed from the outset to provide both accommodation for the athletes during Games time and, after the Games, homes for a new sustainable community, which will be at the heart of a vibrant economic and social hub in east London. Following the Games the Olympic Village will be transformed into 2,818 new homes, 1,379 of which have already been sold to Triathlon to provide affordable housing. The new community will benefit from 10 hectares of parks and open spaces, a new polyclinic and a 1,800-place academy for three to 19 year-olds.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.8/1">The UK is grateful to Kenya and now also the Seychelles for their action in the prosecution and detention of pirate suspects. The UK shares the view of international partners that a regional solution, including eventually within Somalia, is most appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.8/2">The UK, together with the European Commission and others, is supporting work by the UN Office for Drugs and Crime and the International Maritime Organisation to develop judicial and penal systems within the region to enhance their capacity to combat piracy, in line with their commitments under the Djibouti code of conduct.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.8/3">In addition to this preferred regional solution, prosecution within the UK for piracy is possible. Decisions on prosecution in the UK would be for the relevant prosecuting authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.321.2/1">In his first quarterly statement published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-21">21 November 2009</phrase> (turksandcaicosislands.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/nov-statement) the governor outlined a number of actions that the interim Government have taken to stabilise the economy of the Turks and Caicos Islands. This includes completing a review of Turks and Caicos Islands' Government financial management practices; steps to implement a wide-ranging stabilisation plan; completing the 2009-10 budget; robust measures to significantly reduce expenditure and bring it closer into line with revenue; and placing high priority on monitoring and strict enforcement of the payment of dues and taxes. Since the statement, a consultation and review of the existing revenue system has been completed, and negotiations with banks near conclusion to refinance liabilities inherited from the previous Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/2">The revised budget figures for 2009-10 are US$142 million for revenues and US$163 million for expenditure. The 2010-11 budget is still in preparation, however, and this deficit is likely to increase during the next fiscal year due to the ongoing impact of the global credit crunch. This means that the Turks and Caicos Islands' economy still faces significant challenges. Work is in hand to explore solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/3">The latest trade figures are from 2008 and these show imports at US$591 million and exports at US$24.8 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.2/1">Salt Cay has a population of 100, and employment opportunities on the island are limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.2/2">US$150,000 of funds provided by the UK Government for disaster assistance following Hurricane Ike in 2008 have been allocated by the Turks and Caicos Islands Disaster Recovery Board to two projects on the island. A further US$500,000 has been earmarked for another project. Together, these may provide some general, manual employment opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.5/1">Aid provided by the Department for International Development (DfID) to Uganda is conditional on progress in reducing poverty, strengthening financial management and respecting human rights and international obligations. Recent assessments of human rights in Uganda indicate mixed progress. The UK Government, alongside the EU, US, French, Canadian and Swedish Governments, have lobbied intensely against the introduction of new anti-homosexual legislation in Uganda. We are monitoring this situation closely. DfID will continue to take the human rights situation into account when making decisions on funding to Uganda.</p>
