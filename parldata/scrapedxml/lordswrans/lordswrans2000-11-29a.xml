	<p pid="a.133.2/1">Unlimited liability for duty is essential to operational effectiveness of the armed forces and, given their unique status, the Services are exempt from the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. However, the Government's view is that Service personnel should not be disadvantaged by being exempt. Levels of Service pay are based on the recommendations of the independent Armed Forces' Pay Review Body, which works on the principle of broad comparability with the pay of civilians in jobs of similar weight and responsibility (derived by job evaluation) against a number of factors. An additional element called the &quot;X-factor&quot; (currently 13 per cent of basic pay) is then added to reflect the overall balance of advantages and disadvantages experienced by members of the armed forces which cannot be taken into account when assessing pay comparability. Soldiers receive the X-factor throughout their careers, wherever they are serving, and it is pensionable. Therefore, they do not receive an increase in basic pay when deployed on operations. The Government believe that the Review Body arrangements are flexible and robust enough to provide a fair level of remuneration for armed forces personnel, especially once all allowances and welfare benefits are taken into account. Over a career, individuals should not be placed at a disadvantage in relation to groups covered by this legislation.</p>

The UK has recently submitted 46 additional candidate SACs to the Commission, and intends to submit further sites shortly. The UK has classified 223 Special Protection Areas under the Birds Directive. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is currently reviewing this list, in consultation with the RSPB, and it is anticipated that further sites will be classified with the aim of completing the UK SPA network in 2000-2001.</p>

But the market alone will not deliver affordable high-speed connections to all rural areas. We will therefore work through the development agencies in the regions, and with the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, to develop effective strategies for the rollout of higher bandwidth services in rural areas, taking full advantage of public sector investment and the opportunities, in some regions, to obtain EU funding. Other stakeholders will also be involved, to ensure that access to broadband services reaches as widely as practicable. We will ask the Countryside Agency to monitor the rollout of broadband in rural areas and we will take this into account in developing policy.</p>

We are currently consulting industry on the award procedure for 3.4 GHz and 10 GHz radio spectrum licences and the indications are that businesses are keen for the licences to become available as soon as possible. We will be consulting industry, early in 2001, on a range of options for awarding licences at 40 GHz.</p>

We offered three licences in each region to encourage new entrants who would provide competition in existing broadband operators. Ten companies qualified to take part in the auction and although not all of them obtained licences it was a major achievement to attact six new entrants to the market.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.2/1">28 GHz broadband fixed wireless access is only one way of delivering broadband services such as high-speed Internet access. There are comparable services available via ADSL, cable, fibre and satellite. The licences awarded through the auction will provide a competitive stimulus to existing operators which will help bring better and cheaper services to users. The auction has provided new information on industry's valuation of the spectrum. This will form a good basis for future decisions on making spectrum available for broadband access. The Government will be considering when to re-offer licences in regions where no licences were sold. This will provide a further opportunity for operators to obtain licences and to enhance existing services and coverage.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.5/1">According to the information supplied by the company to the Medicines Control Agency, the foetal calf serum used in the manufacture of this stock was collected before 1984 and used in the manufacture of a component batch of polio vaccine in 1985. In 1985 there were no BSE-related controls in place. Medeva has no records of the herd from which the material came, and it is therefore not possible to examine whether there were any subsequent BSE-related issues associated with the source of this material. However, Medeva has confirmed that the serum was obtained from herds that would have been under veterinary supervision and compliant with requirements for human food consumption.</p>

The ICRC, UNHCR and other humanitarian organisations continue to assist the return of displaced persons from both countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.3/1">The Government believe that incorporation of the charter in the EU treaties is neither necessary nor desirable. It is not necessary because most of the substantive charter articles are based on existing law in the EU treaties or the European Convention on Human Rights. It is not desirable because a text incorporated into the treaties requires legal precision. The charter uses a breadth of language well suited for a political declaration enhancing the visibility of rights, freedoms and principles recognised within the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/2">The differences between a declaratory charter and one incorporated in the treaties would depend on the terms of the incorporation; at present the European Court of Justice is not obliged to have regard to the charter.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.2/1">The Stability Pact agreed at its Regional Table meeting in June to focus on business and investment, the fight against corruption and organised crime, the elimination of ethnic discrimination, security sector reform and support for independent media. Her Majesty's Government support this approach. Next year, we expect the pact to evaluate the progress of the 2.4 billion euro quick start package of measures, announced last March, and produce a strategy for future assistance to the region, for a further regional funding conference as agreed recently by the High Level Steering Group. At the Zagreb Summit in November, countries of the region agreed to submit economic recovery and reform programmes as the basis for such a conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/2">A number of departments co-operate closely over UK support for the pact's aims, notably the FCO, DfID, the Cabinet Office, DTI, MoD, the Home Office and HM Treasury. These departments are in regular contact. This arrangement is found to be fully effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.2/3">DfID delivers the major part of the UK's non-military assistance to South East Europe. The department has earmarked &pound;100 million for bilateral technical assistance to the region from 2000-2003. In addition, DfID provides some 18 per cent of European Community aid. At the Zagreb Summit, Community aid worth 4.65 billion euro was announced for Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia over the period 2000-2006 under the Community's new CARDS programme (Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Democratisation and Stabilisation).</p>

	<p pid="a.151.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-02">2 March</phrase> this year, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office announced that the Government had decided to bring to an end the statutory betting levy system, to abolish the Horserace Betting Levy Board and, in principle, to sell the Horserace Totalisator Board (the Tote) to racing.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.8/2">Following that announcement, my honourable friend invited the British Horseracing Board (BHB), as the sport's governing authority, to prepare a realistic plan for the future funding of racing without a statutory levy. The BHB's plan was submitted to Government on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-13">13 October</phrase>. The Government have also been considering, in discussion with the levy board, the BHB and other stakeholder interests, a range of practical issues arising from the abolition decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.8/3">So far as the sale of the Tote is concerned, racing, with the support of the Tote's own management team, are continuing to develop their detailed proposals for the acquisition of the business. The Government, meanwhile, have been considering what might be the detailed terms of the Tote's exclusive licence following the sale and developing proposals for the future regulation of horserace pool betting. We have also formally notified the European Commission of our proposals in order to obtain state aid clearance, and expect to receive its views shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.8/4">The Government are also publishing today A consultation paper on the proposed abolition of the Horserace Betting Levy Board and the licensing of racecourse betting and pool betting on horseracing.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.8/5">This consultation paper takes account of the BHB's plan and sets out government's detailed proposals for the abolition of the levy board. Specific areas covered include the BHB's proposal that it should replace the levy board as racing's central funding body and take control of related levy board assets; the board's responsibilities for advancing veterinary science and education and the improvement of breeds of horses; and the future of the National Stud. It also contains interim proposals, ahead of the outcome of the independent review of gambling, for the licensing and regulation of racecourse betting, including the Tote's pool betting operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.8/6">Publication of this paper represents the next important step towards ending the Government's direct involvement in the administration and financing of racing. The Government wish to see both racing and bookmaking flourish and we remain committed to working closely with both industries as we implement these reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.8/7">Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Library. The closing date for responses is <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-28">28 February 2001</phrase>. Thereafter, the Government intend to bring forward legislation, when parliamentary time allows, that will provide for both the abolition of the Levy Board and the sale of the Tote.</p>

He is very pleased that we have found someone of Sir Edmund Burton's calibre to take over from him, and to lead the organisation at a time when we are investing unprecedented amounts of money in new IT and communications projects to improve the efficiency and operational effectiveness of the police.</p>
