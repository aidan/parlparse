	<p pid="a.45.5/1">Such measures are already in place. All police officers, regardless of rank, are subject to a code of conduct (set out in the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999) that outlines the principles that should guide their behaviour. The code makes it clear that officers should behave with honesty and integrity as well as being fair and impartial in their conduct. Officers must avoid all forms of harassment, abusive behaviour, victimisation or unreasonable discrimination. Whether on or off duty, police officers should not behave in a way that is likely to bring discredit upon the police service. Any breach of the principles in the code of conduct may result in an officer facing misconduct proceedings under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 or the Police (Conduct) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1999, which, in the most serious cases, could involve dismissal.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/2">These regulations are subject to constant and ongoing review.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.2/1">The Government believe that chief officers do have the necessary powers to eliminate racist behaviour among police officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/2">There are procedures under the Police Act 1996 and the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 to deal with conduct that falls below the required standard. These procedures can be invoked by way of a complaint from a member of the public or a report or allegation from any other person. This includes any complaint or allegation of racial discrimination or attitudes. Additionally, the Police Reform Act 2002 introduces a new complaints system to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, under which serious racial discrimination is a category of a complaint that must be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will decide how such a complaint will be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/3">A new recruitment process has also been introduced. These processes are already in place in 13 forces and are being phased in across the remainder of the service. Candidates' attitudes towards race and diversity are tested at least seven times across all exercises in the new assessment centre, including at interview. Those who do not meet the standard are not recruited, regardless of performance elsewhere in the assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/4">The Government are committed to increasing trust and confidence in policing among all sections of the community. This involves community relations training across the police service, continuing work on implementing recommendations of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry&mdash;a key area of which is stop and search, and the handling of racist incidents all aimed to increase trust and confidence among minority ethnic communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/5">The Government are not complacent, however, and will consider any further measures that might be needed to eliminate incidents of racist behaviour among police officers.</p>

The fee covers the cost of registration, handling and disputes or technical problems, correspondence during or after registration, helping and advising attorneys or their legal representatives, and investigating allegations of financial abuse against the donor and cancelling registration on the death of the donor.

The HPC's standards for chiropodists and podiatrists include the requirement for knowledge and skill in treating patients with diabetes mellitus. Subject to transitional arrangements, employment of staff by an NHS trust or a primary care trust in the capacity of chiropodist (podiatrist) is limited to those who are registered in the register maintained by the HPC.

	<p pid="a.49.6/1">The price of &pound;2,500 for a digital hearing aid was the price charged by private sector dispensers, and includes service costs for assessment, fitting and follow up appointments, general business overheads, marketing and profit margin.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.6/2">The factors that influenced the reduction in cost of digital hearing aids to the National Health Service were: the development of a single procurement system that takes advantage of economies of scale of purchasing; the ability to give commitment for specific volumes of product to suppliers; the ability to forecast demand to suppliers; and the shifting of demand for high volume products to fewer suppliers. This was made possible through the partnership between the Department of Health and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, who worked with the private sector as part of the Modernising Hearing Aid Services programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">The price of cochlear implants may reduce when implant activity is sufficiently co-ordinated to allow increased purchasing leverage with suppliers. The configuration of cochlear implant centres is decided by National Health Service commissioners together with their providers; however such decisions will not be solely based on questions of cost but will take into account other matters such as patient access.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.5/1">The creation of gametes is not, in itself, an activity that requires a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). However, the use of these gametes to create an embryo would require a licence from the authority. Prior to issuing any licence for the creation of an embryo for use in treatment or research, the HFEA would have to be satisfied that the techniques used were safe. The HFEA would also have to examine carefully the ethical issues surrounding the use of artificially created gametes in in vitro fertilisation (IVF). No embryos that are used in research or created in the course of research may subsequently be used in treatment and must be allowed to perish before 14 days post fertilisation.</p>
