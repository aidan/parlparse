	<p pid="a.134.5/1">The Government continue to monitor the incidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in France, as well as in other European Union member states and in third countries. Legislation has been in place for some years to protect British consumers from the risks of BSE infected material from any source.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/2">All beef produced within the EU must be produced in accordance with the relevant European Directive, 64/433/EEC. The European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office carries out regular inspection visits to all member states to ensure compliance. Furthermore, United Kingdom authorities are entitled to carry out random spot checks on consignments of beef from other member states, at their destinations, to confirm compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/3">In addition, since <phrase class="date" code="1998-01-01">1 January 1998</phrase> the UK has had national legislation which prohibits the import of specified risk materials (SRM) (except for technical uses such as bone china) from all countries, including the rest of the EU. This legislation requires imports of certain animal products to be accompanied by official veterinary certification that the products do not contain, and were not derived from, SRM. These controls are enforced each week by inspections of randomly selected consignments of imported meat from other member states. The results of these checks are published monthly in the Government's BSE Enforcement Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/4">Since 1996, British law has provided a further measure of protection against the risks of BSE infection through the prohibition on the sale of beef from cattle aged over 30 months at slaughter. This prohibition applies to both home produced and imported supplies of beef. The only exceptions to this ban are for specialist grass reared herds in Britain (which can be slaughtered for human consumption at up to 42 months of age), and for meat from 14 non-EU countries which have traditionally supplied the UK, and which have no history of BSE. This legislation is enforced by the Meat Hygiene Service in licensed meat premises, and by local authorities at other points in the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.5/5">From <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-01">1 October 2000</phrase>, EU-wide requirements for the removal of SRM will apply in all member states, following adoption by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-29">29 June 2000</phrase> of a Decision on SRM controls.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.2/1">The Utilities Bill currently before Parliament will result in substantial benefits to consumers. In order to provide a sound basis for the implementation of those aspects of the new legislation for which it will have responsibility, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets plans to undertake preparatory work right away. The Department of Trade and Industry also needs to undertake some preparatory work on appointments to the new Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and Gas and Electricity Consumer Council, which will be established once the Utilities Bill gets Royal Assent. However, whilst candidates designate will be identified by the recruitment process, no appointments will be made until the Utilities Bill has received Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.2/2">Parliamentary approval to these activities will be sought in Estimates for the OFGEM Vote (Class IX, Vote 10) and DTI Vote (Class IX, Vote 1). Pending that approval, urgent preparatory expenditure estimated at &pound;1 million for OFGEM and &pound;0.3 million for DTI will be met by repayable advances from the Contingencies Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.5/1">In order to reduce the regulatory burden on generators which are not subject to central despatch at present, the Government are proposing to make changes to the de minimis level above which a generation licence is required. Subject to final comments, it is proposed to lay an order to exempt for a period of one year all generators which are not capable of exporting more than 100 MW to the total system and which have energised connections on the date of the order coming into force. Additionally a small number of stations which exceed this limit but are not presently subject to central despatch will be included within this exempt class.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/2">The change will allow generators which are currently connected to public network and do not presently have to submit to central despatch the freedom to aggregate their output with suppliers when the New Electricity Trading Arrangements come into effect. This will be of particular help to those plants which do not have predictable or flexible output including renewables and CHP operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/3">The Government propose to lay the order in August. It will come into force before the commencement of NETA trading in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/4">This order will be an interim arrangement pending the coming into force of new legislation and will apply in England and Wales. During this interim period, generators who wish to connect new plant capable of exporting between 50-100 MW or who plan to increase the size of their plant so that it comes within this category may apply to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for an individual exemption. In deciding whether or not to grant and in determining the date of the granting of such exemptions, the department will take into account the views of interested parties, including those of OFGEM and the relevant transmission and distribution network operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/5">It is the Government's intention within the coming year to lay a further, final order replacing this interim order. Further orders will cover the de minimis rules to govern exemptions from the need for licences to generate, supply and distribute electricity.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/6">The generation exemptions covering plant of this size will be subject to periodic review. It is the Government's present intention that they will be reviewed approximately every three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/7">The Government intend to consult further on possible changes to the rules governing supply exemptions. These changes, which I would propose to bring into effect within the coming year, would help small and industrial on-site generators, including renewable and CHP operators to serve their customers more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/8">The Government are therefore seeking views on a proposal to allow suppliers who generate electricity themselves to supply an aggregate of up to 5MW of power, of which 2.5MW may be supplied to domestic customers. The class would be required to supply at prices not exceeding those set out in the order, and would be required to alert customers being recruited as to their status as exempt suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.5/9">The Government also wishes to hear views on a proposal to allow generators which supply a qualifying group of customers on the same site as the generator to supply the same group of customers at remote sites. This latter class would be required to demonstrate that at least one-third of the electricity supplied to the qualifying group went to on-site premises.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-07-05a.138.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100681" speakername="Lord Whitty" colon=":" colnum="138"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000705/text/00705w02.htm#00705w02_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.138.2/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for the Environment represented the UK at the Environment Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-22">22 June 2000</phrase>, accompanied by Sarah Boyack, Scottish Executive Minister for Environment and Transport. Political agreement was reached on two proposals, along with one set of Council Conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/2">Agreement was reached on two important air quality measures which will deliver significant reductions in transboundary pollutants, contributing to problems of acidification and ground level ozone (summer-time smog) throughout the European Union. The first, the National Emissions Ceilings Directive, sets national emission ceilings for 2010 on four air pollutants (sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and ammonia). We agreed to ceilings of 585, 1167, 1200 and 297 thousand tonnes respectively for each of the pollutants. A second common position, on an amendment of the 1988 Large Combustion Plants Directive, sets stricter limit values for emissions of oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide and dust from new plant. For existing (pre-1988) plant, limit values will need to be applied from 2008, or equivalent overall reductions achieved through a National Emissions Plan. However, plant with less than 20,000 hours operating life remaining on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> may be exempted. This agreement will see a reduction in acidifying emissions, whilst flexibility for industry, particularly the power sector, is safeguarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/3">In advance of the Sixth Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, due to take place at The Hague in November, Council Conclusions were agreed setting out the EU position on some of the key issues. Ministers agreed that eligibility for the Clean Development Mechanism should be on the basis of a positive list of safe environmentally sound projects, which excluded nuclear, and that the use of carbon sinks such as forests should not be extended, unless concerns about their scale, scientific and other uncertainties were addressed. The Conclusions also welcomed a Commission communication on a proposed European Climate Change Programme, and its Green Paper on Emissions Trading.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/4">The Presidency gave brief progress reports on proposals to promote sustainable urban development and to establish a priority list of dangerous substances of European significance whose release to the aquatic environment should be controlled. The Presidency also summarised the environmental legislation adopted under the co-decision procedure during the last six months, and highlighted the increasing importance of this procedure in the Presidency's work. Final outcomes were agreed on six dossiers: a Decision to monitor the CO2 emissions from new passenger cars; a regulation controlling substances that deplete the ozone layer; a directive amending Directive 74/150/EEC limiting gaseous and particulate pollutants by agricultural tractors; a Directive limiting noise emission by equipment used outdoors; a directive on end of life vehicles; and the third EU LIFE Regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/5">The Commission reported on the progress of a new Community strategy for chemicals, expected by the end of 2000, and a draft new framework for environmental state aids on which there was a brief exchange of views between member states. The Commission also gave a report on the progress towards completing risk assessments for brominated flame retardants, based on work carried out by the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/6">The Commission presented two recently published proposals; one for a directive on renewable energy, the other for a directive ensuring proper treatment and disposal of waste from electrical and electronic equipment. Presentations were also given to Council on forthcoming proposals to integrate environmental consideration into public procurement rules and to update the 1991 directive on batteries and accumulators containing dangerous substances.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.2/7">On a Danish point under Any Other Business, the Commission noted that it would be meeting an umbrella grouping of NGOs on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-12">12 July</phrase> to discuss their participation in the EU standardisation process. The Council also noted an Austrian intervention calling for a ban of tributyltin (TBT) in products with which human beings come into contact, following traces of TBT and other organotin compounds being found in nappies in Germany.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.2/1">The Greater London Authority Elections (No 2) Rules 2000 required returning officers to classify ballot papers which must be rejected under one of the following heads:</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/2" class="indent">(a) voter identifiable,</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/3" class="indent">(b) more than one vote cast, and</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/4" class="indent">(c) vote unmarked or void for uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/5">Amongst the rejected ballot papers in the three elections, the following percentages were categorised as voter identity identifiable, voting for more than one candidate and void for uncertainty or blank:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.139.2/8"> <td></td> <td>(a) voter identifiable</td> <td>(b) multi-vote</td> <td>(c) Uncertain or unmarked</td> </tr>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.139.2/15">Ballot papers which were unmarked or &quot;not fully completed&quot; would be included in those under head (c) as 'uncertain or unmarked'. Ballot papers with a mark on them, but where the voters' intentions were uncertain, were adjudicated by returning officers and also categorised as 'uncertain or unmarked'. Whilst under the Election Rules, both types of ballot paper are aggregated together as one category, it is clear from the returning officers' observations that a high proportion of the papers categorised as &quot;uncertain or unmarked&quot; were in fact blank.</p>

A mobile crane based on four-axle chassis with a maximum operating weight of 32 tonnes would pay &pound;165 in VED. As a result of the Appeal Court ruling, a concrete pumping machine based on a similar chassis would pay an annual rate of &pound;4,400.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.0/1">Jubilee Line operational matters are the responsibility of London Underground Limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/2">Opening the Jubilee Line extension in 1999 (integrating existing and new infrastructure) naturally posed a number of challenges, and service on the line suffered considerable teething troubles. However it has since then been improving consistently and I understand from LUL that the extended Jubilee Line is now amongst the best-performing of Underground lines. There are over 120 escalators on the line. One has been out of service at St John's Wood and one at London Bridge. The former is now back in service and the latter is being dealt with by the manufacturer. There have also been one or two minor escalator stoppages elsewhere, quickly resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/3">LUL management has addressed the extended line's problems, and has instituted a programme of further work to continue improving its performance, in particular to increase reliability and reduce delays.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.0/1">The Transport Council met in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-26">26 June</phrase>. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Mr Hill) represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/2">At the opening of the Council, the Netherlands made a statement expressing regret at the recent incident at Dover and stressed the need for EU action on traffic in human beings. The UK welcomed and endorsed the Dutch statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/3">The Council debated a draft directive on interoperability of the conventional rail network. The only outstanding issue was the UK and Spain's request that derogations to allow the retention of existing track or loading gauges would be automatic rather than requiring Commission approval. We are pleased to say that, following the debate, a revised text was agreed which allows the automatic derogation we had been seeking and enabled the Council to agree a Common Position.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/4">The Council debated proposals arising from the loss of the oil tanker &quot;Erika&quot; (the &quot;Erika 1&quot; package). These are revised directives on ship inspection organisations and on port state control of shipping; and a new regulation on accelerating the introduction of double hulls in oil tankers. The Council reached political agreement on the first of these, which would give the Commission responsibility for recognising member states' appointed ship inspection organisations. The Commission gave a progress report on the port state control proposal. There was a debate on double-hulled tankers, during which the UK noted the need for a proper economic and regulatory impact assessment. The UK agreed with the Commission and a number of member states that IMO action at global level would be preferable, but that otherwise EU legislation would be acceptable. These issues will be debated again at the October Council. The Council agreed Conclusions, stating that further progress should be made towards the &quot;Erika 2&quot; package, foreseen at the Feira European Council. France stated that Erika 2 would be a priority of its Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/5">There was a further progress report from the Commission on the Galileo satellite navigation project. The Commission said it would submit a final report on the definition phase and an economic analysis in time for the December Council, at which a final decision would have to be made on whether to go ahead with the project. At the October Council, there would be an orientation debate on structure and funding. The UK joined other member states in stressing the need for full cost benefit analysis and for private sector funding to make the project viable. Conclusions were agreed, urging that the Council be provided with sufficient information early in the autumn to allow it to take a decision on Galileo's future.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/6">The Commission gave a further presentation of its Communication on air passenger rights, underlining the need for progress with legislation or voluntary action in various areas of passenger protection, including the setting of minimum contract requirements for ticket purchase. Further work will be done to prepare for a discussion at the October Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/7">The Commission gave its view of progress on work to create common EU structures for air traffic management (ATM). This might include the establishment of bodies to regulate European ATM. The Commission noted that separation of provision and regulation of ATM services was vital to implement the conclusions of the European Councils at Lisbon and Feira.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/8">The Council agreed that the Commission proposals on cabin crew qualifications in civil aviation should be reexamined in the light of the recent proposal to transpose standards drawn up by the Joint Aviation Authorities into Community law.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/9">The Presidency presented a paper describing recent discussions on the establishment of a European aviation safety authority (EASA). The point at issue is whether the Commission should work up detailed proposals for an EU agency, rather than an international organisation. The Presidency presented a paper which analysed whether an EU agency could effectively promote air safety across Europe. The UK affirmed its openness to the idea of an EU agency, while making it clear that such an Agency would have to have sufficient power to take safety decisions effectively, involve member states and national safety regulators fully in its work, and involve non-EU states as fully as possible. It should not initially cover safety of airports or air traffic management. The Council invited the Commission to make a formal proposal for an EU agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/10">The Council also discussed the Transatlantic Common Aviation Area (TCAA). The Commission is seeking a mandate allowing it to negotiate a TCAA agreement with the US on behalf of the EU. The UK has on previous occasions made clear that it gives priority to its bilateral negotiations with the US, which are continuing. Technical work on the likely shape of a Commission mandate has been taking place, and the UK has been participating in that. The Presidency concluded that the Council was satisfied with the technical work, and asked for further work to be done by COREPER, to allow a decision on the mandate to be taken in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/11">The Commission reported on developments in the area of aviation noise standards. They noted the good progress in defining new standards within the ICAO CAEP process.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/12">The Council agreed a wide-ranging resolution on road safety, following the Commission Communication presented to the March Council. Among areas identified for legislative action are: further development of the European new vehicles crash testing programme (EuroNCAP), use of speed limiters on larger vehicles, higher levels of seatbelt and child restraint usage, safer car fronts, and targeting of accident blackspots. The Resolution also refers to the Commission's intention to bring forward a recommendation for member states to introduce a maximum blood alcohol level of 0.5 milligrams per millilitre.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/13">Two road transport issues were debated: a proposed resolution on transit quotas (&quot;ecopoints&quot;) for lorries passing through Austria; and a proposal on the allocation of Swiss transit permits for heavy lorries. The form concerns a proposal to reduce the ecopoint quotas of five member states, a legal requirement under the terms of Austria's Act of Accession. The member states affected (which do not include the UK) expressed their opposition to this measure and the Presidency instructed COREPER to re-examine the proposal. The Commission noted that, unless an alternative proposal emerges and is agreed upon, the Commission Regulation will automatically come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-20">20 September</phrase>. The Commission also introduced its amended proposal for the distribution of permits for heavy goods vehicles travelling in Switzerland. The permit allocations for individual member states were in the process of being revised in the light of recently completed analyses of trade and traffic statistics in the Alpine region. The Presidency asked for further work to be done by COREPER to prepare for decision at the October Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/14">Under other business the Commission presented its new &quot;Communication on safer and more competitive quality road transport in the Community&quot;, covering such issues as working and driving time for lorry drivers, conditions for employment of non-EU hauliers, and driver training. This will be a priority issue for debate during the French presidency.</p>
