	<p pid="c.197.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Colin Mowl on behalf of the National Statistician, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-22">22 November 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/3">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning how much was spent in net present value terms on alcoholic drinks in the United Kingdom in 1950; 1960; 1970; 1980; 1990; 1995; 2000; and 2003. I am replying in her absence.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/4">Expenditure on alcoholic drinks can be made by both businesses and households. This expenditure can either be for final consumption purposes or as intermediate consumption. An assumption has been made that the interest of this Parliamentary Question is in the final consumption expenditure of households on alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.2/5">The Question asks for net present value data. The closest we have to this are data based on 2002 prices, which removes the effect of price inflation from the data, using the prices prevalent in 2002. The Question also asks for data in a number of years. The earliest year for which data are available is 1956.</p>

Individuals from the overseas territories are treated equitably with others who enjoy British citizenship.

	<p pid="c.200.3/1">The Government do not believe that the EU arms embargo is an entirely effective way to control the EU's strategic exports to China. Member states do not share a common interpretation of the scope of the embargo.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.3/2">In practice, the EU code of conduct, rather than the embargo, is the primary instrument with which the possible export to China of military listed goods and technology is considered. The code has either been integrated directly into member states' national law, or they consider it binding guidance on the implementation of national law. The code effectively controls the EU's exports for countries like North Korea, Iran, Syria and Libya, where no EU or UN embargoes are in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.3/3">In the UK, the code is considered binding guidance under the Export Control Act, and we accordingly treat it as seriously as the rest of the Act. The code is used in more than 80 per cent. of all our decisions to refuse export licences for China.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.2/1">The noble Lord's concerns were raised in correspondence which unfortunately appears not to have been copied to the Home Office. Cycling on the pavement is an offence under Section 72 of the Highways Act 1835. Its enforcement is an operational matter for the police. Individual chief officers of police are best placed to decide on the level of priority given to this offence in the light of its perceived seriousness, other demands on police time and resources, and local circumstances. To help the police with enforcement we introduced the option of a &pound;30 fixed penalty notice for cycling inconsiderately or irresponsibly on the pavement. We have also made it possible for community support officers (CSOs) and persons accredited under the Police Reform Act, a swell as police officers, to issue such notices. Particular local problems can be identified by local crime and disorder reduction partnerships and addressed in their strategies. As with other offending, we would encourage members of the public to inform the police of specific problems and of particularly dangerous behaviour to help them target their responses effectively. The cycling infrastructure and environment are currently under improvement as part of the national cycling strategy. We expect this improvement to reduce the incentive to cycle on the pavement for reasons of safety and convenience. Since the introduction of the fixed penalty notice in 1999, when one person was killed, no other person has been killed in such an accident between 2000 and 2003 and the total number of casualties has declined from 87 in 1999 to 51 in 2003.</p>
