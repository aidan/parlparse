	<p pid="a.111.2/1">The Government have considered the reversal by the House of Lords of the Court of Appeal's 2001 judgment in Wallbank. My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, David Lammy, has made a Statement today in another place that a transitional provisions order relating to the status of chancel repair liability was made under the Land Registration Act 2002 on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-14">14 September 2003</phrase>. The order provides that, for a period of 10 years from the coming into force of the Act on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-13">13 October 2003</phrase>, chancel repair liability will remain an interest that binds successive owners of land even though it is not protected by an entry in a register kept by the Land Registry. As no land registration fee is payable for applications to protect similar ancient property rights, such as payments in lieu of tithe, Crown rents and manorial rights, the Land Registry intends to waive the fee for applications to protect chancel repair liability for the 10-year period.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/3">As Registrar General for England and Wales, I have been asked to reply to your recent question about a citizens information register. (HL4616).</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/4">There is a joint project between HM Treasury and the Office of the Registrar General for England &amp; Wales to examine the feasibility of holding up-to-date contact details (name, address, date of birth and a unique personal number) of everyone in a population register. The intention would be to simplify citizens' life, for example when they move address, and also improve delivery of some public services. This project is called the &quot;citizen information project&quot; (the CIP). An information note about the CIP has been available on the Treasury website and the General Register Office website (<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/registration/cip.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/registration/cip.asp</a>) since February 2003 and was updated in August. The project is also mentioned in the latest ONS Annual Report to Parliament (the Registrar General's activities are reported alongside those of the National Statistician) and in a recent review of population estimates. The Annual Report will be examined by the Treasury Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">15 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/5">The feasibility study was presented to Ministers in June 2003 and I will publish it after Ministers have considered it. The report recommends further investigative work, which it is anticipated will last between 15 and 18 months before any final decision is taken. During this period, there would be full public consultation and the preparation of legislation, which would be necessary to create such a register.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/6">Moreover, any proposals that emerge will be fully consistent with data protection and privacy law. Any personal information collected by me, as Registrar General, is subject to confidentiality obligations defined by law. I will publish a study on whether or not this project can be done once the appropriate further investigations and consultation have been completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/3">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on the recent introduction of a new methodology for assessing economic growth. (HL4638)</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/4">The main change introduced in the data published on <phrase class="date" code="">12 September</phrase> was the use of annual chain-linking for the measurement of the volume of GDP. This method allows changing industrial structures and patterns of expenditure to be reflected more quickly in GDP as the weights used for aggregating components are updated annually rather than 5-yearly as they were under the previous methodology. Because a significant portion of economic activity is measured by statistical surveys or indicators that reflect annual or quarterly change, chain-linking means that the benchmark for each year's measure of GDP is based on the latest available information on the structure of the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/5">The introduction of annual chain-linking follows international guidance published in the United Nations System of National Accounts 1993 and the European System of Accounts 1995. Annual chain-linking has already been implemented in the United States and Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Sweden, Netherlands, Portugal and Finland (using annual weights).</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/6">A number of articles about the move to annual chain-linking are available on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Methodology-by-theme/chainlinking/default.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Methodology&ndash;by&ndash;theme/chainlinking/default.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/7">In addition to the move to annual chain-linking, the price indices used for detailed level deflation of current price estimates of gross fixed capital formation, changes in inventories and trade in goods, and in the compilation of the Index of Production, have been updated so that their internal weights reflect the values of 2000 rather than 1995. The purpose of this rebasing is to use more up to date and therefore more appropriate weights for current industrial structures.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/4">There are no figures for jobs created. However Table 1 attached shows the changes in job levels in the public and private sectors from August 1997 to August 2002 (the latest available data).</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/5">A disaggregation of Table 1 by region is not available, but Table 2 attached shows the total persons in employment by Government Office Region, covering the three month period to July 1997 and the three month period to July 2003, together with the change between those dates. It is a count of employed persons, and not a count of jobs, and thus excludes second and subsequent jobs.</p>
