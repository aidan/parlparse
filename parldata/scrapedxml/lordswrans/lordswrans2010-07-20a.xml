Historic warming of the climate is an important part of this evidence and is provided by three independent assessments of near-surface temperature data, carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and by a collaboration of the Met Office Hadley Centre and University of East Anglia, which show almost identical warming trends over the past century.

That Act also put into law the recommendation that Ofsted must, in particular, report on how mainstream schools meet the needs of disabled children and those with SEN. The Equality Act 2010, following another of the inquiry's recommendations, removed the exemption on schools and local authorities to provide auxiliary aids and services as part of their duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled pupils. The Government are considering when to commence the relevant sections of these Acts.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.5/1">Under the alternative vote, in those systems where voters may mark a preference for as few or as many candidates as they wish, a candidate would require more than 50 per cent of voters' first preferences or more than 50 per cent of votes remaining in the count in order to be elected.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/2">Under the optional preferential form of the alternative vote, if no candidate receives more than 50 per cent of voters' first preferences, then the candidate in last place is eliminated, and each vote originally allocated to the eliminated candidate is reallocated to a remaining candidate according to the next preference expressed on each ballot paper. Where there is no next preference given, the ballot paper is &quot;exhausted&quot; and is set aside from the count. The process of eliminating candidates and reallocating votes will continue until a remaining candidate has more than 50 per cent of the votes left in the count.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/3">It is theoretically possible, if perhaps unlikely, that every elector could decide not to mark any preferences beyond a first preference. In this instance, the order of candidates could not be changed by following the counting process through to the end. However, if the count were to proceed in the same way as any other alternative vote count, with the last placed candidate eliminated and his/her votes either transferred or exhausted, the winning candidate would by definition have won more than 50 per cent of the votes left in the count. However, this may not amount to more than 50 per cent of the total votes cast. The only exception to this would be a case in which the final two candidates had an exactly equal number of votes.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.5/4">As my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase>, a Bill will be introduced before the summer to provide for a referendum on the alternative vote system, and for a review of constituency boundaries in order to create fewer and more equally sized constituencies. The Bill will set out further details about the form of alternative vote system to be put in the referendum.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.2/1">There is no mutual aid deployment protocol between the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) and Cumbria Constabulary. There is, however, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the CNC and Cumbria Constabulary that was agreed in May 2006. This is currently being revised with the expectation that this will be completed by February 2011. This MOU deals with requests by CNC for assistance from Cumbria Constabulary and is not a reciprocal arrangement for mutual aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/2">Any requests from Cumbria Constabulary for assistance by the CNC will fall within the scope of Section 59 of the Energy Act 2004 which provides for CNC officers serving with other police forces, including the Cumbria Constabulary. In these circumstances, CNC officers will be under the direction and control of the chief officer of the relevant force. This was the situation during the shooting incident in West Cumbria on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-02">2 June 2010</phrase> when CNC officers provided assistance under the direction and control of the chief constable of Cumbria Constabulary. Such assistance will though be agreed only if the security arrangements at the Sellafield nuclear site remain robust.</p>
