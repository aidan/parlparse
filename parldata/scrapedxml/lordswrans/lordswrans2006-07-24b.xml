	<p pid="b.219.38/1">The Department of Health monitors all the key research in cannabis misuse and has a range of expert advisers to inform policy. We are currently commissioning an academic &quot;expert topic review&quot; of research on cannabis and mental health, with the aim that its findings will inform mental health promotion regarding cannabis, and will help us to ensure that our advice to mental health patients, their families and professionals continues to be comprehensive and up-to-date.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.38/2">The Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) report on cannabis, <I>Further consideration of the classification of cannabis under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (2005)</I> reviews the evidence on the mental health effects of cannabis. The report states that ACMD remains of the view that cannabis is harmful and its consumption can lead to a wide range of physical and psychological hazards. Nevertheless, it does not recommend that the classification of cannabis products should be changed on the basis of the results of recent research into the effects on the development of mental illness. Although cannabis is unquestionably harmful, its harmfulness does not equate to that of class B substances at the level either of the individual or of society. The department also published independent advice on the health harms, including mental health harms, of a range of substances in its guidance in September 2003, <I>Dangerousness of Drugs&mdash;A Guide to the Risks and Harms associated with Substance Misuse</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.38/3">In 2004 the Government produced guidance to schools on all matters relating to drug education. This has recently been updated to specifically highlight the dangers that cannabis use can lead to a wide range of physical and psychological problems. In addition, the key stage 3 drug education pack, due to be published imminently, also highlights the possible links, both in the pupil and teacher versions.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.38/4">The department has developed three new leaflets for the Government communications campaign FRANK (<a href="http://www.talktofrank.com">www.talktofrank.com</a>) on cannabis: for young people, for heavy users and for parents. All give information on the possible side effects of cannabis use.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.38/5">The department has specifically made information available to primary care trusts about the regular and early use of cannabis possibly causing an increase in an individual's risk of developing &quot;psychotic symptoms&quot; including schizophrenia.</p>

In the cases of Grant and Elahi, the time limit for requesting a referral has not yet expired. In the other cases no request was made by the Government, as it was not felt that they came within the criteria set out in Article 43, and/or it was not expected that the Grand Chamber would come to a different conclusion from the Chamber.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.50/1">For the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June 2006</phrase>, the Defence Vetting Agency (DVA) awarded a total of 34 developed vetting (DV) clearances and 306 security check (SC) clearances for personnel employed and waiting to be employed at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Fort Halstead. These took an average of 74.6 days and an average of 61.7 days from receipt of application to clearance being awarded for DV and SC respectively. These figures apply to personnel at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Fort Halstead in general; it is not possible for the DVA to supply figures for personnel in the forensic explosives laboratory without disproportionate effort. Within the vetting process, any outstanding checks are hastened at regular intervals. There is also the provision for sponsors to flag cases as priority at the outset, which will ensure priority handling throughout.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.143/1">Progress is being made. The Government of National Unity are settling in. On the security side, institutions critical to maintaining the ceasefire are operating effectively. There has also been rapid force redeployment by the Sudanese armed forces from the south and they are ahead of the withdrawal timetable. The Sudanese People's Liberation Army's withdrawal from the east is complete. On the economic side, at least US $700 million to $800 million of oil revenues have been transferred to the south since last year. Rural roads have been upgraded, basic services are being delivered and the Government of Southern Sudan's partners are working hard to build capacity. The first joint National Congress Party and Sudan People's Liberation Movement conference to discuss implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) was held at the end of May.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.143/2">There is still much to do before the many provisions of the CPA are fully implemented. In particular, Abyei continues to be without a civil administration while the parties decide how to proceed with the recommendations of the Abyei Boundaries Commission. The north/south boundary has yet to be set, which is critical to determining the south's oil wealth and the redeployment of the two sides' armed forces. In addition, the National Petroleum Commission is not yet fully operational, making it difficult to verify whether the south is receiving in full the oil revenue it is entitled to. These revenues are essential to funding sustainable development in the south, where tangible change on the ground is occurring only very slowly.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.143/3">Ensuring the implementation of the CPA is a major priority for the UK. We have substantial development and humanitarian programmes. At the 2005 Oslo donor conference, we pledged over &pound;300 million for the following three years for humanitarian and development assistance, and are on track with disbursing our support. Our ambassador in Khartoum is an active member of the Assessment and Evaluation Commission, the body tasked with monitoring the CPA's implementation, and the chairman of its Security Working Group. We are also working hard to ensure that the CPA remains high on the international community's agenda. Its implementation was an important focus of last month's UK-led United Nations Security Council visit to Sudan. They visited Juba on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-08">8 June</phrase> and witnessed at first hand both the progress made and the challenges facing the Government of Southern Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.143/4">There are three British Government staff based in southern Sudan. Another eight Department for International Development-contracted consultants work on CPA issues, one of whom is based in the south. Many other British Government staff divide their time between issues relating to the CPA, Darfur and other issues, but give a considerable proportion of their time to the first. These include our ambassador in Khartoum and his deputy, the rest of the political and defence sections in our embassy in Khartoum (10 UK-based and one locally engaged staff), the whole of DfID Khartoum (12 UK-based and nine locally engaged staff), and all the members of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)/DfID Sudan Unit (nine staff). A further eight advisory staff in DfID and the FCO work part time on CPA issues. There are many UK nationals who are employed by the UN and non-governmental organisations working on such matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.146/1">There are no plans to reform the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. However, the review of public administration will result in some local tourism product development functions being transferred from NITB to the new councils. In addition the Northern Ireland Events Company will merge with NITB. Overall these changes will strengthen the Northern Ireland Tourist Board's role as the strategic leader in tourism; it will allow for the better co-ordination of promotional activities around major events; and it will provide councils with a key role in improving the visitor experience at a local level.</p>
