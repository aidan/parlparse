Most of these deaths occurred in the period between March and June 1999. Up to the start of the NATO campaign, according to the UNHCR, 200,000 Kosovo Albanians were displaced internally, with around 70,000 refugees outside Kosovo. As a result of Serb repression around 850,000 Kosovo Albanians were forced to leave Kosovo between March and June 1999; up to half a million more were made homeless within Kosovo. NATO's intervention made possible the return within weeks of over 90 per cent of the refugees.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.0/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will publish the first annual report tomorrow. It will set out details of progress made on each of the areas covered by the recommendations of the inquiry and will identify action still to be taken. It will show that there has been substantial progress across the criminal justice and education systems. But there is much more to be done and it is vital that all the public services covered by the inquiry's report maintain their determination to deliver the highest standards of service to all members of society regardless of their race.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.6/1">The systematic literature review is being carried out over a period of three years by a team led by Professor Glyn Lewis at the University of Wales and funded by the Ministry of Defence through the Medical Research Council (MRC). Professor Lewis has provided two progress reports to the MRC. The MRC has explored whether those reports can be made public, but it is Professor Lewis's view that this would prejudice the publication of the full study in a peer reviewed journal. The &quot;gold standard&quot; for dissemination of MoD funded Gulf health research is publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. It does not therefore appear at this stage that it will be possible for the MRC to make the progress reports public as the MoD had originally expected when the work was announced. The MRC will encourage Professor Lewis to publish once a reasonable body of work has accumulated on each of the issues. In addition, a University of Wales website will be established this summer to list the details of the references that have been identified in the literature search.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.5/1">My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister launched a &quot;Movement for Innovation&quot; to implement Rethinking Construction in November 1998. We established four task forces or boards made up of leading representatives of clients and the supply side: they are the M4I Board, covering non-housing construction; the Housing Forum; the Treasury-led Central Government Task Force covering central government departments and agencies; and the Local Government Task Force. Their role is to promote innovation and the sharing of innovations and best practice and to raise awareness and improve practice among public sector clients with a view to delivering the targets set out in Rethinking Construction. Co-ordination of these four strands is overseen by a steering group chaired by my honourable friend Nick Raynsford MP, which includes my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury; Sir John Egan; the chairs of each of the four strands; and the chairman of the Construction Industry Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/2">The Construction Best Practice Programme, launched in November 1998, promotes dissemination of best practice and provides advice and support. Innovation and sharing of experiences are encouraged through demonstration projects: there are now more than 230 projects worth perhaps around &pound;3.5 billion (figures are still being collected from the latest projects). This compares with the target in Rethinking Construction of &pound;500 million). Projects are assessed and supported by teams of industry and client secondees.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/3">Measurement of performance is being promoted. We published in May 1999 the first industry-wide key performance indicators, each of which relates to one of the targets in Rethinking Construction: these are being trialled by the demonstration projects and will be refined and extended to cover &quot;respect for people&quot; and &quot;sustainability&quot; issues. In time they will be spread through the wider industry through a &quot;clients charter&quot; which is currently being drawn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.5/4">Successful national conferences have been held to help promote Rethinking Construction among clients and the wider industry; and numerous seminars, &quot;cluster group&quot; meetings and other occasions have been organised by the &quot;movement&quot;; presentations have been given by board or task force members at a whole range of occasions organised by client, industry and related bodies. Events organised by the Construction Best Practice Programme have been attended by over 13,000 people. The Construction Industry Board and the industry &quot;umbrella&quot; bodies have also played an important role in promoting change.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.0/1">Licences for the organophosphorus sheep dips were reviewed in 1992-93. Applications supported by data were required for each product. Data considered included those submitted in support of the original licence applications and any new data considered by applicants to be appropriate. Where data were considered by the Veterinary Products Committee to be insufficient, further data were requested. In addition, the then current scientific data on the toxicity of the active ingredients were summarised and presented to the Veterinary Products Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/2">It is not practice to speculate on manufacturers' motivation and the previous Answer made clear that the reason for the withdrawals was a matter for the companies involved. The additional information given was intended to be helpful and as full as possible within the constraints of the confidentiality requirements of the medicines legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.5/1">The Health and Safety Executive holds discussions with the holders of sheep dip marketing authorisations about matters within the remit of the executive's responsibilities. This includes the use of organophosphorus (OP) compounds and the design of containers of concentrated dip. Changes in container design were made following the VPC's recommendations in 1994 and 1995. However, the report of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in July 1999 clearly highlighted inconsistencies in the wearing of protective clothing, recorded instances of careless handling and drew attention to difficulties faced by operators in opening and pouring concentrated dip. The Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) therefore advised Ministers that manufacturers should be required to bring forward proposals for improved container design which conforms to industry best practice. Plans were considered by the VPC in November 1999 and the decision that all OP sheep dips should be withdrawn until improved containers were available, which the Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-20">20 December 1999</phrase>, was made on the basis of the VPC's advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.5/2">Marketing authorisation holders have co-operated with the withdrawal of products from the market. Representations have been made by farming interests and marketing authorisation holders drawing attention to potential sheep welfare problems that might arise due to the unavailability of OP dips and arguing that the current suspension of authorisations should be lifted for a period while work on improved container design is undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.5/1">Publication of individual grant awards would reveal the investment made by beneficiaries, as match-funding is the norm under the Agriculture Development Scheme 1999. SMEs in particular are often concerned that knowledge of the level of their financial commitment would afford competitors an insight into the scale and potential impact of their project, even before it had started. We therefore respect the commercial sensitivity of the size of individual awards, not least to avoid creating a disincentive to apply for support. Beneficiaries are, however, free to publicise their awards if they so wish.</p>
