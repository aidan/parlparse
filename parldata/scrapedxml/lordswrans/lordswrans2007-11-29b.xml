	<p pid="b.129.5/1">The Government have signalled their intention to give greater priority to alcohol prevention and treatment. From April 2008, the National Health Service will have a new indicator, for the rate of alcohol-related hospital admissions, linked to the new Home Office Alcohol and Drugs Public Service Agreement. We believe that this new priority, coupled with work during 2008 to identify the cost of alcohol-related ill health to the NHS, with the opportunities to reduce this, will give a strong incentive for primary care trusts to invest in alcohol prevention as well as treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.5/2">Controls on alcohol advertising are a mix of the statutory and voluntary. The Licensing Act 2003 has given additional powers to licensing authorities to set conditions which ensure that licensees exercise responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.5/3">The renewed national alcohol strategy, Safe, Sensible, Social, has committed the Home Office to commission a full scrutiny of how far the industry's own social responsibility standards are effective in preventing harm. The department will shortly commission an independent review of alcohol pricing, promotion and harm. This will begin in December 2007 and report in July 2008, covering the full range of issues around advertising, price discounting and its promotion, and links between these and harm to young drinkers and other groups. The voluntary agreement we have made with the alcohol industry for inclusion of alcohol unit content and health information on labels will be subject to independent monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.5/4">We have made clear that, in each of these areas, if the evidence justifies it, we will be ready to consult next year on the need for regulatory change, including possible legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.5/5">Decisions on taxation are a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, taking account of health, economic and other issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.131.5/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill contains provision (Schedule 2 paragraph 3) that will allow the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to license embryo testing where the sick sibling could be treated with umbilical cord blood stem cells, bone marrow or other tissue of any resulting child.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.5/2">The Bill introduces a new paragraph 1ZA(1)(d) into Schedule 2 to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, which refers specifically to the tissue types:</p>
	<p pid="b.131.5/3" class="indent">&quot;In a case where a person ('the sibling') who is the child of the persons whose gametes are used to bring about the creation of the embryo (or of either of those persons) suffers from a serious medical condition which could be treated by umbilical cord blood stem cells, bone marrow or other tissue of any resulting child, establishing whether the tissue of any resulting child would be compatible with that of the sibling&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.5/4">The HEFA issues guidance in its code of practice on tissue typing. Following licensing of the creation and transfer of a saviour sibling embryo, this issue falls outside the remit of the HFEA. However, the Human Tissue Act 2004 requires that the Human Tissue Authority must approve any transplants involving organs from living donors. In the case of adults who lack the capacity to consent and children who are not competent to consent, this extends to bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells.</p>

	<p pid="b.136.2/49">For example, our target is to offer everyone who needs it an appointment at a GUM clinic within 48 hours by March 2008. In September 2007, 88 per cent of patients were offered an appointment to be seen and 78 per cent were seen within 48 hours. In May 2005, only 45 per cent were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours. This is helping to speed up detection and reducing onward transmission.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.2/50">We are keen to improve access to a wide range of sexual-health services&mdash;offering people more convenient options for getting screening and testing, including further education colleges and private pharmacies. That is why we are rolling out the national chlamydia screening programme and working with Boots the Chemist to pilot a two-year chlamydia testing service in high street pharmacies across the capital for 16 to 24 year-olds.</p>
