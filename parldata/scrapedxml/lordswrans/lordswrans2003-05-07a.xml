	<p pid="a.143.6/1">A review of continence services was instituted in 1998 by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr Paul Boateng), leading to guidance which recognised that modest changes to continence services would have a significant impact on the quality of life for patients, in particular for children and older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.6/2">The provision of these services in England is a matter for primary care trusts which are responsible for determining the level of services required to meet the needs of their local population.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.6/3">Common childhood conditions, including paediatric continence, will be considered under the forthcoming National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services, which is currently developing national standards. The new standards will help ensure that children and young people are able to access appropriate services at the right time and that they can take an active part in making decisions about their care.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">There is a well-documented association between enuresis and psychiatric disorder in community samples of children. The rate of psychiatric disorder is between two and six times higher in enuretic children than in controls, but over half of enuretic children have no psychiatric disorder. Psychiatric disorder is more common in those children with both daytime and night-time wetting and in children with other developmental problems. Where a child has enuresis associated with developmental or emotional difficulties, their needs should be fully assessed by a multi-professional team.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.5/1">The national report on the 2001 Census for England and Wales is being laid before Parliament today. Copies are available in the Printed Paper Office and the report is also accessible on the national statistics website.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/2">The report provides detailed statistics covering the wide range of topics included in the 2001 Census, and fills out the picture given by the key statistics report released on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-13">13 February 2003</phrase> and the first results published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>. In particular, it shows many relationships between census topics, for example the links between age, social group and health.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/3">The printed report comprises a set of 145 tables presenting statistics at the national level, and an accompanying CD contains the corresponding figures for England and Wales separately, English regions, and local authorities in England and Wales, along with software to view, manipulate and download the data. The CD contains the equivalent to the entire set of 1991 Census county reports, which were published in two printed volumes for each of the 55 counties in England and Wales over a 14-month period. The CD also contains an electronic version of the key statistics report released on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.5/4">A further set of tables covering migration and workplace statistics will be published in a supplementary report later in the summer.</p>
