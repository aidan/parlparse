	<p pid="a.73.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises the multidimensional nature of poverty. These dimensions include income levels and assets, health, educational status and opportunity, political empowerment, and security. The International Development Targets (IDTs) set out in the 1997 White Paper on International Development go some way toward capturing all these aspects, and form the centrepiece of this Government's policy towards poverty elimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/2">While the IDTs provide a useful focus, country level interventions need to be based on a detailed undertstanding of the particular situation facing the poor in each country. For DFID these interventions are outlined in its Country Strategy Papers. However, even with the best analysis and targeting, reaching the poorest in any community is always a major challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/3">DFID is developing and strengthening the existing guidance and training for all their staff--in the UK and overseas--to help ensure that poverty elimination remains at the centre of all the department's activities. In particular the guidance and training will:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/4" class="indent">introduce staff to the dimensions of poverty in developing countries;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/5" class="indent">assist staff to understand and diagnose the key factors influencing poverty;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/6" class="indent">help staff use the diagnosis to develop appropriate targeted country strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.5/7">We are planning to make enhanced guidance and training available to DFID staff this year. This will be updated on an ongoing basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.1/1">asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/2" qnum="HL834">In which developing countries bonded labourers are listed by the Department for International Development among the poorest groups, and to what extent they are being targeted by development assistance such as micro-credit and income generation schemes.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2000-02-08a.74.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="74"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000208/text/00208w01.htm#00208w01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.74.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) does not keep lists of the poorest groups or lists of developing countries in which bonded labourers are amongst the poorest groups. Bonded labour exists, in many guises, in many countries, despite international conventions and national laws which clearly identify bonded labour as a contravention of human rights. Marginalisation and poverty are key factors which help to maintain this practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/2">The elimination of poverty and fulfilment of human rights for all are comprehensively linked. We are supporting many activities which encourage governments actively to uphold human rights and to develop policies for trade and economic investment which encourage wide based growth and reduce social marginalisation and inequality. We are also supporting advocacy and action by civil society organisations and encouraging socially responsible business practices within the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/3">In some instances, the availability of micro-credit and other income generating schemes can offer poor people a viable alternative to bonded labour. DFID supports micro-finance and income-generation projects for poor groups all over the developing world, particularly in East, Central and Southern Africa, and South Asia. Services such as savings and micro-credit for income generation are delivered through some form of private, community-based institution, which is itself typically supported by a larger organisation such as a bank, a credit co-operative or an NGO. For these support institutions to develop and to be effective, a minimum level of social organisation is required amongst the savers and borrowers. However, where bonded labour relations exist, vested interests that control that labour will usually obstruct any form of social organisation, especially by external institutions. This situation can severely inhibit the successful extension of effective micro-credit institutions to bonded labourers.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.2/4">To date, no DFID micro-finance projects have explicitly targeted bonded labourers. However, DFID has delivered credit services to very poor communities that include bonded labourers. For example, in India, the DFID/CARE International Credit and Savings for Household Enterprises (CASHE) project in Andrha Pradesh includes many bonded labourers. In Western and Southern Orissa, where bonded labour is prevalent amongst tribal people, micro-finance is one among several interventions DFID is supporting to increase the security and range of livelihoods available to poor rural people.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.2/1">The Ministry of Defence is well aware of the suggested link between exposure to DU and the illnesses being experienced by some Gulf veterans. However, this is only one of a number of factors which have been suggested as causes of Gulf veterans' illnesses and, pending further medical and scientific evidence, the Ministry of Defence is keeping an open mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.2/2">The Ministry of Defence is aware of DU testing work involving UK Gulf veterans that has been undertaken in Canada which has led to some veterans being told that they are excreting unusually high levels of DU. The Ministry of Defence still has not seen any robust scientific data justifying this claim. Recognising that this has caused veterans some concern, however, the MoD has offered to arrange independent DU testing for those UK veterans who had their urine tested for DU in Canada. A draft protocol under which this would take place is currently being considered by veterans' representatives. I should add that this new initiative must not be taken as an indication that the Ministry of Defence believes veterans do have high levels of DU in their bodies. Rather it is something the Ministry of Defence would like to do so that we can move forward from a firm scientific basis. This initiative is in addition to our policy which has been in place since March 1999 whereby Gulf veterans referred to the Ministry of Defence's Medical Assessment Programme will be tested for uranium where clinically appropriate.</p>

The recommendation of the Royal Commission for a rather different Appointments Commission with significantly more powers in relation to political members of the second Chamber makes no difference to our assessment of the situation in the context of the transitional House. The Government will make clear their views on the proposals of the Royal Commission in due course.</p>

My honourable Friend the Minister of State at the Home Office (Mrs Roche) will be discussing further publicity with relevant interest groups, but as a first step the leaflets are being distributed to local community groups through Citizens Advice Bureaux and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.2/4">The scheme is solely intended to retain a suspensive right of appeal to the Immigration Appellate Authority for those overstayers who make a specific application to us during the period. It is by no means an amnesty: the same considerations apply whether an application under the scheme is made or not. All overstayers should be aware that a decision to remove them from the United Kingdom is, and will remain, the normal response to their unlawful behaviour. Only when the compassionate circumstances outweigh the public interest in maintaining an effective immigration control will we allow them to remain.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.0/1">For implementation of judgments of the European Court, the agent (one of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Legal Advisers) communicates the judgment and explains its requirements to the lead department. It is for that department to pay any sums awarded by the Court and formulate any general measures which may be required, including proposals for legislation, but the agent ensures that the proposals would give proper effect to the judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/2">The Cabinet Office helps to co-ordinate issues which affect more than one department, working through a committee of officials from the key departments, which meets regularly. It is envisaged that consideration and implementation of decisions of domestic courts under the Human Rights Act 1998 will be co-ordinated in this way. The Home Office is also involved in making recommendations about preparations for implementation of the Act and passing on good practice to departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/3">It is, however, the responsibility of each department to ensure that its proposals, legislation, procedures and practices are compatible with the Convention and the Human Rights Act 1998. This involves a continuous review of legislation and procedures for Convention points. Making compatibility a matter for the centre could dilute our efforts to mainstream human rights awareness throughout Whitehall.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">(a) The Government's primary legislation is mainly drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Exceptions are the consolidation and law reform Bills drafted by the Law Commission and the work on rewriting tax legislation being done by the Inland Revenue's Tax Law Rewrite project. In these cases, the drafting is done by Counsel on secondment from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The legislation for Scotland relating to reserved matters (including such elements of consolidation and law reform Bills for the Scottish Law Commission) is drafted by Counsel on secondment from the Office of the Scottish Parliamentary Counsel in Edinburgh. Some Government Bills extending only to Northern Ireland are drafted by the Office of the Legislative Counsel in Belfast by arrangement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">Since May 1997, a total of four private sector lawyers have been employed at various times to assist with the drafting of legislation being prepared by the OPC or by the Inland Revenue Rewrite project. All four had acquired the necessary skills when they were members of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, before moving into private practice. Their remuneration has varied depending on the amount and difficulty of the work they were contracted to do, but generally speaking has been commensurate with the cost to Government of similar work being done by Parliamentary Counsel. Meaningful comparisons between the remuneration of drafting and for civil legal aid work are not possible because of their different natures.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">Some departments employ private sector lawyers from time to time to draft secondary legislation. However, no central records are kept of the volume of work involved, of the number of private sector lawyers who have been employed nor of their remuneration. This information could only be assembled at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">(b) Litigation for the Government is handled, almost entirely, by Treasury Solicitor or, where departments supply their own legal services, by the in-house litigation teams within those departments. For geographical or other reasons, however, private sector lawyers frequently become involved in government litigation (including public inquiries) as agents. Generally speaking, solicitors from the private sector instructed in this way as agents are remunerated in a manner broadly comparable to the manner in which they would be remunerated for private client work. Rates will vary accordingly to the location and type of litigation work involved. No statistics are available as to the number of litigation cases in which private sector lawyers have been instructed or of the fees paid, and it would not be practicable to provide such information without examining many thousands of individual files.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.2/1">Consultation has taken place between the various departments handling government litigation, and it was found, in view of the volume of such litigation, that it was not possible to give any definitive figures of the type requested: this would involve examining many thousands of files. Moreover, the information requested is almost certainly covered by legal professional privilege, and it would be necessary to approach each client for their agreement that the privilege might be waived in each case where legal advice to settle had not been followed. The time and effort that would necessarily be involved in such an exercise is thought to be disproportionate. (Also, it is worth noting that, in the majority of litigation cases, it is not possible to be categorical about e.g. prospect of winning or losing.)</p>
