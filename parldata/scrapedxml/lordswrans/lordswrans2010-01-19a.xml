That section provided for those registered as British citizens under Section 4B to become British citizens &quot;by descent&quot;.

	<p pid="a.232.2/1">An increasing element of the pay awards for the department and its agencies over the past three years has been allocated to non-consolidated performance pay. These payments are used to recognise excellent performance and exemplary behaviours in contributing to the department's objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/2">Non-consolidated variable pay awards are funded from within existing pay bill controls and have to be re-earned each year. They do not add to future pay bill costs. In the case of the senior Civil Service, the percentage of paybill set aside for performance-related awards is based on recommendations from the independent Senior Salaries Review Body. For staff at AO to grade 6, the percentage of paybill set aside was determined by a three-year pay settlement introduced in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/3">The following tables show, for the department and its agencies, how many people were eligible for (estimated at year end) and received a non-consolidated variable pay award and the average and maximum payment for the award, by civil service band, awarded under the department's standard pay and performance management processes for the past three years of published accounts. The tables include in-year and end-year performance payments but not non-consolidated payments made as part of a pay award to those at or near the maxima of their pay scales.</p>

Reducing the varying number of photocopier papers has enabled the ministry to negotiate competitive pricing, giving the tax payer value for money.

	<p pid="a.236.8/3">As Director-General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what proportion of United Kingdom Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was represented by manufacturing in 1990 and 2009. (HL1071)</p>
	<p pid="a.236.8/4">When assessing industry percentages to total production it is more appropriate to assess against total gross value added (GVA) as opposed to GDP. This is because GDP equals GVA plus unallocated taxes and subsidies such as VAT which are not able to be allocated to industry production.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.8/5">In current (nominal) price terms for the calendar year 1990 total manufacturing is estimated to have made up 22.5 per cent of total GVA. For 2008 (the latest complete year currently published), total manufacturing is estimated to have made up 12.3 per cent of total GVA.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.0/1">Information is collected on authorised and unauthorised absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/2">Unauthorised absence is absence without leave from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences, such as lateness, holidays during term time not authorised by the school, absence where reason is not yet established, and truancy. Information collected by my department on absence is a more comprehensive measure of children's missed schooling. Our focus is on reducing all forms of absence, not just a small subset. The issue is not whether the pupil had permission to be absent; it is how much absence the pupil has. Those pupils who miss 64 sessions (typically 20 per cent of sessions) are classed as persistent absentees.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/3">The latest available published information on absence is published as SFR 03/2009 &quot;Pupil Absence in Schools in England, including Pupil Characteristics: 2007-08&quot; at <a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000832/index.shtml">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000832/index.shtml</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/4">Table 4.1 provides the available information on persistent absence (data are not available prior to 2005-06). Table 1.1 shows the percentage of sessions missed due to authorised, unauthorised and overall absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/5">The analysis below, shows that KS4 attainment for persistent absentees is lower than for other pupils. We are focusing our efforts on reducing persistent absence and the latest figures available show that the percentage of pupils who are persistent absentees reduced to 3.6 per cent in 2007-08, from 4.1 per cent in the previous year.</p>
