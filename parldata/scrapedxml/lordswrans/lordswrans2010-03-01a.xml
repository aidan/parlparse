	<p pid="a.317.2/1">UK Armed Forces are operating in a dangerous environment in Afghanistan. It is essential that they have the authority and capability to deal with individuals who pose a serious threat to UK and other International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) troops, the Afghan security forces as well as the local population.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.2/2">ISAF, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation-led security and development mission in Afghanistan, is not responsible for charging or prosecuting detainees. ISAF forces are mandated to either transfer detainees to the Afghan Government for prosecution through their judicial system or release them. As a sovereign nation, responsibility for prosecution lies with the Government of Afghanistan. The question of how many prisoners detained without charge or prospects of trial by the Governments of Afghanistan and the US is a matter for those governments to answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.2/3">The London conference held on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-28">28 January</phrase> welcomed the Government of Afghanistan's determination to take on increasing responsibility for detentions. The UK will continue to work with the Afghan authorities to build capacity within their detention and judicial systems. The Government of Afghanistan will decide what review procedures should be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.317.5/1">USAID, the US Federal Government agency responsible for the US effort in the field of development and reconstruction, is committed to installing a third unit at Kajaki which would increase the generation capacity to 51 megawatts, and to constructing a new transmission line from Kajaki to Kandahar when the security situation becomes permissive. The Ministry of Defence does not calculate the financial cost of individual operations. Four thousand International Security Assistance Force troops were involved in the operation, including troops from the UK, US, Canada, Denmark and Australia. While the dam does not operate to its full capacity, currently it does provide electricity to the population of Helmand. Two generators are in place and being used, along with diesel-powered, local generation to increase supply. While the security situation in the area makes access and delivery to Kajaki challenging, supplies, including oil, are being delivered. USAID is leading the work on the refurbishment of the power station. It continues to plan to make the facility fully operational.</p>

	<p pid="a.325.3/1">The quality of vocational education and training in the further education (FE) sector is improving significantly. For example, colleges achieved a qualification success rate of 81 per cent in 2007-08, against the target of 80 per cent that was set for 2011. Our apprenticeship programme also saw a record successful achievement rate of 71 per cent in 2008-09-up from 37 per cent in 2004-05. The second inspection cycle of 2005-09 by the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) shows that 65 per cent of colleges were judged to be good or better. This is significantly better than the first cycle (2001-05) where less than 50 per cent of colleges were judged to be good or better.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.3/2">We are also seeing increasing professionalism in the FE teaching workforce. Through a series of reforms, including requirements for teachers to hold appropriate qualifications; work towards qualified teacher learning and skills status; and be professionally registered with the Institute for Learning (IfL), we are ensuring that both pedagogical and subject specialist skills are maintained and enhanced. All teaching staff must undertake a minimum of 30 hours continuing professional development (CPD) each year and there is evidence that this minimum is generally being exceeded. The Business Interchange programme is providing opportunities for the workforce to update vocational skills through employer placements. There is early evidence from Ofsted inspections of the benefits of these reforms to teaching practice and learners.</p>

	<p pid="a.332.6/1">Neither Trinity House nor the Commissioners of Irish Lights are designated as public authorities under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, because they are neither listed in Schedule 1 to the Act nor designated under Section 5.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.6/2">The list in Schedule 1 may be added to by order under Section 4(1), but to be added a body or office must satisfy two conditions:</p>
	<p pid="a.332.6/3">that the body or office is established by virtue of Her Majesty's prerogative or by enactment or by subordinate legislation, or by certain Government or Welsh Assembly Government authorities; andin the case of a body, that it is wholly or partly constituted by appointment made by certain Government or Welsh Assembly Government authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.6/4">The Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses were added to the list in Schedule 1 as they met both the criteria above. This amendment was made by the Freedom of Information (Additional Public Authorities) Order 2002 (SI 2002/2623) that came into force on November 2002. Trinity House and the Commissioners of Irish Lights meet the first condition but not the second, as no appointments to their boards are made by any government entity, nor by the Welsh Assembly Government authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.6/5">Under Section 5, any other body that is regarded as performing a public function can be designated a public authority for the purposes of the Act. However, the Commissioners of Irish Lights primarily operate in the territory of a separate sovereign nation (Ireland) and Trinity House has substantial charitable functions beyond its remit as a General Lighthouse Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.6/6">However, the department expects both Trinity House and the Commissioners of Irish Lights to comply with the spirit of the Act in responding to reasonable requests from the public for information relating to their functions as a General Lighthouse Authority under UK law.</p>
