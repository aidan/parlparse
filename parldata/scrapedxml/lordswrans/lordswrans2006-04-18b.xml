	<p pid="b.162.8/1">DfID is contributing $8 million towards a $13 million United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) implemented police reform programme (PRP) which runs from January 2005 to January 2008.

	<p pid="b.162.8/2">The new recruitment practices aim to make the Bangladesh police more fair and representative, and specific outcomes include an increase of women police.

It has been agreed that the police reform programme will incorporate the police element from that programme, including an extension of community policing within the CHT. Recruitment of police to fulfil these duties will be based on the new system, making applications by indigenous people more likely to be successful.</p>

	<p pid="b.168.9/1">Climate scenarios suggest that climate change impacts do not appear to threaten the viability of the UK agricultural industry as a whole. UK agriculture is highly adaptable and most effects of weather-related changes are already within the experience of farmers. There may also be opportunities to grow new crops. But particular regions and individual farmers need to be aware of changes, especially in regard to water supplies, so they are able to deal with the risks and opportunities in good time.</p>
	<p pid="b.168.9/2">The recently published Climate Change Programme and the new UK Adaptation Policy Framework lay out a clear framework for action. The Government will continue to fund research on impacts and adaptation responses for land managers and will be working to transmit clearer advice to farmers through a variety of channels including the Rural Climate Change Forum.</p>

	<p pid="b.175.0/1">No Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed wild-caught fish have been imported into the UK for the pet trade and for aquaria in the last five years. The department does not hold information on EU imports of CITES-listed wild-caught fish, nor on imports of non-CITES species.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/2">To date, Defra has not made any generic assessment of the impact on biodiversity of the trade in wild-caught fish as pets. However, the Darwin Initiative has funded a range of research and capacity building projects on the sustainable management of wild populations. One such project, led by the Zoological Society of London, is working on sustainable management of Ornamental Fish Species in Mamiraua, in the Brazilian Amazon.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/3">For the small number of fish species listed in the CITES appendices, EU regulations mean we must be satisfied that the trade will not be detrimental to the conservation of the species before a permit can be issued to import them. The European Commission can also suspend trade in CITES species where it is considered to be unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="b.175.0/4">Although this mechanism is not available to regulate trade in the many non-CITES fish species, it is open to any party to make a case to list more fish species on CITES.

	<p pid="b.176.2/1">The flag regulations govern the flying of the Union flag from government buildings in Northern Ireland, which are defined as buildings wholly or mainly occupied by members of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. The flag must be flown on designated days at government buildings where it was the practice to fly the flag on designated days in the 12 months ending on <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-30">30 November 1999</phrase>. Other government buildings have discretion to fly the flag on designated days. The flying of flags from other buildings is unregulated, although in practice many public and civic authorities choose to fly the Union flag at their buildings on the same days as government buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.2/2">Of the buildings listed in the question, five are government buildings and five are public buildings. It was the practice for all five government buildings to fly the Union flag on designated days in the 12 months before <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-30">30 November 1999</phrase> and they are therefore obliged to fly the flag on designated days, in accordance with the flags regulations. Unfortunately on this occasion, due to an oversight, the flag was not flown on St Patrick's Day at DVTA, Hamiltonsbawn Road. Of the five public buildings, three choose to fly the flag on the same days as government buildings and two do not. The table below sets out the specific individual responses to the questions raised, as well as specifying whether a building is classed as a government or public building.</p>

If this is not possible in respect of primary legislation, a court may make a declaration of incompatibility under Section 4 of the Act.

Detainees who self-harm may be treated within the centre or externally in hospital as appropriate. Most incidences, fortunately, occur at the lower end of the scale. There may be many reasons for the variation in incidences of self-harm between centres&mdash;length of stay, size and location of centre, fear of imminent removal and frustration of the removal process. All detainee custody officers in removal centres are trained to the standard delivered within the Prison Service to help identify and prevent suicide and self-harm. They are also trained in accordance with their particular centre's own suicide and self-harm prevention strategy and procedures. Additionally, notices in various languages are displayed in all centres setting out that, where a detainee has a concern about a fellow detainee, this should be brought to the attention of a member of staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.184.2/1">The Ministry of Defence takes the medical treatment of its Armed Forces very seriously, and the care we provide is intended to encompass the whole course of their treatment, from the point of injury to eventual discharge from medical care.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.2/2">Mobilised reservists are entitled to receive the same treatment as regular personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.2/3">Appropriate medical support is provided in-theatre when personnel are on deployment, and a range of establishments in the UK are able to offer further specialised treatment as required. As well as the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) within the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust (UHBFT) at Selly Oak, there are a further six Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs) located within NHS hospitals across the country, enabling military patients there to obtain the high standards of treatment available in the NHS hospital, and allowing the Defence Medical Services to take advantage of NHS expertise.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.2/4">We also have 15 Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRUs) in the UK and Germany to provide assessment and treatment of musculo-skeletal disorders. Patients are referred from unit medical facilities where the simpler injuries would be diagnosed and treated. A Multidisciplinary Injury Assessment Clinic (MIAC) team within each RRU is responsible for providing an assessment and diagnostic service. The MIAC has rapid access to MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanning or other imaging if required. It then determines the most appropriate rehabilitation plan for the patient. This includes rapid access to orthopaedic surgery when clinically indicated, with every patient having a post-operative rehabilitation plan before surgery.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.2/5">Where appropriate, personnel may be referred for further treatment to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court, which provides high-quality medical care, rehabilitation, prosthetics and adaptations for service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.2/6">The MoD is also committed to providing appropriate healthcare to those servicemen and women suffering from mental health problems. This is based on a community-based approach so as to ensure that personnel have better, more timely and more convenient access to mental healthcare. To meet this commitment we have 15 defence community mental health teams across the UK, plus other satellite centres overseas. In-patient care, if required, is provided by the Priory Group. In addition to this, while personnel are in theatre, we provide appropriate levels of support from trained mental health staff based either in the UK or in theatre.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.2/7">The MoD is also working on a number of further initiatives, relating for example to the prevention and management of problems arising from operational stress and to the need to address issues of stigma and discrimination. We have work in hand to ensure that those leaving the services can recognise the signs of stress and know where to go for help.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.2/8">The MoD also has the discretion to meet the costs of treatment related to injuries of illnesses for which a war pension is paid, but not where that treatment is provided free under the UK legislation, such as through the NHS. In 2004&ndash;05, the charity Combat Stress received &pound;2.8 million in respect of such treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.2/9">Although I cannot comment on the individual case of Corporal Corrigan for reasons of medical confidentiality, I can confirm that his claims about the circumstances surrounding his treatment have been the subject of full investigations, and the MoD continues to be in regular contact with him, to ensure that he receives the full benefits to which he is entitled.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.2/1">Where it is not shown in this reply, the information requested, including the tables, has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/2">The <i>Valuing People</i> White Paper (2001) says that people with learning disabilities should be supported to live independently, which includes being supported to live in ordinary housing in their local communities. Approximately 2,900 people with learning disabilities live as in-patients in National Health Service residential accommodation. The White Paper <i>Our health, our care</i>, <i>our say </i>says we want to end this type of institutional provision as these settings limit choices and give poorer outcomes whereas community-based settings enable a greater degree of independence and inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/3">The most recent available breakdown of provision of NHS residential accommodation by strategic health authority for 2003&ndash;04 is shown in table 1.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/4">The information requested on the average daily number of available beds is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/5">Information for 2005&ndash;06 on the number of independent sector beds for people with learning disabilities is collected by the Healthcare Commission as part of the national ethnicity census, in conjunction with the Mental Health Act Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection. This is shown in table 2. Further information available from the Healthcare Commission for 2003&ndash;04 is provided in table 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/6">Comparable data for independent hospitals in earlier years do not exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/7">As of January 2006, 239 people are living in long-stay hospitals. There are 10 long-stay hospitals currently open. The 2001 White Paper <i>Valuing People</i> contained a commitment to review the situation of all people with learning disabilities living in NHS &quot;campus-style&quot; facilities. In order to facilitate the performance management of this task, the Institute for Health Research at Lancaster University was commissioned to undertake a survey of the nature of long-stay beds and residential places provided by NHS trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/8">Table 4 shows the number of long-stay hospital beds and NHS residential places from 1997&ndash;2004. Over the eight-year period the following occurred.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/9">Long-stay hospital beds reduced from 7,527 to 2,769; a reduction of 63 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.2/10">Residential places reduced from 3,433 to 2,882; a reduction of 16 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.2/12">The figures provided in tables 1 and 4 are incomplete, as only about a third of private-sector hospitals provided figures in 2003&ndash;04. There is a current undertaking of work to improve the detail of data through local surveys; the first stages of this work will be available in May 2006.

	<p pid="b.196.2/5">Ofsted devised its first race equality scheme (RES), in keeping with its duties under the Act, in May 2002. This contained limited information beyond a review of Ofsted's functions as, at that time, it was assessed that the function of inspection itself did not differentially affect ethnic groups. This position has changed substantially as evidenced in the consultation documents regarding the development of our RES published on our website this year. The consultation document now clearly states that all our education inspection functions have high relevance to our general duty under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.2/6">I am pleased to say that we have been in regular contact with the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) on a range of matters to do with the development of our RES and our duties under the Act and are working with it on a memorandum of understanding. We undertook a review of our race equality functions in spring 2005 and intend to publish our newly revised RES in late summer 2006 following external consultation which ends in May. The draft version for consultation is available on our website. Impact assessments as part of action planning, training for Ofsted staff and inspectors and the intention to publish our findings widely are features of note.</p>

	<p pid="b.198.2/1">All new recruits to the Police Service of Northern Ireland receive specific training on equality and diversity issues delivered both internally and externally.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.2/2">The first three days of induction are spent on a residential training course to explore, in a safe environment, issues around sectarianism, cultural and religious differences, empowerment, social history and reconciliation. This training also takes cognisance of wider cultural diversity issues which are explored more fully in the Police College programme. This specific equality and diversity training focuses on issues around, among other things, prejudices, stereotypes, assumptions based on people's race, religion, community background, political belief, age, disability, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, nationality etc. There is no singularised instruction for Ulster-Scots, Irish or Mandarin culture; rather, all strands of diversity are core-themed throughout the 21-week training programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.2/3">Other external speakers attend the college to deliver specific equality and cultural diversity training. In addition to these initiatives the Police College also hosts a cultural traditions evening where recruits can meet and speak to representatives from various community groups. The cultural awareness evening provides an opportunity for different traditions to give a presentation to police trainees for about 10 minutes each. Current contributors to the awareness evening are the Orange Order, the Royal Black Institution, the GAA and the Irish Language Society.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.2/4">The learning advisory council along with the Northern Ireland ethnic minority council and the association of further education establishments are currently in talks with the police college at providing language and cultural training in Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese and Russian.</p>

Restructuring is not a cost-saving exercise but is about providing a stronger policing service at all levels from the neighbourhood to strategic force level. Restructuring will create efficiency savings which can be used to improve the delivery of policing locally. In Wales we expect savings of around &pound;16 million per annum after five years, which can be reinvested in policing services.</p>

In line with this protocol those individuals who pose a risk to national security, whose offences suggest involvement in serious criminality or who pose a known security or control risk will be detained in a prison rather than an immigration detention centre. In other cases where detention is deemed necessary, individuals will be transferred to an immigration detention centre as soon as possible. Those convicted of lesser criminal offences, who are not considered a risk to the general public, who have strong ties in the United Kingdom and are not considered at risk of absconding may be released on a restriction order.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.2/1">The Government have recently conducted a wide-ranging public consultation exercise on prostitution. The responses to this exercise formed the basis for the development of a co-ordinated prostitution strategy, published in January. This exercise took account of recent research, including an evaluation of the 11 Crime Reduction Projects funded by the Home Office to examine what works in tackling prostitution. This, in addition to anecdotal evidence from those involved in prostitution and those services that work with them, showed that substance misuse is a common issue for 95 per cent. of those involved in street prostitution. Substance misuse can be a cause or side-effect of involvement in prostitution and dependency is commonly linked to coercion, often complicated by the substance misuse of a &quot;partner&quot;.

	<p pid="b.211.0/34">All pupils both with and without SEN are assessed at the end of key stages of learning. In addition, pupils with SEN may have an individual education plan setting out three or four short-term targets focusing on one or more of the following key areas: communication, literacy, mathematics and behaviour and social skills. Pupils with a statement of SEN have their needs reviewed annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/35">With regard to provision for deaf children in mainstream school, the SEN statutory framework and the SEN code of practice should ensure that all children with special needs have those needs identified and assessed and receive appropriate support. The code makes clear the importance of early identification, assessment and provision for any child who may have SEN, including deaf children. In individual cases, assessments are carried out and decisions on provision are made locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/36">The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 extended the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) to cover access to education. As a result disabled children, including deaf children, seeking access to education now have rights against discrimination under Part 4 of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/37">With regard to special schools for deaf children, under arrangements introduced in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, the consideration of proposals for establishing, altering, or discontinuing maintained special schools are a matter for local decision-making. Local authorities are best placed to respond to the needs of pupils in their particular areas. That is why the Government strengthened local participation in decisions about patterns of provision, and removed Ministers from direct involvement in the decision-making process.</p>

	<p pid="b.212.2/2">The Government do not collect information centrally on numbers of special teachers of the deaf or numbers of teachers with specialist training. There is a requirement under regulations that where qualified teachers wish to specialise in teaching children with a hearing impairment they must obtain a mandatory qualification. The department approves the providing institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.2/3">The General Teaching Council is in the process of updating its records of numbers of teachers with specialist training, which are currently incomplete.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.2/4">The special educational needs (SEN) code of practice provides advice to local authorities and schools on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children who have special educational needs, including children who are deaf. The code sets out a graduated approach to providing support. Many children who are deaf will have statements of SEN. All statements must be reviewed at least annually. The purpose of the review is to consider children's progress, to ensure they are achieving desired outcomes and, if necessary, to amend their statements to reflect newly identified needs and provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.2/5">In addition, the development of the New Relationship with Schools brings a focus on how well schools meet the needs of all their pupils. All schools will carry out an annual self-evaluation and publish a single plan setting out their priorities for improvement in which they will need to show how all their pupils are achieving. This process will highlight any gaps in achievement between different groups of children, which will then be discussed with a locally appointed school improvement partner.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.2/6">Our White Paper <i>Higher Standards, Better Schools for all</i> published in October 2005, which builds on <i>Removing Barriers to Achievement</i> published in February 2004, promotes a more effectively tailored education for all children with special education needs by increasing the sharing of expertise between special and mainstream schools; equipping the workforce with appropriate skills, knowledge, awareness and confidence; and promoting more effective measurement of, and accountability for, the progress made by pupils with SEN across a wide range of abilities. The White Paper also set out our plans for personalised learning. These include providing targeted support for groups of children who are at risk of underachieving, including those with SEN. We will spend an additional &pound;565 million by 2007&ndash;08 to support schools to tailor teaching to the needs of all their pupils.</p>

Funding for schools beyond 2007&ndash;08, as with other areas of government expenditure, will be determined as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review. In the Budget Statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government's long-term ambition is for all pupils to have access to the same level of support and opportunities that are currently available to pupils in the independent sector. The Government will therefore aim&mdash;over time and adjusting for inflation&mdash;to increase funding per pupil towards today's private sector day school levels.</p>

These changes relate to corporate, financial, human resource and procedural matters. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland (SCNI), which is responsible for the development of sport in Northern Ireland, including the distribution of funding, is satisfied that there is a need for such changes and that the GAA is fulfilling accountability and value-for-money requirements of public funding. It was not therefore necessary for government to request these changes before releasing funding to the GAA.</p>

	<p pid="b.217.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.5/2">Letter to Lord Steinberg from the National Statistician, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.217.5/3">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question to Her Majesty's Government whether they have made an assessment of how much on average, out of every &pound;100, a basic rate taxpayer pays in tax, taking into account VAT, excise duties, national insurance and income tax. (HL5088)</p>
	<p pid="b.217.5/4">Estimates of the tax burden on households are based on the ONS analyses <i>The effects of taxes and benefits on household income</i>, which is published annually. The published figures do not provide estimates of the total tax paid (including indirect taxes) at the individual level. Nor is it practical for the analyses to give estimates solely for basic rate taxpayers. However, this analysis does provide an estimate of the share of gross household income paid in tax, by different types of household. Estimates are provided for income quintile groups: the bottom 20 per cent. of households, the second, third and fourth quintile groups and the top 20 per cent. of households. These income quintile groups are based on a ranking of households by equivalised disposable income&mdash;a widely used measure of living standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.5/5">The latest analysis for 2003&ndash;04 was published on the National Statistics website on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase> at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.5/6">The analyses are based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (the Family Expenditure Survey before 2001&ndash;02).</p>
	<p pid="b.217.5/7">Table 3 from this analysis has been attached below. It shows the total tax paid as a percentage of gross income for all households by income quintile groups. In general households with higher income pay a higher proportion of their income in direct taxes, but a lower proportion in indirect taxes.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.5/8">Estimates of indirect taxes are imputed based on household expenditure. When comparing the incidence of indirect taxes on households at different levels of income, it should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. On average, measured expenditure exceeds measured income for households in the lower half of the distribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.5/9">To give a more complete picture of the impact of indirect taxes, they are shown in Table 3 separately as a proportion of gross income, disposable income and expenditure. Table 3 shows taxes as a percentage of gross income, disposable income and expenditure for all households by quintile groups', 2003&ndash;04:</p>

	<p pid="b.220.2/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the noble Lord in response to this Question.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government two Parliamentary Questions relating to bus lanes in Belfast:</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/4" class="indent">how the estimate of taxi flow in traditional traffic models in the development of policy on bus lanes in Belfast was carried out; by whom; and when; and</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/5" class="indent">to what extent the impacts of both public hire and private hire taxis' use of Belfast's bus lane infrastructure have been assessed in terms of travelling passenger and general traffic flow.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/6">I have been asked to reply as the issues raised fall within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/7">I should perhaps explain that in the Government's transport policy statement entitled &quot;Moving Forward&quot; published in 1998, and the subsequent regional transportation strategy, published in 2002, the department undertook to encourage modes of travel other than private car and to explore the role of taxis in an integrated transportation system.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/8">In 1999, the former Minister Lord Dubs decided that the Belfast public hire taxis and taxis that operate under a road service licence should be admitted to bus lanes on routes where they are licensed to operate. He also asked that the suitability of allowing motorcycles and all other taxis using bus lanes be investigated. This decision has largely directed bus lane policy development since.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/9">The Belfast Transport Model (BTM), which was used as part of the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan assessment process, is a multi-modal transport model of the Belfast metropolitan area, and provides a detailed representation of all motorised modes of transport in the Belfast area. The model takes account of the main highway, rail and bus networks and has a 2001 base year model and a 2015 forecast model, which are based on actual or future estimates of population and employment planning data.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/10">While the BTM incorporates bus and public hire taxis vehicle movements it was not considered an appropriate tool to inform the decision-making process in relation to bus lane policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/11">As regards the impacts of public and private hire taxis' use of Belfast's bus lane infrastructure on travelling passenger and general traffic flow, I can advise that following the introduction of public hire taxis into bus lanes in June 2002, surveys subsequently carried out on main arterial routes between October 2002 and March 2003 showed that the level of usage by public hire taxis during the hours of bus lane operation was extremely small and not sufficient to cause any adverse impact to the operation of the bus services.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/12">Translink confirmed that it had not experienced any problems on its bus operations and the West Belfast Taxi Association has also said that having use of the bus lanes has enhanced the efficiency of its service by enabling customers to progress to their destination in a more timely manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.2/13">Private hire taxis are currently not permitted into bus lanes and, as such, no assessment has been made of the impact this might have on bus lane operation or traffic flow. However, I can advise that the department plans to carry out further investigations later this year. These are expected to include a review of findings from elsewhere in the UK and Ireland, a review of any relevant research, traffic surveys and analysis and consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.222.6/2">Domestic students undertaking postgraduate certificates will generally attract some funding for the provider from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, as long as they are not funded by another public source.
