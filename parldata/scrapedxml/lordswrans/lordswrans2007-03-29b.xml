	<p pid="b.291.8/1">Farming gives rise to a range of complex impacts relating to the environment and health. These impacts can be positive as well as negative and many of them are external to farming so that the costs or benefits are met by other sectors or the general public</p>
	<p pid="b.291.8/2">Defra and the devolved Administrations commissioned research by Eftec to develop <I>A Framework for Environmental Accounts for Agriculture</I>. Published in July 2004, the study provided initial evidence on significant positive and negative environmental externalities of UK agriculture. The costs of externalities, including water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, were estimated at &pound;1.4 billion and the positive impacts, including biodiversity and landscape, were valued at &pound;1 billion. This study was seen as a first step in a long-term development process, and a further independent study has now been commissioned by Defra. This study, to be completed in summer 2007, will aim to refine and develop environmental accounts. As more reliable estimates are developed, the accounts will have a valuable role in setting priorities for agricultural policy and as an evidence base for measuring the sustainability of agriculture. The study will also consider the feasibility of developing sector valuations to provide evidence in terms of different types of agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.8/3">As part of an ongoing research project, Cranfield University has used life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the resource use and environmental burdens arising from the production of key agricultural commodities. The research has modelled organic and non-organic (contemporary conventional) production in the UK, and thus explicitly sets out the resource use and burdens arising from the relevant systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.291.8/4">Farming also gives rise to externalities relating to animal health and welfare. By way of illustration, Defra commissioned the Scottish Agricultural College to undertake research into the benefits of tighter welfare standards in the production of meat chickens, measured by the public's willingness to pay for lower stocking densities.</p>

	<p pid="b.293.8/1">Entry-level stewardship (ELS) is open to all farmers and land managers. Acceptance into the scheme is guaranteed, provided applicants include a sufficient number of management options to meet a points target based on the size of their holding.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.8/2">Higher-level stewardship (HLS) is a discretionary scheme and applications are expected to contribute to one or more of the five primary objectives of the scheme. The key characteristics of the English countryside have been outlined in the definition of over 150 joint character areas, each of which has priority targets for the management of a variety of features. All HLS applications are scored directly against these targets, and those applications which meet or exceed a pre-determined threshold may be offered an agreement. Applications which do not address the relevant priority targets for their area will be rejected.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.8/3">The number of HLS applications which may be rejected in the future will depend very much on the volume of applications received and the available budget. This is difficult to predict accurately as the potential for further uptake will depend on the outcome of discussions with the European Commission about the budget for the Rural Development Programme (2007-13).</p>

Funding arrangements from 2007 onwards depend on the outcome of discussions with the European Commission. However, as applicants under entry-level stewardship (ELS) are guaranteed an agreement provided they meet a points target based on the area of their holding, I can confirm that no ELS applications have been rejected due to a lack of available budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.2/2">Higher-level stewardship (HLS), however, is a competitive scheme and submitting an application does not guarantee an offer of an agreement. Because funds for HLS are limited, agreements have had to be allocated where they are likely to achieve the most environmental benefit for the countryside. Unfortunately, while some applications have scored highly, they have fallen short of the current thresholds established within Natural England regions. In some areas, the volume of applications has increased markedly in recent months, exceeding expectations. This has meant that the target score required for an application to be successful has had to be adjusted upwards to ensure that the agreements created represent the best possible value for money. Good-quality applications which just fail to meet the target score are not rejected out of hand, but are deferred until the next application period, at which point they are re-assessed against all the other applications received.</p>

	<p pid="b.295.5/1">Defra is currently carrying out a review of rabies import policy to ensure that UK controls on all rabies-susceptible mammals are proportionate and sustainable. This will help to inform the UK's response to the European Commission's review of certain requirements of EU Regulation 998/2003 on the non-commercial movement of pet animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.5/2">Regulation 998/2003 requires the European Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and Council, based on experience gained and risk evaluation. The report is expected shortly. The UK has already submitted scientific and field information to assist this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.5/3">The UK's own review of national rabies import controls is nearing completion. The evidence received so far from government vets, officials and veterinary risk assessments indicates that our current controls may no longer be proportionate to the risk of rabies entering the UK and we may need to consider modernising processes and regulation in this area. Our controls must also be consistent with current thinking on better regulation. We are seeking further views before reaching conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="b.304.5/1">The UK Government have always played a significant role in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and have provided regular financial support since it was founded in 1988.</p>
	<p pid="b.304.5/2">The UK has also co-chaired working groups of the IPCC covering the science of climate change (1988-2002) and the impacts of, and adaptation to, climate change (2002-present). This required that the Government fund the associated technical support units and chairs. Additionally, we are providing financial support for the head of the technical support unit tasked with preparing the synthesis report for the fourth assessment report, due for completion in November 2007. Finally, we provide travel funds to enable UK scientists to participate in the IPCC process.</p>

	<p pid="b.318.8/1">One of the guiding principles from the creation of the National Lottery was that it would support projects that could not or would not realistically have been possible without lottery funding or with mainstream government funding alone. Lottery funding has duly supported many unique projects of national importance that have aided regeneration&mdash;for example, the Tate Modern and the Eden Project.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.8/2">Lottery funding in all the good cause areas&mdash;the arts, sport, heritage, the millennium, charitable expenditure, health, education and the environment, and the London Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012&mdash;has demonstrably supported activities contributing to physical, economic and social regeneration.</p>

Furthermore, MoLAS-PCA is in regular contact with English Heritage's Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service (GLAAS), which also provides advice to the five host boroughs and the ODA Planning Decisions Team.</p>

In the event that disputes arise, it is important that they are dealt with in an appropriate and expedient manner. The form of dispute resolution will be determined by the circumstances.</p>
