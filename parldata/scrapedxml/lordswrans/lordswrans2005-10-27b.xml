	<p pid="b.198.0/1">The case papers were formally referred by me to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-06">6 May 2004</phrase>, with a request that they consider whether a prosecution should be instituted against Trooper Williams for murder or manslaughter.</p>

He was interviewed by the Metropolitan Police Service, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-27">27 July 2004</phrase>. A further statement was drawn from that interview, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-28">28 July 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/3">I saw the statements of 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-21">21 August 2003</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-05">5 May 2004</phrase>.

Records indicate that the transcript of the interview was first formally received into his private office on or about <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase> but the DPP believes that he discussed this material with counsel prior to <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase> on a date unknown. The DPP did not, however, see the transcript of the interview until well after the decision to prosecute had been taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.198.0/5">The decision to prosecute was formally made by a senior crown prosecutor, not the DPP, although he concurred in it.

	<p pid="b.198.0/7">The DPP informed me that he had nevertheless concluded that there was no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-15">15 March 2005</phrase>. He repeated that advice at a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
