	<p pid="a.158.2/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) operates to a set of published service standards (PSS) which include issuing 90 per cent of standard disclosures within 10 days and 90 per cent of enhanced disclosures within 28 days. Between April 2008 and March 2009 the CRB has issued 396,000 standard disclosures and 3,459,000 enhanced disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.2/2">During this period the CRB has exceeded PSS for standard disclosures with a cumulative total of 99.1 per cent issued within 10 days and has not met PSS for enhanced disclosures, issuing 88.6 per cent within 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.2/3">The CRB has been receiving a higher than anticipated volume of disclosure applications. There are a number of reasons for this, but the volumes have put a great deal of pressure on both the CRB and the police forces. Consequently, some applications are taking longer to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.2/4">Forces have been responding effectively and positively to these high intakes and this has enabled record numbers of disclosures to be issued in recent months.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.2/5">For those forces which, for a variety of reasons, have been having greater difficulty with the increased demand, the CRB has been working very closely with them to address what additional help and support they need in the form of IT and workflow management expertise, accommodation and a 10 per cent increase in staff resources. The CRB has increased its own staff resources by 11 per cent to provide support for the police disclosure units and the bureau continues to monitor their performance regularly.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.2/6">A joint improvement plan has been initiated aimed at reducing the number of aged cases, which are those applications that have been outstanding for longer than 25 days. Aged cases are those which cause the most difficulties for applicants, employers and other users of the disclosure service. This improvement plan has contributed towards a steady decline in the number of these cases over recent months. Monthly performance figures for each of the police forces for their part of the disclosure service are now published on the CRB website at <a href="http://www.crb.gov.uk">www.crb.gov.uk</a>.</p>

We are aware that concerns have been raised that police officers may be using the stop-and-search powers at Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to stop members of the public from taking photographs. The power cannot be used for that purpose and the revised operational guidance on the use of Section 44 which was issued by the National Policing Improvement Agency in November 2008 makes it clear that Section 44 should not be used to stop people taking photographs.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.5/1">The South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA) through the regional economic strategy (RES) for the south-west plays a key role in supporting investments/interventions and delivery at regional, sub-regional (eg Dorset) and local (eg west Dorset) levels. These RES driven interventions, though not recoded on a local authority (LA) basis, ultimately benefit localities and communities across the region. Some of the agency's key activities from the past five years, which will have led to benefits for west Dorset communities, including its businesses, are:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/2">provision of business support through Business Link, the Manufacturing Advisory Service and the Rural Enterprise Gateway (regional) and more local projects such as the Dorset skills festival and the Dorset business mentoring scheme;support to the development and implementation of the Bournemouth Dorset and Poole multi-area agreement, which provides the area with the opportunity to have a direct relationship with Government about its priorities; co-ordination of activity to maximise the economic impact of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games;support for the Dorset rural renaissance programme;support for the development of the Dorset Rural Regeneration Company, Dorset Squared (sub-regional);support towards the Bournemouth Dorset and Poole workspace strategy, helping local authorities plan for appropriate provision of workspace; funding to support the Weymouth and Dorchester economic vision;support to projects and activities along the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site ie the Jurassic Coast Trust, funding for the quality business scheme helping tourism-related businesses improve their customer care; funding towards local projects to support local community planning and local delivery in Bridport and Lyme Regis and funding towards creation of the Dorset towns network;investment to support regeneration projects, including provision of employment space, in Beaminster, Lyme Regis (St Michaels Centre) and Bridport (Gore Cross and project development funding for Bridport South West Quadrant).</p>
	<p pid="a.172.5/3">In addition, the agency is the managing authority for the local action programme of the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE), which has awarded &pound;3.1 million to the chalk and cheese partnership which covers west Dorset. The agency has also recently funded the Town Mill Trust in Lyme Regis to acquire a building to refurbish in order to create new work space.</p>
