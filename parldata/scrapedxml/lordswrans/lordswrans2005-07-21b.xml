	<p pid="b.264.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr Malcolm McKibbin to Lord Laird dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>. </p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/3">You recently asked Her Majesty's Government a Parliamentary Question about how many roadside trees were planted in Belfast in the 10 years up to the end of 2003; how many have survived to date; and whether they plan to strengthen sapling protection procedures. I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/4">I can advise that the number of trees planted in the public footways in the Belfast area for the 10 years up to the end of 2003 was approximately 2,500. The annual survival rate is 95 per cent with the 5 per cent failure rate attributable to instances of disease, road traffic accidents and vandalism. We replace these trees as soon as is practicable and attempt to recover the full replacement costs, where possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/5">I should also explain that the trees planted in the public footways are termed &quot;Extra Heavy Standards&quot;. These trees are about 10 years old, and when planted are protected with a galvanised tree guard. There are currently no plans to enhance this level of protection. Where external funding is available, (for example Environmental Improvement Schemes funded by the Department for Social Development), semi-mature trees are planted. However, you will appreciate that the additional costs for these semi-mature trees could not be funded from our annual street planting programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/6">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

In addition to this, filing times in other countries are also usually less generous than of those in the UK. In the Hampton report <i>Reducing Administrative Burdens</i>, published in March 2005, it was suggested that the synergies between Companies House and HMRC should be explored, particularly in relation to the data required for filing accounts under company law and under corporation tax law. Currently companies have to send different accounts for different purposes to Companies House and HMRC at different times. These organisations are working together to explore how best to simplify these processes for the benefit of smaller companies.</p>

	<p pid="b.277.3/2">The European Commission has competence for dealing with extraterritorial measures taken by third countries against EU member states. Council Regulation EC 2271/96 was introduced by the EU in 1996 to offer protection to EU individuals and companies against extraterritorial legislation including the Helms-Burton Act and the Iran/Libya Sanctions Act, both of which are explicitly extraterritorial in content and whose adoption in the US prompted the introduction of the above so-called blocking legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.3/3">In the same year, the UK ratified the EU regulation by means of an amendment to the UK Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980. Both pieces of legislation are designed to protect Community interests by making it illegal for its individuals and companies to comply with US extraterritorial demands. Further, under the terms of the legislation, UK companies are obliged to inform HMG and the European Commission of any extraterritorial action taken against them in order that appropriate protective measures can be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.3/4">In May 1998, following lengthy negotiations between the EU and the US in which the UK played a prominent part, an understanding was reached. The EU agreed to suspend action in the World Trade Organisation against the extraterritorial aspects of Helms-Burton in exchange for a EU-wide exemption by the US from the extraterritorial elements of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.3/5">The US continues to introduce new legislation with extraterritorial effect and to apply extraterritorial provisions to certain of its exports. The Government will continue to place pressure on the US to adhere to multilateral trade rules, which assert that the prevailing precepts for deciding the limits of a sovereign state's jurisdiction are the territorial and nationality principles.</p>

	<p pid="b.280.2/1">We can confirm that the cost of establishing the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and the cost of enforcing the offences introduced by the Gangmasters Licensing Act 2004 will be met by Defra. These costs will not affect the fees charged by the authority for the issue of licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/2">The authority was established on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and is currently working to set up the new licensing arrangements. It is hoped that the authority will complete this work by the end of the current financial year. It is estimated that the cost of setting up the authority during 2005&ndash;06 will be some &pound;2.3 million. The authority expects to commence issuing licences early in the 2006&ndash;07 financial year. On the assumption that 1,000 licence applications are received in the first year, the authority expects to incur staff costs of some &pound;1.4 million and other costs of some &pound;1.0 million during 2006&ndash;07. If the authority meets its anticipated commencement date for issuing licences, few if any of the costs incurred during 2006&ndash;07 will be classified as setup costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.2/3">As required under the Gangmasters Licensing Act the authority will consult the Secretary of State before finalising licence fees. While the Secretary of State would ideally wish to see the authority recover its operating cost through licence fee income, it is also important to ensure licence fees are not seen as a barrier to business or a disincentive to those businesses that wish to operate legally. Final decisions on licence fee levels will be informed through consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.284.8/1">The identity cards programme has taken a number of steps to assess the operation of biometrics and card technology as part of setting requirements for the proposed identity cards scheme. The programme has formed a team with experience in biometrics and technology who have conducted a review of relevant scientific research in this area. They are working with leading experts from the US National Institute for Standards &amp; Technology, San Jose University, UK National Physical Laboratory, members of the Biometrics Working Group and the Communications-Electronic Security Group as well as learning from the experience of our colleagues at UK Passport Service, Immigration &amp; Nationality Directorate and the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO). Lessons from international biometric identity cards schemes such as Hong Kong and the Philippines are also being reviewed and initial engagement with companies in the field of biometrics has taken place in accordance with Office for Government Commerce guidelines. This work will continue and will be subject to the supervision of the Home Office Senior Biometric Adviser and our biometric assurance group, chaired by Sir David King, the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser. The work of the National Physical Laboratory, in its 2003 feasibility study on the use of biometrics report, confirms that, &quot;In the case of facial recognition, it would seem advisable to update the templates at least every 10 years. Fingerprints and iris should be considerably more stable&quot;. This report can be found on the Identity Cards website.</p>

	<p pid="b.285.5/1">The key to consumer empowerment in this area is ensuring that borrowers are given clear information about how the interest charges under an agreement will be calculated, before they commit themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.285.5/2">The new transparency regime that we have introduced fulfils this function. The new rules require consumers to be given information both pre-contract and in the credit agreement. Since 31 of May this year a statement of when and how interest charges are calculated and applied under the agreement has to be included up-front in the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.285.5/3">Beyond this, I have reservations about whether standardising interest rate calculations would be beneficial to consumers. Not all borrowers want to use credit in the same way, and they benefit from being able to choose a product that complements the way that they organise their finances. I am concerned that standardisation would restrict or even eliminate this consumer choice.</p>

	<p pid="b.286.2/2">The International Criminal Court Act 2001 consolidated various existing legislative instruments, using the precise legal definitions provided for under the statute of the ICC. This enables the United Kingdom to prosecute for all such crimes, as stipulated by the Rome statute. This legislative approach was adopted in order to ensure that any necessary investigations or prosecutions could take place under UK law. Any allegations that crimes under this Act have been committed by British citizens would be considered and investigated by the relevant British authorities.

	<p pid="b.288.8/1">There is currently no formal proposal from the Palestinian Authority asking the European Union to consider sanctions with respect to settlement expansion and the requisition of land for construction of the barrier. The EU's position is clear: settlement expansion and construction of the barrier on occupied territory is illegal under international law. The EU does not support sanctions against Israel. We do not believe that sanctions against one side would bring the parties any nearer to a peaceful resolution. Instead, we have pursued a policy of constructive engagement.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.8/2">As President of the European Union we are keen to take the peace process forward with our partners in the quartet (US, UN, EU and Russia). The key priority for the first few months of the presidency is to support the work of Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement James Wolfensohn, in order to help make Gaza economically viable after Israeli withdrawal. In addition, we are supporting Palestinian efforts at institution building. Successful disengagement and stronger Palestinian institutions could pave the way back to the road map.</p>

	<p pid="b.292.8/8">It is not clear what the &quot;main features&quot; of these contracts mean but to provide details about each contract is not possible without incurring disproportionate cost, as the information is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.8/9">On the assumption the main interest lies in the tender process, then open and fair competition, both at prime and subcontract level, remains the bedrock of MoD's procurement policy. It is the most effective means of achieving value for money and of developing an efficient and innovative defence industry and enables any competent supplier to tender for MoD work, without discrimination or favour.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.8/10">However, competition will not be pursued where it is not sensible, practicable or beyond the point where there is no longer a probability of improving long-term value for money. To ensure best value for money when a contract is awarded by non-competitive means, the MoD employs a &quot;no agreed price, no contract&quot; policy, by way of price negotiation, to try and replicate the market forces from the competitive arena.</p>

The estimates therefore include people eligible for credits but who might also be economically active and also paying national insurance (NI) contributions. For example, a person's eligibility to home responsibilities protection is based on receipt of child benefit regardless of whether that person is working and paying NI contributions.

	<p pid="b.305.2/1">The Police Ombudsman's budget is set at a level to allow the office to fulfil all of its legal obligations under Part II of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 and I refer the noble Lord to that Act. Part of those obligations is the determination of complaints from the public about the conduct of police officers, only a small number of which end in prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions and subsequently conviction by the courts. There is no direct correlation between the Police Ombudsman's budget and the cost of convictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/2">Value for money can only be determined when compared to similar organisations; a fair comparison would be with the predecessor of the Police Ombudsman, i.e. the combined functions of the RUC Complaints and Discipline Department and the Independent Commission for Police Complaints. In his 1997 report, <i>A police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland,</i> Dr Maurice Hayes placed their combined operating cost at about &pound;6,850,000. Given the range and scope of work of the ombudsman's office, which is fully independent of government and police and as it is eight years since the report was completed, its current budget of &pound;7,100,000 (cash) would seem to represent value for money.</p>

	<p pid="b.306.2/2">The Abortion Act 1967 does not extend to Northern Ireland, and abortion may be carried out only when necessary to save the life of the mother, or where continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk of serious injury to her physical or mental health.

	<p pid="b.310.2/2" class="italic">Ballywalter</p>
	<p pid="b.310.2/3">There are 137 Housing Executive and 20 Housing Association dwellings in Ballywalter. The Housing Executive has identified a need for an additional 10 units and Housing Associations are trying to identify a suitable site with a view to having a scheme included in the development programme for 2008&ndash;09. A multi element and environmental improvement scheme for seven Housing Executive bungalows in the Well Road/Well Close area is planned to commence in March 2006. Bathrooms in the Corinthian Housing Association Stump Road scheme are due to be refurbished in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.2/4" class="italic">Ballyhalbert</p>
	<p pid="b.310.2/5">There are 12 Housing Executive dwellings in Ballyhalbert. The Housing Executive has identified a need for five additional properties and a scheme has been programmed for Rural Housing Association in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.2/6" class="italic">Portavogie</p>
	<p pid="b.310.2/7">There are 85 Housing Executive dwellings in Portavogie. The Housing Executive has assessed that there is no real housing need in this area as allocations are generally sufficient to meet need. A multi-element and environmental improvement scheme for 30 bungalows in Greyabbey, Kircubbin, Portavogie, and Cloughey is planned to commence in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.2/8">An external cyclical maintenance scheme for 260 homes in Ballyhalbert, Ballywalter, Portavogie and Cloughey was completed at the end of 2004. A kitchen replacement scheme for 37 homes in Portavogie, Cloughey and Ballywalter was completed in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.2/9" class="italic">Private Sector Dwellings</p>
	<p pid="b.310.2/10">For those properties in the private sector (owner-occupiers, landlords and tenants) a range of grants is available to help with the costs of undertaking improvement work. With regard to the provision of private sector housing, this is undertaken by private developers where demand exists for such housing.</p>

	<p pid="b.315.6/1">The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) applies only to defined benefit, or final salary, pension schemes and to the defined benefit elements of hybrid pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.6/2">The reason for this is that the PPF has been designed to protect the pensions promise made by employers who sponsor defined benefit schemes. In a defined benefit scheme, the pension benefits promised to members are calculated independently of the contributions payable and are not directly related to the investments of the scheme. For this reason a defined benefit scheme can become underfunded, meaning that the scheme's assets are not sufficient to meet the full liabilities of the benefits promised. Where an employer becomes insolvent and is therefore no longer able to sponsor a defined benefit scheme, and the scheme is underfunded to a level where it cannot afford to pay benefits at the PPF level, the PPF will provide the members of that scheme with a level of security in retirement by paying compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.6/3">Defined contribution, or money purchase, occupational pension schemes differ from defined benefit schemes in that the levels of each member's benefits are determined by direct reference to the contributions paid into the scheme in respect of the member. There is no pensions promise with defined contribution pension schemes and no issue of underfunding. It is therefore not necessary or appropriate for such schemes to be eligible for the PPF.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.6/4">From <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase> the board of the PPF will also take over the functions of the existing Pensions Compensation Board which was established by the Pensions Act 1995 to pay compensation to trust-based occupational pension schemes where assets have been lost through acts of dishonesty and the employer is insolvent. The board will hold and manage a fund known as the Fraud Compensation Fund and will provide fraud compensation to defined contribution as well as defined benefit schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.316.5/1">Section 175 of the Pensions Act 2004 (the Act) provides that the Board of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) must impose pension protection levies in respect of all eligible schemes. The levies are to be made up of a risk-based levy and a scheme-based levy and Section 177 of the Act requires at least 80 per cent. of the total amount raised must be raised by risk-based levy.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.5/2">The risk-based levy is designed to reduce cross-subsidy between schemes and promote fairness. This approach means that schemes that pose a higher risk pay more for the PPF compensation cover, and costs are kept down for employers with well funded schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.5/3">The risk based levy is also one of the measures designed to protect the PPF from moral hazard. This is the risk that because the PPF exists to compensate scheme members if their employer has become insolvent and the scheme is under-funded, employers will deliberately manipulate their affairs so as to shift their deficits into the PPF. By charging companies with higher levels of under-funding a higher levy, companies will be encouraged not to under-fund their schemes.</p>
