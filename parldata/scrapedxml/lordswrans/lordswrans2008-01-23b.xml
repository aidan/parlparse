	<p pid="b.48.8/1">The total estimated capital cost of the project for the construction of the outer harbour at Great Yarmouth as envisaged in the project appraisal carried out by EEDA in 2004, which includes the part-publicly funded maritime access works, is &pound;54 million, as set out in my reply of <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-12">12 December</phrase>. This does not take account of any further private development of the port by the private developer.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.8/2">The requirement for revenue commitments from a ferry operator at the outset of the project was imposed as a means of helping ensure viability of the project. This requirement was withdrawn by the RDA following responses to the procurement exercise for the outer harbour project. The requirement was waived on the basis that it was not judged commercially realistic in today's market to expect that a ferry company would commit to revenue guarantees at such an early stage, before construction of the outer harbour had begun. At the same time, the RDA judged that the proposal submitted in response to the procurement exercise by the developer who was eventually selected presented a sound and viable development without revenue commitments at the outset from a ferry operator.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.8/3">The successful developer's proposal was based on enabling larger vessels for existing trades to call at Great Yarmouth and attracting a range of new trades, with port facilities and the commercial focus evolving over time in response to market trends. In addition to attracting ferry services, the proposal identified the following potential sources of revenue; expanding support for the oil and gas sector; expanding the scope and scale for importing aggregates; extending the support for existing trades such as forest products, fertilisers and agri-bulk; providing port and support facilities for the wind farm; catering for oil and gas de/recommissioning demand ; attracting containerised short sea and feeder trades; attracting car imports; attracting new technology projects. Release of information on the amounts of revenue expected would prejudice the commercial interests of the port developer.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.5/1">The planning policy statement (PPS) on climate change published at the end of 2007 makes cutting carbon emissions a key government priority for the planning system in England. The PPS sets out how planning can help secure enduring progress against the UK's emissions targets, by direct influence on energy use and emissions, and in bringing together and encouraging action by others. As part of this contribution, planning authorities are expected to prepare and manage the delivery of spatial strategies that help secure the fullest possible use of sustainable transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.5/2">The PPS underlines that local planners should expect new development to create and secure opportunities for sustainable transport in line with existing planning policies for transport (set out in PPG13). These highlight that a key factor in encouraging the wider take-up of clean road transport fuels and technologies is the development of the associated recharging or refuelling infrastructure. There is therefore no reason why, where appropriate, planning authorities should not already expect commercial and public buildings to have facilities to recharge electrical powered vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="b.55.0/1">Decisions on whether consent should be granted for the storage of certain types of hazardous substances above specified levels are matters for local authorities following consultation with the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency. The Health and Safety Executive provides advice on the risk that would be presented to people in the surrounding area; the Environment Agency on the risk to the environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/2">In respect of a proposal for the storage of hazardous substances by the Potter Group at Green Lane, Melmerby, the Health and Safety Executive was consulted in February 2007. It advised that, subject to compliance with the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, and with specific conditions relating to the storage of hazardous substances on site, the risks to the surrounding population from the proposed operation(s) were so small that there was no significant reason on safety grounds for refusing hazardous substances consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/3">The local authority resolved at a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-28">28 August</phrase> to grant the Potter Group consent for the storage of specified hazardous substances subject to conditions as to storage specified by the Health and Safety Executive, and to voluntary revocation by the Potter Group of an existing hazardous substances consent relating to the storage of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/4">Representations have been made by a local residents group to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and to the Health and Safety Executive. However, as I have explained, this is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>
