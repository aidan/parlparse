We are exploring the feasibility of market mechanisms to enable the trading of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry and land management. We are looking at how measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can be included in agri-environment schemes in future. We also plan to publish shortly a critical review of the potential for organic matter returns and reduced tillage practices to influence soil carbon.</p>

	<p pid="b.2.2/22" class="indent">1. Comprised 763 underpayments ranging from &pound;98 to &pound;348 due to a JPA formula error, fixed in month and 620 substitution pay errors (~&pound;150 underpaid) fixed in February.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.2/23" class="indent">2. A decision was made not to recover some elements of service debt and miscellaneous charges until data accuracy on transition could be proved (13,908). Some of the underpayments (~100) were caused by non-receipt of payable orders while 121 were caused by Late Entry Majors not being transitioned to their correct pay scale and was corrected in June.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.2/24" class="indent">3. The majority of the 1,181 underpayments were caused by University Officer Training Corps input of bounties and training nights; other factors were mess subscriptions and disturbance allowance. The majority of the underpayments were resolved in May and June. There were a further 3,340 minor errors due to migration of some data elements which were mainly resolved in June, though the breakdown of underpayments versus overpayments is unknown.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.2/25" class="indent">4. The majority of the overpayments (2,611) were due to double payment of the female clothing grant (&pound;4.50). The underpayments relate to late input of Cadet Force Home to Duty, which was resolved in month.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.2/26" class="indent">5. Comprised 35,553 incorrect deductions of &pound;3.00 for the discontinued Royal Navy and Royal Marines Dependants' Fund, and 10,752 underpayments of Home to Duty Travel claims for Royal Navy reservists. The former was re-credited to pay accounts in October, and the latter in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.2/27" class="indent">6. 4,249 additional cases occurred where an incorrect rank on JPA generated an erroneous payment. The breakdown between underpayments and overpayments is unknown, corrective action was taken in time for the October 2007 pay run.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.2/28" class="indent">7. A formula error resulted in 1,978 personnel receiving incorrect refunds of accommodation and CILOT charges. Corrective action was taken in November 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.6.5/1">The formal Comprehensive Spending Review settlement for 2008-09 to 2010-11 has been announced and will now be followed by Defra's own financial allocation process, which will take account of the department's full range of priorities. Final allocations will be known in February. At this stage, I am hopeful that the budget for British Waterways will broadly be flat cash over the three-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.5/2">Core government grant for British Waterways for the current year is &pound;66.9 million comprising &pound;55.5 million from Defra and &pound;11.4 million from the Scottish Government.

	<p pid="b.7.2/1">The tax-free mileage allowance is part of the approved mileage allowance payments (AMAPs) scheme which is a statutory scheme introduced with effect from April 2002. The allowance was set at a rate of 40p per mile for the first 10,000 business miles and at 25p per mile thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.2/2">AMAPs cater for a wide range of car drivers and the rates are designed to take into account all relevant factors. They strike a balance between allowing the running costs of all cars, large and small, and delivering the Government's environmental policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.2/3">The Government estimate that the increase in the 40p rate using the retail prices index would be 47p per mile for 2007-08. However, this index includes the prices of goods and services that are not directly related to the cost of motoring and it does not take into account the increase in fuel economy of cars manufactured since 2002. It is not possible to compare the rate with the AA and RAC calculated costs of motoring as costs depend on type of car, engine size, fuel type and miles driven.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.2/14">In April 2006 PSNI adopted a higher evidential standard in respect of non-sanction clearances to bring these clearance types more closely in line with England and Wales. While this has had the effect of reducing the overall clearance rate, sanction clearances (those where a formal sanction is taken against an offender by means of charge, summons, caution or where the offence is taken into consideration at court) remain unaffected.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.2/15">This year's policing plan includes a specific target to increase the sanction clearance rate by three percentage points by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>. Progress against this target is being made by a range of actions, including improving volume crime investigation, developing public protection units within districts, improving working arrangements with the PPS, improving forensic conversion rates and seeking out best practice in other police services.</p>

	<p pid="b.11.5/1">Global fossil fuel prices have increased significantly in the last year due to continued strong growth in demand and supply constraints. This will have increased the costs of generating electricity from fossil fuels&mdash;oil, gas or coal. Therefore, in relative terms, nuclear's cost-effectiveness will have improved. In the cost-benefit analysis of nuclear generation we published a table showing the economic welfare balance under different gas and carbon prices and nuclear costs, which included all waste and decommissioning costs. This is available at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39525.pdf">www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39525.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.5/2">We also estimated the impact of different fossil fuel price scenarios on the economics of different types of electricity generating plant. Since fuel costs account for around two-thirds of the cost of gas-fired generation and about 40 per cent of the costs of coal-fired generation, increases in fossil fuel prices have a significant impact on the cost of generation from these sources.</p>

	<p pid="b.12.5/1">Member states of the European Union (EU) are required to hold stocks of oil and oil products equivalent to 90 days' national consumption. Because the UK is a producer of crude oil its obligation is reduced by 25 per cent to 67&amp;frac12; days. As UK production declines, this reduction will be phased out and the obligation will gradually increase to 90 days when UK production ends.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.5/2">As a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA) the UK is required to hold stocks of oil or oil products equivalent to 90 days' net imports. Unlike the EU, the TEA excludes &quot;tank bottoms&quot; from qualifying as emergency stocks; this effectively means the obligation is equivalent to 99 days' net imports. The UK became a net importer of oil and oil products in 2006 and had an obligation to hold stocks as an IEA member with effect from 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.5/3">Member states can use the same stocks to meet both sets of obligations. We currently expect the obligation to hold stocks as an IEA member to result in a net increase in the UK obligation from about 2016.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.5/4">The Government believe that these measures are sufficient and have no plans to increase the levels of stocks held beyond those already referred to.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.5/2">The number of pigs in breeding herds declined after 1998 for several reasons including the effects on productivity of animal diseases, and also the recovery of the beef market following BSE, the costs of production, exchange rate movements and increased competition from imports. The government-funded Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme of 2000-01 was brought in to help secure the longer-term viability of the sector. The decline in the breeding herds has slowed in recent years although the industry continues to face considerable challenges. It is to be commended for working to secure a sustainable future through market principles and improvements in efficiency and production standards. Defra is supportive of the efforts of the industry and is currently funding a &pound;2 million programme through the Meat and Livestock Commission to aid market recovery in the pigmeat and other red meat sectors affected by last year's foot and mouth outbreak.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.3/1">Three cases emanated from the City of London Police's investigation into allegations of horserace fixing. The first was R v Rodgers &amp; others. This case was concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-07">7 December 2007</phrase>, when the judge directed the jury to acquit the six defendants in the case. The prosecution offered no evidence in respect of the two other trials.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.3/2">The break-down of the prosecution costs in respect of these three cases is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.22.3/3">prosecution counsels' costs (three counsel were briefed): &pound;701,480.37witness expenses: &pound;14,527.04ancillary costs, including electronic presentation of evidence: &pound;234,815.91 Total: &pound;950,823.32.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.3/4">The cost to the taxpayer would also include Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) staff costs; police costs; defence costs (which are to be paid out of central funds); and court costs. Staff costs are attributable to the operation of the CPS as a whole and cannot be assessed on an individual case basis. I am unable to comment on police, defence and court costs as these figures are not kept by the CPS.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.3/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-07">7 December 2007</phrase>, the judge in the R v Rodgers &amp; others case delivered a detailed ruling. In it, he specifically commented that the expert witness's statements were clearly expressed in terms that suggested that he did have appropriate expertise in UK racing rules and practices and that, in 13 out of the 27 suspect races (which formed the basis of the prosecution's case), he had concluded that there was a prima facie case that the jockey in question was in breach of the relevant UK racing rule. The judge further commented that, when giving his evidence in chief, the expert witness said nothing to call into question his expertise in UK racing, either by reference to the rules or the practices of UK racing, and that &quot;remarkably, it was only as a result of and during (the expert's) cross-examination that the very significant limitations and shortcomings in the evidence that he was really able to give first became apparent&quot;. In particular, the judge said that some of the witness's responses during cross-examination were tantamount to the witness disqualifying himself from giving expert evidence in relation to the suspect races. The judge, therefore, concluded that the probative value of the expert's evidence, following extensive cross-examination, was so limited that very little, if any, weight or value could be attached to it. The judge found that in these circumstances he had to direct the jury to acquit the defendants.</p>
