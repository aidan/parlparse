	<p pid="a.6.2/1">The global control of small arms and light weapons (SALW) is one of the highest priorities of the Government's global conflict prevention strategy. Internationally, the United Kingdom fully supports the United Nations programme of action (POA) on SALW. The UK is one of the largest and most influential donors on small arms issues. Under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, the UK has allocated &pound;13.25 million (2004&ndash;07) to control and reduce the supply, demand and availability of SALW. The funding supports projects that assist UN agencies, regional organisations, governments and non-governmental organisations to combat the proliferation and misuse of small arms. One of our key priorities is promoting the transfer control initiative, which aims to secure agreement on common international standards governing small arms transfers at the UN POA review conference on small arms in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.3/1">Accurate data are not held centrally. All local authorities maintain their own records of privately-owned trees that are protected by tree preservation orders and many have inventories of trees for which they are responsible. The last survey of trees in London <i>(Action for London's Trees, </i>1993) estimated that there were nearly 6,000,000 individual trees and hedges and more than 65,000 woodlands and stands of trees. <i>Trees in Towns </i>(1993) assessed the composition of tree stocks in 66 sample towns in England. This survey is currently being reviewed <i>(Trees in Towns II) </i>and the results will be available in summer 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/2">The two surveys of 1993 recorded that the vast majority of trees were in good condition. Since that time Forest Research has monitored the condition of nonwoodland amenity trees to identify the incidence and trends of pathogens and insects affecting tree health. It does not assess the overall health of the national tree stock. <i>Trees in Towns II </i>will also provide up to date data on tree condition which will be compared with that from previous surveys.</p>

The MHRA regulates such importation and will object to import if it has concerns about the safety or quality of a product.

	<p pid="a.19.2/1">For many years the Forestry Commission's research agency, Forest Research, has investigated means by which grey squirrel populations may be controlled. The recommended methods and best current practice are set out in the Forestry Commission's <i>Forestry Practice Note 4 (revised) &quot;Controlling Grey Squirrel Damage to Woodland&quot;,</i> the latest edition of which was published in April 2004 and is available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">The Forestry Commission has also run a series of regional seminars for landowners and managers aimed at the dissemination of best practice on grey squirrel control techniques.

	<p pid="a.19.5/1">In June 2004 the Forestry Commission, in partnership with the England Squirrel Forum, prepared a document &quot;Towards a Forestry Commission England Grey Squirrel Policy&quot;. This examined the impacts of grey squirrels and explored options for their management. The document sought to provide a baseline and context from which policy and delivery actions could be developed. Its preparation involved input from, or consultation with, over 25 organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">Following this process the Forestry Commission and Defra produced a draft statement &quot;Grey Squirrels in England&mdash;Policy and Action&quot; that was used for expert consultation in November 2004. The consultation involved all organisations in England known by the Forestry Commission, Defra and their agencies to have a particular interest in grey squirrels. The draft statement was also sent to the chairs of the Scottish and Welsh squirrel forum for their comments.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.2/1">On the public forest estate the Forestry Commission focuses its resources, and hence management, on locations where grey squirrels cause the greatest threat to the sustainable management of woodland. This includes targeting control to protect timber where it is cost-effective to do so and also to protect threatened red squirrel populations in priority areas identified under the species action plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">Land managed by the commission is not subject to dedication under the provisions of Section 5 of the Forestry Act 1967 (as amended). The only land dedicated by the Forestry Commission is under Section 16 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 as access land; such dedication has no bearing on the policy to control grey squirrels.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">There are currently no formal systems for routinely assessing the risks posed by non-native birds and mammals. However, Defra is funding research to develop a standard methodology to assess the risks posed by non-native species to the environment. This research is expected to be completed in February 2005 and the report will be published on Defra's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/2">Information on new mammal and bird species identified in the UK is collected through a variety of existing monitoring schemes such as the Rural Development Service's wildlife reports and the Biological Records centre. For established non-native species population distribution, numbers and trends are commonly monitored through the same schemes set in place to monitor native birds and mammals: the British Trust for Ornithology is an example of such a monitoring scheme for birds, and the Tracking Mammals Partnership for mammals.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.2/3">In addition, species-specific risk assessments and studies are conducted whenever species are considered to pose an existing or potential threat to native biodiversity, to human or animal health, or to economic interests. Recent examples of such assessments include national surveys of ruddy duck and feral wild boar, and black rats on Lundy Island.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.5/1">There are currently no plans to estimate the cost of grey squirrel damage to either the community forests or other grant-aided planting schemes. It is accepted that grey squirrels may cause damage to such woodlands but any attempt to accurately estimate the cost of such damage is fraught with difficulty due to the large number of variable factors involved. For example, natural variations in squirrel populations can have an impact on damage levels, as can woodland management regimes. There is a great deal of uncertainty involved in predicting the value of the final crop, particularly the differential between prime quality and lower grade timber.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/2">In addition, the cost of damage is not solely related to timber, particularly in the case of community planting schemes where landscape and amenity values may be relevant.</p>
