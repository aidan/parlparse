	<p pid="a.53.6/1">The Government are concerned about the number of women offenders in prison, both on remand and sentenced. The Prison Reform Trust's recent report on the rise of the women's remand population highlights some important issues and we welcome its contribution to the debate on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/2">It is, of course, for the courts to decide in each case whether to remand a person in custody and subsequently what sentence is appropriate. We acknowledge, though, that there is a significant number of women who are remanded in custody who do not go on to receive a custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/3">We are taking forward the Women's Offending Reduction Programme, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-11">11 March 2004</phrase>, which promotes a more focused response to the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend. It encourages joint working between departments, agencies and other organisations to tackle those factors, including problems with mental health, drugs, housing, childcare, abuse and employment. The long-term objectives of the programme are to reduce women's offending and to reduce the number of women in custody. The intent is to maximise the opportunities for a diversion at the pre-sentence stage. The focus too will be on improving community based interventions that are better tailored to the needs of women, and encouraging greater use of community disposals to ensure that custody is only used for women who really need to be there. In addition, the recently published national probation service accommodation strategy includes a commitment to develop more all-women provision within the approved premises estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.6/4">It is encouraging to note that after a decade in which the female prison population grew by almost 200 per cent the current total is broadly the same as it was this time last year.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">The Prison Service recognises the importance of promoting and facilitating the maintenance of close and meaningful contact between prisoners and their family and friends. This may be achieved by social visits, by telephone or written correspondence.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">A number of establishments are improving the environment for social visits, within the constraints of prison security. An increasing number offer extended or family visits that focus on improving the relationship between imprisoned parent and child.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/3">The Prison Service also recognises the difficulties of maintaining marriages and other relationships. It has constructive partnerships with organisations that have experts in the delivery of programmes in this area, such as Relate.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/4">The Prison Service is continuing to look critically at how the current booking systems for visits operate, as well as looking at how new or existing technology can be used to improve the position. Some establishments already offer alternatives to booking by telephone, such as the prisoner booking the visit or the visitor booking a future visit while at the establishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/5">Several establishments are working with voluntary organisations or transport companies to try to ease the burden of travel for visitors. A number of improvements have recently been made to the Prison Service's Assisted Prison Visits Scheme, which provides financial assistance with travel costs for those visitors who are on low income. Changes include permitting grandparents to be classed as close relatives, increases in the tax credit household income threshold, and an increase in the overnight accommodation rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/1">In January 2003, the Prison Service wrote to all Prison Service area managers disseminating principles of good practice which could be applied to the arrangements for booking social visits. An update will be issued to governors early next year and it remains a matter for each governor to determine to what extent the recommendations can be applied to augment existing local practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">Good Practice Guidelines for Visitors' Centres were published in 1998 and most of the content remains relevant. However, to complement that document the Prison Service commissioned &quot;Recognising Quality&quot;, a self-evaluation and reference toolkit for visitors' centres, to be used in conjunction with the guidelines. &quot;Recognising Quality&quot; was launched at a Prison Service sponsored conference in April 2003, which specifically focused on visitors' centres. This was also a good opportunity for those directly involved with the management of visitors' centres to share and report to other delegates individual examples of good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/3">The maximum response time for telephone callers to book a social visit is not prescribed centrally as it would not be practicable to do so. I would draw the noble Earl's attention to the fact that an increasing number of establishments offer alternative methods of booking. It is hoped that these and other measures will ease the burden on booking lines.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.5/1">It is not a mandatory requirement for Prison Service establishments in England and Wales to involve family members and next-of kin in sentence planning for adult offenders, nor in arrangements for their resettlement. However, some establishments do involve families where the offender wishes it, and where resources and other practicalities allow.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/2">For offenders under the age of 18, and all those sentenced to the detention and training order, governors are required to ensure that, where appropriate, families are given the opportunity to contribute to the sentence planning process throughout the custodial part of their sentence.</p>

The United Kingdom is therefore involved in Galileo both as a member of the European Union, and as a participating state in the European Space Agency programme. We have taken a leading role through expert involvement in technical committees and as one of the four countries with the equal largest shares in the financial contributions to the European Space Agency's element of the programme. As a result, companies in the United Kingdom have benefited from the award of contracts including the construction of the first test satellites for the programme. We are also committed to the development of new applications for satellite navigation that will make use of the enhanced performance that will be available when Galileo is operational.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.0/1">The Road Haulage Modernisation Fund (April 2001 to March 2004) supported two efficiency projects. One was a driver training programme to train drivers and instructors in safe and fuel efficient driving (SAFED). The second was a fuel economy adviser programme to provide advice to hauliers on how to apply best practice in fuel-efficient operations. Average fuel savings recorded by participants in these schemes were 9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Both projects have been extended by a further year to the end of this financial year.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-10-12a.57.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="57"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo041012/text/41012w03.htm#41012w03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.57.3/1">(a) No analysis has been carried out to assess any additional damage to road pavement and structures since the introduction of 44-tonne vehicles. However, the UK design and assessment loading standards for highway structures cover the effects of 40-tonne EU vehicles that were allowed on UK roads from <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase>. Extensive research has shown that road pavement damage is strongly influenced by axle load; for an individual axle mass of 10.5 tonnes, there is approximately 40 per cent less road wear than for an axle mass of 11.5 tonnes. Hence, 44-tonne vehicles operating with six axles of 10.5 tonne axle mass limit cause less road wear than 40-tonne vehicles operating with five axles of 11.5 tonne axle mass limit. Therefore 44-tonne vehicles do not impose greater load effects than other permitted vehicles and so should not cause additional damage to highway structures or road pavements.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.3/2">(b) No specific programme of monitoring or analysis of the economic consequences on rail freight of the general move to 44-tonne vehicles has been undertaken. Initially, 44-tonne vehicles were limited to combined road-rail freight. However, market studies and forecasting exercises undertaken before the introduction of 44-tonne vehicles indicated that the main effect on rail freight markets would be increased pressure on prices and rail operators' margins, rather than a major shift of freight from road to rail transport. Since 44-tonne vehicles were introduced into general road freight, the payload advantages that accompanied the combined road/rail freight limitations have ceased. However, the overall competitive position of rail freight has been affected by influences wider than the introduction of 44-tonne vehicles into general road freight.</p>
