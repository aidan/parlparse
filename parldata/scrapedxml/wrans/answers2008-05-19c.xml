	<p pid="c.4W.3/1">Diversity and equality were key components of the bid for London 2012. Although it is a private company which funds itself from sales of sponsorship, merchandise, ticketing and broadcasting rights, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) nevertheless recognises its high-profile position within the overall London 2012 project. It has implemented a strong diversity and inclusion policy on its recruitment and retention of staff and volunteers that covers gender, race, disability, sexual orientation, religion and age. Five of the 11 members of LOCOG's Management Committee, as published on its website, are women.</p>
	<p pid="c.4W.3/2">LOCOG will shortly publish its Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and will send a copy of this to the House of Commons Library. LOCOG will regularly monitor and report on its performance against the Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.</p>

CompeteFor is a key component of this matching buyers with suppliers, and throughout this process businesses are signposted to business support services. The ODA has visited every nation and region of the UK to engage businesses in the opportunities generated by the Games.

	<p pid="c.7W.3/1">All service personnel are paid to their nominated bank accounts through the joint personnel administration (JPA) system whether posted within the UK, overseas or on operations. Recruits provide their bank details on arrival at their initial training or reservists&#146; units and payments to banks normally commence within three months of enlistment. Thereafter, it is the responsibility of the individual service person to maintain their bank details on the JPA system, including initiating, through their human resource administration staff, payments to overseas bank accounts, when posted overseas. The JPA system also has the capacity to make payments by payable order and for unit administration staff, when required, to make payments in cash.</p>

For each of the offshore Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) subject to consultation in 2007-08, JNCC prepared draft documents to the best of its existing knowledge, in consultation with various Government Departments and agencies who hold such information.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/2">JNCC intends to update its conservation objectives and advice on operations taking into account additional information received during the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/3">The following summarises all the information relating to fishing activity, which is available for each site in JNCC's draft conservation objectives and advice on Operations for each possible site:</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/4" class="italic"> Braemar Pockmarks</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/5">Information for 12 months (ending July 2007) from the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency's (SFPA) Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) database indicates that there is currently significant fishing activity within the proposed boundary of this site. A 2006 survey of the site by an energy supply company also identifies that there is significant trawling in the site. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) report that fishing in this area will include Nephrops trawling, seine netting, single boat demersal trawling, pair trawling and both single boat pelagic and pair pelagic trawling. SFF also indicate the data show that herring followed by haddock are the most important species with significant quantities of cod, monkfish, saithe and whiting. SFPA suggest it may be impossible to construct quantities data given the small size of the area.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/6" class="italic"> Scanner Pockmark</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/7">Information for 12 months ending July 2007 from the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency's (SFPA) Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) database indicates that there is currently little fishing activity within the proposed boundary of this site. It is possible that this is because there is an obstruction in the area and this is under investigation. SFPA report that fishing in this area will generally be Nephrops (Norway lobster or &#145;scampi&#146;) trawling by Scottish vessels. There is also some Danish industrial fishing of pout and sand eel, and some pelagic UK, Danish and Swedish vessels targeting mackerel and herring. The SFF indicate that data show that there has been only one day of pelagic fishing in the past three years in the statistical square that the area lies in and that there is a significant number of days by vessels targeting whitefish using single boat demersal gear and demersal pair trawl. SFPA suggest it may be impossible to construct quantities data given the small size of the area.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/8" class="italic"> North Norfolk Sandbanks and Saturn Reef</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/9">This area is heavily commercially fished with mixed demersal fisheries and shellfisheries. The majority of beam trawlers are Dutch and Belgian operating around the banks and targeting sole, plaice and possibly cod, skate and rays. There are also some UK beam trawls and UK vessels using static fishing gear. There may be an occasional UK trawler operating in the area. While the area was popular with Grimsby based trawlers many years ago, the decline in that sector has meant that there has been little recorded activity by them in recent times. French stern trawlers work the area for whiting at certain times of the year (according to French fishing industry information).</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/10">Vessels targeting shellfish which are based on the coast from Caister to Weybourne, including the Cromer/Sheringham crab and lobster fleet, tend to work fairly close inshore and operate mainly on the inner sandbanks. However some of these vessels will venture further off shore. Wells based potting vessels in North Norfolk are more likely to operate further offshore and in the proposed SAC area. The offshore potters based in Grimsby, Bridlington and Scarborough are active throughout the general area. Some five UK long-liners can work the area, principally for cod, skate and dogfish, though the numbers have declined in recent years, with some of the vessels now concentrating on survey and guardship duties. Data from the Marine Fisheries Agency's Fishery Activity Database (FAD) show that the value of landings of fish caught within the boundary of the proposed site, in England by UK vessels, is &#163;841,000 from beam trawls and &#163;68,000 from other demersal towed gear.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/11" class="italic"> Haig Fras</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/12">Fishing is known to take place within the site. Information from the Marine Fisheries Agency (MFA) indicates that the area is commercially fished in relation to mixed demersal fisheries, including hake and that there are the following activities:</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/13" class="indent">Netters: Haig Fras is well within range of the netting fleet based at Newlyn. The area is fished by all of the western based static gear netting vessels (12 in number) and all are members of the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO). In some cases these vessels are believed to work directly on top of the proposed SAC area. French netters also appear to work in or near Haig Fras at times.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/14" class="indent">Beam trawlers: There are a number of Newlyn based beam trawlers, probably less than 10, that work around this general area and possibly within part of the proposed SAC site at times. There may be some Belgium and Irish activity here as well, at certain times of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/15" class="indent">Demersal trawlers: French stern trawlers fish quite widely in the general area around and possibly within Haig Fras for nephrops and demersal species (according to French fishing industry information). A couple of Anglo-Spanish trawlers may also work the area.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/16" class="indent">Long-liners: A couple of Anglo-Spanish vessels are known to work in the general area.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/17" class="indent">Data on UK landings in England from the Marine and Fisheries Agency show that the value of demersal fishing to UK vessels is about &#163;230,000. There is also known to be French and Irish demersal trawling.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/18" class="italic"> Stanton Banks</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/19">Information for 12 months ending July 2007 from the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency's (SFPA) Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) database indicates that there is currently significant fishing activity within the proposed boundary of this site, particularly to the north-west of the site. SFPA report that it is fished heavily by vessels based in west coast of Scotland. The site tends to be a seasonal fishery because of weather and as such provides a good fishing area for larger boats during summer months. The effort is nearly all demersal trawling. The main species targeted are Nephrops (Norway lobster or &#145;scampi&#146;), haddock, hake and monkfish as well as various other species. The West of Scotland Fish Producers Organisation note that their vessels target nephrops and take by-catches of monk, megrim whiting, haddock and hake suing bottom trawls. In addition there is seasonal pelagic boat activity and significant crab fishing. Irish vessels (using both pelagic and demersal gear) also operate in this area; indeed part of the proposed site lies in Irish grey zone where UK-and Irish-claimed fishing limits overlap and there is an agreed system for enforcement. SFPA report that the industry are aware of coral in the area, and that fishermen make an effort to steer clear of it as it damages their nets.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/20" class="italic"> Darwin Mounds</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/21">Mobile demersal gear is known to cause an impact to the reefs and has therefore been banned over the reef under the common fisheries policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/22" class="italic"> Wyville Thomson Ridge</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.2/23">Information for 12 months ending July 2007 from the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency's (SFPA) Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) database indicates that there is currently significant fishing activity in the area. Generally the target species for demersal trawling are blueing, ling, greater fork beard and other associated deep sea species. These are targeted mostly by French (according to French fishing industry information), some UK (Scottish) vessels and possibly Spanish vessels. Given the areas rocky nature, it will generally be larger vessels. French pelagic trawlers also operate in this area. Because this site is adjacent to the recently agreed UK-Faeroese Median Line (S.I. 1999 No. 2031) there remains confusion as to the precise UK/Faeroese fishing limits in practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.15W.3/1">Of the 12 species originally proposed by the JNCC for listing on Schedule 4, nine are non-EU species. Animal Health has issued CITES permits for six species (red-browed amazon, red-tailed amazon, hyacinth macaw, blue-throated macaw, red vented/Philippine cockatoo and Bali starling) in the last 10 years, indicating that these species have been kept in captivity in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.15W.3/2">The EU ban on wild bird imports has meant that, other than birds imported for conservation programmes, only captive-bred birds from approved breeding establishments have been permitted for import into the EU. Any import of wild non-EU birds would be contrary to the ban and CITES regulations. I consider that these regulations maintain a satisfactory level of control on any trade in the nine species, and there is no evidence to suggest that these controls do not work.</p>
	<p pid="c.15W.3/3">I do not consider that the listing of the nine non-EU species on Schedule 4 in England would have any effect on any illegal take of these species that may occur from the wild in third countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.15W.6/1">My Department has no plans to carry out DNA testing on all birds that may be removed from schedule 4. The Department has no evidence to suggest that the population of birds currently listed on schedule 4 is other than from primarily legitimate sources. The cost of DNA testing the whole captive population would be prohibitively expensive and would not be justified by any possible enforcement or conservation benefit. Any DNA testing to be carried out by Animal Health will be based on a risk and intelligence-led approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.15W.6/2">Modern breeding techniques use artificial insemination from a variety of possible male donors. The movement, and death of many of the birds involved in this process means that any comprehensive testing scheme for all birds subject to registration would simply not be logistically possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.16W.2/1">The prohibition on the import of wild birds into the EU was extended in July 2007 and with this prohibition likely to remain in force for the foreseeable future, the situation in the commercial trade of wild birds has changed. My Department therefore revised the criteria for the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) assessment of species to be listed on schedule 4. The list of species provided by the JNCC was considered in terms of the proportionality of the burden that registration of these species would place on keepers, balancing any conservation benefit that may arise from registration against the regulatory burden imposed by registration.</p>

	<p pid="c.21W.2/2">Around 800,000 adults aged 22 and over are receiving the October 2007 national minimum wage<sup>(l)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.2/3">For people receiving the national minimum wage who remain with the same employer for the whole year<sup>(2)</sup> it is estimated that around a quarter are earning less than &#163;2,800 gross annual pay, about half earn less than &#163;5,400 per annum and around three-quarters earn less than &#163;9,100 per annum.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.2/4">The vast majority of those receiving the national minimum wage and earning less than the median of &#163;5,400 per annum are part-time employees. There will also be some people earning above the national minimum wage who earn less than &#163;5,400 per year (and are not included above) because they do not work many hours during a week or during the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.2/5" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> BERR has arrived at this estimate by deflating the October 2007 national minimum wage for adults (&#163;5.52 per hour) by average earnings growth between April 2007 and October 2007. This deflated rate is equivalent to &#163;5.40 per hour. Using April 2007 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings data around 800,000 individuals earn less than or equal to &#163;5.40 per hour in the survey reference week.</p>
	<p pid="c.21W.2/6" class="indent"><sup>(2)</sup> Data on annual gross pay is only collected in the Annual Survey of Hours for employees who have worked with the same employer for a period of at least 12 months.

In the case of its trade services, results for FY 2007-08 show that UKTI helped 15,900 UK companies to exploit overseas business opportunities. The total estimated additional bottom line profit for these businesses, generated by UKTI services, was &#163;3 billion. In the case of inward investment, we expect the outturn result for the year to be close to the 525 target for foreign direct investment projects which UKTI has successfully facilitated, and significantly to have exceeded the target for 125 of those projects to be of high value.</p>

	<p pid="c.24W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-07">7 May 2008</phrase>, we launched the Driving Standards Agency&#146;s Learning to Drive consultation, which sets out proposals for the reform of driver education, training and testing. The reforms will better prepare newly qualified drivers for modern driving conditions and help reduce collisions and casualties:</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/2">Key elements in our proposals are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/3"><i> A new pre driver foundation qualification in safe road use</i>, with a course piloted in schools and colleges in Scotland from this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/4"><i> More thorough and effective learning to drive arrangements</i> underpinned by a new learning to drive syllabus setting out the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to be a safe and competent driver. This will be supported by a student workbook. We are trialling new ways for people to develop safe attitudes including an attitude advisor, which can assess driver&#146;s approach to risk and help guide training programs. We shall be investigating new ways of learning and training, including driver discussion groups, as well as improved in-car training arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/5"><i> Improved driving tests.</i> We are investigating changes to both our theory and practical tests to ensure drivers meet the standards we require before qualifying for a full licence.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/6">We are researching our theory test so it provides a better assessment of understanding, perhaps by using case studies. We shall research possible changes to the Hazard Perception Test to improve its safety effects. We have sought views on whether we should continue to publish the theory test question bank.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/7">We are trialling possible changes to the practical test so that it provides a better guide to whether a learner has reached the standard to drive unsupervised. These changes include introducing independent driving, situational judgment, changes to the way specific manoeuvres are tested and switching from a fault based marking system to one that focuses on positive evidence on competence.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/8">We are investigating improved feedback arrangements for all our tests. We are also looking at splitting the theory and practical tests into modules, to enable learners to pass elements as they are ready.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/9"><i> New opportunities to take further training and qualifications.</i> We shall work with the insurance industry and employers whose employees drive in the course of their work to develop new courses and qualifications that they value, leading to lower insurance premiums and improved job prospects.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/10"><i> Star ratings for driving instructors</i> so that learners can make an informed choice about the driver training services on offer and which are suitable for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/11"><i> Improved training and testing arrangements for driving instructors,</i> both when they qualify initially and subsequently, to ensure they are well placed to provide a quality service in the new environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.5/12">Copies of the consultation paper are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.26W.0/2">The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) currently operates a network of 425 driving test centres throughout Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="c.26W.0/3">To facilitate the introduction of new European requirements for practical tests, alongside its existing estate DSA is developing a new national network of driving test centres. These centres, which are based on an updated design, are fully compliant with the Disability Discrimination Act and also support the Government's wider sustainability agenda.</p>
	<p pid="c.26W.0/4">In order to exploit the value of the investment in these new centres DSA have decided that, wherever possible, they will be multi-purpose test centres (MPTCs). The new centres will have appropriate facilities to conduct practical tests for learner car drivers and motorcyclists. In some cases, there will also be provision for lorry driver tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.26W.0/5">As an organisation which relies on test fee income for the provision of its services DSA needs to ensure that it can deliver a cost-effective service which avoids unnecessary expenditure. The provision of MPTCs is expected to cost in the region of &#163;71 million. That cost will largely be recovered through increased fees paid by test candidates.</p>
	<p pid="c.26W.0/6">In order to keep those fee increases to the minimum, DSA must closely examine how it delivers its services and seek more efficiencies in the way it conducts its business. This includes reviewing existing driving test centre provision to ensure that, while the service standard is maintained, there is no wasteful over-provision of facilities. Regrettably this does mean that some existing driving test centres have to close.</p>
	<p pid="c.26W.0/7">Since 1997 the following driving test centres in England have been closed:</p>

This was achieved by using a combination of well-rehearsed internal contingency measures (such as employing existing technology to &#145;pair&#146; rescue co-ordination centres, where necessary), redeploying experienced managers, establishing a national strategic support centre and co-ordinating closely with other search and rescue operators.

	<p pid="c.34W.5/1">Responsibility for issuing the concessionary travel passes rests with travel concession authorities, as it has done since 2000. When we made the decision last September to require the new concessionary travel passes to be in smartcard form we recognised this was a challenging requirement in the time available. This is why we put in place contingency arrangements, including allowing existing local passes to remain valid in the local area until <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September</phrase>, and providing authorities with temporary passes for people who wished to travel outside their local area.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.5/2">Local authorities were advised to order sufficient temporary passes to ensure that anyone who was eligible for the England-wide concession was able to take advantage of it from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase> even if they had not received their smartcard pass by then.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.5/3">In fact, most local authorities and their suppliers were able to produce passes in time for the start of the concession. By <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase>, 95 per cent. of the anticipated passes had been produced. Unfortunately, while they had managed to produce the passes on time, we are aware that some suppliers experienced last minute problems in dispatching those passes to eligible people. Despite this, we estimate that around 4.8 million passes were dispatched by <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.42W.2/1">The recent review of the fire safety aspects of the building regulations looked at the case for sprinklers in warehouses. We undertook supporting research on the issue and a full public consultation. Following consultation, it was decided that a limit for the maximum unsprinklered compartment size for single storey warehouses should be set at 20,000m<sup>(2)</sup> and/or a height of 18m where previously no such limit existed. This new maximum compartment size was included in the 2006 edition of Approved Document B which came into effect in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.42W.2/2">Since then we have had a number of representations suggesting that this maximum compartment size should be reduced such that smaller warehouse buildings would also be provided with sprinkler protection. However, we have no plans to revisit this part of the building regulations in the near future.</p>

Local authorities will negotiate with individual lenders on a case by case basis where repossession is threatened. We are also working with local authorities to ensure that Court Desk sendees are available to people facing repossession action so that they have legal representation on the day. These areas of work are covered in &#147;Preventing Homelessness: A Strategy Health Check&#148; which we published in September 2006 as a toolkit for local authorities, and continue to use in our work to support local authorities in implementing their local homelessness strategies.</p>

The Housing Green Paper made clear that the housing numbers in existing and in some cases emerging plans were not high enough to address the pressing problem of long-term housing need and affordability. We are therefore aiming to complete a further set of Regional Spatial Strategy partial reviews by 2011 that will include revised housing numbers for local planning authorities that are consistent with our national aim to deliver 240,000 homes per year by 2016.</p>

	<p pid="c.55W.5/2">The promotion of Britain in the context of the 2012 Games involves a number of Government Departments and other organisations, working in partnership with the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. This includes DCMS, the FCO, DBERR, and the British Council. It includes a wide range of events such as the British presence at the Beijing Games, and other activities and programmes by UK organisations and networks at home and overseas.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.5/3">Part of the grants available by DCMS to VisitBritain and the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) will support Games-related tourism marketing and promotion over the period 2008-12.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.5/4">VisitBritain will receive &#163;133.3 million over the next three years for its work in international and domestic matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.5/5">The RDAs outside London spent &#163;29.8 million on tourism support in 2006-07, of which &#163;3.6 million was from DCMS. They will receive &#163;10.2 million from DCMS in the next three years. The London Development Agency spent &#163;22 million on tourism support in 2006-07, of which &#163;1.9 million was from DCMS, via the Greater London Authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.5/6">The strategic context for tourism marketing and promotion was set out in the DCMS Tourism Strategy for the 2012 Games, which was published last September. VisitBritain is presently preparing the details of the operational tourism marketing plan for the Games, but other organisations will also play their part in ensuring a successful boost to tourism from hosting the Olympic Games.</p>

In addition, any individual may also make an objection to the ERO about another person&#146;s registration details at any time.

	<p pid="c.64W.3/1">The use of computerised personal information in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998. The Information Commissioner administers and enforces the Act independently of the Government. His office produces advice for individuals about their rights and guidance for organisations on how to comply with the Act when using personal information and websites. For example, in January 2007 the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office published a Personal Information Toolkit for the general public; in June 2007 it produced guidance to data controllers about collecting personal information on the internet and in November 2007 it launched a new website to provide tips and advice on safe social networking and to help young people protect their personal information.</p>

The Data Sharing Review, being conducted by the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, and Dr. Mark Walport, will publish its report in the first half of 2008. The impact of technology was one of the issues covered by the review&#146;s consultation paper and we look forward to seeing the final report. More generally, the Government and the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office keep legislation under review in light of ever-increasing technological changes in the field of data protection.</p>

The Government are keen to ensure that the electoral process is accessible to all electors. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 extends the duty placed on local authorities to review polling places to ensure that, as far as is reasonable and practicable, they are convenient and accessible for electors. Under the Act, local authorities must carry out a full review of polling places at least every four years, and representations can be made to the Electoral Commission in respect of reviews carried out by local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.72W.5/1">A request was received in November 2005 before the exhumation and reburial of the remains of Mr. Kelly. The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Custodial Property Estates Section agreed to meet the reasonable costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/2">Following the exhumation and reburial of the remains of Mr. Kelly, NOMS received in May 2006 invoices for the funeral directors and other services relating to the exhumation and reburial. These were settled the same month by final payment made to the solicitors who had requested the exhumation and reburial. There were two remaining claims for costs in respect of which requests for interim payments were made. The first claim related to the role of a person asked by the same solicitors to make the arrangements for the exhumation and reburial. However, no breakdown of the costs was supplied with the claim and as, despite several requests, such a breakdown was not provided no interim payment could be made. The information was eventually provided and the amount payable agreed and paid. The second claim related to the services of a psychologist. Following a meeting in August 2006 an offer to settle the claim was made that month but there was a delay in a formal response. NOMS is endeavouring to seek to settle this account appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/3">In November 2005, following an approach by solicitors about the exhumation and reburial of the remains of Mr. Kelly, the then Department of Constitutional Affairs contacted the head of NOMS Custodial Property Estates section who agreed to meet the reasonable costs of the exhumation and reburial. Invoices submitted by those solicitors for the funeral directors and other services relating to the exhumation and reburial were agreed and paid in May 2006. The claim for costs for the role of the person asked by the same solicitors to arrange the exhumation and reburial was agreed with the solicitors and paid in January 2008. The claim made by the solicitors for the services of a psychologist has yet to be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/4">The staff in Custodial Property Estates section dealing with estate management matters are professionally trained surveyors experienced in dealing with members of the public and all aspects relating to contracts which include alternative dispute resolution. If any specific training need were to be identified appropriate training would be arranged.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/5">The car parking area has been in use for a considerable number of years and to search for the information about decisions, as requested, could only be undertaken at disproportionate cost, if such information is still in existence. The brick paving and sand base over the graves can be removed to facilitate exhumation of remains.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/6">In cases where it is proposed to erect a building on land where there are graves it is normal practice for the remains to be exhumed and reburied away from the site. Such buildings are subject to the building regulations in the same way as other new prison buildings. The Coroners&#146; Office has previously advised that there is no legislation or rules relating to burials preventing the use of such areas for car parking.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.5/7">Alternative dispute resolution and other such processes in relation to two claims in respect of costs relating to the exhumation and reburial of the remains of Mr. Kelly was raised in August 2006 by the solicitors who had requested the exhumation and reburial. With regard to the first claim from the person engaged by those solicitors to make the arrangements for the exhumation and reburial, in September 2006 that person served a claim against the solicitors who then served a claim against NOMS. The claim was resolved out of court. The second claim relates to the services of a psychologist. The NOMS Custodial Property Estates Section is endeavouring to resolve this matter without the need for a process such as the alternative dispute resolution as the sum in dispute is some &#163;1,500.</p>

	<p pid="c.73W.3/1">We are aware of the difficult situation many women in Afghanistan still face. Our Embassy officials in Kabul regularly discuss women&#146;s rights with members of the Afghan Government, non-governmental organisations and parliamentarians, highlighting their importance.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.3/2">The Government work to enhance the status of women in three main ways: through policy engagement with the Afghan Government; through support for national programmes and services, which benefit women; and through bilateral programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.3/3">Despite the challenges, progress has been made. Over a third of children now in school are girls. We have committed over &#163;35 million to support the Afghan government&#146;s micro-finance programme, giving women in particular better access to finance. 27 per cent. of seats in the Lower House of the Afghan Parliament are now held by women&#151;more than in the House of Commons, which is around 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.3/4">Our major support is channelled through the Afghan government, since gender inequality is a deeply embedded and long-term problem which needs a strategic approach. We have worked, for example, with the government to ensure that gender equality is integrated into the Afghanistan National Development Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.3/5">We are also giving &#163;500,000 to support a five-year Women&#146;s Empowerment programme (2005-10), implemented by the non-governmental organisation, Womankind. The programme focuses on promoting women&#146;s equal participation in governance, building awareness of women&#146;s rights among civil society and policy makers, and on providing educational, health, community and psycho-social support to women affected by violence and conflict.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.3/6">We funded the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, with &#163;500,000, to implement its three-year Action Plan (2006-08). A large part of the Commission's work focuses on women&#146;s rights, including documenting and tackling violence against women. In addition we have funded a non-governmental organisation, Global Rights, to produce a detailed report on domestic abuse in Afghanistan, due to be published shortly.</p>

We have, as chair of the UN Security Council, called for action by Burma to work with the UN and international donors and expedite access. We are pressing regional powers such as Thailand, China, India and Indonesia at senior political and official level to use their influence on Burma to accept unfettered international assistance. We have said that we would use whatever delivery mechanism they are able to negotiate with the Burmese and channel our relief effort through them.

	<p pid="c.77W.8/1">The UN Human Rights Council (HRC) is now fully up and running after an institution building phase begun in 2006. Achieving UK human rights priorities remains difficult with the majority of members wishing to prevent the body effectively tackling country specific problems. However, the HRC has, largely through UK/EU action, taken some encouraging steps, including special sessions on Burma and Darfur and discussions of a wide range of country specific situations during open session. These sessions are webcast and open to non-governmental organisations and interest groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.8/2">The introduction of the HRC&#146;s Universal Periodic Review marks the first time that every UN member&#146;s human rights record will be systematically examined. The UK was one of the first countries to be examined in April. We used this opportunity to provide a model for engagement that we encourage others to follow, including by addressing the challenges we face.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.8/3">The UK remains committed to seeing complementary action on human rights in other parts of the UN, in particular through the General Assembly&#146;s Third Committee. We will continue to resist those who argue that human rights are only a matter for the HRC in Geneva. They must be promoted in all parts of the UN.</p>
	<p pid="c.77W.8/4">We continue to see the HRC as a body that can deliver valuable results in human rights on the ground. It will take time and effort to realise this aim. The UK is ready to engage fully to see the Council increasingly fulfil its potential.</p>

	<p pid="c.78W.5/2">The UN is responsible for tackling any individual allegations of misconduct with troop contributing countries. We have therefore not raised this with Governments, but we do pursue the issue with the UN. The UK played a key role in the 2006 negotiations that established a model Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the UN and troop contributing countries, which lays out the actions that will be taken if any troops fall short of prescribed standards of conduct. We were also involved in negotiations last year which made the MoU more robust. We support the UN Secretary-General&#146;s &#145;zero-tolerance&#146; policy towards sexual exploitation and abuse by UN personnel and we press for language supporting that policy, and call for troop contributing countries to take appropriate preventative action, to be included in all UN Security Council resolutions on peacekeeping missions.

	<p pid="c.79W.2/1">It is critical that UN peacekeepers uphold the highest human rights standards. Troop and police contributing countries, with UN support, are responsible for training their peacekeepers appropriately. Government officials regularly discuss with the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) how to improve its training, including in human rights. The Government supports DPKO's training programmes with funding.</p>

	<p pid="c.80W.0/1">Improving the effectiveness of the UN in tackling conflict is a key objective, as set out in recent speeches by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. The UK believes that UN peacekeepers play a vital role. The Government work closely with the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), including financial support from our Department's Conflict Prevention Pool on capacity building projects. In 2007-08 the UK provided over &#163;4 million to support the training of peacekeepers.</p>
	<p pid="c.80W.0/2">The UK supports DPKO's proposed rapid deployment model&#151;the Enhanced Rapidly Deployable Capacities. The critical rapid deployment capacity, for UN or other operations, will remain with nation states and regional organisations. The UK is working with international partners to develop this capacity, for example with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's Response Force, the EU Battlegroup Concept and the African Union's Standby Force. The UK makes a very significant contribution, including rapidly deployable capacities, to UN-mandated operations in the Balkans and Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="c.82W.9/1">Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are a requirement for countries to receive concessional assistance from the World Bank (through the International Development Association&#151;IDA) and the IMF (through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility&#151;PRGF). In addition they are the basis for the provision of debt relief under the enhanced HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) Initiative. The World Bank reports that PRSPs are on the agenda of about 70 low-income countries. The World Bank website (<a href="http://www.worldbank.org">www.worldbank.org</a>) publishes 66 PRSPs. It would incur disproportionate expense to answer the question in full by identifying which of these include human-rights based benchmarks.</p>

	<p pid="c.86W.2/1">Borrowers domiciled in England and Wales whose loans have been written off&#151;mainly on statutory grounds of age, death and disability&#151;are at Table 1. Of 2.5 million loans at the end of 2006/07, the numbers of loans written off during that year represented around 0.1 per cent. of the total.</p>

	<p pid="c.86W.2/3" class="indent">Upon the death of the borrower, or if the borrower is in receipt of a disability related benefit and permanently unable to work;</p>
	<p pid="c.86W.2/4" class="indent">On age grounds. MS loans with no arrears are written off when the borrower reaches the age of 50 (or 60 if the borrower was aged over 40 when he/she last borrowed). ICR loans issued before 2006/07 are written off at age 65;</p>
	<p pid="c.86W.2/5" class="indent">For ICR loans issued after 2006/07, 25 years after students become liable to repay their loan.</p>

	<p pid="c.93W.2/1">Decisions on fuel duty are made as part of the Budget process. Government policy are that fuel duty should increase each year at least in line with inflation, as the UK seeks to reduce polluting emissions from fossil fuels, and fund public services.</p>
	<p pid="c.93W.2/2">The Chancellor considers a range of factors when deciding rates of fuel duty, including social, environmental and economic costs. Budget 2007 therefore announced that main road fuel duty would rise by 2p per litre in 2008. However, in order to respond to short-term economic conditions, at Budget 2008, it was announced that this duty increase would be deferred to <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.93W.5/1">The Bank of England does not regulate banks. The Financial Services Authority supervises financial services activities in the UK under the powers granted to it in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.93W.5/2">It is the responsibility of banks to publish annual reports that provide a true and fair view of their financial position. For listed companies, the accounting treatment for measurement and disclosure of losses in companies' annual reports, including any in relation to exposure to sub-prime, is governed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the EU. Most UK banks have <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December</phrase> year-ends and will have included in their annual reports for 2007 their losses as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase>. Under IFRS, there is no specific obligation for companies to disclose separately any losses from exposure to the sub-prime market, though many banks did provide such additional disclosures in their 2007 annual reports, reflecting the materiality of the disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="c.93W.5/3">Any company which has its shares listed on the London Stock Exchange also has a continuing obligation to provide adequate information to the market in a timely manner in order that investors can make informed decisions.

With the deterioration in market conditions in relation to sub-prime since <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase>, in particular in March 2008, banks, where they consider it relevant, have disclosed additional losses they have incurred in 2008 in relation to their sub-prime exposure, in accordance with these requirements.</p>

	<p pid="c.97W.2/1">The Government are committed to combating tax evasion and avoidance and is working closely with EU and OECD partners to tackle the problem. Tax havens are characterised by banking secrecy and a lack of cooperation for tax compliance purposes. A key objective therefore is to increase transparency and exchange of information. The EU savings directive and the associated agreements with non-EU countries and territories play an important part in this. The current review of the directive is an opportunity to pursue our objective. Within the OECD there is a renewed determination to push forward the process of negotiating tax information exchange agreements with offshore jurisdictions. We urge all countries, including tax havens, to meet OECD transparency standards.</p>

	<p pid="c.109W.0/1">UKBA recently piloted the use of a short-term holding facility at small south coast sea ports, primarily Poole. During this period, the merit of using this type of facility for both pre-planned operations and to apprehend illegal immigrants was considered. A version of this vehicle, informed by the earlier pilot but with a different specification is currently being developed to meet the needs of our enforcement teams. UKBA is on track to pilot the new vehicle during autumn 2008 in the Northampton area. Funding for this trial will be from within existing resources and is commercial in confidence.</p>

	<p pid="c.109W.6/2">We have made it perfectly clear that our objective is that foreign national prisoners should face deportation when they meet the relevant criteria and that deportation should happen as early as possible in their sentence. Over 4,200 foreign national prisoners have been removed or deported from the UK in 2007. This means that the UK Border Agency has removed over 80 per cent. more foreign national prisoners than in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.109W.6/3">From this summer the agency will begin commencement of the automatic deportation provisions contained in the UK Borders Act 2007. The Act places a duty on the Secretary of State to make a deportation order in respect of a non-European economic area national who has been sentenced to either a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months or a period of imprisonment of any length for a particularly serious offence, as listed under section 72 of the Nationality and Asylum Act, 2002). The provisions enable the agency to speed up the removals process by ensuring that unless the foreign criminal has an arguable asylum or human rights claim, they will only have a right of appeal from outside the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.112W.0/2">Working holidaymakers will remain able to switch in country into the Innovator or Businesspersons categories until those categories are closed down at the end of the summer, and those eligible under the current immigration rules to switch into employment in shortage occupations will be able to do so until the work permits provisions are closed down in the autumn. Since under the PBS it will not be possible to switch from Tier 5: youth mobility into Tier 1: highly skilled migrants, we announced, in anticipation of that, there would be no switching from the WHS into Tier 1 in our Statement of Intent, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase>. Working holidaymakers who wish to work in the UK as highly skilled migrants therefore need to return to their home country to apply for the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) before it is closes at the end of the summer, or for Tier 1 (General) once HSMP has been closed. There are no figures available for how many working holidaymaker have returned home to apply for HSMP entry clearances.</p>

	<p pid="c.117W.0/1">The Department does not record sickness absence due to stress, but uses a broader category of &#147;mental health, including depression, anxiety and potential stress-related problems&#148;. We do not monitor working days lost by reason each month, but produce information on a rolling year basis. The total number of working days lost for this reason in the calendar year 2007 was 2,097.</p>
	<p pid="c.117W.0/2">The Department has recently improved its internal reporting of sickness absence by reason by drawing information direct from its payroll system. This was in response to concerns that some absences on its human resources system were not being closed properly, leading to absence levels being overestimated. The 2006 figure of 4,305 working days lost is therefore an overestimate and not directly comparable with 2007.</p>

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  3. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics, the Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.123W.5/2">NHS Choices is for, the first time and in one place, bringing together and making easily accessible to patients comparative information on NHS and independent hospitals.

In addition, the website enables patients to have access to the same high quality evidence as doctors about which treatments are most effective.</p>

	<p pid="c.134W.2/2">However, a variation will be allowed only where it is &quot;just and equitable&quot; to do so. Broadly this means that the result of the variation must be fair taking account of all the circumstances of the case, and, in particular, the welfare of any child likely to be affected.

	<p pid="c.135W.2/1">We recently carried out a major review of WORKSTEP, Access to Work, Work Preparation, the Job Introduction Scheme and the Disability Employment Advisor role. We listened to the views of many disabled people, employers, external delivery partners and Jobcentre Plus staff, as well as taking into account the recommendations from the National Audit Office and the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report &#145;Improving Life Chances of Disabled People&#146;. The public consultation, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-10">10 March</phrase>, set out proposals to improve these services to help more disabled people. We will publish a response to the consultation during the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.135W.2/2">In the meantime, we will continue to take steps to raise awareness of the services that can be provided by Disability Employment Advisers. As well as the normal methods of publicity, for example leaflets and the Jobcentre Plus and Directgov websites, Disability Employment Advisers work hard to engage with customer representative organisations and other partners in the community. This is particularly important in increasing access to services for people with learning difficulties. In Edinburgh, for example, the Disability Employment Advisers work closely with organisations that support customers with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.135W.2/3">Jobcentre Plus is often invited to contribute to literature produced by various disability organisations including for example RADAR'S Doing Work Differently, which includes information on Disability Employment Advisers and the specialised support available to disabled people. Jobcentre Plus also contributes articles to publications such as My Future Choices, the magazine of the Transition Information Network, outlining support available and how to get it. Where appropriate, Jobcentre Plus will continue these activities.</p>

	<p pid="c.136W.0/1">A lack of skills and the need for training is only one of a number of barriers faced by people with a learning disability who want to take up paid work.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.0/2">We recognise the importance of working more closely and strategically with our key suppliers in order to help us improve delivery of services to customers, including where programmes provide training to support people with learning disabilities into jobs. Areas for improvement in training will also be driven through our management of contracts as well as Ofsted inspection and audit.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.0/3">Jobcentre Plus offers a range of support to help people move into work. Workstep is designed to support disabled people who have more complex barriers to work, including those with a learning disability. Providers will provide training which is appropriate to enable the disabled employee to do their job. Around one third of Workstep participants have a learning disability. Others are helped by the Access to Work programme through which they can receive a grant to fund a support worker.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.0/4">We are working jointly with other Departments to improve work opportunities for people with a learning disability. The Getting A Life project is specifically aimed at getting the employment, education and local authority day services functions for people with a learning disability to work together in an integrated manner. The main focus is on people going through transition to adulthood.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.0/5">The project is being steered and funded by the Departments for Work and Pensions; Health; Innovation, Universities and Skills; and Children, Schools and Families; with the support of the Social Exclusion Task Force, Valuing People, and the Office for Disability Issues. Demonstration projects are being run in seven sites over a three year period from April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.0/6">In addition, the Government's Public Service Agreement for socially excluded adults is aimed in part, at increasing the number of adults with learning disabilities in employment. To help us achieve this, we are working with local government through the new Local Area Agreements and we are also working with a number of departments to consider what more central Government can do to help this group of people into work.</p>

The SPI is a sample survey of information held by HMRC tax offices on persons who could be liable to UK tax. It is carried out annually and covers the income assessable for tax in each tax year.

	<p pid="c.138W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking how many people in the North West used the out of hours evening service in the last three years and what representations he has received on the decision by North West to discontinue its out of hours evening service. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.138W.0/4" class="indent">Between April 2006 and March 2008 the North West region received 5743 week day evening calls and 2522 resulted in a home visit, the majority of visits resulting in a payment. We do not have complete figures for April 2005 to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.138W.0/5" class="indent">As a result of the enhanced service now offered by The Pension Service in terms of its opening hours and the vastly improved access to Crisis Loans, a national internal review of the out of hours service was undertaken. We have decided that the service should in future operate to provide emergency cash payments only on days when no normal service is available (weekends and public holidays in the main).</p>
	<p pid="c.138W.0/6" class="indent">Under the current arrangements, approximately 15% of the weekly referrals are received between Monday and Thursday resulting in only around 40 visits nationally, compared to 10,000 crisis loan applications we receive per day. Delivering an out of hours service on weekday evenings to such small numbers of customers is not cost effective.</p>
	<p pid="c.138W.0/7" class="indent">Local customer stakeholders were informed in each of the regions in advance of the new arrangements and two representations have been made from organisations in the North West. Local managers have made arrangements with these organisations to discuss the new processes.</p>

That is why we commissioned a rolling deregulatory review to look at how the private pensions regulatory framework can be made simpler and less burdensome. The decline in membership of defined benefit schemes is a long-term trend and is due to a number of complex factors.</p>

	<p pid="c.146W.8/3">Information on the number of pupils with dyslexia alone is not collected centrally. Figures relating to pupils with specific learning difficulties have been provided. Pupils with specific learning difficulties have a particular difficulty in learning to read, write, spell or manipulate numbers and this includes pupils with dyslexia, dyscalculia and dyspraxia.</p>
	<p pid="c.146W.8/4">Tables showing the number of pupils by type of SEN in each local authority area have been placed in the Library. This information has not been analysed below local authority level. It is important that anyone using the data should understand the limitations of the data's reliability and validity. There are a range of factors which may affect the data recorded, including: local interpretation of definitions; classification of children with multiple needs; statistics being based on school and local authority identification of need rather than a diagnosis by medical or psychological staff; and the availability of special school provision in authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.150W.5/2">Last year the Department funded the FSC to support the provision of residential courses for 6,000 key stage 3 pupils from 100 London schools, and to deliver training for teachers to develop effective integration of the residential experience into schools. The FSC have recently developed and trialled a suite of Curriculum Adventure courses targeted at disadvantaged students in underperforming London, Black Country and Manchester schools. The courses focused content on the Mathematics, English and science curricula using the outdoor environment and adventure activities as a stimulus and context for learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.150W.5/3">More widely to support schools to deliver high-quality learning outside the classroom the Department is producing a comprehensive set of &#145;How to&#146; guidance to help with planning; funding, running and publicising learning outside the classroom. A series of continuing professional development modules will underpin this guidance.</p>

This group should have representation from Sport England, County Sports Partnerships, and school sports partnerships to raise the profile of sport within the programme and develop facilities within their area. In addition, Partnerships for Schools, Sport England and the Youth Sports Trust fund &#147;Sports Advisers&#148; to help develop community-use facilities. These Sports Advisers work with the local authority sports stakeholder groups to develop a vision, and support the stakeholder groups to work with schools to achieve it. These advisers also work with Sport England to ensure sports governing bodies can contribute to the developing BSF strategy. The Department also publishes a guide titled &#147;Inspirational Design for PE and Sport Spaces&#148; for all local authorities, to assist in developing their BSF Strategy for Change.</p>
