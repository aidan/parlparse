	<p pid="b.2169W.5/1">In the past few years, we have seen a steady widening of participation in higher education. Performance indicators published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that the proportion of students from non-traditional backgrounds has increased across a range of measures. The proportion from low participation neighbourhoods, for example, rose from 12.1 per cent. to 13.9 per cent. between 1997/98 and 2003/04, the latest year for which figures are available.</p>

	<p pid="b.2172W.5/1">The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector, including adult education, to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The LSC was established in 2001 bringing the planning and funding of post-16 education together under one body.</p>
	<p pid="b.2172W.5/2">In 2001&ndash;02 the Learning and Skills Council spent &pound;2,236 million on adult programmes including FE, Work Based Learning, Adult and Community Learning and other programmes. This increased to &pound;2,427 million in 2002&ndash;03 and to &pound;2,866 million in 2003&ndash;04. These figures are available in the LSC's published accounts. Figures for adult education for the years prior to 2001 are not comparable as the budget was split between a range of different organisations. The Departmental Annual Report sets out total expenditure on Further Education, Adult Training and Skills and Lifelong Learning for this period.</p>
	<p pid="b.2172W.5/3">My Department does not hold funding figures for adult education at the local level. As the allocation of funding in local areas relates to the LSC's operational responsibilities, the LSC's Chief Executive, Mark Haysom, has written to the hon. Member with the information requested. A copy of his reply has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.2177W.5/1">Section 8 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 refers to the design of, and access to, the buildings of educational institutions. Although this Act is still in force, Section 8 has since been superseded by other legislation including the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 (SENDA), The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 and the Building Regulations 2000. The provisions in these later Acts and Regulations are more comprehensive than those in Section 8 of the 1970 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.2177W.5/2">Schools now have a planning duty under Part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to prepare accessibility plans for increasing over time the accessibility of schools for disabled pupils and prospective pupils. This planning duty covers: improving access to the curriculum, the physical environment of schools and provision of written materials in alternative formats, and will lead to access improvements that will have a positive impact on all aspects of school life.</p>
	<p pid="b.2177W.5/3">The Learning and Skills Council monitor the extent to which further education college premises are accessible to disabled learners and, since SENDA was introduced in 2001, it has approved funding to enable colleges to undertake adaptations that will help them comply with the Act. So far over &pound;160 million has been made available. All colleges have made, or are making, adaptations or have plans in hand.

This outlines the requirement to have an up-to-date policy on sex and relationship education available to parents for inspection. The guidance reminds schools to teach children about the nature of marriage and its importance for family life. The guidance also outlines the right of parents to withdraw children from the non-statutory elements of sex education. We have explained the rights of parents in the SRE and Parents leaflet and on the DfES Parents Centre website. Ofsted in its survey Sex and Relationship Education in Schools&quot; (2002) reported that over nine out of 10 schools have a sex and relationship education policy.

	<p pid="b.2181W.8/2">Authorities are expected to consider the appropriate solution for a failing school in the light of the circumstances of the school. Under the White Paper's proposals they are expected to consider closure where a failing school is making inadequate progress after 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.2181W.8/3">However, authorities will retain the responsibility to secure the provision of school places and to promote high standards. Where there is a need for a new school either to replace an existing closing school or to meet population growth, the LA will be able to hold a competition and invite promoters to bring forward proposals for a new school.</p>

	<p pid="b.2182W.2/28" class="indent">You may be aware that a recent independent report by the Learning and Skills Development Agency identified a number of technical anomalies&quot; where the application of the LSC's methodology differs between the school and further education sectors. The report highlighted these anomalies as contributing to the difference in the funding for 16&ndash;18 year old students in school sixth forms and those in sixth form and FE colleges.</p>
	<p pid="b.2182W.2/29" class="indent">The statement on schools' funding made in July 2005 by Jacqui Smith, the Schools Minister, included a programme of work to address the anomalies between school sixth form and college funding. This will be taken forward as part of the LSC's <i>agenda for change</i> programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.2187W.2/1">The White Paper makes clear that it will be for the governing bodies of individual schools to decide whether to become self-governing foundation schools and to acquire trusts, taking account of the views of parents and other stakeholders. The Government have already introduced a fast-track route for community and voluntary controlled secondary schools to acquire self-governing foundation status and have consulted on extending this to primary schools. Schools wishing to acquire trusts will follow similar procedures, with added safeguards where parents have concerns about the acquisition of a particular trust. In particular, the local authority will be able to refer a school's proposals to acquire a trust to the Schools adjudicator for determination, if it is clear that the school has failed to take proper account of the views of a majority of parents or if there are serious concerns about the impact of the proposals on school standards. The White Paper envisages the appointment of a Schools commissioner who will support the development of trust schools and work with potential trusts.</p>

	<p pid="b.2188W.2/1">The data requested are not available at a national level. However, based on a survey carried out during a six month period in 2001, a team at the Institute of Education estimated that around 53 per cent. of young women conceiving during that period were supported by the pilot programmes (based on monitoring returns from 27 out of 35 programmes). Take-up of the programme is likely to have increased since 2001, which was the first year of the pilot.</p>
	<p pid="b.2188W.2/2">Management information from Wakefield Sure Start Plus programme shows that just under half of young women whose conceptions resulted in a birth were supported by the programme in 2003.

The ratio of one qualified teacher to 13 children was first published in a Department for Education and Science circular in 1973 but superseded in 1991 by the 1991 Department of Health guidance which allowed for one1 qualified teacher and one qualified nursery assistant to 26 children for nursery classes.</p>

	<p pid="b.2192W.2/1">The Department of Education, in conjunction with the Education and Library Boards and other school authorities, is introducing new nutritional standards for school meals. The Department has provided additional funding to support the initiative and this will mostly be used to raise the food and nutritional content value of school meals to 50p in primary schools, and 60p in post-primary schools, in line with developments in England. There are 50 schools in the North-Eastern Education and Library Board area presently involved in the roll-out of the new standards and a further 78 will follow in January 2006. 17 of the 44 primary schools in South Antrim will be meeting the standards by that date. All schools will eventually be included in the scheme.</p>

However, when expressed as a percentage of the total, there was a slight decline, from 73.4 per cent. in June 2002 to 72.8 per cent. in June 2005.

	<p pid="b.2196W.3/1">EU state aid rules limit the extent to which public funds may be used to support export campaigns that promote domestically produced meat. Nevertheless, where possible, DARD is working actively to assist exporters, for example by the development of international marketing strategies under the Food Strategy Fit for Market&quot; initiative, facilitating state aid approvals for promotional activity carried out by the Livestock and Meat Commission. This includes a promotional campaign currently under way in the Netherlands to promote Northern Ireland lamb and a Beef Market Restoration Campaign which will commence in 2006, intended to address key issues relating to the restoration of beef obtained from cattle over-30-months (OTM) old at slaughter into the food chain, minimise the impact of OTM beef on the market and achieve early integration of this beef into the supply chain and export markets as soon as they reopen. Every effort is also being made to have the beef export ban lifted as soon as possible as this will provide a great stimulus for the industry. In addition the future sustainability of these sectors will depend on increased focus on customer requirements and the development of differentiated products that will enhance their ability to compete in global markets.</p>

This will help to ensure that Northern Ireland is better equipped for a more sustainable future.</p>
	<p pid="b.2198W.0/2">The Department of the Environment (DOE) is taking the lead in producing the Sustainable Development Strategy for Northern Ireland (NISDS) which is due to be published along with an implementation plan in summer 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.2198W.0/3">The emerging strategy has identified six priority areas for action and flagged up that some of the key sustainable development issues for NI relate to energy, waste and transport and their associated impacts on society.</p>
	<p pid="b.2198W.0/4">In tackling the key issue of waste, the Department of the Environment is working with all local authorities on the implementation of the Waste Management Strategy and provides funding which supports recycling of waste. Together with the recent inclusion of Antrim borough council in the kerbside collection scheme operated by Bryson House Recycling, this has contributed to the area having one of the highest recycling rates in NI (38.4 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.2198W.0/5">Energy and CO <sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels are another key issue for NI. The erection of a 600 kWh wind turbine on the Antrim Hospital site generates the hospital's base electrical loading using renewable energy and giving an estimated reduction of 1,376 tonnes in CO <sub>2</sub> annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.2198W.0/6">In terms of transport, a series of improvements to the A8 Belfast to Larne road over recent years will help to increase safety and improve travel times on what is a key route within the Antrim council area. Furthermore, DRD have announced that almost &pound;700,000 will be invested in local transport and safety schemes in the Antrim council area this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.2198W.0/7">Last month, the Department for Social Development awarded Antrim town centre &pound;75,000 as part of a town marketing programme which includes support for a programme of events and a shop local initiative. This will help support the local economy and assist in branding Antrim as an interesting place to visit.</p>

	<p pid="b.2202W.5/2">The best record of insurgents killed and injured by the United Kingdom forces are the Significant Actions Reports filed by UK forces following incidents involving hostile forces. The table details the information drawn from this reporting for the period between June 2003 and September 2005. Due to the tempo of operations information on insurgent casualties was not collected centrally before June 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.2202W.5/3">The figures drawn from these reports are not an accurate estimate of Iraqi casualties caused by UK forces, and should not be taken as such. It is not always possible to make an accurate count of Iraqi casualties following hostile contacts. The figures reported are the subjective impression of troops involved in the incidents. There is no way of checking these impressions since UK forces do not risk their own lives to ascertain how many casualties they have caused hostile forces and Iraqi casualties are frequently withdrawn from the area. It is also not always possible to determine who caused the casualties. Sometimes insurgents are killed or injured by the fire of other insurgents, although this number is likely to be small.</p>

	<p pid="b.2204W.10/1">Since 1997 BT has received the following financial sums to enable exchanges to extend broadband availability in the UK:</p>
	<p pid="b.2204W.10/2" class="indent">East of England Development Agency paid BT approximately &pound;500,000, to enable most of their remaining exchanges in BED A areas. This was awarded through the Broadband Aggregation programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.2204W.10/3" class="indent">Following a competitive tender South West Regional Development Agency awarded BT approximately &pound;3900,000 to enable some exchanges in the Cornwall area.</p>
	<p pid="b.2204W.10/4" class="indent">Following a competitive tender, BT in Wales was awarded &pound;3.6 million of European Structural Funding to upgrade over 40 BT telephone exchanges from UXD5, making ISDB2 services available to 99 per cent. of BT lines. The investment was also used to enable Digital Subscriber Lines, ahead of the commercial roll-out programme for the UK, in BT exchanges in market towns across Wales. It is estimated that the total project value was around &pound;6 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2204W.10/5" class="indent">Following a full EU Procurement Process to extend broadband availability in the North East region, BT was paid &pound;1,830,345. This sum is subject to a downward adjustment, in accordance with a reverse contribution scheme, which operates to repay money to the Agency if broadband take up in the region exceeds a prescribed level.</p>
	<p pid="b.2204W.10/6" class="indent">&pound;364k was awarded to Vale Royal Local Authority acting on behalf of the Cheshire Digital Development Agency who, following a competitive tender through the North West Regional Aggregation Body, awarded BT a contract to enable of a series of remote rural exchanges in Cheshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.2204W.10/7" class="indent">In Cumbria, Your Communications was awarded a large infrastructure project (Project Access) contract for approximately &pound;17 million following a negotiated, state aid approved OJEU competitive tender. Your Communications sub contracted part of the contract with a value of around &pound;1 million to BT for the early enablement of all the exchanges in Cumbria and specifically for the enablement of 14 exchanges in the remotest areas of the sub region.</p>
	<p pid="b.2204W.10/8" class="indent">In Scotland &pound;16.5 million was awarded to BT following competitive tender. The roll-out has not yet been completed so not all the money has been paid as yet. The European Commission was notified under State Aid rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.2204W.10/9" class="indent">East Midlands Development Agency has worked with BT on a number of sub- regional strategic partnerships, to extend broadband availability. As part of the contractual arrangements confidentiality agreements were signed by the sub- regional partnerships to protect information as commercial in confidence. Accordingly, this information is not be available for disclosure.</p>

	<p pid="b.2208W.8/1">The Regulatory Impact Assessment on the Maternity and Parental Leave Regulations 2001 extending the 1999 Regulations implementing Directive 97/75/EC estimates no significant one off implementation costs. Additional recurring annual costs to employers are estimated to be between &pound;6 million and &pound;39 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2208W.8/2">The Regulatory Impact Assessment on the extension of the Council Directive on European Work Councils to include the UK estimates one off non-recurring costs of &pound;8.4 million, affecting 111 UK based undertakings.

	<p pid="b.2208W.8/3">The Regulatory Impact Assessment on the Part Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations implementing Directive 98/23/EC estimates costs of &pound;27.4 million. These are annual and recurring costs to businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.2208W.8/4">The sole purpose of Directive 98/52/EC on the extension of Directive 97/98/EC on the burden of proof in sex discrimination cases was to amend the implementation date of Directive 97/80/EC in the UK from the <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-22">22 July 2001</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.2225W.0/1">The London Olympic Bill allows for the establishment of an Olympic Route Network. This network would be on roads between Olympic venues and accommodation and would allow the Olympic Delivery Authority to implement special traffic management measures. There will be no general restrictions on use of the Olympic Route Network.</p>
	<p pid="b.2225W.0/2">However, based on the experience of previous games and their successful use in Sydney and Athens, it is proposed that on part of the Olympic Route Network, where road space permits, there will be Olympic lanes operating in a similar way to bus lanes. At certain times of the day use of these lanes will be restricted, largely to accredited members of the Olympic family. The Olympic family includes athletes, Olympic officials, accredited media and technical personnel.</p>

	<p pid="b.2225W.9/1">DCMS is a diverse organisation that values its staff as individuals. Although the Department doesn't specifically celebrate religious events such as Ramadan, Diwali and the Chinese new year it does promote them by including in its diversity training the need for staff to be sensitive to colleagues observing different periods of religious observance. We also provide a religious and cultural observance guide and an interfaith calendar which is available to all staff on our intranet site. The Department also has a policy of flexible working. As part of the refurbishment of the Cockspur Street Site there are plans for a dedicated multi-faith prayer room.</p>

	<p pid="b.2230W.2/2">Recent conflicting legal decisions have left public authorities and contractors unsure whether or not the users of services contracted-out to non-public sector organisations are covered by the Human Rights Act 1998.

It is for that body to make appropriate estimates of costs and arrangements for payment. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will reimburse the Ministry of Defence's additional costs and will seek their own reimbursement from the West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authority. Given the unforeseen and open-ended nature of the task, the Ministry of Defence has been unable to provide estimates of the likely costs of Armed Forces personnel at this stage. The information will be given to West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authority as soon as it is available.

	<p pid="b.2242W.2/3" class="italic">Rules governing the acceptance and wearing of Foreign Orders, Decorations and Medals by citizens of the United Kingdom and her overseas territories</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/4">These rules set out the circumstances under which a citizen of the United Kingdom or her overseas territories (UK citizen&quot;) may be granted The Sovereign's permission to accept and wear an Order, Decoration or Medal (foreign award&quot;) conferred by a Head of State or Government of a foreign country. Head of Government of a Commonwealth country of which The Sovereign is not Head of State and certain international organisations (collectively referred to as foreign state&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/5" class="italic">Principles</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/6" class="indent">1. No UK citizen <sup>1</sup> may accept and wear a foreign award without the Sovereign's permission. Such permission must be sought as soon as there is an indication that an award may be offered.</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/7" class="indent">2. The granting of permission for a UK citizen to accept an award offered by a foreign state will only be considered if the award recognises specified services rendered to the interests of that foreign state.</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/8" class="indent">3. Permission will not be given for UK citizens to accept a foreign award if they have received, or are expected to receive, a UK award for the same services.</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/9" class="indent">4. Acceptance of a foreign award does not mean that the UK will make a reciprocal offer directly or indirectly associated with the UK recipient</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/10" class="italic">Permission</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/11" class="indent">5. Permission to wear a foreign award, if granted, will be either:</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/12" class="indent">unrestricted&mdash;allowing the award to be worn on any occasion, or</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/13" class="indent">restricted&mdash;allowing the award to be worn only on particular occasions associated with the foreign state that conferred it.</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/14" class="indent">6. The grant of permission, whether unrestricted or restricted, will be conveyed by letter to the UK citizen concerned from the Sovereign's Private Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/15" class="italic">Application</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/16" class="indent">7. A foreign state wishing to confer an award on a UK citizen is expected to ascertain&mdash;through its Diplomatic Representative at The Court of St. James's&mdash;whether permission to accept an award would be likely to be given. Such requests for clearance will only be entertained in respect of awards given by Heads of State or Governments recognised as such by the Sovereign.</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/17" class="indent">8. Requests made by certain international organisations (e.g. the United Nations and NATO) in respect of service in operations under their auspices should be made to the Defence Services Secretary in the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="b.2242W.2/18" class="indent">9. Requests made in respect of services rendered more than five years previously, or in connection with events in the distant past (e.g. commemorative awards), will not be entertained.</p>

Requests for clearance meeting the requirement of these regulations will be submitted to The Sovereign for consideration by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs&mdash;who will be under no obligation to make such a submission if the application has not been made as indicated in paragraphs 7 and 8 above.</p>

The same survey also found that in the control areas still operating the current housing benefit regime, which is used for the evaluation of the local housing allowance, 15 per cent. of housing benefit claimants in the deregulated private rented sector who receive their benefit directly have been at least two weeks behind in paying their rent in the past 12 months.

	<p pid="b.2265W.5/1">When an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is confirmed, poultry workers on the infected farm, together with vets, contractors and others who might be at risk due to direct close contact with diseased birds will be offered the antiviral therapy, oseltamivir, as soon as possible after disease confirmation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2265W.5/2">The stockpile of antivirals is currently being held centrally, while it is being built up. Arrangements have been put in place to make them available to those who need it within 48 hours. Antiviral drugs will be made available and administered through the Health Protection Agency's (HPA) local health protection units in collaboration with the National health service in England. Similar arrangements will apply in Wales and Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.2265W.5/3">From March 2006, the antivirals will be stored regionally. These arrangements for their storage and distribution in England will be the subject of a tendering exercise conducted by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency. It will be open to pharmaceutical wholesalers to respond to that tender. Any non-pharmaceutical items stockpiled are covered by standard NHS storage and distribution arrangements. Devolved administrations are responsible for their own storage and distribution arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.2267W.2/2">The Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB) total charge to a general practitioner registrar for a certificate of completion of training (CCT) is &pound;250. This is a single, once-and-for-all payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.2267W.2/3">Since PMETB assumed the responsibility for award of CCTs on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, the board had obviously not issued any CCTs by <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">Saturday 1 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.2267W.2/4">Looking at the number of CCTs in general practice issued by PMETB since that date, the maximum length of time taken to award a CCT, once all the required documentary evidence had been submitted, was 12 working days. The average for this activity is 11 working days.</p>
	<p pid="b.2267W.2/5">If PMETB's award is based on a previous joint committee for postgraduate training for general practice (JCPTGP) assessment there is no additional cost. However, I understand that the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) has decided to charge an enrolment fee of &pound;350 for doctors now entering GP training so that it can advise and monitor doctors' progress through training and carry out the necessary work to make recommendations to PMETB on the issue of a certificate. This is consistent with the practices of other medical Royal Colleges for this activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.2267W.2/6">The CCT was not awarded before <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase> when PMETB took up its legal functions. The CCT replaced the certificate of prescribed experience previously awarded by the JCPTGP. Although we do not know the maximum length of time the JCPTGP took to award its certificate, we understand that the average length of time was 10 working days from receipt of all the documentary evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.2267W.2/7">The change from the JCPTGP to the PMETB has had absolutely no impact on the recruitment of general practitioners. There were some initial problems when functions were transferred to PMETB at the beginning of October but these are being resolved and at the present time there are no complete applications over 11 days old awaiting the award of a CCT.</p>

	<p pid="b.2275W.0/2">The Department's change programme commenced in March 2003, prior to the publication of the Gershon review. Our Gershon commitment however is based on delivery of this programme. We confirmed in our 2005 Departmental report that gross full time equivalent headcount for the core Department had reduced from 3,390 in March 2003 to 2,050 in March 2005. We will update progress against our Gershon commitment in our autumn performance report.</p>
	<p pid="b.2275W.0/3">We have not as yet declared any achieved cost savings relating to information technology projects as Connecting for Health applications have only recently commenced rollout phase. Our calculation of efficiency gains recognises that benefits accrue from the integrated delivery of technology, process and people change. Future gains therefore will not wholly differentiate technology-only efficiency benefits. Our measurement methodology will be set out in an updated efficiency technical note, due to be published on the Department's website at the end of November.</p>
	<p pid="b.2275W.0/4">We have not yet declared efficiency gains for 2004&ndash;05. These gains and expected further progress in 2005&ndash;06 will be set out in our autumn performance report due to be presented to Parliament in December.</p>

	<p pid="b.2277W.5/1">It is essential that individuals across the population be made aware of the risks associated with high blood pressure and the importance of knowing their blood pressure numbers. For the last four years the Department has funded the Blood Pressure Association's (BPA) Know Your Numbers campaign. The national blood pressure testing week, which took place between 12 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-18">18 September</phrase> this year, is the high point of the BPA's campaign and provides an opportunity for the public to attend a blood pressure testing station located in their local community. Individuals are also offered free information on prevention, management and treatment of the condition to prevent the onset of heart disease and stroke.</p>
	<p pid="b.2277W.5/2">The most important factor in putting up blood pressure, alongside diet, physical inactivity and being overweight, is salt intake. In September 2004, the Food Standards Agency launched a high profile consumer awareness campaign on salt. The second phase of the campaign, focusing on highlighting the 6 grams daily intake target and encouraging people to read labels to become aware of where their salt intake is coming from, started in October this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.2293W.9/1">Under Agenda for Change, the basic pay that staff receives reflects the knowledge, responsibility, skills and effort required for their job as measured by the new national health service job evaluation scheme, rather than their previous job title. Agenda for Change also has generally fewer pay bands than the Whitley system it replaces. For these reasons, there is no guarantee that staff in different Whitley grades in the past will be in different pay bands under Agenda for Change.</p>
	<p pid="b.2293W.9/2">In the case of radiography, there have been concerns about the wording in some national job profiles which assist trusts in assimilating radiographers to the new pay system. The job evaluation group, a sub-group of the NHS Staff Council, is currently working with the Society of Radiographers to revise the band five and band six national profiles.</p>
	<p pid="b.2293W.9/3">This work cannot guarantee that senior II radiographers will be in a higher pay band than basic grade radiographers. It will however help ensure that assimilation decisions are appropriate. In addition, where trusts consider that pay levels are insufficient to recruit or retain staff, they are allowed to pay recruitment and retention premia of up to 30 per cent. of basic pay. For these reasons, it is not anticipated that the move to the new system will result in recruitment problems in the profession.</p>

	<p pid="b.2296W.2/1">The national health service is founded on the principles of equal access and equal treatment for all. Providing communications support to service users is not an optional extra; this is driven by the requirement to comply with legislation and supporting guidance. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 and the Human Rights Act 1998 make it imperative for public organisations, including primary care trusts, other NHS bodies and local councils, to provide language and other communications support to individuals seeking help. Various pieces of guidance and advice issued to the NHS and social care in recent years have emphasised this point. In addition, since October 2004, NHS Direct has ensured that all callers who have difficulty in speaking English, and prefer to speak in other languages, can have a telephone interpreter on the line during a consultation. The service is available 24 hours a day seven days a week.</p>

	<p pid="b.2296W.5/1">The Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 has been operating very effectively in the almost three years that it has been in force. It has had a significant impact in reducing smoking. The Act is enforced by Trading Standards Officers who do regular monitoring of local businesses. According to Trading Standards Officers, compliance with the Act appears to be very good. The Advertising Standards Authority also monitors advertisements. There have been no prosecutions and there has been only one formal caution, and no prosecutions under the Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.2299W.0/1">The Government take underage drinking extremely seriously. That is why we are taking forward work through the Alcohol Harm Reduction Programme to tackle it. Recent activities in the Programme have included the Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns in which the police have clamped down on underage drinking&mdash;through fixed penalty notices for both buying alcohol while underage and those who buy alcohol on behalf of children, test-purchase operations on licensed premises and confiscating alcohol from young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.2299W.0/2">We have also been working closely with the alcohol industry to develop a Principles and Standards document which includes a commitment to prevent sales to under-18s through a Challenge 21&quot; approach and better staff training. The Licensing Act 2003, which comes into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November 2005</phrase>, will make it an offence to sell alcohol to minors anywhere in England and Wales, and introduces tougher penalties for those who do. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill builds on this through new powers for the police to close premises for up to 48-hours where alcohol is persistently sold to under-18s.</p>

	<p pid="b.2300W.3/1">The House of Lords ruling in Limbuela and Others leaves intact a fundamental principle within our approach to asylum which is that people should claim as soon as they arrive in the country. The Law Lords have recognised that there are difficult decisions to be made and each case has to be judged on its individual merits. We are studying very carefully their judgment and considering whether we need to make any adjustments to our existing procedures and processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.2300W.3/2">We are adopting tough new means to crack down on opportunistic behaviour. In particular, we are setting up tightly managed new processes for handling late and opportunistic claims as part of the new asylum model announced in the Government's Five-Year Strategy for Asylum and Immigration. The impact of this will be that those who seek to play the system will receive a very quick asylum decision and so will, in reality, have very limited access to benefit&mdash;should they qualify for this while that decision is being taken.</p>

Failure to enrol in the UKPS trial should not be taken as an absolute indication that a participant is unable to enrol a specific biometric rather that enrolment was not successful using the range of equipment available during the trial, in the limited time available and within the context of the trial.

	<p pid="b.2304W.2/1">The Street Crime Initiative, launched in 2002, was aimed at improving the safety of individuals on the streets. The initiative succeeded in reversing the sharp upward trend in robbery levels and, over three years, reduced robbery by 32 per cent. in the ten street crime areas. The lessons learned from the initiative form the basis of good practice guidance which has been disseminated to all police forces by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.2304W.2/2">Throughout the course of the initiative, a range of preventative and intervention schemes aimed at young people were introduced, for example Positive Activities for Young People and Safer School Partnerships&quot;, which now play a key part in the delivery of the cross departmental programme to tackle youth crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.2304W.2/3">Another example is the SAFE&quot; campaign. In January 2005, in conjunction with Crime stoppers, we ran SAFE&quot;-a national anti-robbery week in schools. The campaign, which included assembly and lesson plans, provided young people with the knowledge and skills to avoid situations that increase their vulnerability to street crime. It supported and reinforced messages and information provided by local schemes, such as the Street Wise&quot; project in Havering, which raises young people's awareness and assists in increasing their personal safety. The campaign was delivered to 11&ndash;14 year olds in secondary schools throughout England and Wales. We are currently updating the materials with a view to running the campaign again in January 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.2306W.2/1">The Home Office generally allows the wearing of the Kirpan by Sikh employees and this practice is not covered by any formal Code of Practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.2306W.2/2">In operational areas of the department, for example the Prison Service and the Immigration Service there will be occasions where, for reasons of security, it is not permitted for either staff or visitors to wear the Kirpan. In these circumstances arrangements are in place to ensure that particular care is taken to respect their religious significance.</p>

	<p pid="b.2306W.5/1">To ensure particular issues relevant to Sikh customers are handled sensitively, the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) has provided briefing and guidance on diversity issues to its frontline staff; and where Sikh customers feel unable to remove the Kirpan, alternative arrangements are made for their application to be examined, and their passport collected which allows Sikh customers to keep the Kirpan with them at all times.</p>
	<p pid="b.2306W.5/2">These measures have been introduced following consultation with the Home Office and other organisations. They are based on risk assessments which are kept under regular review.

This resulted in a reduction of the London laboratory's caseload by 10 per cent. during this period. It has led to an improved performance in the London laboratory's delivery of the overall FSS target to turnaround 95 per cent. of cases in less than 33 days, which has assisted in improving organisational efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="b.2315W.5/1">At Newhaven, the immigration control is usually operated between 0500 hours to 2300 hours seven days a week. The operating hours are dependent on the number, and times, of the ferry arrivals at Newhaven. For operational reasons it is not HMRC policy to disclose particular deployment patterns to specific ports or airports. The immigration controls operating on the Eurotunnel site in France are staffed by immigration officers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>

The Advisory Panel on Country Information (APCI) is a bit different to the above NDPBs. The Government is not required to consult it prior to legislative proposals. However, during the passage of the 2002 Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act and the 2003 debates on affirmative orders made under that Act to add countries to the Non Suspensive Appeals list, Ministers gave some clear assurances. These were that the APCI would be consulted on the country of origin information being used by the Government before making an Order to designate a country. It is not within the remit of the APCI to comment on the decision to designate nor is there a requirement for the Government to publish its response to advice from the APCI.</p>
