	<p pid="e.911W.0/1">Compulsory set-aside (the obligation for farmers to take a percentage of agricultural land out of production) was abolished in 2008. The Campaign for the Farmed Environment was launched in 2009 as an alternative to regulation, allowing farmers to voluntarily implement changes in farming practice that will recapture the environmental benefits formerly provided by set-aside land. It is due to run until July 2012.</p>
	<p pid="e.911W.0/2">The Campaign is led by the farming industry and is its chance to demonstrate that it can deliver better environmental outcomes for farmland birds, other farm wildlife, soil and water at a local level without the need for additional regulation. I want the Campaign to be a success and do not believe that Government should need to regulate and impose more red tape; if the farming community can achieve the same results through its own actions. But if the farming community cannot step up and achieve these results voluntarily, the. Government will have to consider a compulsory approach to deliver the same level of environmental benefits.</p>

	<p pid="e.911W.3/2"><i> </i>I have made clear that tackling discards must be a priority for common fisheries policy (CFP) reform, and I am delighted that at the high level meeting on discards the EU Commission, and other members states, were able to agree on this too. At the event, the UK, Germany, France and Denmark also took the step of signing a declaration calling for serious reform of the CFP, making the reduction of discards a high priority, while securing improved management of fish stocks and the prosperity of our fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid="e.911W.3/3">The UK is committed to tackling discards, and will use the momentum created by the event and the declaration to continue to influence and shape reform-in doing so we will use the crucial evidence gathered from the UK's discard reduction work to make sure that the right solutions are taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="e.911W.3/4">The UK is clear, however, that it will not just wait for the reform of common fisheries policy; discard reductions must be delivered now. We have already made excellent progress with initiatives such as project 50%, which saw discards in the south west sole fishery reduced by 52%.

The Agency manages a wide range of common agricultural policy (CAP) schemes including the single payment scheme, internal market schemes covering dairy products, crops, fruits and vegetables, external trade measures covering export refunds, import and export licenses and milk quotas. The agency also carries out a wide range of inspections on farms and at abattoirs, factories, ports, airports and markets to ensure CAP scheme rules are met and that claims for payment are valid.

	<p pid="e.927W.6/1">We are currently considering how to deliver our commitment to cut red tape and encourage the performance of more live music, while ensuring that there is appropriate protection for local communities. A reduction in red tape associated with the licensing of regulated entertainment would clearly benefit pubs and other venues that put on live music events now. This is why we are continuing to have discussions with representatives from the music industry, the Local Government Association and others so that we can find the best possible solution and bring forward proposals.</p>

	<p pid="e.931W.0/1">The UK Border Agency continues to invest in quality through a detailed audit process developed with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to support a continuous improvement in quality. In addition to auditing individual decisions it conducts audits of the quality in specific areas of interest such as potential victims of trafficking, maintaining the best interests of the child, and Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual decisions. The Border Agency provides a wide variety of training, policy, guidance and tools to support high quality decisions on asylum applications. The Asylum Improvement Project, which was established by the Government in summer 2010, is exploring new ways to improve the asylum system which includes detailed work to reduce the number of asylum decisions overturned at appeal.</p>

	<p pid="e.934W.2/1">It is not possible to answer the question by giving details of average monthly cost in each detention facility since this information is commercially sensitive. Seven out of the 10 immigration removal centres are run by private contractors and the cost for running these centres are only agreed after an extensive tendering exercise. By giving the cost of running these centres we would jeopardise the process of ensuring that the taxpayer gets the optimum price. The average estimated direct monthly cost of holding a person in any of our immigration detention facility is &#163;3,407.</p>

	<p pid="e.934W.5/4">As a backstop, we are also developing a new option of pre-departure accommodation for use when other options for ensuring return have failed. This will not look or feel like an immigration removal centre; families will be held in self-contained flats, providing them with independence and privacy, within a large setting, including extensive grounds. It will be run on a care model rather than a secure one and there will be provision for family members to leave the premises after suitable risk assessments. The project to create the pre-departure accommodation has engaged the use of a number of specialist consultants for areas such as surveying and planning. We have so far received invoices for around &#163;65,000.</p>
	<p pid="e.934W.5/5">The pre-departure accommodation will take a little longer than <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March</phrase> to establish so a small number of family rooms will remain available at Tinsley House Immigration Removal Centre in the meantime. Their use will be kept to an absolute minimum during this interim period. We do not expect them to be used beyond May for families with children, other than for those few cases of families who are refused entry to the UK at the border and need to be held for a short time while enquiries are made and/or until a return flight can be arranged for them. There may also be the occasional need to use Tinsley for criminal or other high-risk families who could not be accommodated safely in the pre-departure accommodation but this would be rare.</p>
	<p pid="e.934W.5/6">The family facility at Tinsley House has just been refurbished to create a far more family-friendly environment. This work has cost &#163;1.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.934W.5/7">Both the family unit at Tinsley House and the new pre-departure accommodation will be subject to regular assessments and reporting by UK Border Agency monitors, but also to the oversight and inspection of HM Chief Inspector for Prisons, the Children's Commissioner for England and the Independent Monitoring Board.</p>

	<p pid="e.935W.2/1">The UK Border Agency takes very seriously its responsibilities towards children. The agency is required under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to carry out its functions having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the UK. Statutory guidance has been issued to the agency on how to fulfil this duty and all staff are required to complete training on keeping children safe.</p>

	<p pid="e.935W.2/3">Special arrangements are also in place for unaccompanied children who arrive in the UK to claim asylum. The children are referred to the nearest local authority immediately on arrival to ensure that they receive the same standard of care and support as any other child in need. Their asylum claims are then considered by specialist case owners with enhanced safeguards to take account of their vulnerability. Even if their asylum claims fail the children are not returned to their countries of origin unless appropriate reception and care arrangements have been put in place.</p>

	<p pid="e.935W.5/1">We are committed to safeguarding the welfare of asylum seeking children who arrive in the UK either unaccompanied or as part of a family group. The UK Border Agency (UKBA) has a statutory duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in the United Kingdom under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.</p>
	<p pid="e.935W.5/2">Where a child forms part of an asylum seeking family, further support has been provided to UKBA staff as part of the recent work to end child detention for immigration purposes. A new asylum instruction was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March 2011</phrase>, providing additional advice on how to process an asylum application made by an adult with at least one child dependant under 18, and how to consider the best interests of the child within that process. Specialist training has also been provided for any asylum case owners who will be required to host family return conferences or family departure meetings, both key stages within the new family returns process which was rolled out nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March 2011</phrase>. A new family key worker pilot based in the north-west region started recently with the aim of providing further practical support for families going through the asylum process.</p>
	<p pid="e.935W.5/3">There are a considerable number of safeguards in place to protect the welfare of unaccompanied asylum seeking children and these are documented within the 'processing an asylum application from a child' guidance. Recent changes include providing further guidance on considering the best interest of the child, the introduction of a standardised welfare pro forma to ensure newly encountered unaccompanied children's physical welfare is properly considered in advance of any interview, as well as piloting a child specific asylum screening form. All unaccompanied children are referred to a local authority as well as the Refugee Council's Children Panel to ensure they obtain appropriate care and advice throughout the asylum process.</p>

	<p pid="e.940W.2/2">The latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) show in the 2009-10 academic year there were 2,493,420 enrolments in UK higher education institutions. Of these enrolments, 125,045 were EU domiciled (excluding UK) and 280,760 were non-EU domiciled. Domicile has been used as opposed to nationality as this is a more widely used and reliable method of measuring overseas students.</p>
	<p pid="e.940W.2/3">In 2009-10, 2,322,200 learners were participating in Government-funded further education at a general further education colleges (including tertiary colleges) in England. Of these learners, 14,800 had a country of domicile in the EU (excluding the UK) and 5,400 had a country of domicile outside of the EU. Information on the nationality of learners in further education is not available. Information regarding students attending further education colleges in the rest of the UK is not held by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="e.940W.2/4">Government-funded learning as recorded on the individualised learner record (ILR) for further education is restricted to home learners. Therefore funded learners who are non EEA (European economic area) nationals must have been resident in the UK for the three years preceding their course start date and the main purpose for residence was not to receive full-time education during any part of that three year period. There are a limited number of exceptions to this, for example-refugees, learners with indefinite leave to remain status, or learners studying under reciprocal exchange agreements.</p>
	<p pid="e.940W.2/5">The UK continues to welcome genuine students from around the world to study at genuine education institutions here.</p>

	<p pid="e.940W.5/1">The Home Office has conducted no formal assessment of the impact of income inequality (ie the gap between the richest and the poorest) on levels of crime. The Home Office has, however, conducted an analysis of the results of the British Crime Survey to see if there is a link between household income and risk of being a victim of crime. This shows that there is no link between household income and violence, criminal damage, domestic burglary or theft from the person. There is a link between the highest earning households and vehicle crime that may be due to the multiple ownership of cars. This analysis was published in the Home Office annual crime statistics publication, Crime in England and Wales 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="e.942W.5/1">We expect all those with no basis of stay in the UK to leave voluntarily, and in certain circumstances we offer assistance with doing so. However, where they refuse to leave we have a duty to uphold our immigration laws by enforcing their departure.</p>
	<p pid="e.942W.5/2">The vast majority of people detained comply with arrangements for their removal, and while they are taken to the airport to be placed on the aircraft, they make the return journey alone. However, a small minority of people even then refuse to leave and, regrettably, escorts have to be used to enforce their departure.</p>
	<p pid="e.942W.5/3">It is not our wish that individuals are restrained, but if they refuse to leave and in some cases even become violent in an attempt to harm the officers, damage the aircraft or generally disrupt their removal, we have to ensure they are controlled for safety reasons and comply with the law. There are no other alternatives where people refuse to go.</p>
	<p pid="e.942W.5/4">Escort officers are trained in the use of control and restraint techniques, which are only used as a matter of last resort when all other alternatives of persuading a person to comply with their removal have failed or they need to be controlled for safety reasons.</p>
	<p pid="e.942W.5/5">The use of restraint is legitimate and lawful so long as its use is justified, proportionate and de-escalated at the earliest opportunity when the individual has complied. Where restraint is used, officers have to complete a comprehensive report, which is submitted to a senior manager and the UK Border Agency escort monitor for review.</p>

As made clear in the Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Government will continue to build on an existing programme of work to preserve the ability of the law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications data and to intercept communications within the appropriate legal framework. We will legislate to ensure this is compatible with the Government's approach to civil liberties and use of communications capabilities. As set out in the Home Office's Structural Reform Plan, details of this legislation will be announced in Parliament in due course.</p>

	<p pid="e.948W.6/1">The consultation document, 'Policing in the 21<sup>(st)</sup> Century' announced our intention to create a powerful new body of operational crime fighters-the National Crime Agency-to tackle serious and organised crime more effectively and strengthen our borders. To be established in 2013, this powerful new body will harness and build on the intelligence, analytical and enforcement capabilities of the existing Serious Organised Crime Agency, of which the UK Human Trafficking Centre is a part, and better connect these capabilities to those within the police service, HM Revenue and Customs, the UK Border Agency and a range of other criminal justice partners. It will contain a Border Policing Command that will enhance national security, improve immigration controls and crack down on trafficking of people, weapons and drugs. Further details will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="e.953W.0/1">The big society is neither a single initiative nor a traditional government programme. Rather, the big society is about putting individuals and groups in the driving seat in their communities, with government playing an enabling role. So one of the three pillars of the big society is our work on public sector reform through which public services will be opened to new providers such as charities, social enterprises and private companies to make them more innovative, diverse and responsive to public need.</p>
	<p pid="e.953W.0/2">A key plank of this strategy will be delivered through the Localism Bill, which will be introducing new rights to enable communities to challenge to take over running local authority services, and help them save assets and facilities that are important to them.</p>
	<p pid="e.953W.0/3">The community right to challenge will enable voluntary and community groups, local authority employees that wish to deliver the service as a mutual, and parish councils to express an interest in running a local authority service where they believe they could do it differently or better. The authority must consider the expression of interest and where it accepts it, run a procurement exercise for the service.</p>

	<p pid="e.954W.3/1">As I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-11">11 January</phrase>, we are proposing to introduce a new mandatory ground for possession for serious housing related antisocial behaviour which will make it easier for landlords to take swift and decisive action against the most antisocial tenants. Officials are currently working on details of this proposal which will require legislation to come into force.</p>
	<p pid="e.954W.3/2">My department is also exploring jointly with the Ministry of Justice whether any unnecessary obstacles to the swift resolution of antisocial behaviour possession cases where serious harm is being caused to individuals and communities exist and, if so, how these can be overcome.</p>
	<p pid="e.954W.3/3">More widely, the Government are currently consulting on proposals to streamline and improve the existing toolkit available to the police, social landlords and others to tackle antisocial behaviour. The proposals are intended to better protect victims and communities from the serious harm caused by criminal and antisocial behaviour by making the tools faster, more flexible, and more effective.</p>

In addition, where a claim is made under EC Regulation 883/2004, HMRC will carry out further checks with the authorities of the other member state to confirm the composition of the family, whether the other parent is working there and whether that member state is paying family benefits. Payments of UK family benefits are not made until the other member state has provided the necessary confirmation.</p>

Due to data quality issues we cannot identify flows of remittances from the UK to developing countries and therefore cannot isolate their specific economic impact.</p>
	<p pid="e.963W.12/2">However, research by the DFID-funded Development Research Centre on Migration, Globalisation and Poverty at the University of Sussex shows that remittances can boost growth in developing countries by financing investment, consumption and production growth. Remittances are a relatively stable source of foreign exchange earnings and provide support to the balance of payments. Findings from six years of research by the research centre are summarised in its report 'Making Migration Work for Development' (2010). Remittances can also contribute to poverty reduction. A joint study by DFID and the United Nations, 'Impact of Remittances on Poverty' (2009) found that a 10% rise in remittances reduced the poverty headcount ratio by 3.9% in developing countries where remittances account for more than 5.0% of gross domestic product.</p>

The Scotland Office works with other Government Departments, with the Scottish Government, and with other bodies as appropriate, to ensure that there is an appropriate response to any civil contingencies or emergencies in Scotland. For instance, during the period of inclement weather in December 2010, I worked with Defence Ministers to ensure that military assistance was provided to civil powers.</p>

	<p pid="e.968W.9/1">Our earlier answer of <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-20">20 January 2011</phrase> set out in brief the sustainability criteria we are introducing for the use of solid biomass, including woody biomass, to generate electricity under the renewables obligation (RO) from April this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.968W.9/2">These criteria are a minimum greenhouse gas emissions saving of 60% compared to fossil fuel assessed across a lifecycle that considers the emissions associated with cultivation, processing and transport of the biomass, together with general restrictions on the use of materials from land important on carbon or biodiversity grounds. Such land includes primary forest, peatland and wetland.</p>
	<p pid="e.968W.9/3">We are also continuing with the existing requirement for operators to report on a range of matters relating to the biomass used to the best of their knowledge and belief. These matters include the mass or volume of the biomass used, its type and form, the country of origin or purchase, and whether the biomass is an energy crop, by-product of a process or meets an environmental accreditation scheme. The same set of sustainability criteria will be applied to the use of UK and imported solid biomass, and to both new and existing plants. The sustainability criteria will not apply to solid biomass that is waste or wholly derived from waste.</p>
	<p pid="e.968W.9/4">As set out in our earlier answer, we intend, following a transition phase where solid biomass plants over 50 kilowatts will be required to report on their performance against these criteria, that from April 2013 solid biomass electricity plants of one megawatt and above will be required to meet these criteria in order to receive support under the RO.</p>

	<p pid="e.969W.2/1">We are introducing mandatory reporting on performance against the sustainability criteria under the renewables obligation (RO) from April this year for operators using wood and other solid biomass, above 50 kilowatts capacity. The first reports would be due to be supplied to Ofgem by <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-31">31 May 2012</phrase>, to cover the biomass used by a plant operator between <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-31">31 March 2012</phrase>. These reports would include performance against the land criteria, an assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions saving relative to fossil fuel and information on the biomass used including mass or volume, country of origin, type arid form.</p>
	<p pid="e.969W.2/2">These reports will enable Government, on an annual basis, to assess performance against the sustainability criteria for the use of wood and other solid biomass in electricity generation under the RO. We intend to formally link meeting the criteria with eligibility to receive RO support for operators of 1 megawatt capacity and above from April 2013.</p>
	<p pid="e.969W.2/3">These reports will also provide Government with valuable information on the availability and source of biomass being used for large-scale electricity generation in the UK, the scope for growth of sustainable bio-electricity in the UK and the potential effects on our wood industries. In addition, we believe that the introduction of sustainability criteria that are linked to eligibility for financial support will provide a powerful driver for better understanding across the bioenergy supply-chain of the key levers, such as reducing the use of road transport, that can deliver improved emissions savings.</p>
	<p pid="e.969W.2/4">Therefore, in the Government response to the consultation on the RO Order 2011, we announced DECC, Ofgem and the Environment Agency will jointly develop an easy to use lifecycle tool to assess the GHG emissions associated with bioenergy generation from the cultivation of the feedstock to processing and transport. We intend the tool will be made available online later this year.</p>

Administration costs have increased dramatically in recent years and cost controls will be essential in reducing the total cost of national health service administration from &#163;5.1 billion in 2010-11 to &#163;3.7 billion by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="e.986W.2/2">The expectation is that general practitioner consortia will have an allowance for running costs that could be in the range of &#163;25 to &#163;35 per head of population by 2014-15. We will not determine the exact amount until further work has been undertaken with pathfinders. This work will explore the optimal balance between ensuring sufficient investment in organisational sustainability with maximising resources for front-line services. Before this, during their development phase, the running costs will be locally agreed within the running cost envelope for each region.</p>

	<p pid="e.986W.8/1">The Department commissioned Professor Sir Michael Marmot of University College London to undertake a strategic review of health inequalities post 2010. His review report-&quot;Fair Society, Healthy Lives&quot; which reported in February 2010-explored the links between health and income inequalities and the health outcomes around life expectancy, infant mortality and obesity.</p>
	<p pid="e.986W.8/2">The review noted that the relationship between income inequality and health outcomes is well established and differences in health outcomes are the result of wider social factors. Its assessment of the evidence showed that life expectancy across all groups has improved, but the gap between different social classes remains, rooted in disadvantage.

	<p pid="e.987W.5/2">The Health and Social Care Bill 2011 proposes introducing new legal duties for the Secretary of State, the NHS Commissioning Board and general practice commissioning consortia to have regard to addressing health inequalities.</p>

	<p pid="e.988W.2/1">National health service organisations are responsible for compiling their own menus and making decisions about the food served to patients. In April 2010, nutritional care was made one of the key registration requirements for all organisations providing health care. As such, all hospitals are expected to adhere to the Care Quality Commission's (CQC) 'Essential standards of Quality and Safety'. This relates to all patients and there is no specific requirement regarding the elderly.</p>
	<p pid="e.988W.2/2">Alongside the regulations, the CQC has produced a range of 'outcomes', which indicate that an organisation is likely to be meeting the relevant regulation. In terms of nutritional needs, the outcome guidance states that people who use services should be supported to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration.</p>
	<p pid="e.988W.2/3">CQC assesses how trusts comply with these legal requirements and it has the power to impose a range of sanctions where breaches are found. At our request, CQC is also carrying out unannounced inspections led by experienced and senior nurses. We have asked CQC to publish a report on these inspections, which will depict the level of care being provided to older patients and the actions that hospitals can take to improve this care.</p>

	<p pid="e.991W.2/1">Ministers and officials discussed and agreed the recommendations for the future of NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), of which the National Blood Service is part, as set out in the report of the arm's length bodies review (July 2010). The report has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="e.991W.2/2">It was agreed that NHSBT would stay within the arm's length body sector but that an in-depth review would be commissioned into opportunities to make it more commercially effective. Representatives from relevant Department policy teams, the Welsh Assembly Government and NHSBT are contributing to the review. The review, which is at an early stage, will not consider changes to any functions or services that could risk destabilising the current national donor system, particularly the interface with donors. Any possible options that are identified will be considered very carefully before a final decision is made by Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="e.994W.7/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has a wider interest in the network of local citizens advice bureaux (CAB), but funding is a matter for local authorities, not BIS. BIS has no locus over the future of law centres, on which the Ministry of Justice lead.</p>
	<p pid="e.994W.7/2">The Government are aware that the local authority in Bolton has no anticipated plans to cut funding to Bolton CAB. As far as the rest of Greater Manchester is concerned a large number of local authorities have yet to finalise their budgets but both Bury and Tameside bureaux are not anticipating any cut in funding. Rochdale and Oldham local authorities are looking at moving to a commissioning process and bureaux in those areas will have the opportunity to bid for funding on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="e.994W.7/3">The Government do not as yet have a full picture of funding of bureaux across England as many local authorities have yet to decide on budgets but BIS is working closely with Citizens Advice, the umbrella body, to assess the full impact.</p>

	<p pid="e.999W.2/15">BBSRC does not have fixed allocations for neuroscience funding. Future funding of neuroscience research by BBSRC is dependent on the quality and strategic relevance of grant applications. Funding will be allocated over the next four years in relation to relevance to BBSRC's strategic priorities and BBSRC's four-year spending review settlement. As currently only a small part of neuroscience is within BBSRC's strategic priorities, it is likely that there will be a reduction in BBSRC funding over the next spending review period for neuroscience research that is outside our strategic priorities. An estimate, not an allocation, which is all that is possible at this stage until BBSRC has received applications for funding and dependent on their relevance and quality, is that this might amount to a reduction of &#163;4 million/year, i.e. total neuroscience funding might run at approximately &#163;36 million/year.</p>

We are satisfied that there was a prima facie case of alleged dumping requiring the European Commission to initiate the investigation. The Government judges each anti-dumping case on its own merits based on an economic analysis of the results of the Commission's investigation and representations received from relevant interests (e.g. producers, users and others). To date one meeting has been held with INEOS Oxide Ltd, a UK producer and the complainant in this case. As in all anti-dumping cases we will discuss this case with the Commission and other member states as appropriate. The Commission will in any event consult all member states through the Anti-Dumping Committee before any measures are taken.</p>

	<p pid="e.1006W.2/2">Returns from local authorities indicate that their expenditure on looked after children in 2009-10 was some &#163;2,888 million. This supported around 80,000 children who were in care for some or all of that year. This would equate to an average expenditure of &#163;36,000 per child. However the cost will vary considerably between individual children.</p>

	<p pid="e.1006W.5/2">Good quality early education helps tackle disadvantage and improve children's life chances. We announced in the spending review that funding has been protected so that all three and four-year-olds will continue to receive 15 hours per week of free nursery education, delivered more flexibly, and that this will be extended to every disadvantaged two-year-old from 2013.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.5/3">Fairness is at the heart of the Government's agenda. Local authorities have a statutory duty-under section 7 of the Childcare Act-to secure nursery places free of charge, effectively prohibiting top-up fees. This ensures that there are no barriers to accessing the benefits of nursery education for all children, but particularly the most disadvantaged. Parents are free to purchase additional hours and services outside of the hours for which providers receive funding from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.5/4">Many providers up and down the country are offering an excellent service to parents and their children within existing funding levels. The Government are listening to the views of early years providers and their representative bodies concerning funding issues. The Government are seeking to improve the efficiency with which funding is distributed to providers, through the Early Years Single Funding Formula (EYSFF) reforms, as well as reducing bureaucratic burdens on providers who deliver free nursery education. Many providers will also be benefiting from other support that local authorities provide for early learning and care. Providers will want to take into account this whole package of support before deciding whether delivering free places fits with their business model.</p>

We have provided important new investment in 4,200 additional health visitors who will play a key role in supporting those families most in need.</p>

	<p pid="e.1008W.2/2">The Department for Education does not collect this data. Decisions on staffing in Sure Start Children's Centres are a matter for local discretion.</p>
	<p pid="e.1008W.2/3">We have removed the overly prescriptive requirement for all Sure Start Children's Centres in the most disadvantaged areas to provide full day care. We have also removed the associated requirement that this provision be delivered by both a Qualified Teacher (QT) and an Early Years Professional (EYP), so that children's centres may chose to employ just one of a QT or an EYP.</p>
	<p pid="e.1008W.2/4">In the past, children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas were required to provide full day care, i.e. 10 hours a day, five days a week, for 48 weeks a year. However, the National Audit Office Memorandum for the Children, Schools and Families Committee, December 2009, suggested that in some areas, when demand for full day care is low, money intended for other Sure Start services-like family support and outreach to vulnerable families-is subsidising the provision of early education and care.</p>
	<p pid="e.1008W.2/5">We expect children's centres to continue to play a critical role in early education and care, including providing and encouraging take-up of free nursery education for two, three, and four-year-olds and additional hours where there is demand. Furthermore, we know the quality of early education is a key driver of good outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged children. So, where children's centres offer early education, it is crucial that this is of high quality.</p>
	<p pid="e.1008W.2/6">The Government remain committed to investing in the quality of the early education and child care workforce, and will develop proposals to support this later this year. The recent local authority and school funding settlement provides for the ongoing support and development of the workforce. Continued national investment in the early years workforce includes the funding of places on the Early Years Professional Status programme and the New Leaders in Early Years programme which began in November.</p>

	<p pid="e.1009W.6/1">Religious education RE is a statutory part of the basic curriculum of maintained schools in England, but not a part of the national curriculum. This means that there are no statutory national programmes of study, attainment targets or assessment arrangements. However, the locally agreed syllabus, which is designed by standing advisory councils on religious education (SACRE) and adopted by the local authority, is statutory, and that means that local authorities must provide such a syllabus and that maintained schools must follow it. Schools with a religious character can either follow the locally agreed syllabus, or use a syllabus which has been agreed by their governing body. It is the responsibility of the head teacher, governors and local authorities (LAs) to make the necessary provisions for RE in all maintained schools.</p>

	<p pid="e.1011W.5/1">The information requested is not held centrally. The Department does not hold information on individual examinations or modules sat by pupils towards achieving qualifications. Only the grade awarded for the overall qualification is collected from awarding organisations for use in constructing measures of achievement in the school and college performance tables.</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.5/2">We believe there is a clear danger that modularisation and re-sits are undermining confidence in the grades awarded in key examinations and are undermining in-depth study. We have asked the qualifications regulator Ofqual to look at the impact of recent changes to A-levels and whether further action is needed to ensure that re-sitting does not become widespread and undermine confidence in the exams. We have also asked the regulator to advise on how to bring an end to modular GCSEs and return to a system where students are examined on everything they have learnt at the end of their course.</p>

	<p pid="e.1012W.5/1">The Government are determined to reduce the data collection burden imposed on schools. To ensure that bureaucracy is kept to a minimum and that the value outweighs the burden, the central collection of information from schools is kept under constant review. Some collections have ceased in recent months and more are likely to do so as the result of a root and branch review of all the Department's data collections from schools. For example, we have already ended the Making Good Progress collection, the School and Local Authority Target Setting (SaLTs) collection and the Contact Module in the School Census. These changes are just the start of an ongoing programme of work and our intention is to reduce burdens further. We will ensure that any collections that remain reflect Government priorities and White Paper commitments.</p>

In accordance with the recommendations in the Government's report, &quot;Common Sense Common Safety&quot; (October 2010), the Department for Education is working with the Health and Safety Executive to help schools comply with their duty of care in a sensible and proportionate way. This includes developing succinct guidance on all aspects of health and safety in schools including for educational visits. We are also supporting the Health and Safety Executive to develop a code of practice for off-site adventure activities (to take the place of validation by the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority).</p>

	<p pid="e.1015W.2/1">The Government set out in the White Paper &quot;The Importance of Teaching&quot; their commitment to restore A levels to their place as rigorous, highly respected qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="e.1015W.2/2">The Government believe there is a danger that modularisation and multiple re-sits are undermining confidence in grades awarded in key exams and undermining in-depth study. We have asked the independent qualifications regulator, Ofqual, to examine the impact of recent changes to A levels and consider how we can ensure that the number of re-sits is minimised. We will also consider whether linear A levels should be available to test the depth of students' understanding.</p>

	<p pid="e.1017W.8/1">The Government's recent funding announcements reflect our commitment to ensuring all children, particularly those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, have access to high quality early education. The spending review confirmed that all three and four-year-olds will continue to receive 15 hours of free early education per week, delivered more flexibly. Funding for free early education places for three and four-year-olds is provided through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG), which supports the majority of education provision for children aged three to 16. Local authorities, in consultation with their Schools Forum, decide how best to distribute funding across their locality, and local authorities set their own local rates of funding to early years providers. No national funding allocation figure is available.</p>
	<p pid="e.1017W.8/2">The spending review statement also included a commitment to extending the entitlement to free early education to all disadvantaged two-year-olds from 2013. The investment over the next four years will be: &#163;64 million in 2011-12; &#163;233 million in 2012-13; &#163;331 million in 2013-14; and, &#163;380 million in 2014-15. For the first two years of the spending review period, this funding will be provided to local authorities through the Early Intervention Grant.</p>

	<p pid="e.1021W.2/1">The Government recognise the importance of reading and language development in the early years. The Early Years Foundations Stage (EYFS) framework requires providers (unless exempt) who care for children from birth to five to support and extend their reading, writing and communication skills. By the end of the EYFS, children are expected to link sounds to letters, name and sound the letters of the alphabet and read independently a range of familiar and common words and simple sentences.</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.2/2">All three and four-year-olds are entitled to 15 hours per week of free early education. We also announced in the spending review that this will also be extended, subject to legislation, to every disadvantaged two-year-old. This investment will ensure that all young children-particularly the most disadvantaged-reap the benefits of early education in terms of their cognitive and social development, readiness for school and later educational attainment.</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.2/3">Early learning also takes place within the family. Since 2004 my Department has funded the Booktrust.</p>

	<p pid="e.1021W.5/1">The chair of the capital review was selected for the depth and range of his experience and expertise relevant to the terms of reference for the review as follows.</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/2">Sebastian James has a great deal of experience in driving out inefficiency and maximising value for money in the retail sector, making him a good choice to chair the capital review. He is currently the Group Operations Director of DSG International plc leading both the Retail and Services teams, as well as being responsible for the supply chain. Previously, as Group Development Director, Sebastian managed the Currys store building and transformation programme. In both roles he has been responsible for significantly improving quality and customer experience while reducing costs by over 25%. As Strategy Director for Mothercare plc Sebastian had responsibility for developing and implementing the turnaround strategy at Mothercare plc. He was also involved, as operating partner, in the foundation of eGS, a leading e-Government procurement platform.</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/3" class="italic"> Terms of reference for the review of capital</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/4" class="italic"> Purpose</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/5" class="indent">1. To review, in the context of the Government's fiscal consolidation plans and emerging policy, the Department's existing capital expenditure and make recommendations on the future delivery models for capital investment for 2011-12 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/6" class="indent">2. The overall aim of the review is to ensure that future capital investment represents good value for money and strongly supports the Government's ambitions to reduce the deficit, raise standards and tackle disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/7" class="italic"> Scope</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/8" class="indent">3. The review will consider how all DfE capital expenditure within any spending constraint and PFI policy could be distributed more effectively over the next spending review period (2011-12 to 2014-15).</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/9">The review will be broken down into four main strands:</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/10" class="italic"> Allocation of capital funds</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/11" class="indent">To evaluate the extent to which value for money has been achieved in capital expenditure to date;</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/12" class="indent">to consider how to generate sufficient places to allow new providers to enter the state school system in response to parental demand;</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/13" class="indent">to review current methods of allocating capital (for example, by formula to local authorities);</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/14" class="indent">to consider options for reflecting Government policies on carbon reduction; and</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/15" class="indent">to enable the establishment of new schools.</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/16" class="italic"> Distribution of capital investment</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/17" class="indent">To assess the scope and make recommendations for how to distribute capital more efficiently and less expensively, including simplification of procurement, and increased use of standard and modular design;</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/18" class="indent">to develop a clear understanding of current approach, waste and issues associated;</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/19" class="indent">to consider the relationship between schools, local government and central Government;</p>
	<p pid="e.1021W.5/20" class="indent">to increase choice locally determined by parental demand;</p>

	<p pid="e.1026W.6/1">The commitment in the Schools White Paper, &quot;The Importance of Teaching&quot;, currently applies only to teachers in schools. This is because teachers are particularly vulnerable to the damage that maliciously intended or false allegations can have on their careers and personal lives. School teachers are responsible for the discipline of pupils in their classrooms and as such may on occasion need to use reasonable force to prevent pupils committing a criminal offence, injuring themselves or others, damaging property or to maintain good order and discipline. There is a perception that some children feel they can make allegations without any thought to the consequences for the teacher concerned, because they know it is unlikely they will be punished for making a false allegation. Where allegations are found to have been made maliciously the clearing of the teacher's name may be scant consolation for the trauma suffered through the social stigma attached to having been suspected of abusing or hurting a child. There may be arguments that the wider children's workforce, including those working in sixth form or further education colleges, can also be vulnerable to such allegations and I intend to keep under consideration the possibility of widening the scope of the anonymity protection.</p>

	<p pid="e.1028W.5/2">The Government have committed to investment and reform in early intervention at a time of financial constraint-intervening early makes sense socially, morally and financially. The Early intervention Grant is intended to fund universal programmes and activities available to all children, young people and families, as well as specialist services where intensive support is needed. However, it is up to local authorities in consultation with their local communities to prioritise the type and distribution of services subject to their statutory duties.</p>
	<p pid="e.1028W.5/3">There are no statutory duties specifically attached to the funding in the Early Intervention Grant, due to the un-ringfenced nature of the grant. The Early Intervention Grant may be used to fulfil statutory duties such as Sure Start and Short Break services but local authorities can meet the requirements of their statutory duties through a combination of all their funding, subject to local priorities. As the Early Intervention Grant is un-ringfenced, it provides the freedom and flexibility local authorities need to make savings while protecting the services that are most important to their residents.</p>

	<p pid="e.1030W.2/3" class="indent">Work Choice, which was launched in October last year, provides tailored support to help disabled people who face the most complex barriers to employment find and stay in work and ultimately help them progress into unsupported employment, where it is appropriate for the individual.

	<p pid="e.1030W.2/4" class="indent">Access to Work-provides practical advice and financial support to employed disabled people above and beyond what the employer could reasonably provide, to help them overcome obstacles resulting from disability and thus stay in work.</p>

	<p pid="e.1030W.2/6">The Department for Work and Pensions also funds residential training for unemployed disabled adults whose needs cannot be met through any other Government funded programmes.</p>
	<p pid="e.1030W.2/7">Later this year, the Work programme will be introduced which will provide more personalised back-to-work support for unemployed people, including disabled people. Contributory ESA customers will be able to volunteer for the Work programme, and if they wish, remain on the programme after their benefit has come to an end, ensuring that they receive all the support they need to help them return to work.</p>
	<p pid="e.1030W.2/8">The Work programme will be complemented by a new Jobcentre Plus offer which will allow more flexibility to Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers to judge which interventions will help individual customers, including disabled customers, most cost effectively and meet local need. Jobcentre Plus will continue to work closely with local health services, supported by disability employment advisers and work psychologists.</p>
	<p pid="e.1030W.2/9">I also commissioned an independent review of the support the Government provides to disabled people who want to work. This review is being conducted by Liz Sayce, chief executive of the disability organisation RADAR and will report in the summer 2011, with recommendations on how existing specialist employment support for disabled people can better serve the Department's wide ranging customer base.</p>

It was anticipated that increased workloads would be temporary and it was always planned to reduce numbers as the growth in unemployment slowed.

At this point, Jobcentre Plus does not plan to recruit further FTAs and will release the majority of existing FTAs during 2011/12. This will be kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="e.1045W.8/1">Following my recent visit to Sri Lanka, I am aware of concerns regarding language barriers, including access by Tamil-speaking Sri Lankans to government services. The Sri Lankan Government have recognised this issue and are seeking to ensure more state officials are able to speak Tamil. During 2010 the police force launched recruitment drives to attract 1,500 Tamil civilians into the police force. The UK, with the Sri Lankan Government's consent, has provided Tamil language training to over 300 police personnel. Through the British Council we have also conducted training of trainers and provided Tamil language learning materials for the security forces.</p>
	<p pid="e.1045W.8/2">One of the interim recommendations for the Sri Lankan Government's 'Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission' is to provide interpreters to assist with overcoming language barriers. We welcome this recommendation and the Sri Lankan Government's efforts to improve access to government services for all communities.</p>

Each year the FCO provides several reminders to staff how effective contributions via their payroll in either regular or single donations can be, especially for higher rate taxpayers. There are currently over 300 employees in the FCO who have signed up to payroll giving, with around 21 charities represented, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Cancer Research, Help for Heroes and the UN Children's Fund. In financial year 2009-10 FCO staff donated over &#163;100,000.</p>

	<p pid="e.1055W.0/11">Prisoners do not need permission from the governor to send or receive letters from the media, but correspondence which is intended for publication or for use by radio or television or for posting on the internet (or which if sent, would be likely to be published or broadcast) must not contain material which:</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/12" class="indent">is for publication in return for payment (unless the prisoner is unconvicted);</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/13" class="indent">is about the prisoner's own crime or past offences or those of others, except where it consists of serious representations about conviction or sentence or forms part of serious comment about crime, the processes of justice or the penal system;</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/14" class="indent">refers to individual prisoners or members of prison staff in such a way that they might be identified;</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/15" class="indent">is likely to appear in a publication associated with a person or organisation if there is reason to believe that the person or organisation concerned is planning or engaged in activities which present a genuine and serious threat to security or good order of the establishment or other prisons;</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/16" class="indent">contravenes any of the other restrictions on content applying to letters in general which are set out in Prison Service Order 4411 (which is available in the Libraries of both Houses).</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/17">Outside the high security estate, outgoing mail is only routinely read in exceptional circumstances, but may be read where it is thought likely that a prisoner may attempt to send out letters that breach the rules on correspondence. A percentage of outgoing mail is read at random.</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/18">The function of media liaison officer will be only a small part of the daily duties of the person to whom the role is assigned and it is not possible to estimate the cost incurred. There will normally be one media liaison officer for each prison.</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/19">The unauthorised disclosure of information to any third party by staff, if proved, would constitute a breach of the NOMS staff code of conduct.</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/20">Records indicate that in the last 12 months one member of staff was dismissed from the service for the unauthorised disclosure of prisoner related information to the press.</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/21">Prisoners who breach the rules relating to contact with the media will be dealt with under the internal disciplinary procedures, and are likely to face additional monitoring of their correspondence in future. There are no records kept centrally about the number of prisoners who have been found to have made unauthorised contact with the press or journalists.</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/22">Governors can restrict future access to prisoners or prisons by journalists who have engaged in authorised contact with prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/23">A range of internal and external stakeholders were consulted on the instruction on Prisoners' Access to the Media (PSI 37/2010), in line with NOMS instructions on the approval and implementation of instructions. No consultees specifically represented victims of crime. There has been no review of the effects of introducing the updated policy. The instruction makes clear that face to face or telephone contact with journalists will only take place in exceptional circumstances and we do not expect a large increase in the number of contacts between prisoners and the media.</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/24">Prison Service Instruction 37/2010 Prisoners' Access to the Media was issued to all prisons on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-02">2 July 2010</phrase> and they were required to implement it from <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">12 July</phrase>. Governors were instructed to inform prisoners as well as all staff, particularly Media Liaison Officers, of the updated policy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1055W.0/25">The restrictions set out on the content and use of letters are designed to prevent distress to victims. Governors may only permit a prisoner to have contact by telephone with a journalist if they are satisfied it will not cause distress to the victim or their family. Approval for a visit by a journalist will normally only be granted following consideration of the impact on the victim. Any decision to grant an interview must be communicated to victim liaison officers (where there are victims of sexual or violent offences and where the offender received a sentence of 12 months or more and in those cases where the offender was diagnosed with a particular mental disorder) who must tell the victim or their family. There are no plans to review the policy on prisoner access to the media at present.</p>
