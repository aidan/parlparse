	<p pid="a.110W.5/28">While in all three services personnel sign up to a specific engagement or commission, they are permitted to resign from their service before the end of this period provided they have completed a minimum return of service. In the Naval Service the initial commitment for Royal Navy Ratings is 18 years, Royal Marine Other Ranks is four years and Royal Navy Officers is 12 years. usbIn the Army Other Ranks enter an engagement of 12 years and Officers are given three years service from the date of commissioning with the option to extend once they receive a positive annual report. In the RAF, Airmen sign for an engagement of nine years and RAF officers sign a permanent commission of 18 years reckonable service or until they reach the age of 40. The commitments above are general and may differ depending upon which trade or specialty is joined.</p>

	<p pid="a.111W.8/2" class="italic">Substantive answer from Peter Luff to Gordon Banks:</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.8/3">UK forces have not fired air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles as part of Operation ELLAMY. The gross book values of each of the air-to-surface missiles fired by our forces from the start of recent operations over Libya up to <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-24">24 April 2011</phrase> are: Storm Shadow &#163;790,000 and Dual Mode Seeker (DMS) Brimstone &#163;175,000. Our stock of Brimstone was procured from 2004 as single mode missiles and subsequently enhanced to dual mode, under a separate contract, from 2008. Equivalent values for each of the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) Block III and TLAM Block IV surface-to-surface missiles fired over the same period are &#163;1,100,000 and &#163;870,000 respectively. All of the figures are inclusive of VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.8/4">In addition, as I said in the answer I gave on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-04">4 April 2011</phrase>, Official Report, column 569W to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" name="Tom Blenkinsop">the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Tom Blenkinsop)</phrase>, the value of Storm Shadow missiles, contracted for in 1997, includes the cost of producing an integrated weapon system and not just the purchase cost of the missile. The same is also true of Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.8/5">Enhanced Paveway II and Paveway IV guided bombs have also been released over Libya, but I am withholding their current gross book values as this information is commercially sensitive and its disclosure would prejudice the commercial interests of the contractor.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.8/6">Finally, the Ministry of Defence now takes a portfolio approach to procuring new Complex Weapons. This approach was launched in April 2010 and will secure significant efficiencies across the breadth of the Complex Weapons portfolio over the next 10 years and beyond, and is designed to meet the UK's military requirements and safeguard our sovereign capability.</p>

We believe that rewarding or recognising people for what they do is a good way to encourage behaviour change; the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40391" name="Caroline Spelman">the right hon.

Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr Pickles)</phrase>, commended the Recyclebank model at Windsor and Maidenhead last year. Schemes like this can help us to meet our revised waste framework directive obligations to reuse or recycle 50% of waste from households by 2020. It will of course be important to understand the impact of reward schemes, in order to help development of future policy. In the Waste Review, we are looking at how to share lessons from innovative ways of rewarding recycling and reuse. We will also be developing a Waste Prevention Programme for England, as required by the revised waste framework directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.120W.2/1">The Department does not look to determine &#8220;functional equivalence&#8221; in relation to relay services for deaf people. The requirement for equivalence in access to electronic communications is a broad concept and not tied to any particular service.</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.2/2">Further, determination of equivalence in relation to relay matters for deaf people will be a matter for the regulator, Ofcom, under new provisions of the revised EU Electronic Communication Framework. These revisions require member states to ensure that access to, and affordability of, electronic communications services for disabled end-users is equivalent to the level enjoyed by other end-users. Implementation of the revised Framework needs to be completed by <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-25">25 May 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.2/3">Implementation of new Article 23a in the USD will enable Ofcom to specify, where appropriate, requirements to ensure that disabled end-users:</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.2/4">(a) have access to electronic communications services equivalent to that enjoyed by the majority of end-users; and</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.2/5">(b) benefit from the choice of undertakings and services available to the majority of end-users.</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.2/6">In that respect, Ofcom is currently undertaking a review of relay service provision, the objective of which is to assess whether current arrangements for the provision of relay services are adequate in delivering equivalence to voice telephony for hearing and speech impaired end-users (including BSL users). Ofcom expect to publish a consultation document within the next few weeks and a research report which helps inform the review was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-04">4 February</phrase> and can be read at:</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.2/7"><a href="http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/telecoms-research/ofcom-relay-services/">http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/telecoms-research/ofcom-relay-services/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.120W.2/8">However, any decision on relay services will have to be made following a process of review, consultation, cost benefit analysis and a proportionality test.</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.2/9">In addition, Ofcom contributed to the consultation and report published by the Body of European Regulators (BEREC) in February 2011 on &#8220;Electronic communications services: Ensuring equivalence in access and choice for disabled end-users&#8221; which helps further clarify the distinction between functional equivalence and equivalence of experience.</p>

	<p pid="a.120W.5/2">Ofcom is currently undertaking a review of relay services. The review&#8217;s objective is to assess whether the current arrangements for the provision of relay services are adequate in delivering equivalence to voice telephony for hearing- and speech-impaired end-users and, if they are not, to consider proportionate solutions. This involves looking at, among other things, the existing text relay service and additional relay services including video relay and captioned telephony.</p>

	<p pid="a.121W.3/1">This Government expect the adoption system to work effectively for all looked-after children who would benefit from this permanence option and all local authorities to perform at the level of the best. I believe that adoption has lost some momentum in recent years. That is why I have started a programme of adoption reform. I have already published revised statutory adoption guidance, written to directors of children&#8217;s services and lead members setting out my expectations and set up the Ministerial Advisory Group on Adoption to steer the overall programme. At its next meeting, the group will discuss adoption breakdown and how to help ensure that adoptive families are appropriately supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.121W.3/2">I recently published an adoption data pack to support local authorities in delivering improved adoption outcomes and to help them compare their outcomes with those other local authorities. The Department is also funding two important voluntary sector projects to help improve adoption practices and supporting the British Association for Adoption and Fostering in promoting adoption through national adoption week.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40593" name="Michael Gove">the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, has announced that he will not continue to provide ring-fenced funding for school sport partnerships beyond <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-31">31 August 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.124W.2/2">Instead, the Secretary of State is making available &#163;65 million of new funding for schools to enable them to provide more opportunities for competitive sport. This funding will cover the school years 2011/12 and 2012/13 and will pay for one day a week of a secondary PE teacher's time to be spent out of the classroom, encouraging greater take-up of competitive sport in primary schools and securing a fixture network for schools to increase the amount of intra- and inter-school sporting competition. This will include schools in the Crawley constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.124W.2/3">Further details about this funding will be sent to schools later this term. The first tranche of funding is likely to be passed to secondary schools in September 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.125W.3/1">In comparison with many other Government Departments, particularly those engaged in delivery of citizen-facing public services in the UK, the Department for International Development (DFID) holds relatively little personal data. Most of the personal data which DFID does hold relates to its current and former members of staff and to recipients of pensions paid to former employees of British colonial Governments. Most personal data held by DFID for these functions are stored in the UK or in country offices by DFID itself and in accordance with the Department's organisational data protection policy. Some data relating to staff are transferred on a case by case basis according to business need to third party suppliers, some of whom may be based outside the UK (for example, to make airline reservations or arrange shipments of personal freight to country offices).</p>
	<p pid="a.125W.3/2">DFID has one contract with a supplier for the processing of pension payments to former employees of British colonial Governments overseas. The supplier's payment service is located in the Republic of Ireland. Payments are made in this way to approximately 3,500 recipients. A majority of the recipients of such pensions are likely to be British citizens.</p>

	<p pid="a.127W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has a regional programme in the Caribbean focusing on governance and security, wealth creation, climate change and disaster risk reduction. Guyana benefits from this programme directly, as well as through regional bodies. Our regional programme does not include support to education or health. Until December 2011, Guyana will benefit from our support to' the United Nations Development Programme's Enhancing Public Trust, Security and Inclusion programme which includes work to strengthen governance by empowering communities to press for better services and- greater accountability from Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.127W.6/2">On environmental protection, Guyana will continue to benefit from our regional climate change support programme, as well as the programmes of multilateral bodies (such as the World Bank and European Union) to which the UK makes a significant contribution and which support a range of areas including forest and mangrove protection. In previous years, the UK helped fund the development and implementation of Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy, which includes forest protection. Norway is now supporting Guyana in this field, so no additional UK bilateral support is anticipated this year.</p>

It would be disproportionately expensive to identify how many individuals worked for the first time during this period.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.7/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.7/2">The implementation date for the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) is April 2012. When it is implemented we expect the speed with which criminal records are exchanged between EU member states to increase. We also expect member states to exchange more criminal records once this can be done electronically rather than on paper. Together these should improve the effectiveness of criminal record exchange within the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.7/3">ECRIS is not an EU wide criminal record system, nor is it EU wide sex offenders' register. It is instead a computerised criminal record exchange system. The effectiveness with which ECRIS will prevent known sex offenders from targeting children overseas depends on the extent to which other member states chose to make requests for the previous convictions of those seeking to work with children. The UK already encourages other member states to seek the previous convictions of UK nationals who are seeking to work with children.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.3/3">&#8220;it is important that the vital role of the EU in promoting development and prosperity can be adequately represented in the General Assembly.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.3/4">The <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-03">3 May 2011</phrase> result achieves this, while preserving our interests on how EU member states are represented externally.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.3/5">The resolution allows technical and procedural changes to ensure the EU can continue to be represented as effectively as it was before the new presidency arrangements established by the Lisbon treaty came into effect before the resolution, the EU's rotating presidency, or another EU member state, represented the EU agreed position in the UN General Assembly. The Lisbon treaty transferred from the rotating presidency to the High Representative the responsibilities for chairing the Foreign Affairs Council and representing common foreign policy positions agreed unanimously by the member state. This resolution now allows that, while remaining an observer, the EU itself can represent common agreed positions of member states in the General Assembly. EU representatives&#8212;including the President of the European Council or Baroness Ashton&#8212;can now be inscribed on the list of speakers among representatives of major groups in order to make early interventions and may be invited to participate in the general debate of the General Assembly, subject to the limits set out in the resolution text. It remains, however, the case that the EU representatives can only do this if the UK and other member states authorise them to do so. Furthermore, EU representatives speak and act on behalf of the 27 member states with their authorisation, not in addition to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.3/6">The resolution underlines the intergovernmental nature of the General Assembly, whose membership is limited to UN member states. It does not affect the UK's sovereignty; nor does it affect the UK's ability to act independently in the UN or internationally. The rights of individual EU member states are not curtailed. Moreover, the resolution makes very clear that the EU will remain an observer. Its status in the General Assembly is unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.3/7">The EU representative will continue to be seated among the other international organisations that have observer status.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.3/8">The effect of the resolution is limited to the General Assembly (including Committees, working groups, international meetings and UN conferences). It does not affect the rights or status of the EU or member states in any other UN body or international organisation. The UK's position in the UN Security Council is not affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.144W.3/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) maintains a register of number plate suppliers as a means of regulating the supply of number plates. Since 2003 customers requiring new or replacement number plates have been required to provide evidence of entitlement to the registration mark and proof of identity before being issued with a number plate. Suppliers are required to keep records of sales. DVLA enforcement officers take action in cases of non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.144W.3/2">In addition, DVLA has endorsed a voluntary standard for anti-theft number plates that are incapable of being removed from a vehicle and re-used. These plates are commercially available and motorists are encouraged to fit them as a sensible precaution to protect themselves against the risk of theft.</p>

	<p pid="a.153W.5/3">Any institution that considers altering its previously advertised prices or support package will need to consider the wider implications of such change, not least if it would be unfair on applicants who may have already accepted a higher charge or different support package for the same course.

	<p pid="a.154W.2/1">The Government's lead Department for trade promotion is UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), a joint Department of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/2">UKTI focuses its resources on helping British companies to succeed in the markets where there is greatest demand from business for UKTI services, reflecting actual and potential opportunities in these markets. It has a presence in 96 markets around the world and this includes 20 Commonwealth countries which are trading partners for the UK, as well as a number of non-EU member state countries. Where there is no UKTI presence, FCO provides diplomatic support for British companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/3">It is not possible to provide information on all the interactions that UKTI has had with the countries where it has a presence, as these are continuing and ongoing. There have been some notable, high profile, senior ministerial visits to target markets over the last year; participants have included the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the right hon.

Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable)</phrase>, and my noble Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment, Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, among others. Markets visited with ministerial delegations have included China, India, Brazil, Russia, the middle east and Egypt.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/4">Based on HM Revenue and Customs Overseas Trade Statistics, UK exports of goods to Commonwealth countries in 2010 were worth some &#163;23.9 billion and imports &#163;31.4 billion. UK exports of goods to non-EU, non-Commonwealth countries in 2010 were worth some &#163;112.0 billion and imports &#163;161.3 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/5">Separately, UKTI's new Strategy, Britain Open for Business, sets out plans to provide practical support to exporters and inward investors over the next five years. Working with the FCO, UKTI has identified 19 high-priority markets where they will intensify efforts and shift further resource to help UK companies seize opportunities. The full list of these markets is: Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. We will also target Hong Kong both as a market in its own right and as a springboard into the mainland China market.</p>

	<p pid="a.169W.2/1">For the period in question, the only officials in the Department eligible for base pay increases are those earning under &#163;21,000. The Department's pay systems are performance-related and do not reward staff for &quot;seniority&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.169W.2/2">The provision of pay for promotion will depend on the number of promotions which take place in the period in question, which is difficult to predict. Staff would normally receive a 10% pay uplift following promotion to the next grade. The Department usually operates promotion gateways or boards, but these are currently suspended while the Department works through the implications of its transition programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.169W.2/3">These promotions will be strictly controlled and are likely to be few in number in the current climate. Numbers of promotions cannot be predicted in advance as they are dependent on contingent business needs. The arrangements for non-consolidated performance-related pay for non-senior civil service staff are subject to the Treasury's annual civil service pay guidance. The overall &#8216;pot&#8217; of money set aside for this will not increase in 2011-12 nor in 2012-13. Non-consolidated performance-related pay for senior civil service (SCS) staff is determined within a framework set by the Cabinet Office. The overall &#8216;pot&#8217; for such awards will decrease in 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.169W.2/4">The two-year pay freeze for the SCS started in April 2010 and for the rest of the Department's civil servants (the integrated structure, i.e. grades administrative officer to grade 6) this freeze will start in August 2011.</p>

From April 2006 to March 2009, transitional research funding was allocated to these organisations at reducing levels. At the same time, an increasing amount of NHS research funding was awarded competitively through new NIHR programmes and schemes. The NHS organisations reported on their use of these allocations in annual R and D reports, and each report included figures for research spend in a range of disease areas. These figures have been included in any estimates made by the Department of total annual research spend in these disease areas up to 2008-09.</p>

A national consultation showed overwhelming support from the public for this flexibility, with over 70% of the public who commented in favour.

	<p pid="a.174W.2/1">One of the principal aims of the arm's length bodies review is to streamline and simplify regulation. To help achieve this, our preferred option is to transfer all of the functions of the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) to the Care Quality Commission apart from any research-related functions which the proposed Health Research Authority may take on. The Government will be consulting in the late summer on this and other options as to where functions currently carried out by the HTA would best sit in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.176W.7/1">DECC and DWP Ministers and officials are working closely together on data matching as an important part of the policy development and planning for the Core Group of the Warm Home Discount Scheme. The scheme will involve data matching DWP pension credit data with energy suppliers' customer data to give recipients a rebate on their energy bills. This follows the successful delivery of the pilot 2010 Energy Rebate Scheme (ERS), which led to over 200,000 older poorer pensioners receiving a discount of &#163;80 off their electricity bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.7/2">Data matching for the Core Group of Warm Home Discount will involve a significantly larger client group than that used for ERS. This will lead to significant technical, security, operational and policy challenges. To seek to expand the scope of data matching before evaluating this wider use of existing powers would constitute a significant delivery risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.7/3">In addition, the Government are currently developing proposals for a fundamental reform of the working age benefits regime. The additional groups proposed for data marching by respondents to the Warm Home Discount consultation are likely to change significantly. We need to ensure that any further data matching powers would be durable and deliverable.</p>

	<p pid="a.177W.12/1">12 providers are running National Citizen Service (NCS) pilots in 2011. The NCS pilot programme aims to test a range of different approaches to the delivery of the core NCS programme. One of the dimensions we are seeking to test is the impact of levying a small charge on participants. Half of the 2011 pilot providers are levying a charge for participation while the other half are not. Those providers levying a charge offer a range of discounts and bursaries, and are required to ensure that financial cost is not a barrier to participation for any young person who wishes to take part. The maximum charges by NCS provider are shown in the following table.</p>

Since so many participants will not pay a fee to participate, it is not appropriate to estimate the average amount payable per participant, but the range of maximum fees levied by those pilots charging a fee is between &#163;20 and &#163;99.

	<p pid="a.178W.5/5">Unemployment rates are normally based on the proportion of economically active aged 16 and over who are unemployed. However, questions on qualifications are not asked of all people above state pension age. Therefore the analysis has been restricted to those aged between 16 and 64 years.</p>

From 2012, we will be publishing data on the number of deaths in each category of custody in the annual statistics on deaths reported to coroners which will provide greater transparency about these inquests. The Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody and the Coroners&#8217; Society of England and Wales are also working together to develop a series of recommendations to address inquest delays. We are also committed to improving the coroner system and intend to achieve this through implementation of key provisions within part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.

There were in excess of 16,000 incidents requiring the use of C&amp;R in 2010. Despite the death of Mr Moyo in 2005, it has proved to be a very safe system for enabling violent and dangerous prisoners to be restrained while minimising the risk of injury to staff or prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="a.186W.6/13">Waiting times within the SSCS jurisdiction have been increasing due to recent changes in the welfare benefit system. This explains why the average waiting time from receipt of the appeal at the SSCS to the first hearing has increased from 16.8 weeks in May 2010 to 19.0 weeks in December 2010. The SSCS Tribunal has continued to respond strongly to the significant increase in appeals. As the volumes of receipts have increased, so has the capacity of the tribunal to deal with them. It is increasing its capacity through the recruitment of additional staff, judicial medical tribunal members as well as a range of business improvements.</p>
