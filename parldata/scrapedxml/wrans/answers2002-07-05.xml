	<p pid=".617W.3/1">Figures prior to 2000 are not available, as precise volumes were not being measured. Some measuring systems were initiated in 2000 but were not sufficiently comprehensive to enable proportions to be quoted in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.3/2">In April 2000, recording of paper sent for recycling commenced at our main London office and averaged 300kg/wk in the initial months. This increased by 30 per cent following an office awareness-raising campaign in September 2000. Other recycling streams initiated during 2000 included plastic cups, aluminium cans, glass, newspaper, toner cartridges and used fluorescent tubes. Since December 2001, our main London office has been using a Government-approved waste contractor (John W Hannay) who collect all mixed office waste daily and sort it on receipt into 12 recycling streams. They state that they recycle over 90 per cent and send under ten per cent to landfill. This system also obviates the need for time-consuming sorting and recording of individual waste streams at source. We are currently exploring the possibility of extending this system to our other main office in East Kilbride, and will also be conducting environmental audits of our overseas offices with a view to expanding recycling, composting and re-use where local circumstances permit.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.3/3">When we relocated to a new London office towards the end of 2001; eight giant walk-in skips were filled with waste paper for recycling. Obsolete computer equipment was sent to the charity Computer Aid for reuse (including in developing countries) and surplus obsolete office furniture was donated to local schools and other charities. For the final office clearance we used a Government-approved company (Azcom, via a call-down contract with the Disposal Sales Agency) who reuse and recycle as much cleared material as possible as an alternative to landfill.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.3/4">DFID is wholly committed to the Green agenda and targets, and is in the process of finalising an Environmental Management System covering all aspects of operational activities. Improved recording and monitoring procedures will form an integral part of that system when it is up and running.</p>

	<p pid=".618W.12/1">I visited Dodoma on 2&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-07-03">3 July</phrase> for discussions with President Mkapa and Government Ministers about the UK's development partnership with Tanzania. I was warmly received, and had some open and constructive discussions with the Government of Tanzania about their impressive progress on social and economic reform, as well as about the government's response to the International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) report on the air traffic control system. Given that the contract with BAE Systems is legally binding, President Mkapa is inviting ICAO and BAE Systems to visit Tanzania to help advise his government on the best and most effective way of using the system. President Mkapa also made clear that there would be no second phase of the project. The President and Finance Minister outlined measures the government had put in place to ensure proper scrutiny and transparency of contracts to avoid any similar problems in the future. Improved systems and legislation, which DFID has helped to support, are now in place for public expenditure management and procurement.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.12/2">In view of these assurances and the measures taken by the government of Tanzania, and given the impressive achievements Tanzania has made in economic growth and social reform, I agreed to establish a six year partnership based on mutual commitments to drive forward Tanzania's poverty reduction and economic reform efforts. The Memorandum of Understanding will provide a commitment to at least #45 million per annum of support to the Tanzanian budget, the first year of which will be disbursed between <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase>.

The Department has issued guidelines on health and safety in science education, and also endorsed guidance from educational organisations, covering good keeping and handling of living organisms in schools. The Growing Schools initiative, launched last September, and supported by #500,000 funding, includes the development of school grounds for growing, for example, food Xcrops&quot;, and may also support farm units which contain animals.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.7/2">There have been guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry to follow on the use of certain animal materials in the production of vaccines and other medicines since 1989. The latest version of the guidelines was drawn up by the European scientific committee, the committee for proprietary medicinal products (CPMP), and adopted in May 2001. The latest version of the guidelines became legally binding from <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-01">1 July 2000</phrase> for new applications for a licence for a medicinal product and from <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March 2001</phrase> for products that were already licensed.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.7/3">The scope of guidance at any one time, and its implications for pharmaceutical companies, have often been unclear. Following a thorough review of the information supplied to Parliament on bovine spongiform encephalopathy-related issues in vaccines, the Government have established that, regrettably, incorrect and misleading information was given to Ministers by the medicines control agency and thus has been given in response to a number of Parliamentary Questions. An account of the questions incorrectly answered and the correct information has now been placed in the Library and letters sent to right hon. and hon. Members who asked those questions.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.7/4">We have also placed in the Library:</p>
	<p pid=".619W.7/5" class="indent">a copy of the Government's chief medical officer's report on the withdrawal of the oral polio vaccine;</p>
	<p pid=".619W.7/6" class="indent">a copy of the committee for safety of medicine's (CSM) consolidated review of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents and the safety of United Kingdom authorised human medicines;</p>
	<p pid=".619W.7/7" class="indent">a report by the MCA that explains in detail the development of the guidance for the pharmaceutical industry to follow on the use of certain animal derived materials in the manufacture of medicines, and the approach taken by the agency to its implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.7/8">For all practical purposes, nothing in the reports that have been published changes the safety profile of any vaccine licensed for use in the UK. In particular, the CSM's review is reassuring in concluding that there are no TSE-related issues arising from the use of animal materials in the manufacture of UK licensed vaccines.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.5/1">A number of initiatives have begun and legislative changes taken place since 1997 that benefit people with visual impairments as well as other disabled people. Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, deals with discrimination in the provision of goods, services and facilities. Since 1999, for example, service providers have had to take reasonable steps to change practices, policies or procedures, which make it impossible, or unreasonably difficult for disabled people including those with visual impairments to use a service.</p>
	<p pid=".621W.5/2">The community equipment services strategy, which was published in March 2001, calls for increases in the number of people benefiting from equipment. It highlights the importance of equipment and adaptations for visually impaired people. XDoubly Disabled&quot;, published in 1999, provided essential background and guidance for senior National Health Service managers with specific responsibility for advising on access for blind and other disabled persons to services and employment. Last month the Department issued fair access to care services, which provides guidance to councils with social services responsibilities on how they may achieve fair access to care services through reviewing and revising their eligibility criteria for all adult service users. Additionally, we have recently awarded the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) and the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association (GDBA) jointly a project grant to develop visual care standards.</p>

On the basis of the amount of milk on which subsidy is claimed, the RPA estimate that around one in 10 eligible pupils in Lincolnshire is a beneficiary of the scheme. This compares with around one in five for England as a whole. Given the basis on which claims are made, comparable county-by-county figures could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".625W.3/1">In 1999, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) introduced an adverse outcome analysis system. This provided CPS areas with a consistent means to identify reasons for adverse outcomes and also to allocate responsibility of any failure. This information is collated centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.3/2">For the last seven years, many areas of the CPS have had in place, with the police, a system of joint performance management that involves an appraisal of Crown Court acquittals, including those ordered and directed by the judge. This process has provided areas with information showing particular trends and a means by which improvements can be made.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.3/3">The Crown Prosecution Service produces quarterly summaries of unsuccessful case outcomes from information drawn from its various case tracking systems. This year the CPS and the police have begun to develop a joint case outcome analysis which builds on these two processes and will focus on avoidable case failure. Under this system, the reasons for judge-ordered and judge-directed acquittals in individual cases will be jointly assessed for individual training needs and other joint strategies for performance improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.3/4">The process will be supported by more sophisticated management information following the introduction of the CPS' Compass Case Management System due to roll out between April and December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.3/5">The figures in the following table show a fall in judge-directed acquittals from 1,777 in 1999 to 1,471 last year, a reduction of 17.2 per cent. Over the same period judge-ordered acquittals rose from 9,616 to 11,825, an increase of 23 per cent. Much of this increase can be attributed to recent changes in procedures. Since January 2001, the prosecution, unlike before, have been able to discontinue cases in the Crown Court. Although this is a prosecution decision, the current system records these as judge-ordered acquittals.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.5/1">The first stage of the CPS IT modernisation programme (the Connect 42 project) was completed successfully at the end of 2001, and has provided all Crown Prosecution Service staff with computers and e-mail. This enables prosecutors and caseworkers to access the Internet for legal reference material as well as providing secure e-mail to police forces and other Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.5/2">The second stage of the modernisation programme (the Compass project) is a PFI project and was awarded to Logica, on time and budget, in December 2001. Logica, in partnership with the CPS, are providing maintenance, support and replacement of the IT infrastructure over 10 years. In addition, Logica have been contracted to provide a case management system compatible and linked with other IT systems in the CJS to replace the four case tracking systems currently used by CPS.</p>

	<p pid=".628W.3/2">The Social Exclusion Unit's 1998 Report identified that between one quarter and one fifth of rough sleepers had been in the Armed Forces at some stage, predominantly some years before as National Servicemen. Since then, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has been working in partnership with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Homelessness Directorate, (previously known as the Rough Sleepers Unit) and the charitable sector to improve care and support for acute cases of homelessness, and notably those already sleeping rough on the streets or at high risk of doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.3/3">The MOD has put in place new preventive mechanisms at pre-discharge, point of discharge and post-discharge to help vulnerable leavers make a more successful transition to civilian life. These and other measures taken by the Government and its partners have reduced levels of rough sleeping by some two-thirds, in line with the Prime Minister's target. Furthermore, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has confirmed that an interim analysis of rough sleeping data gathered in November 2001 shows that the percentage of rough sleepers with an Armed Forced background has decreased markedly since the 1998 SEU Report.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.3/4">Medical care of ex-Service personnel with substantial emotional problems is the responsibility of the National Health Service (NHS) and the full range of treatments and psychiatric services is available. Those requiring psychiatric treatment may be treated as NHS patients at the Duchess of Kent's Psychiatric Hospital, subject to the nature of their medical condition and capacity though, if they reside outside the catchment area, their local Health Authority would have to meet the cost of treatment in accordance with NHS budgetary procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.3/5">The MOD has recently placed a research contract with Kings College London to help advise policy decisions to improve the delivery of cross-departmental support to veterans and to identify any areas of unmet need. This research will include interviews with key stakeholder organisations, such as Combat Stress.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.3/6">The Veterans Agency already makes payments to allow qualifying war pensioners suffering from psychological injury or illness to receive remedial treatment at Combat Stress centres.</p>

In particular, we have been concerned over fighting in Kisangani, Ituri province and the Hauts Plateaux in south Kivu, the associated abuses of human rights and the negative impact on the humanitarian situation. Where the security situation permits we have encouraged the United Nations Mission (MONUC) to investigate and to take appropriate action. We have raised our concerns with the governments of the region. We have supported UN resolutions and EU statements calling on the de facto authorities of the region to ensure the protection of civilians, respect human rights and uphold the rule of law.</p>

	<p pid=".639W.0/1">I represented the UK at Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-25">25 June</phrase>, accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Environment. The Council made real progress on a range of important issues.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/2">The Council approved a Decision, on behalf of the European Community, to ratify the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The UK supported Community ratification of this important instrument. The Protocol establishes clear and specific international rules on the import and export of genetically modified organisms (GMOs): prompt ratification by the EU will help secure its entry into force.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/3">Council Conclusions were adopted paving the way for a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of soil. The UK supported the Conclusions, which invite the Commission to produce a Community Strategy and, where appropriate, general principles for assessing and managing threats to soil but, with France, Austria and Denmark, made a written declaration on the importance of respecting and subsidiarity principle.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/4">Conclusions were also adopted emphasising the need to take measures to halt biodiversity loss by 2010, and welcoming the outcome of the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ministerial Declaration made there. The Conclusions also suggested next steps in the implementation of the Habitats Directive and management of the Natura 2000 network.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/5">Brief Council Conclusions were adopted on progress on ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. These expressed disappointment at Australia's recent withdrawal from the Protocol and urged other parties who have not yet done so to ratify as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/6">Ministers held general orientation debates on three subjects: the proposed amendments to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive recovery and recycling targets, the proposed revision of the Seveso II Directive, and a proposed Environmental Liability Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/7">On packaging and packaging waste, the UK intervened in support of a compromise Presidency text and registered a Parliamentary Scrutiny reserve. The compromise text maintains the Commission's minimum overall targets, and broadly maintains their proposed material specific targets (plastic recycling target increased to 22.5 per cent), but extends the deadline for Member States to meet those targets from 2006 and 2008 and removes the maximum target for recovery. The European Parliament first reading is expected to be in September, and so Council is likely to agree a Common Position in October.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/8">Member States, including the UK, supported the Presidency compromise text on proposed amendments to the Seveso II Directive. The Directive aims to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances. The proposed amendments would alter the classification system for explosives, change threshold quantities for substances dangerous to the environment, and for carcinogens, and add new named carcinogens to those already listed in the Directive. France proposed lower thresholds for reject ammonium nitrate, following an accident at Toulouse in September 2001 when a quantity of ammonium nitrate exploded. This change was agreed with UK support. Again following the European Parliament first reading in early July, the Council is likely to agree a Common Position in October.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/9">During the debate on environmental liability, Ministers focused on the issues of financial security and subsidiary responsibility. The UK intervened arguing that subsidiary responsibility was not consistent with the polluter pays principle and that the Council should not make a decision on the appropriate system of financial security until the precise scope of the Directive was clear. The Presidency concluded that Member States were divided on these issues but that a majority favoured both some form of compulsory financial security and some form of subsidiary responsibility for Member States.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/10">The Council took note of COREPER's conclusions in support for Environment Council in its contributions on follow-up to the EU Sustainable Development Strategy, including if necessary the establishment of a group of high-level officials, and on co-ordination between the sectors concerned by sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/11">The Presidency gave a progress report on the proposed emissions trading Directive and invited views. The UK expressed support for a Community emissions trading scheme. The Presidency also updated Council on a proposal for a Regulation concerning traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and on the Decision to ratify the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure (PIC) for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and its associated implementing Regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.0/12">Under Any Other Business, Sweden drew the Council's attention to the progress made by industry in developing technology to reduce emissions from diesel cars and suggested that community rules needed revising to reflect this. Portugal presented its national strategy for Sustainable Development. The Netherlands called for a proposal accelerating the phase out of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Germany raised the issue of co-existence of GMO and conventional crops. Belgium asked the Commission for an update on the forthcoming white Paper in Integrated Product Policy. The UK asked whether the Commission has decided on its intended legislative approach for Fluorinated gases. The Commission replied that it was still considering various options for legislation, and would make a proposal by the end of 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".641W.5/2">Expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is made in accordance with the EU regulations. Actual CAP expenditure may be higher or lower than forecast at the beginning of each budgetary year, due to the market situation, exchange rate fluctuations, or exceptional items. Surplus from one year's EC Budget is returned to Member States in the following year's Budget by means of a reduction of the amount to be financed from own resources. This has the effect of reducing the amount each Member State is required to pay from the GNP-based resource. The budget process requires the Commission to estimate the level of expenditure necessary in a particular year. It would be misleading to describe a difference between the estimate and outturn expenditure as an Xunderspend&quot;. Information on the implementation of the budget is available from the House of Commons Library in the Annual Reports of the Court of Auditors.</p>

The Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions assessed this replacement plan against Government policy in the summer of 2001 and submitted various representations. The replacement local plan proposes to allow Norwich Airport to continue to develop as a regional airport of significant importance to the local economy. The Secretary of State did not submit any representations on the proposals for Norwich Airport in the initial deposit version of the local plan. When the revised version of the local plan is published later this year I will carefully assess any changes made to the plan.</p>

	<p pid=".644W.6/1">Part E of the Building Regulations sets standards for the sound insulation between new homes. I propose to publish amendments to part E of the Regulations and the supporting documents in the autumn of this year. There will be a requirement in the regulations for testing the sound insulation of a sample of new homes on each site.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.6/2">The requirement for sound insulation testing will apply to houses, flats, hostel and hotel accommodation, whether purpose built or formed by conversion of other types of building. For new hostel and hotel types of accommodation, and houses, flats, hostel and hotel accommodation formed by conversion of other types of building, I anticipate that the requirement will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase>. For new houses and flats only, I anticipate that it will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.6/3">The reason for this later date is that I have asked the House Builders Federation to develop Robust Standard Details for the sound insulation of separating walls and floors for use in new houses and flats. These Robust Standard Details must provide consistently good performance, and so will not need routine testing.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.6/4">Officials and the Building Regulations Advisory Committee will assess whether the House Builders Federation has achieved this objective. If satisfied that this scheme might work successfully, then I will put the proposals out to public consultation. If this does not raise any unforeseen issues, I would intend to amend the Regulations to allow Robust Standard Details to be used as an alternative to testing. Otherwise, I anticipate that testing will be introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.6/5">Mindful of the need not to overburden business with unnecessary administration, we want to give the construction industry a chance to prove that their preferred system will work. However, we are not prepared to compromise on consumer issues. If Robust Standard Details do not prove effective, testing will be introduced.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.6/6">The consultation on Part E also included a proposal to transfer the protection of new housing from external noise from the Town and Country Planning System to the Building Regulations system. We have decided not to proceed with the proposal as part of this amendment. However, we are continuing to explore whether we should pursue this at a later date.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.0/1">The Northern Ireland Office's Public Service Agreement (PSA) was first published in October 2000 to cover the three-year period 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04. As the PSA targets effectively embrace virtually all of our departmental activities the cost of seeking to meet our PSA objectives is essentially the same as our total departmental expenditure. For 2001&ndash;02 (the first year of our PSA) this is currently estimated at #1,052 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/2">The efficiency elements within our current PSA are already reflected in the profiling of the budget set for the Department whereby anticipated reductions in spending in one area are redirected to offset emerging pressures in other areas.</p>
