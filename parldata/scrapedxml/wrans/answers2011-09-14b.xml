	<p pid="b.1170W.4/1">The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been identified as one of three bilateral action country plans within the UK Government's National Action Plan (NAP) on UNSCR 1325 Women, Peace and Security. We have achieved a number of successes against the objectives of the NAP, which include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.4/2">A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) funded film 'The Greatest Silence', distributed widely to raise, awareness of sexual violence; FCO developed and funded televised campaign 'Vrai Djo', which seeks to challenge male attitudes towards women; Department for International Development (DFID) technical support and funding to the Ministry of Gender to support the development and implementation of national-level gender policies; DFID support to an influential women's network (CAFCO) to ensure that fifty percent of voters registered were women; continued lobbing of the Government of DRC to implement legislation outlawing sexual violence and a zero tolerance policy on human rights abusers; and funding for a number of projects to raise awareness of sexual violence legislation, including workshops across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.4/3">However the levels of violence faced by women in DRC remain unacceptably high and our work to implement the resolution remains an important part of HMG's remit in DRC. The NAP is a working document; it will be reviewed again in October. A report will be produced and presented to Parliament by ministerial statement.</p>

Some of these providers also worked with forces before the framework was put in place. The great majority of force spending on forensics is with these suppliers. However, forces may in addition enter into contracts with forensic specialists on which information is not collected centrally.</p>

The UK has consistently pressed member states for a concerted effort to ensure all EU spending delivers the highest value for money, through strict prioritisation to reduce waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.8/3">The UK has first aimed to minimise annual growth in administrative expenditure in EU institutions. The Government, working in the EU Council, reduced the 2012 administrative budget from the 1.3% first proposed, to 0.4%. We are also working to achieve very significant savings in such spending over the next financial perspective, through reductions in three major areas: EU staff remuneration, EU staff numbers and all other administrative spending such as EU procurement and support services.</p>

It uses variable mandatory speed limits to help manage traffic flows at peak times or following an incident. It is a component of managed motorways, which uses a range of innovative technology combined with new operating procedures to actively control traffic flow. Techniques such as varying the speed limits, opening up the hard shoulder to traffic or limiting access to the motorway from slip roads when needed are all measures of managed motorways designed to reduce congestion.</p>

This scheme is prioritised as one of the fourteen schemes which is to proceed into construction before April 2015. The project will increase the capacity of the M1 Junction 28 to 31, by making the existing hard shoulder suitable for use as a running lane and introducing managed motorway technology.</p>

I am withholding details of these discussions as their disclosure would prejudice commercial interests. Nevertheless, the decision to sell the DSG, announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review White Paper last October, has generated significant interest within industry. Although the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is not yet in a position to invite formal expressions of interest in the sale, we have received some early and speculative approaches from a number of companies, including BAES, Babcock and General Dynamics (UK). MOD officials have met informally with BAES and Babcock, at the request of the companies, to allow them to explain their interest in the DSG in more detail.</p>

Most of these records have been misfiled and are quickly located and accounted for. The National Archives has an ongoing programme dedicated to locating such documents, so this number fluctuates slightly although the level remains fairly consistent. A small number of incorrectly located documents at any one time is an inevitable consequence of being one of the most open and accessible archives in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220W.2/2">The National Archives produces over 600,000 documents for readers annually, with a document ordered on average once every 10 seconds on busy days. Occasionally, records are found not to be in their correct location within the 185 km of shelving, generally as a result of human error. The National Archives proactively monitors all missing documents on a weekly basis and employs a robust 11 stage search process. This includes tracking the document's movements on its ordering system, searching reading rooms and inspecting documents viewed by the same user. Documents in use at the same time, those in the same series, those with similar reference numbers, and documents filed in the same area are also searched. Documents which are not located after an initial search are listed as 'missing' on The National Archives' online catalogue.</p>

	<p pid="b.1221W.2/30">Decisions on the future size of the prison estate will be driven by prison population demand. Prisons will only close when capacity allows. We will always ensure that there are enough places for those offenders sentenced to custody by the courts, including a margin to manage fluctuations in the prison population. Decisions to reduce or make changes to prison capacity will only be taken if they do not put this ability at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.2/31">The decision to close an establishment will be based on the following primary factors:</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.2/32">an economic assessment which identifies prisons that are inefficient to operate or maintain; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.2/33">an operational assessment to consider whether the closures of prisons can be managed while continuing to maintain the safe and decent operation of the prison estate and to meet the needs of offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.2/34">The prison estate as a whole is kept under review and is subject to consideration through the assessment process described above.</p>

	<p pid="b.1228W.11/1">We are committed to introducing a new dental contract based on capitation, registration and quality, with the aim of improving oral health, especially that of children. Dental contract pilots, which will test aspects of the new contract, are underway and include significant emphasis on prevention of dental disease. To reinforce the benefits of the contractual changes, we will also be piloting oral health promotion schemes which include measures to link general dental practices more closely with primary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228W.11/2">In addition, we have included rates of dental decay among five-year-old children as an outcome measure in Healthy Lives, Healthy People: proposals for a public health outcomes framework. Surveys of child dental health show that, between 1973 and 2009, the number of 12-year-old children free of tooth decay increased from 7%, to 66%, of the population in that age group. However, significant inequalities remain which we are resolved to address.</p>

The aim of treatment is to support patients in living with and managing their pain and there is an important role for voluntary organisations in providing peer group support and patient education.</p>

Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total an additional number (the next smallest) has been replaced. 2. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. 3. Consultant main speciality: The specialty under which the consultant responsible for the care of the patient at that time is registered. Take care when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as &#8216;acute&#8217;). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other patient or service information. 4. HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. 5. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i>Source</i>: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

The monthly workforce data is not directly comparable with the annual workforce census; it only includes those staff on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) (i.e. it does not include primary care staff or bank staff), it also includes locum doctors (not counted in the annual census). There are also new methods of presenting data (headcount methodology is different and there is now a role count). This information is available from September 2009 onwards in &#8220;Monthly NHS Hospital and Community Health Service (HCHS) Workforce Statistics in England&#8212;May 2011, Provisional, Experimental Statistics&#8221;, which has been placed in the Library. Monthly locum data is excluded from this table. <sup>(3)</sup> Not applicable. North Yorkshire and York PCT was not formed until 2006. <sup>(4)</sup> Not available. Monthly data is not available for GP statistics. <sup>(5)</sup> In order to avoid double counting, hospital practitioners and clinical assistants are excluded from the all doctors totals, as they are predominantly GPs that work part time in hospitals (applies to headcount data only). <i>Source:</i> The Information Centre for health and social care&#8212;General and Personal Medical Services Statistics, Medical and Dental Workforce Census, and Monthly Provisional Statistics.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1247W.0/1">UK Government policy is to get humanitarian assistance to people as close to their homes as possible so that they do not feel the need to leave their homes. Some Somalis choose to migrate internally, for example to seek support from family members in Mogadishu. I support United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugee's (UNHCR) work with the Somali authorities to get assistance to voluntary camps across Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.0/2">Vulnerable Somalis also have a right to flee across international borders to seek asylum but I agree with the UNHCR position that establishing new internally displaced people's camps, especially near border areas, is not the answer to prevent international refugee flows. They are likely to be sited in insecure areas, with difficult access for agencies, and health and security risks for the population which may be even greater than where they have fled from.</p>

In addition, Department for International Development (DFID) receives regular written and verbal reports and officials are in close contact with the Government of Kenya (GoK) on the Liboi reception centre. The GoK and UNHCR have reached an agreement on opening the Liboi reception centre. Once building has started, UNHCR estimates that there will be sufficient infrastructure in place to receive refugees within two weeks, but that full completion will take an additional two months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.3/2">These plans are however, subject to final authorisation from the GoK, which has valid security concerns over the management of its border with Somalia, and to the capacity of GoK, UNHCR and other organisations involved to set up and staff a new facility quickly. DFID provides some unearmarked funding to UNHCR 's Kenya operation for them to allocate according to emerging priority gaps, including Liboi.</p>
