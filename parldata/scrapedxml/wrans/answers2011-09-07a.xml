	<p pid="a.615W.2/1">The new rules for the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme 2011-12 were announced in March 2011. Under the new scheme, the available budget will be divided into quarterly budgets and then shared pro-rata between all claims received. Obviously we hope that the budget will cover the full rate of VAT for all claimants but, if it doesn't, an apportionment will be made and this will be announced on the Listed Places of Worship website. The first payments in this financial year are due to be made at the end of the second quarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.615W.2/2">By returning to the pre-2006 scope of the scheme we estimate that the available budget should be sufficient to pay all claims in full but, given the high volatility of claims in the past, it's impossible to predict with certainty at this stage. I will not be in a position to confirm whether claims can be paid in full until all claims for the first quarter of the year have been submitted and processed. The rate of payment will be published on the Listed Places of Worship website once this process is complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.3/1">Ofcom were directed to take a number of actions relating to spectrum in December 2010, including carrying out a combined auction of 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum as soon as possible. Ofcom consulted recently on auction design but has yet to take any final decisions on how they will proceed. Consequently I have had no discussions with Ofcom about a possible further direction in the event of a legal challenge to their proposals. The operators have expressed their concerns with the Ofcom proposals to me and I have stressed to them the Government's wish to see this auction take place as early as possible in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.619W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-01">1 November 2010</phrase> the Government reiterated their policy of paying 80% of undisputed invoices within five days and ensuring that prime contractors paid tier two suppliers within 30 days through use of a contract condition. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-19">19 July</phrase> I made further announcements to improve payment performance. These included a requirement for Departments to actively contract manage the performance of prime contractors, the Crown Representatives encouraging key suppliers to pay more quickly than in 30 days and encouraging suppliers to report issues of late payment to Cabinet Office's Mystery Shopper service. Departments are not required to publish payment data on a central repository, though some Departments choose to publish performance on departmental websites.</p>
