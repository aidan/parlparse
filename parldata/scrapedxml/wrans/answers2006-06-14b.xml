	<p pid="b.1197W.2/2">I regard the request from English Nature very seriously. I also recognise that Lyme Bay represents an extremely important fishery for the south west and the socio-economic impact of any action needs to be taken into account in reaching a decision. My officials have attended meetings with English Nature and Southern and Devon Sea fisheries Committees and, more recently, with the newly formed South West Scallopers Association. This dialogue is continuing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/3">I hope we can urgently broker a local solution to this issue which will be acceptable both for the marine environment and the livelihoods of fishermen. If this is not possible, or if individual scallopers choose not to respect any negotiated agreement, I will not hesitate to accede to English Nature's request.</p>

This is confirmed in the recommended guidelines that the Commission has issued to help member states develop their national coexistence strategies. These are available at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/comm/agriculture/publi/reports/coexistence2/guide_en.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/comm/agriculture/publi/reports/coexistence2/guide_en.pdf</a>. More up to date background on the Commission's thinking in this area is contained in the report that it issued earlier this year on the implementation of national coexistence measures.

	<p pid="b.1203W.8/1">There are no formally agreed levels of poultry culling capability. However, there are a range of culling methods available to the state veterinary service. These include maceration (for day old chicks only), lethal injection, neck dislocation, percussion killers, gassing in containers, whole-house gassing and, as a last resort when no other method is practicable, ventilation shutdown.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.8/2">Killing capacity has been progressively increased over the last two years through the establishment of contingency contracts with catchers and equipment suppliers. Capacity has been further increased since January 2006 through the development of a system based on the gassing of poultry in containers using a mixture of argon and carbon dioxide; the Department has commissioned 50 of these units, each capable of killing 2,000 chickens per hour. In addition, we have purchased a number of percussion killers for use on larger birds and plan to further increase our capability to gas poultry in their sheds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.8/3">However, it is not possible to state the total killing capacity per month because this figure depends on a variety of factors. These include the age and species of poultry, the housing system, the size, location, quantity and geographic spread of the affected holdings, and the availability of catchers, gas and resources.</p>

	<p pid="b.1209W.5/1">The Rural Payments Agency contributed to the advice supplied to Ministers before the decision was taken to adopt the flat rate model of the Single Payment Scheme. That advice pointed to a greater degree of challenge in implementing a flat rate, as opposed to a historical, model of the SPS, but at no point was any suggestion made that the chosen model was undeliverable. Given that EU regulations required member states implementing the SPS in 2005 to notify the Commission of their chosen models by <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-01">1 August 2004</phrase>, subsequent assessment of different models would not serve any practical purpose.</p>

	<p pid="b.1216W.11/1">There was no specific funding allocated for the purchase of ICT equipment in 1997. ICT funding allocations for schools in England in each year from 1998 to 2006 are detailed in 'Funding for ICT in Schools in England' which is available in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.11/2">From 2006-07 we have moved to a new method of funding for ICT equipment and there is no specific amount for ICT. The amounts previously allocated specifically for ICT have been included in allocations for Devolved Formula Capital and School Development Grant. Schools may use their overall resources, including their Devolved Formula Capital grant and their Schools Development Grant, to purchase ICT equipment and services. This supports schools in their financial management and provides greater flexibility on how they spend funding to target their priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1217W.11/1">Capital investment underpins the Government's drive to raise standards of education and we are fully committed to taking forward our programme to renew and improve all schools. Funding for investment in schools is &pound;6.8 billion this year and it will rise to over &pound;8 billion by 2010-11. This compares to under &pound;700 million in 1996-97.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.11/2">Our aims include rebuilding or renewing all secondary schools through the Building Schools for the Future programme, including their science laboratories, in fifteen waves of investment which started last year. Already about 350 schools have been prioritised in the first three waves, and we aim to include up to a further 600 schools in the next three waves. We also aim to have 200 Academies open or in the pipeline by 2010. In all, by 2010 almost a third of all secondary schools will be funded to improve their science teaching facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.11/3">Building Schools for the Future is only one of our capital programmes, and is allocated just over a third of the total capital funding for schools. All schools and authorities get additional funding for their priorities. This includes the funding which schools get directly&mdash;a typical secondary school will get over &pound;100,000 of its own money this year, which can be rolled over to allow larger projects such as science facilities to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.11/4">We are providing the resources to improve school laboratories where this is the priority. What is now important is to ensure that the new laboratories are designed not just to teach the curriculum, but that they have 21<sup>(st)</sup> century facilities and are inspiring places to teach and to learn. Our aim is to enthuse pupils with an interest in science, both as a subject and a possible career. Therefore we are planning shortly to launch a &quot;School Science Labs of the Future&quot; project which will bring together teams of leading designers and bodies with specialist interest in, and practical knowledge of, the teaching and learning of science to develop a range of exemplar designs. The most exciting of these will be built in schools around the country so that there is a range of practical examples to act as benchmarks and to disseminate the learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.11/5">Although this is over a longer timescale, we believe that this is the best way of ensuring comprehensively that all young people have the opportunity to learn in high quality facilities which inspire them to pursue their dreams and achieve their potential, and not be turned off by science.</p>

	<p pid="b.1222W.3/1">Improving the quality of the UK's hotels, and other visitor accommodation, is a key aim for my Department and its partners in the tourism sector. The grading schemes operated in England, Scotland, and Wales are central to that process of improvement, and to consumer certainty in the quality of the British tourism product.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222W.3/2">VisitBritain's net expenditure on accommodation quality grading work in 2005-06 was &pound;2,374,600 (after Value Added Tax). This figure represents payments to the Quality in Tourism division of GSL, which operates VisitBritain's quality scheme under contract, less participation fees received. These figures will change over time, but it is likely that a net minimum of &pound;12.5 million will be spent on the quality scheme by VisitBritain from its grant in aid resources over the life of the 5 year contract, to 2010. VisitScotland and the Wales Tourist Board additionally invest significant amounts in their own quality schemes, which have been fully standardised with those of VisitBritain and the Automobile Association since May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222W.3/3">My Department will shortly start a major consultation of the tourism sector, to inform a comprehensive strategy for making the most of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games of 2012. Funding for any new work on accommodation quality, which may arise as a result of that consultation, will be considered before the tourism strategy is issued.</p>

It includes all themes covered by water and sanitation: water resource management, assessment and protection; urban and rural water supply and sanitation; humanitarian assistance; and water for food. It presents a breakdown of expenditure by region, country, theme and bilateral aid type. Sensitivity analysis of the necessary assumptions is also presented. An update of the report, with details of expenditure for 2004-05 and 2005-06 will be published in autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1229W.2/1">The humanitarian situation in Burma is very poor. Reliable data are scarce, but many of Burma's 50 million people live in serious poverty&mdash;a situation exacerbated by the Government's actions. There are reportedly half a million people internally displaced in Eastern Burma, with around 100,000 in hiding in conflict areas, and more than half a million refugees in neighbouring nations. Communicable disease is an acute problem. Over 70 per cent. of the population live in malaria risk areas and Burma has one of the most serious HIV epidemics in Asia.</p>

	<p pid="b.1231W.2/2">The Ministry of Defence publishes casualty information compiled from a number of sources. One of these sources is the UK's main (Role 3) Field hospital in Shaibah in Iraq. The current figure (around 240 personnel) cited for troops wounded as a result of hostile action on Operation Telic is based on the records of those treated at the Shaibah Field hospital. This figure does not therefore include UK forces treated only at US facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.2/3">To present a more complete picture and to capture UK military and civilian personnel injured in Iraq and not included in the Shaibah figure for those wounded as a result of hostile action, we have published figures on Telic casualties drawn from other sources. These are the Notification of Casualty (NOTICAS) reporting and Aeromed figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.2/4">The Aeromed figure includes all UK military and civilian personnel medically evacuated from Iraq whatever the cause and from any location in Iraq, including Baghdad, to any destination outside that country. This reporting includes all UK service personnel who have lost a leg and have been treated at US medical facilities in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.2/5">The Notification of Casualty reporting is comprehensive from January 2005 onwards, when the Joint Compassionate Casualty Centre (JCCC) was set up, and includes all UK personnel treated at US facilities for serious injuries. But during the early phases of Operation Telic the tempo of operations meant that the paperwork associated with the NOTICAS process was not always completed properly. As a result we cannot be certain that all our NOTICAS records covering this early period are complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.2/6">We are working to cross check historic information to improve our Telic casualty reporting, including records for RFA Argus and 202 Field hospital. Once this information has been verified, I will place a copy in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232W.8/1">Our records show that 732 armed forces personnel were aeromedically evacuated from Iraq in 2005. Of these, 666 were diagnosed with physical conditions, and 309 of them were treated at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at Selly Oak, Birmingham, which is the Ministry of Defence's main receiving hospital for aeromedically evacuated personnel. The others were transferred to other NHS hospitals or referred to community-based care for ongoing treatment. We are unable to determine precisely how many of these patients required hospital treatment or were discharged at the airhead for ongoing care in the community as the relevant database does not contain this information. To provide this information, individual patient records would have to be consulted, and this could only be done at disproportionate cost and with the patient's permission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.8/2">Determining the number of personnel who returned from Iraq with a mental health condition is not straightforward. Sixty six personnel were aeromedically evacuated in 2005 specifically because they were diagnosed as suffering from a mental health condition, but the number who were diagnosed, after their return, with psychological problems as a result of their service in Iraq is greater than this. The Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) was notified of 727 personnel who were referred to the MOD's Departments of Community Mental Health in 2005 with possible mental health problems and subsequently identified as having a psychiatric disorder related to their service in Iraq at any date from 2003. It can also be difficult to determine the underlying causes of some mental health problems, some of which could be caused by a combination of other life events that occurred before or after service in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="b.1236W.0/1">There are 13 decommissioned and de-fuelled nuclear powered submarines awaiting disposal that are stored safely afloat&mdash;seven at Rosyth and four at Devonport (Plymouth). Two other submarines at Devonport are awaiting de-fuelling prior to being stored afloat pending disposal. The spent fuel is the only high-level radioactive material on these submarines.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236W.0/2">On leaving naval service each submarine contains approximately 83 tonnes of intermediate-level waste (ILW) and 81 tonnes of low-level waste (LLW). A proportion of the ILW will decay over time to LLW. For example, after 30 years, the quantity of ILW would have reduced to approximately 19 tonnes and the LLW proportionally increased to 145 tonnes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238W.3/1">Perfluorooctane sulphonate, known as PFOS, is used in a number of industrial applications and was used as an ingredient in two particular firefighting foam concentrate ranges for petrochemical fires.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238W.3/2">In October 2004 DEFRA consulted on a national action to restrict the use of PFOS following evidence to suggest that it could be harmful in certain circumstance to both the environment and humans. However, before consultations had been completed, the European Commission suspended our unilateral action and subsequently issued its own draft directive to restrict the marketing and use of PFOS. In this draft, all current PFOS uses, including firefighting foam, would be allowed to continue. This would not therefore allow the UK to set regulations to ban its use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238W.3/3">The stocks of foams based on PFOS are diminishing but it is likely that some fire and rescue services do still hold some stocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238W.3/4">As a result DCLG, jointly with the Environment Agency, are proposing a voluntary phasing out of PFOS-based firefighting foams and will shortly be issuing guidance to the fire and rescue services requesting them to no longer use these foams and instead to consider the use of alternatives once they are satisfied the performance of these alternatives meets their needs. Some fire and rescue services have already voluntarily substituted their stocks of PFOS foams with alternatives, the old foam having been destroyed by incineration.</p>

The latest figures show that there were 79,543 sales completed in 2004 as against 77,455 in 1996 (the year before the reforms were introduced). House prices have increased by 73 per cent. in Denmark during the period 1997 to 2005, compared to a 166 per cent. rise in Britain during the same period.</p>

In the case of a loan secured on a debtor's home, that advertisement must include a health warning regarding the consequences of not keeping up with repayments.

	<p pid="b.1247W.4/2">The Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) is a final salary scheme. Benefits are worked out as a proportion of final pensionable earnings multiplied by years of service. Men and women have paid the same level of contributions and received benefits calculated on the same basis, including contingent dependants' benefits, in respect of service from <phrase class="date" code="1987-07-01">1 July 1987</phrase>. To the extent that they have consistent career and salary patterns, the pension scheme therefore provides equal benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.4/3">New entrants to the civil service since October 2002 have, as an alternative to joining the PCSPS, been eligible to join partnership, a stakeholder pension arrangement, providing benefits on a money purchase basis. Employer contributions to partnership are between 3 per cent. and 12.5 per cent. of pensionable earnings based on the member's age but regardless of gender. Employers also match employee contributions up to 3 per cent. of pensionable earnings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.4/4">In addition amendments to the rules of the PCSPS will be laid before the House before the summer recess. These amendments will ensure that the pension arrangements do not discriminate on the grounds of age without any objective justification.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.2/1">The Central Office of Information (COI) meets with public service and commercial broadcasters regularly to discuss both the screening and scheduling of public information films.

	<p pid="b.1251W.2/1">The Refreshment Department can generally identify from its purchasing records the quantity and value of organic meat, poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables purchased over the past year, and the quantity and value of some organic grocery and counter-line products readily identifiable as organic (for example, certain brands of sandwiches, salads, yoghurts, biscuits, cakes, etc.). However, the Department does not keep a comprehensive list that specifically identifies the quantity of all organic foods used. No record is kept of the quantity of food sourced within 50 miles of London.</p>

	<p pid="b.1258W.5/2">The Government's main strategy for tackling areas of high urban deprivation is neighbourhood renewal and three local Neighbourhood Partnerships have been established in the Craigavon borough council area to help take forward the strategy in the areas that have been identified as deprived.

	<p pid="b.1260W.5/2">Clearly the categories of murder and attempted murder refer to the most serious incidents. While the overall incidents of use of a knife in crime rose last year, the number of murders and attempted murders reduced.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270W.5/1">No formal assessment has been made. However, the role of cost protection and its impact on clients and opponents was considered by the Department in 2004-05. It was decided to remove cost protection from most family cases but retain the existing rules for non-family proceedings. The purpose of cost protection is to ensure that vulnerable clients are not deterred from bringing proceedings by the threat of having to pay excessive costs, should they lose their case. Clients bringing certain types of civil proceedings with the help of legal aid are protected so that they can only be ordered to pay costs which are reasonable, given their circumstances. However, in certain circumstances, courts can also direct that costs awarded to an individual, against a funded client, should be paid by the Legal Services Commission, if the individual will suffer financial hardship if the costs are not paid.</p>

	<p pid="b.1276W.9/1">My noble and learned Friend the Attorney-General is responsible for matters relating to possible prosecutions in the United Kingdom. Following the coroner's verdict he and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary separately met James Miller's family. During his subsequent visit to Israel in May, the Attorney-General had detailed discussions on this matter and indeed the killing of Thomas Hurndall, with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Minister of Justice, Attorney-General and Military Advocate General and others. In addition the Attorney-General raised the issue of holding an independent inquiry into the death and subsequent investigation and pressed for appropriate compensation to be paid to the family without delay. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is in contact with the Attorney-General about how this matter will be taken forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284W.2/2">Seven events were held, attended by about 430 people across England and in Wales as part of the process of consultation to assess the potential race impact of the proposed amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The black and minority ethnic (BME) mental health network was involved in the initial development of the race equality impact assessment (REIA) consultation events. Due to an unfortunate breakdown in communications over the timing of the events, the network decided to withdraw their support from the events. We apologised for any misunderstanding and sought to involve the network in the events. The events were attended by a range of users and carers, including representatives from the African-Caribbean, South Asian, Irish, Pakistani and Chinese communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/3">Professor Antony Sheehan, Director General of the care services directorate, is now personally overseeing this work and is meeting with members of the BME network on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-19">19 June 2006</phrase> to discuss how to continue taking this forward. This meeting will be followed by a ministerial meeting with members of the BME network on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-20">20 June 2006</phrase>. In the meantime, the Department's REIA advisory group met on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-31">31 May</phrase> and agreed to further work on the impact of the amendments to the Mental Health Act. The REIA advisory group has met on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-13">13 June 2006</phrase>. One of the members of the Department's REIA advisory group is from MIND, and is also the co-chair of the BME network. The BME network continue to engage as part of the wider REIA process and we value their helpful input.</p>

	<p pid="b.1288W.2/1">Although there is no national agreement for the display of leaflets at libraries, doctors' surgeries, council offices and citizens advice bureaux there are a number of routes which ensure the availability of leaflets at these locations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.2/2">The Pension Service's local service teams, located throughout England, Scotland and Wales, have local partnerships with external organisations and formally monitor the use and availability of leaflets at 'Hard Copy Information Points' on partner premises. They also share local knowledge and experience of which leaflets are the most popular and most useful to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.2/3">The 80,000 subscribers to the Department's Publicity Register receive a quarterly newsletter called 'Touchbase' which provides details of current and forthcoming information campaigns. Subscribers are also able to order leaflets directly from the Department through its on-line catalogue of information products.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.2/4">Some private companies provide information services in public locations such as libraries and doctors' waiting rooms. The costs of providing this service are usually met directly by the Department or by the venue but the information remains free of any charge to the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.2/5">Recent customer research has indicated that disabled people would prefer information to be available at the point of diagnosis. The Disability and Carers Service are proposing to develop an awareness poster for display in locations such as doctors' surgeries, hospitals and local authorities that will signpost potential customers to more detailed information. Where possible the outlet displaying the poster will also hold stocks of leaflets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1289W.2/3">The payment of state pension takes precedence because it is a contributory benefit, either extinguishing the payment of carer's allowance, or reducing it if the amount of carer's allowance due is higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.2/4">Although this will mean that carer's allowance is not payable, or not payable in full, an underlying entitlement to carer's allowance gives access to the carer premium in housing benefit and council tax benefit and to the carer's additional amount in pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1301W.2/1">This Department has not undertaken any research into the pay gap between disabled and non-disabled workers. However, the Low Pay Commission reports that, in 2004, the pay gap for people with a work-limiting disability was 13 percentage points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.2/2">The employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), as amended and strengthened by this Government, place a duty on an employer not to directly discriminate against a disabled person, or to treat the disabled person less favourably for a reason related to that person's disability, unless this can be justified. The Equal Opportunities Commission's Code of Practice on Equal Pay also makes clear that it is good practice for employers to compare the pay of disabled and non-disabled people doing equal work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.2/3">As a result of a strong economy and active labour market policies, the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people is starting to close. The employment rate for disabled people was 38.1 per cent. in spring 1998, rising to 46.6 per cent. by spring 2005; over the same period, the employment gap fell from 35.1 per cent. to 28 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.2/4">The Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report, &quot;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&quot; set out a 20 year strategy to realise our vision of substantive equality for disabled people.

However, the &quot;DTI Information Security Breaches Survey&quot;, published April 2006, found that 52 per cent. of businesses (84 per cent. of large businesses) suffered premeditated and malicious breaches in 2006, compared with 68 per cent. in 2004 and 44 per cent. in 2002. In assessing costs, the survey showed the average cost of all incidents, both criminal and non-criminal, rose from &pound;10,000 in 2004 to &pound;12,000 in 2006 and estimates the total cost of all incidents is of the order of &pound;10 billion per year, up roughly 50 per cent. since 2004.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.8/1">The SIA do not calculate average processing times. Some, such as those involving overseas criminal records checks, unavoidably take a considerable time.

However, the convention establishes a framework for control which, in the United Kingdom, is implemented through the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. So any assessment of the enforcement of the convention is, in effect, an assessment of the enforcement of the Act. The Act establishes the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to advise me on all matters relating to drug misuse. The council meets, and makes recommendations to me, regularly.</p>
