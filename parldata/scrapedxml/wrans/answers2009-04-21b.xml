	<p pid="b.522W.2/1">For the last 10 years the vast majority of the Department's, and its predecessors, IT services have been provided through a PFI agreement with Fujitsu services and covers the provision of all desktop services, web infrastructure services, document management and other business applications. Many of these are charged for as part of overall, bundled, service charges. The Department also has in place an alternative IT framework agreement with a number of suppliers to enable competition where this is deemed appropriate. In addition, previously the responsibility for ICT was of a devolved nature and it is not therefore possible to provide all of the information requested without disproportionate cost.

	<p pid="b.524W.3/1">Temporary staff are staff that have been recruited on a short-term or fixed term civil service contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.3/2">The Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code dictates that short-term appointments of 12 months made outside of fair and open competition can be extended up to a total of 24 months. Such extensions are considered only on an exceptional basis. Extensions of these types are not encouraged and BERR's policy requires line managers to write a business case to the Head of Recruitment to seek approval of an extension.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.3/3">Fixed term appointments (FTAs) are made through open competition. The person is employed until a specific date is reached, a specific event occurs or a specific piece of work is completed. FTAs are normally made for a period of one to three years and do not usually exceed a total period of four years. BERR's policy requires line managers to seek authority from the Head of Recruitment to extend or make permanent a fixed term appointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.3/4">Agency staff are new recruits that have joined the Department but are not on a civil service contract and are employed by a third party. The use of agency staff is delegated to line management units. Permission must be sought from an HR Business Partner to use agency staff to fill a post. They can only be used on an occasional basis, where there is a short-term business need and other options for filling a post have been considered. The extension of these contracts is not encouraged.</p>

	<p pid="b.540W.2/1">Information about English local authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected quarterly at local authority level, about households rather than individuals. Information is not collected at constituency level. Therefore, data are provided at the Birmingham city council area, but not for the Hall Green constituency. Data collected include the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="b.540W.2/2">Information on the numbers of households housed in temporary accommodation is reported quarterly by local authorities as at the last day of each quarter. The figures include: those households which have been accepted as owed the main homelessness duty; those for which inquiries are pending; those being accommodated for a limited period because they have been found intentionally homeless and in priority need; those being accommodated pending possible referral to another authority, and those being accommodated pending the outcome of a local authority review or county court appeal.</p>
	<p pid="b.540W.2/3">The number of dependent children (or expected children) in these households is also collected, but data on the number of adults are not. There were 452 households in temporary accommodation on the <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>, reported by Birmingham city council, of which 362 were households with dependent (and expected) children and in total 1,068 children (and expected children) within these households.</p>

	<p pid="b.545W.9/20">Sport England are responsible for allocating this funding to benefit community sport. They do not routinely break down their Exchequer funding information beyond a regional level, e.g. beyond the North East, or designate sports clubs into 'amateur' or 'evening' for the purposes of data collection.</p>
	<p pid="b.545W.9/21">With regards to regional data, Sport England advise that information before 2002-03 could be provided only at a disproportionate cost. They advise that the North East has received a total of &pound;6,423,837 of direct Exchequer funding since 2002-03, of which, &pound;1,174,286 was directly awarded to sports clubs. Sport, and sports clubs across the country, including in the North East, will also have benefited from initiatives such as the Community Club Development Programme which are delivered through national governing bodies, applied to directly, but which are not included in these sums.</p>
	<p pid="b.545W.9/22">Information on lottery funding for sport in the Jarrow constituency, South Tyneside, the North East and the UK in each year since 1997 can be found on the national lottery grants database at:</p>

	<p pid="b.545W.9/24">From April 2009, sports clubs and other sporting organisations will be able to apply for direct funding from a consolidated number of lottery and Exchequer funding streams, including Sportsmatch. Applications for this funding will be accepted from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> and full information is available on Sport England's website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.545W.9/26">In addition, clubs will benefit from the funding that Sport England recently announced for national governing bodies of around &pound;120 million per year, in order to drive their strategic aims in relation to sport of 'grow, sustain, excel'.</p>
	<p pid="b.545W.9/27">For young people specifically, the North East will also benefit from the &pound;783 million the Government will be investing in the national PE and School Sport for Young People strategy from 2008-11, bringing total investment (including lottery funding) to over &pound;2.4 billion between 2003 and 2011.</p>

Each Department is currently responsible for their own numbering strategy, and it is their responsibility to ensure that all citizens&mdash;whatever their incomes&mdash;can afford to make contact. The council intends to use the results of its numbering survey to steer a future cross-government approach to the use of phone numbers. Consideration of the use of 0845 numbers, which are defined by Ofcom as &quot;special service basic rate numbers&quot; will form part of this methodology. As far as the Contact Council is currently aware, no central government department operates a premium rate number&mdash;defined by Ofcom as a number beginning either '090' or '091'&mdash;and if they do this will be identified during the aforementioned numbering survey.</p>

	<p pid="b.552W.2/1">Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a notifiable disease. The epidemic in Great Britain peaked with 37,056 clinical cases in 1992. In 2008 there were 33 BSE cases detected either as clinical cases or through the testing programme, a 38 per cent. decline compared to 2007. Most cases of BSE have been detected in cattle born before the animal feed controls were reinforced in 1996.</p>
	<p pid="b.552W.2/2">The ban on feeding ruminant meat and bone meal to ruminants is the key animal health control for BSE. In 2008, Animal Health carried out 2,322 feed inspections and collected 9,598 feed samples to enforce the ban in Great Britain. Animal Health continues to implement other BSE controls including the killing and disposal of animals which may have consumed the same feed as a BSE case and of the recent offspring of female BSE cases. The Food Standards Agency is responsible for ensuring the removal of specified risk material from the food chain, which is the key public health control for BSE.</p>

	<p pid="b.552W.5/1">The incidence of anthrax in cattle in the United Kingdom is low. There have been six confirmed incidents of anthrax (with seven cattle affected) in the last 10 years. The last confirmed incident in cattle involved two cattle in Wales in April 2006. This needs to be viewed in the context of a UK cattle population of circa 10 million cattle.</p>
	<p pid="b.552W.5/2">During the first three quarters of 2008-09 official veterinarians and veterinary officers undertook 3,862 anthrax investigations (in all species) where anthrax was a possible differential diagnosis (generally unexplained sudden death) with no confirmed cases detected. Forth quarter figures are still being collated. Investigation and control of anthrax disease is one of Animal Health's performance targets on which it reports to DEFRA's Food and Farming Group and during its quarterly liaison meetings with DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.552W.5/3">The number of investigations undertaken suggests that awareness of the need to report possible suspect cases is high among the farming and veterinary professions.</p>
	<p pid="b.552W.5/4">DEFRA's Veterinary Exotic Notifiable Diseases Unit have recently been reviewing their desk instructions relating to anthrax and Animal Health are currently developing a revised comprehensive training package for use in training new and existing official veterinarians and veterinary officers. In parallel with this Animal Health are looking at reviewing their Operations Manual instructions to incorporate some of this material and identify any areas where instructions could be improved/updated (e.g. in terms of contingency planning for disposal of suspect carcases, such as compiling a register of local authorities with access to portable incineration equipment etc.).</p>
	<p pid="b.552W.5/5">Information about anthrax is available on the DEFRA website.</p>

Pending collection for disposal, carcases should be held in such a way that domestic animals (including farmed livestock) and wild animals cannot gain access to them. In practice, it would be reasonable to expect them to be held securely, such as in an enclosed building, or an area away from livestock under a suitable cover, such as a tarpaulin. For the future, the Government support research into bioreducer systems which, if accepted as an alternative method of containment for fallen stock under the above regulation, may make it possible to contain and treat fallen stock on farm safely for a longer period pending its eventual collection for disposal by rendering or incineration.</p>

	<p pid="b.556W.8/1">Switching from using oil-based plastics to genuinely biodegradable renewable polymers/bioplastics can deliver environmental benefits, providing they are appropriately handled after disposal. DEFRA works closely with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to develop policy in this area. The DECC-sponsored National Non-Food Crops Centre (NNFCC) has established a Thematic Working Group to bring together those involved in the renewable polymer supply chain, to help realise the economic and environmental benefits of renewable polymer technologies and products.</p>
	<p pid="b.556W.8/2">In addition, NNFCC, the DEFRA funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and the Association for Organics Recycling (formerly the Composting Association) have been contributing to a 'Green Alliance' project, under the 'Closing the Loop' umbrella, looking specifically at biodegradable packaging. A guidance note and web based information tool has been developed. These are on the Green Alliance website and can be viewed via:</p>

	<p pid="b.558W.2/1">Funding to encourage take-up of energy efficiency measures in Great Britain is available primarily through two schemes: the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and Warm Front, but only Warm Front is funded from the public purse. The following table illustrates the investment made by Warm Front in insulation measures to improve the energy efficiency of householders over 60 in (a) Test Valley, (b) the ceremonial county of Hampshire and (c) the city of Southampton in each year since 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.558W.2/2">CERT is operated and funded by the six major energy suppliers, which are required to meet targets by encouraging households to take-up energy efficiency measures, including insulation and high-efficiency lights and appliances. Ofgem, the scheme administrator, does not collect data on energy supplier spend. However, based on the costs of the measures promoted by suppliers, we estimate that the overall spend by suppliers on delivering their CERT obligations across Great Britain will exceed &pound;3 billion over the period 2008-11.</p>

	<p pid="b.559W.6/2">The Committee reached the end of its term of office in October 2008 and the Board of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) decided to defer any decision on future arrangements for providing independent technical advice on nuclear safety, pending various reviews. Any decision will need to take account of the arrangements, yet to be finalised, to implement the Stone review of nuclear regulation. Experts staff HSE's Nuclear Directorate and it calls on many external sources of advice on nuclear safety when it needs them.</p>

	<p pid="b.562W.2/1">Detailed estimates of this nature are not available although we have made estimates of the energy costs associated with our security requirement to keep certain equipment running out of hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.562W.2/2">In 2007, power consumption tests based on the range of personal computers (PC) then in use suggested an average daily usage of 1.92 kW per day. This level of consumption would have been broadly constant during the past five years. With the introduction of the new hardware/software, a typical PC would consume approximately 666 W per day. Identifying a cash value based on these figures would incur disproportionate cost, as different tariffs apply in the countries around the world in which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is represented.</p>
	<p pid="b.562W.2/3">We have recently commissioned IBM to identify our IT-related carbon footprint which will be delivered in June 2009. This will establish a basis for assessing progress made toward reducing emissions as additional measures are implemented, covering the full life of equipment from procurement, through operation, to disposal.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister recently wrote to President Kibaki to thank him for Kenya's co-operation in combating piracy in the Gulf of Aden. Our high commissioner in Nairobi discussed piracy with President Kibaki on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-20">20 February 2009</phrase> when the President reiterated the importance of international action on a shared problem. The UK is a member of the International Contact Group taking forward work on this issue, which also includes Kenya.</p>

	<p pid="b.566W.11/2">The Department for International Development's (DFID) has made a &pound;250 million commitment to support education in Pakistan over the next five years. We are engaged in detailed discussions with the federal government and the provincial governments in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP, which includes the Swat region), Balochistan and the Punjab on plans for the use of these resources. Improving the enrolment of girls in school is a key priority area for our discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.11/3">We have already committed &pound;13.8 million to improve education in the NWFP. &pound;6.8 million of this support is providing monthly stipends, which will benefit over 300,000 girls, who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend secondary school. In the Swat district of NWFP, conflict has severely affected girls' education. In recent months 190 schools have been destroyed, most of which have been girls' schools. At present, however, the provincial government reports that classes have restarted using tented accommodation. The UK Government are deeply concerned about the threat to girls' education posed by extremism in Swat.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.11/4">We are also supporting a national &pound;3.5 million gender in education project that is helping the Government to better address gender issues in the formulation of education policy. This includes disaggregating education information by gender, in order to monitor progress in improving girls' educational access.</p>

	<p pid="b.570W.5/1">In 2007-08, 72 per cent. of trusts achieved the four hour standard of 98 per cent. of patients being seen, diagnosed and treated within four hours of their arrival at accident and emergency (A and E). As shown in the latest Healthcare Commission emergency department patient survey (2008), the percentage of respondents rating their overall care as excellent, very good or good was high at 88 per cent. It is important that patients have access to high quality timely care in A and E. However, we recognise that there are still areas for improvement and would encourage all trusts to examine their results and use these as a means to continue to improve patients' experience of A and E services.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.5/2">Investment and reform is working. Our drive to eliminate long waits in A and E has made local health services work in new and better ways resulting in faster access to treatment for patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.5/3">There are occasions when, for clinical reasons, patients may need to remain in A and E for longer than four hours&mdash;but it is for clinicians to make that judgment. That is why the minimum operating figure of 98 per cent. was introduced in 2003, following discussions with clinicians, to allow for the minority of patients that clinically require more than four hours in A and E.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.5/4">It is a local matter for national health service trusts to ensure that they meet the A and E four hour operational standard while not compromising patient care and clinical priorities. In cases of underperforming trusts it is for the primary care trusts and strategic health authorities (SHAs) to ensure that there are plans in place for improvement so all patients can expect the same high quality service. Where there is sustained underperformance, the Department seeks assurances via the SHA that NHS trusts have robust plans in place for improvement in A and E performance, in providing high quality, timely care to patients.</p>

Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> 2. <i> Alcohol-related admissions:</i><br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br/> Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&mdash;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br/> Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/> Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/> Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/> Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br/> 3. <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis:</i><br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> 4<i> . Ungrossed data:</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> 5. <i> Finished admission episodes:</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 6. <i> Primary diagnosis:</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> 7. <i> Secondary diagnosis:</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> 8. <i> Data quality:</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 9. <i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> 10. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> 11. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 12. <i> Assignment of Episodes to Years:</i><br/> Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.573W.6/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued its current technology appraisal guidance to the NHS on the initial use of adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in October 2007, which is 40 months from the date that Ministers referred adalimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to NICE's technology appraisal work programme. The guidance partially updated NICE's existing guidance on etanercept and infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.6/2">NICE is currently developing separate appraisal guidance on the use of adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, rituximab and abatacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis after the failure of a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. NICE currently expects to publish updated guidance on this topic in July 2010. Until NICE publishes final guidance for this appraisal, NICE'S existing guidance on the use of etanercept, infliximab, rituximab and abatacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis after the failure of an anti-TNF in technology appraisals TA36, TA126 and TA141 remains in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.6/3">The scheduling of work on specific technology appraisal reviews is a matter for NICE, but we understand that in this case the guidance development process has been particularly complex because of the need to address issues identified at the appeal stage.</p>

The expert group on commissioning national health service infertility provision, which we established in 2008 to provide advice to the Department and to PCT commissioners, has identified that increasing awareness of the consequences of infertility, and developing the expertise of commissioners, will contribute to further progress in this area of health provision. The expert group is producing a commissioning guide to address these issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.577W.2/1">The Health Visiting service is a universal service. Work continues to strengthen the service and maximise its effectiveness. The universal programme for 0-5 year olds, the Healthy Child Programme (formerly the Child Health Promotion Programme), led by health visitors, was set out in updated guidance issued in March 2008. The associated impact assessment estimated the additional costs of introducing new assessments of all pregnant women and under-fives for obesity risks at &pound;20 million per annum, greatly outweighed by the estimated benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/2">In Healthy Lives, Brighter Futures, the strategy for children and young people's health, the Government set out the intention to ensure that every Sure Start Children's Centre has access to a named health visitor to work as part of the team and oversee the health work of the centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.2/3">The new Action on Health Visiting programme, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-12">12 March</phrase>, will look further at the key roles of health visitors and the action needed on skills, development and career opportunities to ensure the national health service is able to recruit and retain the right workforce.

	<p pid="b.588W.9/1">Stroke is included as a priority for the national health service in the operating framework. The stroke strategy recommends that everyone who can benefit from urgent stroke care should be transferred to an acute stroke centre that provides 24-hour access to scans and specialist stroke care. All hospitals now provide computed axial tomography scanning and most provide magnetic resonance imaging and carotid doppler too. The Department published an imaging guide in 2008, to help ensure that imaging services develop in line with the quality markers in the national stroke strategy. A copy has been placed in the Library. The guide has been welcomed by the profession. The latest National Sentinel Audit of stroke from the Royal College of Physicians shows that the number of stroke units providing thrombolysis is increasing. However, provision of these services out of hours remains a challenge. Local stroke networks have been established to assist in reviewing and organising the delivery of improved stroke services. This includes ensuring access to scanning and the provision of thrombolysis where appropriate.</p>

It could be a potential solution to the ongoing shortage of human organs and tissues for transplantation, but also raises concerns for the safety of the individual and the wider public for the efficacy of the procedures and for the welfare of the animals involved. No xenotransplant procedure involving humans will be allowed to take place unless there is sufficient evidence to justify the particular procedure proposed.</p>

The regulator proposes to move to a more robust model of standards regulation that moves the focus from just forensic practitioners to include standards for organisations, practitioners and the science methods used.

	<p pid="b.598W.2/1">The number of persons proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts of sexual offences against children under the age of 18 years in England and Wales, the north-east region, and Cleveland police force area, by gender, and age group, for the years 1996 to 2007 can be viewed in the following tables 1 to 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/2">Data provided are for those statutes where the age of the victim is specified.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/3">Charging data are not held by the Ministry of Justice, hence proceeded against data have been provided in lieu.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/4">The Sexual Offences Act 2003 significantly modernised and strengthened the laws on sexual offences in England and Wales to provide extra protection to children from sexual exploitation. Data for the period 2004 onwards cannot therefore be directly compared to earlier years. Many new offences created by the Act will not have a direct equivalent under the old legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/5">Information for Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive and that for Northern Ireland for the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/6">Data held by the Ministry of Justice cannot be further broken down to constituency level (i.e. Tees Valley district, and Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland); hence Cleveland police force area data have been provided in lieu.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/7">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/8">Court proceedings data for 2008 will be available in the autumn of 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.604W.11/6">In order to reduce the bureaucracy on officers still further the Government have also abolished the need for police officers to complete the annual police activity analysis form, which asked them to account for their activity for each 15-minute working period of their shifts over a two week period&mdash;a step which alone frees up the equivalent of 150 extra officers and staff.

It measures time spent by police on core policing duties such as patrol, responding to 999 calls as well as activities of CID and specialist officers. In 2007-08 the front-line policing measure was 64.9 per cent. for police officers and 64.4 per cent. for patrol officers.</p>

	<p pid="b.611W.6/1">Weights and Measures law already applies to beer and it is an offence to serve short measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.6/2">We have considered whether there is a need to strengthen the law in this area to allow for the specific characteristics of beer and have carried out three public consultations on this issue. However, there was no consensus among stakeholders on whether action was necessary or if so what action should be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.6/3">Currently the law provides that a pint of beer can include a frothy head. Given that industry guidelines provide that consumers can ask for and receive a top up, we are satisfied that drinkers are sufficiently protected. Therefore, on balance, given the scale of the issue and the costs involved, we believe there is no need for further regulation at present.</p>

	<p pid="b.617W.2/2">The independent forensic science regulator was appointed in February 2008 and given responsibility for regulating forensic science quality standards. Since then he has published his Manual of Regulation, his Review of the Options for the Accreditation of Forensic Practitioners, and Quality standards for the Providers of Forensic Sciences to the Criminal Justice System. The regulator proposes to move to a more robust model of standards regulation that moves the focus from just forensic practitioners to include standards for organisations, practitioners and the science methods used. The forensic science laboratories are already accredited to testing international standards, accreditation that now includes assessment by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) of practitioner competence.</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.2/3">Policy decisions regarding forensic science rest with the Home Office and policy decisions regarding the public funding for CRFP are the responsibility of the National Policing Improvement Agency. However, such decisions were agreed with Home Office Ministers.

	<p pid="b.617W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice is committed to reducing its carbon emissions in accordance with the campaign initiated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Activities. In order to support this commitment MOJ has employed third party expertise to conduct a Green ICT Scorecard exercise. This analysis of the sustainability of IT operations in MOJ has helped to identify where current 'carbon hotspots' are and where MOJ should focus its efforts for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.5/2">The overall energy consumption of IT devices used by MOJ is difficult to evaluate as much of MOJ's estate is within buildings shared with other organisations like police and local councils. Within locations which house solely MOJ operations, IT devices are not metered separately from the other electrical equipment so the electricity consumption associated specifically with IT devices has not been determined.</p>
	<p pid="b.617W.5/3">As data centres are solely for housing and running IT equipment it can reasonably be considered that all power supplied to a data centre is for IT devices be it directly or indirectly. Because MOJ's IT is outsourced, all of its major data centres our outside of the MOJ estate and shared with other clients. As such the power consumption of these sites is not a direct cost to MOJ nor is it reported to MOJ. Nevertheless, MOJ has been working closely with its suppliers to include data centres in the Green ICT Scorecard work and it has already led to increased data centre energy efficiency without negatively affecting the volume or efficiency of data processing.</p>

	<p pid="b.618W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice is committed to reducing its carbon emissions in accordance with the campaign initiated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Activities and the Greening Government ICT Strategy. The MOJ recognises that making Green IT work is not just about technology but also about embedding sustainability in our process and behaviour as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.2/2">MOJ has worked to meet the 'Areas for ICT Carbon Reduction' in the Greening Government ICT Strategy improving the sustainability of its printing, the energy efficiency of its desktop PCs and data centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.2/3">MOJ has built sustainable IT principles into its IT policy and consideration of sustainability forms part of process of evaluation of changes to the IT estate. MOJ is working with its suppliers to improve the energy efficiency of IT operations both in its outsourced data centres and at its own sites and has employed third party expertise to analyse the sustainability of IT operations managed by a sample of MOJ's key suppliers and advise on how best to realise improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.2/4">This work has already led to increased data centre energy efficiency, and work on the centralisation of data processing will further reduce data centre energy consumption without negatively affecting the volume or efficiency of data processing carried out. The convergence of formerly separate networks offers better sharing of IT resources for staff and the reduction of the overall number of devices we need to deliver the same level of service.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.2/5">MOJ has also used initiatives to realise the positive impact that ICT can have on the overall carbon emissions of its operations. It continues to invest in video-conferencing and teleconferencing technology to reduce emissions. The imminent uplift of desktop PCs will offer not just improved power management to reduce energy consumption but also roaming profiles allowing any users to log to any machine helping support MOJ estates' goal of 80 per cent. desking and a reduction in the overall size of the MOJ HQ estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.618W.2/6">MOJ is also working on staff awareness of green IT issues. Campaigns have been run encouraging the shut down of electrical items outside of office hours, the reduction of printing and paper consumption and the better use of video-conferencing and teleconferencing to reduce travel.</p>

	<p pid="b.622W.3/12">In 2007-08 End of Custody Licence was introduced and some expenditure on subsistence payments made to prisoners on discharge has been included in the recorded expenditure for discharge grants. It would incur disproportionate costs to separate this amount as we would need to survey all prison establishments.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/13">The purpose of the Discharge Grant is to enable the prisoner to meet their immediate subsistence needs in the first week after release. Whether they are going straight into employment or applying for benefits, they will receive payment in arrears. Without a discharge grant, therefore, there would be an increased risk that prisoners would re-offend in order to meet their immediate financial needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/14">Sentenced prisoners are eligible on release for a Discharge Grant of &pound;46 unless certain exclusions apply. These exclusions include, for example: those serving a sentence of 14 days or less; those awaiting deportation or removal from the United Kingdom; those who are known to have in excess of &pound;8,000 in savings (and would therefore be ineligible for income support under the relevant regulations).</p>

	<p pid="b.625W.6/1">Community Payback (unpaid work) operates seven days a week with weekend projects in all probation areas. Evening Community Payback schemes are not always practical or cost effective given the types of work involved. However, 15 probation areas report that indoor Community Payback work placements are operated in the evenings.</p>

	<p pid="b.625W.6/3">Last year (2007-08) 55,771 people successfully completed Community Payback sentences. This amounts to over 6 million hours of free labour, which was used to benefit the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.6/4">Projects have included removing graffiti, bringing derelict areas and buildings back into public use, clearing church yards, country streams and unused allotments, repairing park benches and playground equipment. A lot of work is undertaken on environmental projects and also with schools, community centres, with faith groups and local authorities. It would not be practical or cost effective to undertake many of these tasks during the evening.</p>

	<p pid="b.630W.2/3">The Office of Criminal Justice Reform has recently updated the information pack &quot;information for the bereaved&quot; given by Family Liaison Officers to bereaved family and friends following murder and manslaughter. This pack provides useful information about decisions and arrangements bereaved families and friends may need to make. It also explains how the Criminal Justice System works and the role of the police, the coroner and the courts. It provides contact details of various organisations and support groups to which bereaved families and friends can be signposted. The updated guide is due to be published in May.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.2/4">The Office for Criminal Justice Reform has been working closely with Support after Murder and Manslaughter (SAMM) to develop the services the charity provides to victims of homicide and improve awareness of victim needs within partner organisations, particularly the police service. SAMM staff and volunteers deliver training to family liaison officers and other statutory agencies who provide direct support to those bereaved through homicide.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.2/5">SAMM receives a grant of &pound;140,000 a year from the OCJR to deliver services.</p>

	<p pid="b.644W.5/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.5/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to respond to your questions on what the average waiting time for calls to the Crisis Loans Direct helpline to be answered was in each of the last 12 months and how many telephone calls were (a) made to and (b) answered by the Crisis Loans Direct helpline in each of the last 12 months. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.5/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus does not have a Crisis Loan Direct helpline. Crisis Loans operate from 20 of our Benefit Delivery Centres (BDC's) across the country, each with a dedicated telephone number. Currently these BDC's do not operate on the same telephony platform. The information requested is therefore not available in the format requested, as the data cannot be compared. The roll-out of the Internet Protocol Contact Centre telephony platform into BDC's will provide us with comparable data by the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.5/6" class="indent">In the last two years Crisis Loan applications have more than doubled and since July 2008 averaged around 230,000 applications per month. Since January 2009 we have seen further increases in applications to 275,000 for January and 272,000 for February 2009. This increase in demand means customers in some areas may not get through first time. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that people fail to get through ultimately.</p>

It is normal and consistent with domestic equality legislation for pensions and benefits schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives. Attendance allowance must be seen in the context of the interlocking nature of the social security scheme and the fact that the cut-off age will tend to coincide with a time when a person becomes entitled to a range of other benefits and services.</p>

	<p pid="b.650W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what estimate he has made of (a) the number of people who have used the Jobcentre Plus rapid response service in the last 12 months and (b) the number and proportion of those people who found employment through the service. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.0/4" class="indent">The rapid response service (RRS) was expanded in November 2008. The service is now available whenever an employer is faced with a possible need to make people redundant. We contact each employer who notifies the Insolvency Service of a proposal to make 20 or more people redundant at one establishment. We also offer RRS support to other employers who we know are going to make people redundant whenever we judge that the potential impact on the local labour market of the cumulative effect of recent redundancies justifies using RRS.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.0/5" class="indent">Since the service was expanded, over 1,000 employers have accepted offers of RRS support for employees facing redundancy, or the possibility of redundancy. Our administrative records suggest that, all told, more than 150,000 employees were facing possible redundancy in those situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.0/6" class="indent">We do not record the numbers of people finding jobs during the delivery of RRS support. The RRS is just one part of the overall service we provide to people who lose their jobs and need help to move back into work as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.650W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.3/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how many (a) benefit delivery centres, (b) customer-facing jobcentres and (c) contact centres Jobcentre Plus operated in each (i) region and (ii) Jobcentre Plus District in each year since 2002. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.3/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus inherited around 1,500 offices from the merger of the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service in 2002. We have modernised our Jobcentre network to improve customer service, rationalising our estate to provide excellent coverage with integrated customer facing offices, at the same time reducing cost to the tax payer. We remain the largest office network in Government with 741 modern Jobcentres. These offices are supported by modern Contact Centres and main Benefit Delivery Centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.3/5" class="indent">The great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have around half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.3/6" class="indent">Our Contact Centre network was set up in 2006 and there are currently 31 Contact Centres. Our Benefit Delivery Centre network was established in late 2007 with 79 centres and all remain in place. The information you have requested is only available at regional/country level and can be found in the following tables.</p>

	<p pid="b.654W.3/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking how his Department measures the performance against objectives of the Jobcentre Plus rapid response service; and what information his Department collects on the job outcomes of the Jobcentre Plus rapid response service. These fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.654W.3/4" class="indent">Our objective is to ensure that the support of the rapid response service (RRS) is offered whenever it might be appropriate for the employer and employees concerned. The purpose of the RRS is to provide early and immediate help to employees facing redundancy through advice and support on such issues as benefits, the local labour market and effective job search.</p>
	<p pid="b.654W.3/5" class="indent">In that context, we contact each employer who notifies the Insolvency Service of a proposal to make 20 or more people redundant, and also offer support to other employers we believe to be making redundancies whenever we judge that the cumulative impact of redundancies on the local labour market justifies using RRS. In some cases employers contact us, and we will always support employees facing redundancy through RRS when asked to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.654W.3/6" class="indent">Since we extended the RRS in November 2008, we have kept an administrative record of the number of employers who take up our offer of support.</p>
	<p pid="b.654W.3/7" class="indent">We do not attempt systematically to record other information, such as the numbers of employees who are given advice and support through RRS, or the job outcomes achieved for the former employees of particular employers, as to do so would be prohibitively expensive. Accordingly, information on the numbers of job outcomes achieved for people who access support through the RRS is not available.</p>

	<p pid="b.661W.5/1">The level of fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance is estimated using results from a sample survey of benefit claims, which is designed to produce a robust estimate at the national level.</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.5/2">The first Monetary Value of Fraud and Error (MVFE) target for Income Support/Jobseeker's Allowance (IS/JSA) in SR02 ran from a baseline year of 1997-98 through to 2005-06. During this period as well as the national estimates used to evaluate progress against the target, tables were also published that showed estimates of MVFE for Government Office Regions, which were equivalent to JCP regions from 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.5/3">With the introduction of a new SR04 target in 2005-06 DWP statisticians analysed the historical regional estimates produced during SR02 to assess whether they had been a robust indicator of MVFE at regional level. Analysis showed that for many regions the estimates of fraud and error fluctuated substantially year on year. These fluctuations were judged to be due to the relatively small sample of claims investigated in any one region. Since the sample survey is designed to produce the best estimate at a national level, estimates of fraud and error at a lower geographical level are based on a small sample of claims and have a high risk of not accurately representing the amount of fraud and error for all claims in a region.</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.5/4">Following this analysis DWP have not published regional estimates from 2006-07 onwards as they were judged to be not robust enough to meet the standards required of national statistics and there was a high risk that fluctuations in the estimates would be misinterpreted as indicating real change in fraud and error in the regions.</p>

	<p pid="b.663W.5/4">Small and medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) will be top priority for Train to Gain funds including the &pound;350 million growth over the next two years which was announced in the re-budget Report. The &pound;350 million is within the overall Train to Gain delivery' budget heading.</p>
	<p pid="b.663W.5/5">The 2009-10 grant letter to the Learning and Skills Council sets out the budget for Train to Gain. Train to Gain is a growing programme and we plan to invest &pound;925 million through Train to Gain in 2009-10 and this will increase to over &pound;1 billion per year by 2010-11. Train to Gain is a demand-led service and as such it is not possible to predict the budget spend for 2009-10 for SMEs.</p>
