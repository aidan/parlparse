	<p pid="d.7W.0/2">Casinos other than 2005 Act casinos are licensed under the Gaming Act 1968. The 1968 Act established the principle of permitted areas in order to prevent a proliferation in the number of small casinos.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.0/3">This remains a key objective of the Government's casino policy: we believe that limiting casinos licensed under the 1968 Act to the 53 permitted areas will continue to act as a deterrent to proliferation, as it is unlikely that operators will want to open more casinos in these limited geographical areas than the market there can naturally sustain.</p>

	<p pid="d.11W.0/1">A pilot mystery shopping exercise was undertaken in the summer of 2007 on remote sites operated by prospective licensees and others. The Commission also conducts an ongoing programme of mystery shopping visits to remote gambling websites as part of its wider compliance effort for licensed remote gambling operators. The Commission expects to conduct further testing of operators licensed in other jurisdictions but to date all of those tested since <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase> under the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005 are operators licensed in Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="d.20W.8/1">The purpose of pilots is to investigate the issues surrounding the use of various potential innovations in electoral administration and gain learning that will inform development of policy and possible future e-counting solutions. One of the aims of the e-counting pilots that took place in May 2007, for example, was to investigate whether commercially available scanning machines could successfully be used in an e-counting solution. The pilots demonstrated that it is possible to use commercially available scanning machines, and this should lead to lower costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.20W.8/2">All electoral pilots are evaluated by the Electoral Commission, which makes recommendations regarding the future operation of particular innovations. These evaluations usually encapsulate the key lessons and recommendations from each pilot. The Government take these into account alongside lessons learned during development and implementation of the pilots themselves and, where relevant, the experience of e-counting elsewhere in the UK and overseas.</p>

	<p pid="d.22W.14/1">The numbers of suicides and self-harm incidents since 1998 are contained in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="d.22W.14/2">The National Offender Management Service has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of Prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. ACCT is the prisoner-centred flexible care-planning system introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07 to replace the old F2052SH system.</p>
	<p pid="d.22W.14/3">Any death in custody is a tragic event. The Government are committed to learning from such events and reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in state custody. We are implementing many of the recommendations of Robert Fulton's Review of the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody. From April 2009, a new three tier Ministerial Council on Deaths in Custody will replace the existing forum and the Ministerial Roundtable on Suicide.</p>

Instead, the code reflects current guidance and practice in this area, in particular with regard to security considerations.</p>

	<p pid="d.34W.3/1">Piracy is an international problem that requires an international solution. Piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden are less than 0.1 per cent. of the estimated 16,000 vessels which pass through the region annually. The Government are however, very concerned by increasing numbers of incidents in and around Somali waters. The EU is planning a counter piracy operation to which the UK will provide the operation commander and operation headquarters. EU partners agree that any operation must be co-ordinated with NATO and Combined Task Force 150, themselves active to deter piracy off the Horn of Africa. The UK contributes to both. The UK Government are also tackling piracy at its roots on land. Through the Department for International Development, the UK has allocated &pound;25 million to support efforts to tackle instability in Somalia. The instability creates the conditions allowing piratical activities to flourish.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/2">The Department for Transport has issued advice to seafarers on the measures that can be taken to prevent acts of piracy and armed robbery in Marine Guidance Note 298. We have also urged masters to obtain up to date information about pirate attacks in order to plan their passage through the Gulf of Aden. This advice can be obtained from the Royal Navy's UK Maritime Trade Operation based in Dubai. The shipping industry has also been informed of the Maritime Security Patrol Area (MPSA) established by the Combined Maritime Forces. The MPSA does not eliminate the risk of criminal activity and shipping has been warned to exercise extreme caution and vigilance.</p>

	<p pid="d.38W.12/2">National legislation, brought in during 1998, requires that all coaches and minibuses irrespective of their age, that carry groups of children aged three to 15 years on organised school trips, including dedicated home-to-school transport, are equipped with seat belts.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.12/3">Since <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase>, seat belts have been required to be installed in each forward and rearward facing seat in all new buses. There is derogation from these requirements for buses specifically designed for urban use with standing passengers, when used for scheduled commercial services, whether or not school children are being carried.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.12/4">The Department for Transport has made no recent estimate of the cost of retrospectively fitting seat belts to all vehicles used for school transport.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.12/5">The decision not to require the retrospective fitting of seat belts to urban buses was taken primarily on technical grounds. A review of the design of buses and of the materials used in their construction concluded that seat belts could not be easily installed in such a way as to be effective without very significant changes being made to the vehicle's construction.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.12/6">While modern coaches are designed to accommodate seat belts, the strength of the important structural points in buses has generally remained unaltered.</p>

	<p pid="d.41W.6/1">The National Alcohol Strategy 'Safe.Sensible.Social' sets out the Government's plan to minimise the health harms, violence and antisocial behaviour associated with alcohol, while ensuring that people are able to enjoy alcohol safely and responsibly. The Strategy focuses action on three groups most at risk which are 18-24 year old binge drinkers, young people under 18 who drink alcohol, and harmful drinkers whose drinking is damaging their health, often without them realising it. The Strategy contains a range of measures to tackle alcohol related crime and disorder, which will have an effect on the number of people becoming drunk and disorderly in public, therefore reducing the number who end up in police custody.</p>
	<p pid="d.41W.6/2">In particular, the Home Office has funded 13 alcohol arrest referral pilots around the country. Alcohol arrest referral schemes make provision, in suitable cases, for adults arrested for alcohol-related offences to be referred to brief advice sessions. Sessions are structured to inform arrestees about the links between unsafe drinking and offending. The schemes aim to reduce offending rates among binge drinkers who are not dependent on alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="d.41W.6/3">Additionally, the Government have also recently launched a new, hard-hitting &pound;4 million national advertising campaign, under the Know Your Limits banner, to drive home the serious consequences of binge drinking. It poses the question:</p>

In 2008-09 125 IDVA services were allocated grants including the 104 services supporting the specialist domestic violence courts. This includes four sites in Hampshire at Alton, Andover, Portsmouth and Southampton. The Government also allocated funding in 2008-09 to Government offices for the expansion of IDVA services (and multi-agency risk assessment conferences) locally and anticipates that funding will be made available again in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="d.47W.0/3">The administrative costs of DBOs are assumed to be equivalent of an ASBO; &pound;5 million to &pound;30 million. The custodial costs of a DBO are lower (than an ASBO) since the shorter DBOs are assumed to have fewer breaches. This is estimated to be &pound;0.5 million to &pound;2.5 million or &pound;2 million to &pound;10 million, if the increased number requires new prison places to be constructed. This assumes an equal mix of two, six and 12-month DBOs. The additional construction costs are not expected to be necessary as the total impact is expected to be less than 100 prison places. Even this scenario allows for six times more DBOs than there are currently ASBOs.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.0/4">This implies total costs in the range of &pound;5.5 million to &pound;32.5 million. These estimates do not take into account the possible impacts on the profits of businesses who may lose revenue from banned drinkers.</p>

	<p pid="d.54W.2/1">The National Policing Improvement Agency's (NPIA) Missing Persons Bureau has been developing its services to police forces, partners and stakeholders. This includes examining the protocols for the capture, storage and matching of DNA in missing persons' cases, and work with the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) on their Action Plan on Young Runaways, launched in June 2008. The Bureau has a change programme with over 40 enhancements designed to develop its response to missing person investigations.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.2/2">A new national child rescue alert system is being developed and will enable the Bureau to launch United Kingdom-wide alerts and to participate in launching cross-border alerts with other European Union (EU) member states.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.2/3">The Bureau is involved in an EU-sponsored (Justice and Home Affairs Council) joint Anglo-French alert exercise to determine if a national scheme is viable for the United Kingdom and test a hypothesis of how such a scheme might work.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.2/4">The Bureau is currently liaising with the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (USA) and with four EU member states in this development programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.2/5">A review is currently being carried out of the state of 'unidentified body' cases within forces and encouraging forensic reviews. Work is also being done to establish an effective DNA strategy for missing persons' enquiries and the Bureau is developing its IT system (Hermes) to enable automatic and electronic transfer of data from police forces to the Bureau and onwards to the charity Missing People.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.2/6">One of the key future priorities for the Bureau is the development of a code of practice to create a national 'picture' of missing people. A code will generate accurate and timely data to enable the new national indicator on runaways as part of the National Indicator Set for 2009-2010. This indicator (NI71) is designed to secure effective joint working between children's services, the police and other local partners to ensure that necessary data about young runaways is collected, analysed and used to assist in safeguarding children. This code of practice has been drafted and consultation ends on November 21.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.2/7">A co-hosted event with the charity Missing People will be held in April 2009 to raise awareness and to share best practice.</p>

	<p pid="d.61W.5/2">Sheep rustling is a crime and is covered under the Theft Act 1968. The Government's Crime Strategy has now moved away from centrally imposed targets toward making local agencies accountable and responsive to the needs and priorities of the local community. Where sheep rustling emerges as a pressing local issue there is a local framework in place for local police forces and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships to devote resources to tackling this crime.</p>
	<p pid="d.61W.5/3">The Home Office has recently presented a Tilley Award for innovation to a partnership between the police and industry in the Glens of Antrim, Northern Ireland, which tackled theft of sheep. This project used new technology to identify individual sheep through retinal scanning. It is reported that this has been very effective in the area in reducing the number of sheep stolen and assisting in successful prosecution. The Home Office has made no other assessment of sheep rustling.</p>

	<p pid="d.65W.3/1">School cleanliness is the responsibility of the head teacher and governors and the local authority where they are the employer. The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 Regulation 9 and the Approved Code of Practice on the regulations issued by the Health and Safety Executive cover cleanliness. More specifically &quot;Toilets in Schools&quot; a recent departmental document on Teachernet makes clear the importance of well designed and well maintained facilities so that pupils can and will make regular use of them. The Government have made a number of steps. The BSF Furniture and Equipment (F &amp; E) brief aims to encourage schools and bidders to recognise the role furniture can play within the transformational agenda. As part of this aim, it will make clear the expectations for furniture such as the need for improved strength and stability criteria as set out in part 2 of the new European standard EN1729. It is also proposed to include the ergonomic requirements of EN1729 part 1. A 30-month research project the Department has recently commissioned into the accommodation implications of personalised learning will examine the role furniture can play in ensuring flexible layouts. The Department have also published a website which gives ergonomic dimensions for furniture in order that designers have the most up-to-date data from which to work on new designs. Quality of furniture in schools can often lie in making the right choices of furniture, the Department's website aims to ensure that schools buy appropriately sized furniture. Many of our design guides give details on purchasing quality furniture and how to ensure it is 'fit for purpose', one of the key indicators of quality.</p>

	<p pid="d.66W.5/2">The proportion of teenagers who drink regularly is falling but those who do drink are drinking a lot more. Young people who drink too much not only put their own health at risk, but are more likely to get involved in antisocial behaviour and contribute to insecurity on our streets. The Youth Alcohol Action Plan, published in June, sets out a number of actions to address the problems of young people's alcohol consumption. We will provide clearer health information for parents and young people about how consumption of alcohol, particularly at an early age, can affect children and young people. This will include the chief medical officer's guidelines on safer drinking by young people and a comprehensive communications campaign aimed at 11 to 15 year-olds to be launched in spring 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.66W.5/3">In line with recommendations from an independent review of drug and alcohol education, Ministers announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-30">30 October 2008</phrase> that Personal Health and Social Education (PHSE) would be made statutory subject. This would underline the key role PSHE has to play in young people's personal development.</p>
	<p pid="d.66W.5/4">Very few young people are addicted to alcohol but we know that a small proportion of young people do drink too much which puts them at risk of harm. DCSF are working closely with the National Treatment Agency (NTA) to continue to improve the accessibility and quality of substance misuse treatment for young people (under 18), with the aim of ensuring that effective treatment is available for any young person with alcohol problems that needs it.</p>

	<p pid="d.69W.5/1">Over a period of four years, April 2004 to March 2008, the Department for Work and Pensions has, on average, recruited 8,200 new employees per year. The bulk of the new employees are recruited by Jobcentre Plus on behalf of both itself and other parts of the Department. The Department during the same period recruited, on average, 75 new employees per year into either the senior civil service, or into specialist or professional roles. In respect of these recruitments, the Department operates a framework agreement under which five suppliers have been selected to provide recruitment consultancy services. The suppliers are Hays, Capita, Assessment and Development Ltd., PricewaterhouseCoopers and Water for Fish.</p>
	<p pid="d.69W.5/2">The Department is also able to draw on a number of other suppliers from a framework agreement operated by the Cabinet Office for senior civil service recruitment. The suppliers in question are Rockpools, Moloney Search, Strategic Dimensions, Gatenby Sanderson, Egon Zehnder, Saxton Bampfylde Hever, Veredus, Hays, Penna, Whitehead Mann, Hoggart Bowers and Odgers Ray and Berndtson.</p>
	<p pid="d.69W.5/3">The amount spent on recruitment consultants are given as follows. Information for 20003-04 and 2004-05 could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

We have had very constructive discussions with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and others on their proposal that we extend the higher rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance to children and working age people with severe visual impairments.

	<p pid="d.81W.5/1">From December 2004, the standard interest rate used to calculate support for mortgage interest payments in income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance and state pension credit was changed to respond to changes in the Bank of England base rate. The standard interest rate is the Bank of England base rate plus an additional 1.58 per cent. This is more representative, transparent, easier to understand and easier to administer than the previous method, which was based upon an average of building society interest rates. The additional 1.58 per cent. recognises the fact that lenders' interest rates are set at a higher rate than the base rate and to ensure that no-one lost out when the method of calculation changed.</p>

	<p pid="d.83W.2/1">The pension credit application process has been simplified to make it easier to apply. Customers no longer need to sign and return their pension credit forms as applications can be made entirely over the telephone.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.2/2">A further simplification has been introduced this November which enables claims to housing benefit and council tax benefit to be made over the telephone with the pension credit application and forwarded directly to the local authority without the need for a signature.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.2/3">On completion of the application, customers are issued with a statement of details informing them of all the details used by the Pension, Disability and Carers Service in processing the application.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.2/4">In February 2007 an additional question was introduced into the pension credit application process to identify customers with caring responsibilities which results in the customer being invited, where appropriate, to claim carer's allowance using a new, shortened, claim pack specifically designed for people of pension age.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.2/5">These changes represent a significant improvement to the claim process and will enhance the overall customer experience for thousands of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.2/6">While the new method of applying by telephone is being promoted, customers can still request a clerical pension credit application form if they wish and will be sent an application pack. However, by answering a few simple questions, the application form can now be tailored to match their personal circumstances and will contain only the relevant questions to complete. Customer letters are also now available in Welsh and/or large print formats and are issued automatically, ensuring the customer receives the same speed of service as a customer requesting an English language standard print letter.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.2/7">A number of partnership organisations such as Age Concern, North East Pensioners Association (NEPA) and Better Government for Older People (BGOP) were involved in the redesign process and provided input into the final products which were subject to scrutiny by the Social Security Advisory Committee.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.2/8">The Pension, Disability and Carers Service continues to promote the take up of all pensioner benefits, entitlements and services through a range of marketing activities. Campaign activity in 2008-09 to promote the take up of pension credit has utilised direct mail, local partnership activity and regional radio, press and outdoor advertising.</p>

	<p pid="d.86W.2/1">The proposed Regulation changes will not apply to lone parents who: are in receipt of Carer's Allowance; have a child for whom they are receiving the middle or higher rate care component of Disability Living Allowance; foster children. These lone parents will be exempt and continue to be eligible for Income Support.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/2">Lone parents in these circumstances who are also home educators are included in this group. Those lone parents who do not qualify for exemption and are capable of work will have to claim Jobseeker's Allowance, where they will be required to actively seek and be available for work of at least 16 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/3">However, it is recognised that lone parents who home educate may face unique and varied circumstances. Therefore we are ensuring that Jobcentre Plus Personal Advisers will have the appropriate training and guidance to deal with home educators when they make a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance. This will include making use of the proposed additional flexibilities to the Jobseeker's Allowance regime where the individual circumstances of home educators make this necessary. In addition home educators, like all other lone parents, will not be penalised if they have good cause for not taking up a job and the availability and suitability of childcare will be central to such a decision.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.2/4">As there is no requirement for parents to register as home educators there are no official statistics on the number of children who are being home educated. Therefore, it is not possible to provide any breakdown of lone parents who home educate whether through necessity or choice. Research carried out by York Consulting in 2006 estimated that around 20,000 children from all types of families were then registered with their local authority as being educated at home. We recognise that the figure could be substantially higher.</p>

At this meeting the individual circumstances of each lone parent will be considered.

There are still a number of 2007 payments outstanding for legal reasons, predominantly involving the settlement of probate.</p>

Vaccine is delivered through existing veterinary medicine supply chains, an approach agreed with the livestock industry to ensure the simple, rapid roll-out of vaccine to protect animals earlier this year. Because the approach to vaccination is voluntary, no definitive figures can be provided on the numbers of livestock actually vaccinated.</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.2/2">Vaccine was rolled out incrementally as it became available from the manufacturers in 2008, beginning with the south-east in May, and gradually westward and northward throughout the summer, until vaccine was available to the counties in northern England in September.</p>

	<p pid="d.96W.5/3">If a resident is fulfilling the requirements of the section 46 notice, by separating out recyclates and placing them in the correct receptacles and yet still generates too much residual waste to fit in the receptacle provided for residual waste, the authority may make arrangements with the household for a larger or additional receptacle to be used.</p>
	<p pid="d.96W.5/4">A waste collection authority must collect all household waste presented in the manner it has specified in the section 46 notice. Provisions in the Climate Change Bill do not alter this duty.</p>

	<p pid="d.101W.2/1">Farmgate milk prices are determined by a number of factors, including the time of year; exchange rates; prices of dairy commodities prices on world and community markets; supply and demand; the value of the product mix; and for some contracts, production costs are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.2/2">With production in its seasonal trough, farmgate prices are likely to have reached the peak of this cycle. As production increases towards the spring, farmgate prices will fall. How far and fast they will fall will depend on the adjustments needed to the downside of the commodity cycle. Prices for products such as butter and milk powders are currently falling on EU and world markets. The global economic downturn is also likely to have an impact on dairy commodity prices and demand. In time, this will feed through to farmgate prices. However, because of exchange rates and the large liquid milk market in Great Britain, the full effects of the downturn in commodity markets are unlikely to be fed through into farmgate prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.2/3">The exception is Northern Ireland, which is more reliant on the trade in commodity products than the rest of the UK. Northern Irish producers are therefore the first to benefit from increasing commodity prices and the first to experience falling farmgate prices as commodity prices weaken.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.2/4">Looking to the longer term, prices will recover as demand increases. However, farmgate prices are likely to become more volatile in future as the market is further deregulated.</p>

	<p pid="d.101W.5/1">The European Court of Justice in its judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-15">15 July 2004</phrase> in case C-424/02 found that the UK had failed to take the measures necessary to give priority to the processing of waste oils by regeneration to fulfil the requirement in the Waste Oils Directive (75/439/EEC as amended). However, since that time a revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) has been developed which repeals the Waste Oils Directive, and includes a revised waste hierarchy. The text of the revised WFD was adopted by the Environment Council of Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-20">20 October 2008</phrase>, and following its publication in the <i> Official Journal</i>, the UK and other member states will have two years to transpose its requirements.</p>

	<p pid="d.105W.9/1">Recent and current research and monitoring studies have identified further losses in both the thickness and extent of Arctic ice.</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.9/2" class="italic"> Sea ice</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.9/3">Last month, scientists from University College London reported that the thickness of Arctic sea ice was significantly lower (by an average of 10 per cent.) during the winter of 2007-08 than during the previous five winters, indicating that the total volume of sea ice has decreased significantly. Though based only on satellite data (which are not ideal for measuring sea ice thickness), this result confirms previous evidence of decreasing sea ice thickness over the past three decades from U.S. and U.K. submarine sonar measurements.</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.9/4">Satellite monitoring since 1979 also shows there has been a long-term decline in the extent of summer Arctic sea ice and this decline has accelerated over the last decade. The summer minimum in 2008 was slightly greater than the record low in 2007, but was still the second lowest year on record, despite relatively cool temperatures this year. The latest generation of climate models developed by the Met Office Hadley Centre, under its joint DECC and MOD-funded Integrated Climate Programme, appears to capture the recent trend well and indicates that this decline will continue over coming years.</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.9/5" class="italic"> Greenland Ice Sheet</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.9/6">UK researchers have been using satellite data and other observations to monitor changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet. The longer term results show that the total ice mass has decreased over the past few decades and recent observations indicate that the duration and total area of surface melting on the ice sheet was higher during summer 2007 than during any other summer since records began in 1973. This year, there has been significant loss of ice from Petermann and Jakobshavn Isbrae glaciers. Continuing ice sheet loss has major implications for sea levels rise and DECC is working with UK researchers to understand and model ice sheet dynamics better, to improve estimates of where the Greenland ice sheet 'tipping point' might be in relation to global temperature increase.</p>

	<p pid="d.112W.8/2">The EU emissions trading scheme sits at the heart of our strategy for reducing emissions from the power sector. All power plants have to operate within the cap on emissions set by the EU ETS and we are actively supporting current proposals to tighten the cap year on year to 2020 and beyond, setting us on a pathway to achieve our 2020 and longer term emission goals.</p>
	<p pid="d.112W.8/3">Although the separate processes involved in CCS&mdash;capture, transport and storage&mdash;have been proven on an individual basis over many years, the application of the full chain of CCS technology on a commercial-scale power station has not yet been demonstrated. Until the operation of the full chain of CCS in conjunction with a power station has been proven, it would not be prudent to require new coal plants to be fitted with CCS or to set a date by which this would be required. The urgency for demonstrating the foil chain of CCS is why the UK Government are supporting one of the world's first commercial-scale demonstration projects.</p>

	<p pid="d.114W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-15">15 October 2008</phrase> the European Commission adopted amendments to EFRS 39 and IFRS 7, with the unanimous support of member states. These amendments ensured that EU companies have the same flexibility as their American competitors to reclassify assets held-for-trading into the held-to-maturity category. The current financial crisis justifies the use of reclassification by companies. In these circumstances, financial institutions in the EU would no longer have to reflect market fluctuation in their financial statements for these kinds of assets. These changes will apply as from the third quarter of 2008.</p>

On average, black and minority ethnic (BME) households send remittances three and a half times a year, although this varies by ethnic group. DFID recognises the positive impact that these money transfers can make on people's lives in developing countries, and has an active agenda to improve the developmental impact of remittances, seeking to help make remittances cheaper, safer and more accessible.

Member to our <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-02">2 September 2008</phrase> statement on the package of measures responding to housing market conditions which confirmed that the social housing grant would be opened up to all stock-owning local authorities as well as local authorities with arms length management organisations. We are working with the Housing Corporation on the practicalities and the timetable for delivering this. No local authorities have applied for funding so far.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.6/2">We have also introduced other measures to create incentives for councils to build and acquire new homes. S313 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 provides that councils can keep the full rental income from new council homes (including newly built and newly acquired properties). We also intend to make changes to the capital regulations, in order to allow councils to keep the full receipts from new council homes. We expect to consult shortly on the use of S313 power and the capital receipts regulations which aim to enable councils to benefit in full from rental income or sales receipts from properties that have been built or acquired since this planned change to these rules.</p>

	<p pid="d.133W.4/1">The number of direct engagements (regardless of the instigator) involving the international security assistance force (ISAF) and insurgents in Helmand province for the last three years are as follows:</p>
	<table>

	</table>
	<p pid="d.133W.4/10">ISAF forces operating in Helmand come from a number of different nations, which often operate closely alongside each other. These forces also operate very closely alongside Afghan Army and police units. Without undertaking a detailed assessment of each engagement, it is not possible precisely to define in every case whether an attack was aimed at UK forces, at our ISAF partners, or against Afghan units. Data is therefore collected on the number of incidents involving ISAF forces in Helmand without attempting to identify the nationality of the forces actually being attacked. The environment also makes it extremely difficult precisely to distinguish between incidents initiated by insurgent forces and those initiated by ISAF.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.4/11">This data is based on information derived from a number of sources and can only be an estimate, not least because of the difficulties in ensuring a consistent interpretation of the basis for collating statistics in a complex fast-moving multinational operational environment.</p>

	<p pid="d.137W.8/1">The comparison requested is not possible as, under the then Gurkha Terms and Conditions of Service, a Gurkha sergeant would not serve beyond the 18 year point. He would have been awarded a pension under the Gurkha Pension Scheme, payable straight away, while his regular Army counterpart would have been awarded a preserved pension under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 (AFPS 75) payable at age 60. Assuming that both individuals were aged 40 when they left, the ex-Gurkha sergeant would have received 20 years pension before his regular Army counterpart was entitled to receive his pension benefits.</p>
	<p pid="d.137W.8/2">I should mention that under the new Gurkha Terms and Conditions of Service, all sergeants transferred to the same engagement as British personnel which means that they, too, could potentially serve to the 22 year point, with pension benefits under either AFPS 75 or AFPS 05, depending on which they chose.</p>

	<p pid="d.153W.5/1">The Government's stance on piracy has recently been reviewed. This has resulted in a move to a more proactive posture whereby Royal Navy (RN) units in the region will actively seek out pirates, and we have issued them with more robust guidance to deal with any pirates encountered. The RN will contribute to counter-piracy operations through three international efforts.</p>
	<p pid="d.153W.5/2">The UK is already engaged in efforts to combat acts of piracy off Somalia, through the Combined Task Force (CTF) 150, which has established a Maritime Security Patrol Area (MSPA) in the Gulf of Aden.

	<p pid="d.153W.5/3">Standing NATO Maritime Group 2, including attached RN units, has also deployed to the region with a mandate which allows it to conduct counter-piracy operations from mid-October. NATO is considering the ways in which this mandate can be implemented including the escorting of World Food Programme shipping into port in Mogadishu.</p>
	<p pid="d.153W.5/4">We have also supported EU planning for a counter-piracy naval operation off the coast of Somalia, and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-14">14 October</phrase> the EU Political and Security Committee decided to accept the offer made by the UK to provide the Operation Commander (Rear Admiral Phil Jones) and the Operation HQ (the Multinational Headquarters at Northwood). On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-10">10 November</phrase> EU Foreign and Defence Ministers met at the General Affairs and External Relations Council and agreed a joint action to set up the operation. A separate decision is expected in December to launch the operation. The UK offer is subject to sufficient forces being generated for an operation likely to begin in December.</p>

	<p pid="d.158W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October</phrase> HM Government made the Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008. This requires all persons in the UK (and UK persons elsewhere) to freeze funds owned, held or controlled by Landsbanki, including those owned held or controlled in relation to Landsbanki by certain Icelandic Authorities or the Government of Iceland. The Order was made because the Icelandic Government, its authorities and Landsbanki appeared to be on the brink of action which would be to the detriment of the UK economy, including detrimental treatment of UK depositors.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.0/2">The effect of the Order is that all funds owned, held or controlled by Landsbanki in the UK are frozen. Landsbanki funds may only be released from frozen accounts in the UK under the authority of a licence granted by HMT. No freezing orders have been made in respect of other Icelandic banks.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.0/3">The Order was made under a power contained in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. This Act includes a broad range of provisions and is not only about countering terrorism. The power enables the Treasury to make a freezing order where the Treasury reasonably believe that action to the detriment of the UK economy (or part of it) has been or is likely to be taken by a foreign government or resident of a foreign country or territory. As we have made clear the UK's action was not taken on the basis of the anti-terrorism provisions in the Act.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.0/4">As envisaged by the 2001 Act, the Landsbanki Freezing Order also gives the Treasury power to licence exceptions to the freeze. Granting licences is an integral part of the Treasury's ongoing role in relation to the freezing order, in particular, in minimising potential harmful consequences, while providing the necessary safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.0/5">The Treasury's approach has been to publish general licences and guidance to deal with industry concerns. A general licence was granted on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-09">9 October</phrase>. This dealt with the concern of allowing the London branch of Landsbanki to continue its commercial finance operations, on which a number of UK businesses depend for their immediate cash flow. This licence also confirmed a broad range of transactions that were permitted, including that third parties could set-off and net out arrangements where Landsbanki was the counterparty. A further licence was granted on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-13">13 October</phrase>, to provide reassurance to a wide range of market participants who might otherwise be in a position of dealing with frozen funds.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.0/6">In response to inquiries received, the Treasury published a series of notices to ensure the scope of the Freezing Order was clear to UK financial institutions. The notice published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-17">17 October</phrase> provided detailed guidance and reiterated that other Icelandic banks and companies were not affected by the Freezing Order. It was published on the Treasury's website and was also sent to financial institutions in the UK via the financial sanctions e-mail notification service.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.0/7">In response to a request from certain financial institutions, the Treasury granted a licence on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-07">7 November</phrase> in relation to securities settlement through exchanges where there is no central counterparty.</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.0/8">In addition, the Treasury liaised with the major UK banks to ensure that the freezing order was not preventing payments to Icelandic companies; discussed individual transactions with banks that advised transactions had been blocked because of the Order; and made clear that the Order does not prohibit UK banks from transferring money to Iceland in payment for imports of Icelandic fish (as long as they are not unlicensed &quot;frozen funds&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="d.158W.0/9">The Chancellor announced the Order was being made in his statement to the House on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October</phrase>. As is generally the case in relation to asset freezes, prior notice was not given to the persons designated under the Order, so as not to prompt asset flight.</p>

	<p pid="d.176W.2/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics has responsibility for contributions to the revision of the System of National Accounts 1993.

	<p pid="d.176W.2/7" class="indent">The proposed change to the treatment of pension liabilities in the new System of National Accounts aims to quantify and recognise future pension benefits as liabilities of social security schemes or unfunded employer schemes.

My officials have raised the detentions directly with the Chinese authorities both in Beijing and London.</p>

	<p pid="d.183W.5/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice advises against all travel to eastern and north eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including North Kivu. British nationals in the affected areas are likely to be working with international aid agencies and UN agencies. These organisations have their own security systems in place for evacuation of staff and take advice from MONUC locally. The British embassy in Kinshasa is able to provide limited consular assistance to British nationals in need of emergency assistance. The embassy also has a diplomat based in Goma who, as part of his role, is able to offer ad hoc consular advice and assistance.</p>

The role of the Foreign Secretary's Special Representative for Climate Change is to help build the political conditions for the transition to a low-carbon economy. So far six targeted diplomatic campaigns have been established in support of this objective. My right hon. Friend The Foreign Secretary's Special Representative for Climate Change is closely involved in the design and implementation of the campaigns and represents my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary with key partners.</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.6/3">Progress has been made in building more favourable political conditions. For example, there is now much greater awareness among partner governments that a successful and rapid transition to low carbon is a requisite condition for security and prosperity; there is a stronger consensus in the EU that it should be an early mover in the transition; and momentum is building on the need for an the early deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage. In addition, progress is being made in building a conversation between the EU and China which looks at opportunities in the low carbon transition, and considers how the economic relationship between the two can help accelerate the transition. Building the necessary political conditions will be critical in ensuring a successful outcome at the UN conference in Copenhagen at the end of next year.</p>

	<p pid="d.209W.2/1">The majority of 'suitable persons' will either be court-appointed deputies, donees of lasting powers of attorneys or friends or relatives who may already be involved in managing and organising the care of the direct payment recipient. It would not be appropriate to vet these people who have been chosen by the person without capacity themselves or the Court of Protection. However, it is up to local authorities to satisfy themselves that identified suitable persons are able to act in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity, even where they are not fully vetted.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.2/2">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 introduces further safeguards where the 'suitable person' is not a friend or family member of the individual whose direct payment they are managing. Where the council engages someone to provide services for that individual, then they become a regulated activity provider. These issues were fully debated during the passage of the Act. In practice, this means that the council must ensure that the individual they engage has undergone a vetting and barring check, as specified in the Act. If the suitable person is a friend or family member, the council will be able to apply for vetting information about potential carers but checks will not be mandatory.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.2/3">Guidance recommends that this is a good option currently for Direct Payment recipients and we would envisage that the new guidance would mirror this advice for suitable people. Furthermore, regulation 16 of the draft regulations sets out that the local authority must review the making of the direct payment at certain intervals and under certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.2/4">Until the safeguards included in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 are brought into force, safeguards are being provided through Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks. Through a registered body, such as a local authority, a 'suitable person' will be able to apply for a CRB disclosure on the person they wish to employ. This facility is currently available to people managing their own direct payment.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.2/5">In relation to support and information available to the person managing direct payments on behalf of an individual who lacks capacity, the Department will issue guidance after analysing responses to the 'Putting People First&mdash;Transforming Adult Social Care&mdash;Consultation on Direct Payments Regulations' in spring 2009. This guidance will also support suitable persons identified in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and draft Direct Payments regulations made under the provisions in this Act. Furthermore, as part of 'Putting People First', we have encouraged councils to explore different support mechanisms to support people to access Direct Payments.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.2/6">Finally, we are taking action to ensure advice is made available to families who will manage direct payments on behalf of an individual who lacks capacity. The Government are making resources available under the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) grant to councils and primary care trusts to train professionals on all aspects of working with people who lack capacity and taking best interest decisions on their behalf. Councils decide how best to use these resources on training, awareness raising and appointing specialist MCA professionals.</p>

For some, this will also include what percentage of income should be guaranteed to the provider, and for how long. If the income guarantee is set too high it could reduce the risk on the provider who may not be incentivised to provide a high quality service and reduces value for money. If set too low the general practitioner-led health centre provider may not obtain sufficient income in the early period of the contract to deliver a high quality and usable service 8am to 8pm, 365 days a year.</p>

	<p pid="d.214W.0/1">A copy of the information requested on exception rates for coronary heart disease by primary care trust (PCT) with spearhead PCTs identified has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.0/2">The latest research by the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre (NPCRDC) shows that although practices in deprived areas are slightly more likely to exception report patients than practices in affluent areas, deprivation-related variation in reported quality of care for measured activities reduced during the first three years of the Quality and Outcomes Framework, resulting in more equitable delivery of health care for these activities.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.0/3">The NPCRDC conclude that general practitioners in deprived areas achieved high scores without high rates of exception reporting, and the differences in scores between affluent and deprived areas are small and of relatively little clinical significance. This is a considerable achievement for practices in deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.0/4">There is evidence that some practices, whether in deprived or affluent areas, may be using exception reporting inappropriately. Manipulating QOF data in order to increase rewards without delivering the required level of quality for patients is clearly unacceptable&mdash;and also unfair on the majority of practices who comply with QOF requirements. PCTs are responsible in England for verifying evidence for QOF achievement. They should analyse exception rates and recorded prevalence, investigating any outliers, correcting QOF payments where necessary and taking action if they uncover any actual fraud.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.0/5">The Government are committed to ensuring, in consultation with the profession, that QOF continually develops and supports leading edge quality of care for patients based on best available evidence. We want to look with the profession at how we can reduce exception reporting in order to ensure that all patients who would benefit receive good quality of care, including those who are hard to reach.</p>

	<p pid="d.234W.2/3">The proportion of teenagers who drink regularly is falling but those who do drink are drinking a lot more. Young people who drink too much not only put their own health at risk, but are more likely to get involved in antisocial behaviour and contribute to insecurity on our streets. The Youth Alcohol Action Plan, published in June, sets out a number of actions to address the problems of young people's alcohol consumption. We will provide clearer health information for parents and young people about how consumption of alcohol, particularly at an early age, can affect children and young people. This will include the chief medical officer's guidelines on safer drinking by young people and a comprehensive communications campaign aimed at 11 to 15 year-olds to be launched in spring 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.2/4">In line with recommendations from an independent review of drug and alcohol education, Ministers announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-30">30 October 2008</phrase> that Personal Health and Social Education (PHSE) would be made statutory subject. This would underline the key role PSHE has to play in young people's personal development.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.2/5">Very few young people are addicted to alcohol but we know that a small proportion of young people do drink too much which puts them at risk of harm. DCSF are working closely with the National Treatment Agency (NTA) to continue to improve the accessibility and quality of substance misuse treatment for young people (under 18), with the aim of ensuring that effective treatment is available for any young person with alcohol problems that needs it.</p>

	<p pid="d.236W.2/1">Ministers and officials speak to many institutions and organisations about issues that affect individuals' progression to higher education. Progression to higher education for vocational learners is an important element in our drive to capture, enrich and exploit the talents and potential of all learners; and the Lifelong Learning Network programme has been established precisely to focus on progression and widening opportunity for vocational learners, putting them on the same footing as those following more traditional academic pathways.</p>
	<p pid="d.236W.2/2">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has invested over &pound;100 million across 2005-11 in 30 Lifelong Learning Networks (LLNs). These networks make an important contribution to a number of the Government's strategic objectives including lifelong learning, credit transfer, articulation arrangements between higher education programmes and the Qualifications and Credit Framework, employer engagement and workplace learning, and progression from the 14-19 diplomas. HEFCE officers, including those from widening participation teams, meet with senior staff from institutions in the north west in the normal course of HEFCE business and progression for vocational learners and widening participation forms part of that dialogue. HEFCE officers were involved in discussions with the Greater Merseyside and West Lancashire LLNs about additional student numbers for 2009-10 and how they should be distributed and targeted in priority areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.236W.2/3">Since Blackpool college's proposal to develop a Higher Education Centre, HEFCE have maintained close strategic engagement with the college, undertaking regular visits and meetings with the senior management team.

	<p pid="d.237W.0/22" class="indent">(c) The cost of developing an Address Register for the 2011 Census is estimated to be about &pound;10 million over the years 2008-11. The primary sources of address lists, namely the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF), the Ordnance Survey MasterMap Address Layer 2 (AL2), and the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG), which is administered by the local authority community through the Local Government Information House (LGIH), will be matched to find the common elements and to identify differences for more research and verification. Although the Address Register strategy takes account of other national addressing initiatives it is only being developed for the 2011 Census. Subject to having appropriate data sharing agreements in place, it should provide a one-off quality improvement to each of the main address sources. It is also hoped that the development of processes and delivery partnership models could be used to support the wider agenda for a single National Address Register in the future.</p>

In addition, the number of temporary foreign workers not covered by the LFS has been estimated as 170,000, based on ONS experimental short term migration estimates.

	<p pid="d.245W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the Authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated November 2008:</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what criteria the Office for National Statistics uses to decide whether a publicly-funded body may be classified as a private sector organisation (233370).</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/4" class="indent">ONS produces the United Kingdom's National Accounts. The National Accounts are an internationally comparable accounting framework that describes the activities in a national economy, including the transactions that take place between sectors of that economy. The relevant international manuals are the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93) and the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95) in particular.</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/5" class="indent">As part of the process of producing the National Accounts, ONS decides on the classification of institutions and transactions within the economy. This well-established process is set out in Annex A of the National Statistics Protocol on Statistical Integration and Classification available at: <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/ns-standard/cop/protocols/index.html">http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/ns-standard/cop/protocols/index.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/6" class="indent">Paragraphs 19-24 of the protocol annex provide a brief description of the classification criteria used when classifying an institution to the public or private sector. The paragraphs are reproduced below for ease. 'NACC' in paragraph 22 refers to the National Accounts Classification Committee, which is described in detail within the protocol.</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/7" class="indent">Classification criteria: the basic approach to classification</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/8" class="indent">19. Each classification decision is taken on its own merits and in line with international statistical guidance. Cases of public interest tend to be one of two types:</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/9" class="indent">i. whether an entity, an organisation or financing vehicle for example, is in the private or public sector;</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/10" class="indent">ii. whether government receipts are a charge for a service or a tax</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/11" class="indent">i. Classification of an entity to the public or private sector</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/12" class="indent">20. The guidance is extensive but two main stages can be identified when classifying an entity to an institutional sector. The first involves a decision on whether the entity is within the public or private sectors, and the second a decision on whether it is a market or non-market producer.</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/13" class="indent">21. In summary the difference between the public and private sectors is determined by where control lies, rather than by ownership or whether or not the entity is publicly financed. International guidance defines control as the ability to determine general corporate policy. For example, this control can be exercised through the appointment of directors, control of over half of the shareholders voting power, through special legislation or decree, or through regulation.</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/14" class="indent">22. As a result NACC will examine an entity to see whether there are any factors that enable any part of the public sector, either individually or collectively, to determine the general corporate policy of the entity. This includes recognition that government, or other sectors, may also control a unit through contractual arrangements. If this control is established the entity is classified to the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/15" class="indent">23. Having decided whether an entity is part of the public or private sectors, the second important aspect for sector classification is to determine whether it is a market or non-market entity. Public sector market entities are classified as public corporations (for example Royal Mail and Manchester Airport Group); public sector non-market entities are classified in the general government sector (for example government departments and the BBC). General government is then sub-divided into sub-sectors, including central government, state government and local government. Private sector market entities are classified as private corporations, and private sector non-market entities are generally classified to a sector known as Non Profit Institutions Serving Households.</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.2/16" class="indent">24. The borderline between market and non-market classification is defined in the international guidance by whether more than fifty per cent of the production costs are covered by sales of goods and services.</p>
