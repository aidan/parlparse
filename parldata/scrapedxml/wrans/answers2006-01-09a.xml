	<p pid="a.2W.3/1">To date, 30 areas are operating under statutory charging. The remaining 12 areas have been operating shadow charging schemes since 2003, whereby charging is operating on a non-mandatory basis, which mirrors as closely as possible statutory charging arrangements between 9 am and 5 pm Monday to Friday. These remaining areas are scheduled to move onto statutory charging by April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.3/2">The expected benefits of the charging scheme are a reduction in the rate of discontinuance, an increase in the guilty plea rate, and a reduction in the rate of attrition.</p>

The Director kept the Attorney-General informed throughout this case and consulted the Attorney-General in respect of his decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.2/3">In January 2005 an issue arose in the trial process, the Attorney-General carried out a Shawcross exercise by which he consulted ministerial colleagues as to whether they had information that might bear on the consideration of the public interest by the Director. In the event, having regard to ongoing developments in the trial process, no decision was required to be taken at that time and the information obtained formed no part of the Director's decision to discontinue the prosecution in December 2005. That decision was informed by facts and information provided by the chief constable in November 2005 following upon a further development in the trial process. No further ministerial consultation took place.</p>

	<p pid="a.8W.5/5">In particular disabled candidates are supported through the Two Ticks Scheme which ensures that all disabled applicants are interviewed for jobs, if they meet the minimum criteria for the post. In addition, the Department uses the Access to Work Scheme which independently assesses each disabled employee so reasonable adjustments can be made, where applicable, to enable them to develop and work to their full potential.</p>

	<p pid="a.25W.2/1">The current funding arrangement of the National Safety Camera Programme allows for revenue raised from safety cameras to be used only to fund the deployment of safety cameras.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.2/2">This is because the Safety Camera Programme has a specific purpose, provided for in the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001, section 38 'Unified power for the Secretary of State to fund speed cameras etc' whereby police forces and highway authorities are provided with extra resources to support the deployment and operation of safety cameras, from the fines for speeding and red light offences detected, over and above their main road safety funding. The resources provided through the programme cannot therefore be used for any other purposes, not provided for in the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.2/3">Under this current arrangement any surplus fine revenue is paid to the Consolidated Fund at HM Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.2/4">The Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase> that this funding arrangement for safety cameras will end on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2007</phrase>. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> all future income from safety cameras in England and Wales will go to the Consolidated Fund in the same way as other fines.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.2/5">In England the Department for Transport will be enhancing the level of funding for road safety within the local transport planning process by &pound;440 million over the period 2007&ndash;08 to 2010&ndash;11. This new arrangement for funding road safety will give local road safety partnerships (local authorities, the police and other agencies who work with them) greater flexibility to implement the mix of road safety measures, including 20 mph zones around schools, that will make the greatest contribution to reducing road casualties in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.2/6">On <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, responsibility for safety cameras in Wales will transfer to the National Assembly for Wales. I understand that the Welsh Assembly Government are considering future funding arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.39W.2/1">All Government Departments are committed to the broader vision of improving the life chances of disabled people through the delivery of services and the development of their policies. The Department for Work and Pension's Inter-Departmental Group on Disability is a forum for DCMS to take part in policy discussions on disability issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.39W.2/2">DCMS has had no discussions with national gymnasium chains about accessibility but in August 2005 I wrote to all local authorities reminding them of their responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act in the context of leisure and tourism facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.39W.2/3">Since 2001, Sport England (SE), working in partnership with the English Federation of Disability Sport ( EFDS), has invested &pound;6 million in the Inclusive Fitness Initiative (IFI). The investment has supported the development of 180 fully accessible local authority gyms which have a required minimum level of accessible gym equipment; suitably trained staff; marketing which is targeted at members of the disabled community; and strong links with other sporting opportunities for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.39W.2/4">SE and the EFDS are also working with fitness gym providers such as Cannons and Fitness First to improve provision for disabled people in private sector facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.2/1">Under the old regime, it was legal for unsupervised children of any age to enter and remain in licensed premises so long as they did not enter the 'bar area'. Under the new regime, there are restrictions that prevent unaccompanied children under 16 being present in certain categories of premises that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises, including pubs and night clubs. In addition, where necessary and appropriate, conditions may be attached to premises licences or club premises certificates which prohibit or restrict the entry of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.2/2">We estimate that there are around 190,000 premises licensed under the 2003 Act but information is not held centrally on how many have conditions attached to their licence which restrict entry to children. As 'licensed' premises include pubs, nightclubs, hotels, cinemas, theatres, restaurants and late night takeaways, it is likely that the vast majority serve food, including bar snacks.</p>

	<p pid="a.44W.2/1">Data has not been collated on the numbers of pools where an admissions policy has altered since my meeting on this subject in 2005. Information on admissions policies at individual pools in England is available through Sport England's &quot;Active Places&quot; website (<a href="http://www.ActivePlaces.com">www.ActivePlaces.com</a>). The Amateur Swimming Association has also compiled a comprehensive list of swimming pools through which similar information can be found. Both databases are maintained regularly.</p>
	<p pid="a.44W.2/2">It is for individual pool operators to determine appropriate measures to mitigate risks at their pools identified through a risk assessment. The Health and Safety Executive advocates that, as part of this process, pool operators should consider the number of children which can safely be accompanied by a single adult. Risk mitigation measures should be kept under review to ensure that they remain appropriate. It is also sensible for pool operators to take account of the guidance available in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.46W.8/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.8/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many complaints have been received by the Child Support Agency in each year since 1997; how many went forward for adjudication; and how many have been <i>(a)</i> full and <i>(b)</i> partially upheld.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.8/5" class="indent">I have provided tables below to show the number of complaints received by the Agency by clients, and by other bodies, for which information is available. It should be noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful comparisons over time due to changes in the way that information has been recorded. In particular, whilst the volume of Stage 1 complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002/3 and 2003/4, this is likely to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three tier complaints process during 2003/04.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.8/6" class="indent">The three tier complaints process comprises of; Stage 1 complaints from clients which are dealt with by the Complaints Resolution Team located within each of the Agency's six business units. Stage 2 complaints which are an escalation to the relevant Area Director when the client is not satisfied with the outcome of stage 1, and stage 3 which is an escalation to the Chief Executive if the client remains dissatisfied.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.8/7" class="indent">Complaints are also received into the Agency from MPs, or via MPs from a member of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.8/8" class="indent">The outcome of whether a complaint to the Agency is upheld is not recorded. However, as described above, clients are signposted to the next level of the process should they remain dissatisfied. The table below shows the volume of cases escalated to stages two and three, for which information is available. Once these internal avenues have been exhausted, the client may wish to contact the Independent Case Examiner (ICE), their MP or, via their MP, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

Our proposals for reform which we intend to publish in the spring, will be guided by the principle that the pension system should deliver fair outcomes for women and carers. A campaign to encourage carers to apply for home responsibility protection is being launched today.</p>

	<p pid="a.54W.5/1">In 2002, we put in place a comprehensive strategy for reform of housing benefit, with the first priority being to improve administration across the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/2">We have already made significant progress. The average time taken by local authorities to process new claims has shortened by two weeks. We have introduced a number of simplification measures to reduce complexity in the housing benefit rules. We have provided investment, to help authorities make improvements in the administration of housing benefit. We have reduced the losses due to fraud and error. We are piloting the new Local Housing Allowance in 18 local authorities, with a view to national implementation.</p>

For example, the introduction of Work Focused Interviews, although adding an extra stage to the claim process, has facilitated a pro-active rather than a passive approach to the search for work.</p>

	<p pid="a.64W.2/45"><sup>(19)</sup> The 2004&ndash;05 DLA National Benefit Review identified cases where the change in customer's needs have been so gradual that it would be unreasonable to expect them to know at which point their entitlement to DLA might have changed. These cases do not result in a recoverable overpayment as we cannot quantify or define when the customer's change occurred. Because legislation requires the Secretary of State to prove that entitlement to DLA is incorrect, rather than requiring the customer to inform us that their needs have changed, cases in this subcategory are legally correct. The difference between what claimants in these cases are receiving in DLA and related premiums in other benefits and what they would receive if their benefit was reassessed is estimated to be around &pound;0.7 billion (+/- &pound;0.2 billion). This figure is not included in the total above, but a similar figure was included in the global fraud and error figure of &pound;3 billion reported in the resource account for 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid="a.64W.2/50">1. Fraud and error on CTB has not been measured before and is assumed here to be equal to fraud and error rates on HB.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.2/51">2. Although quoted to the nearest &pound;0.1 billion, there are considerable uncertainties around the total estimates (95 per cent. confidence intervals of between &plusmn;&pound;0.2 billion and &plusmn;&pound;0.3 billion).</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.2/52">3. Individual figures may not add across to total fraud and error figures due to rounding.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.2/53">The Department publishes National Statistics reports including estimates of overpayments through official error. Estimates for income support (IS), jobseeker's allowance (JSA), pension credit and housing benefit (HB) are published every year so these are the benefits where we have most information on changes over time.

	<p pid="a.64W.2/108">1. These figures will not include all overpayments in HB through official error. They were published in the latest National Statistics report for HB fraud and error, and only cover the 85 per cent. of HB expenditure that is within the scope of the HBR sample. In these reports, there was an extra category of error labelled &quot;non-residence&quot; error, an unknown amount of which will be due to mistakes made by officials&mdash;these overpayments are not included in the figures in this table.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.2/109">2. The Second National Housing Benefit Accuracy Review, in 1997&ndash;98 gave an estimate of &pound;60 million for official error, but was based on a different methodology, so the results are not considered comparable with more recent estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.2/110">The Department also publishes one-off snapshot reviews. The most recent report covered disability living allowance (DLA) and the official error figures from these are in the table.</p>

	<p pid="a.70W.2/1">In the National Strategy for Carers, 'Caring About Carers', published in February 1999, the Government set out its commitment to encourage and enable carers of working age to remain in work and to help those carers who are unable, or do not want, to combine paid work with caring to return to work when their caring responsibilities cease or diminish. Many people providing informal care already do paid work as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.70W.2/2">From April 2004, Work Focussed Interviews (WFIs) have been introduced for partners of benefit customers in Jobcentre Plus areas. Although partners who are full-time carers with entitlement to carer's allowance are exempt from WFIs, they are however entitled to help and support, including through new deal for partners, on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.70W.2/3">Carers who are in receipt of carer's allowance can work and earn up to &pound;82 per week. This amount is calculated net of expenses such as income tax, some national insurance contributions, and half of any contribution towards an occupational or personal pension. Help can also be given with the cost of care of the disabled person when the carer is at work, provided that the substitute carer is not a close relative of either the carer or the disabled person. The amount allowable is 50 per cent. of the net earnings after deduction of the other allowable expenses. Therefore, it is possible for a carer to earn well in excess of &pound;82 and still remain eligible for carer's allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.80W.5/2">At the outset of a claim for benefit steps are taken to confirm that the address provided exists and is correct, this is done through matching the details provided with historical data held within my Department. Decision notices issued when entitlement is established and annual award notices issued when benefit rates change include written reminders of the need for customers to notify changes of address. In addition to this when it is known that an address is out of date various steps are taken depending upon the benefit in payment, for example in jobseekers allowance the customer is seen on a regular basis where correct address details are confirmed. Disability &amp; Carers Service would contact such people as carers, health care professionals involved in the case etc to confirm address details. In other areas checks would be made with local authorities where housing benefit and council tax benefit are in payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.5/3">If an address could not be traced banks would be contacted to suspend payments and data matching takes place with organisations such as Royal Mail redirect. Details of changes in addresses notified to one part of my Department are shared with other Agencies within the Department through cross-benefit computer systems. These systems also receive address data from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs where many customers who are in receipt of child benefit, child tax credits and new tax credits are also customers of my Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.89W.5/2">Sustainability for jobs gained through the new deal programme is measured in slightly different ways across the new deals. In the case of new deal for young people and new deal 25 plus, employment is regarded as sustained if a person gaining a job through these new deals does not claim jobseeker's allowance for at least 13 weeks after gaining employment. This measure has not changed since the programmes were introduced in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.5/3">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>, employment sustainability for those participating on new deal for lone parents has been measured through the Work and Pensions longitudinal study. If a job gained through the programme lasts at least 13 weeks, it is regarded as sustained. A measure of job sustainability was not available prior to October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.5/4">When a person gains a job through a new deal for disabled people (NDDP) job broker and remains in work for 13 weeks out of a 39 weeks period, that employment is regarded as sustained. This measure has not changed since the programme started in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.5/5">A measure of job sustainability for new deal 50 plus and new deal for partners is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.5/6">Employment gained through employment zones, which help people living in areas of persistently high unemployment into work, is defined as sustained if a person gaining a job through the programme does not return to claim jobseeker's allowance for at least 13 weeks. This measure has not changed since the programme was introduced in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.5/7">In the case of action teams, which help people in economically deprived areas into work, employment is regarded as sustained if the job lasts continuously for at least 11 weeks during the 13 week period after the person starts work, or if the person has two or more jobs which together add up to a total of at least 11 weeks during the 13 week period after they start work. This measure of sustainability has not changed since the programme was introduced in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.5/8">In April 2004, we introduced working neighbourhoods pilots to help people in deprived areas into work. Employment gained through the programme is regarded as sustained if a person moves off benefit and remains in work for a minimum of 13 weeks. This measure has not changed since the programme was introduced in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.5/9">Our ambition programme, which provides unemployed people with the skills and experience to work in specific employment sectors, defines employment as sustained if a person gaining a job through the ambition programmes is still working in that sector 26 weeks after gaining a job. This measure has not changed since ambition started in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.5/10">Finally, our progress2work and progress2work linkup programmes, which assist drug and alcohol misusers into work, as well as offenders and homeless people, define employment as sustained if a person, gaining employment through the programmes, does not return to claim jobseeker's allowance within 13 weeks. This measure has not changed since the programmes were introduced in 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.91W.5/3">Jobcentre Plus district managers are also encouraged to work in close partnership with local organisations, making best use of non-contracted provision, often provided through the voluntary sector. For example, with new deal for lone parents, districts have agreements with intermediary organisations within both the voluntary and private sector to refer lone parents for training and other support. We have also procured European Social Fund contracts to provide training and job search support for new deal customers and these have been delivered by voluntary organisations.</p>

Trustees can seek advice from their professional advisers; in addition, the pensions regulator produces a number of documents designed to help trustees in their work, including codes of practice. A code of practice on scheme funding is due to be published this month. The new funding provisions to replace the minimum funding requirement, due to come into force this month, promote greater transparency in scheme funding. Trustees of final salary schemes will be required to send regular statements of their scheme's funding position to all scheme members.</p>

	<p pid="a.100W.11/1">The Post Office card account is a simple account with very limited functions. It was specifically designed to receive payments of benefits and pensions administered by central government.</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.11/2">The Post Office card account does not have a facility for the account holder to make payments to a third party (i.e. their landlord) by standing order, so is not a suitable account to receive payments of housing benefit or the local housing allowance which is currently being piloted. Most housing benefit customers already have a suitable bank account that can be used to receive their payments from which they can make payments directly to their landlord.</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.11/3">The Post Office card account was introduced as a stepping stone for those who did not feel that they were yet ready to make use of even a basic bank account. Should someone feel that they now need an account with more facilities then they should consider moving to an account which better suits their needs. Customers who have opened and operated a card account have demonstrated that they are now capable of using a basic bank account. There are a large number of current and basic bank accounts which can be accessed at Post Offices, if this is important to housing benefit recipients.</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.11/4">DWP cheques are designed for those people who we cannot pay into an account. There is no need for a facility to pay DWP cheques into Post Office card accounts. If customers, including those receiving income support, want to put their money into a card account then we can do this directly for them without needing to issue a cheque.</p>

	<p pid="a.104W.2/1">It is a matter of record that the policy of both this and previous Governments has been to exclude most, but not all, full-time students from entitlement to housing benefit; since 1990 financial support for those students opting to study full-time has been seen as the responsibility of the education system, rather than the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.2/2">Those in full-time education are not supported through the benefits system once they reach the age of 19; the age at which child benefit ceases to be payable. Students in vulnerable groups, mainly those with a disability and those with dependent children retain eligibility for income related benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.2/3">People in full-time education are not entitled to receive jobseeker's allowance. Successive Governments have taken the view that full-time education is incompatible with the 'work first' nature of the jobseeker's allowance regime. It would be very difficult for someone in full-time education to fully meet the conditions for receipt of jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.2/4">Young people who are eligible to claim jobseekers allowance receive, like everyone else, help and support to find work. As unemployment lengthens and getting into work becomes more difficult the help provided becomes more intensive. As part of this, young people become eligible for the new deal after six months unemployment. The new deal provides intensive support through a personal adviser and includes, for those people who do not find work quickly, a number of options, including full-time education and training, to help improve their prospects of finding work. Young people participating in full time education and training as part of the new deal receive an allowance, which is equivalent to their jobseeker's allowance plus a top up of &pound;15.38 per week to cover additional costs incurred through participation. Individuals receiving housing benefit can currently study for qualifications below degree level, as long as it is for less than 16 guided learning hours a week. This is not always a significant barrier as many full time Learning and Skills Council courses are just over 12 guided learning hours a week.</p>
