However a survey of mental ill health in the prison population undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics estimated that around 90 per cent. of prisoners had at least one of the five disorders (personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse, and drug dependence) considered in the survey.

	<p pid="a.1567W.9/20">Every death in prison is a tragedy, and affects families, staff and other prisoners deeply. Ministers, the Ministry of Justice and the National Offender Management Service are committed to learning from each death and to reducing the number of such incidents. Good care and support from staff save many lives, but such instances go largely unreported. Prisons successfully keep safe in any given month approximately 1,500 prisoners assessed to be at particular risk of suicide or self-harm. Deaths in prisons are among the most scrutinised of all incidents and each case is subject to a police investigation and independent investigation by the prisons probation ombudsman. Robust systems are in place for monitoring deaths and learning from them.</p>

From mid-2007, this policy has been applied to both the public sector and contracted estate. The strategy requires each prison to undertake regular analysis of the problem areas, consider solutions and provide an action plan to improve personal safety and reduce violence. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety. This includes environmental and physical measures, as well as alternative ways of managing behaviour.</p>

Road transport is the main source. At high levels NO2 causes inflammation of the airways. Long term exposure may affect lung function and respiratory symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591W.0/80">London is currently exceeding the EU Limit Value of 40 microgrammes/m<sup>(3)</sup> and is not likely to meet this value by the attainment date of 2010. The Council Directive 2008/50/EC on Ambient Air Quality and Cleaner Air for Europe provides for member states to submit plans to the European Commission to postpone the compliance deadline for meeting the limit value for nitrogen dioxide from 2010 to 2015. The UK Government expect to submit such a plan to the Commission in 2010 following consultation early next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1595W.5/1">DEFRA has commissioned returns from English local authorities on fixed penalty notices issued in 2008-09 for a range of environmental offences, including those relating to waste receptacles. Returns are still outstanding from many local authorities and these are being pursued. Results will be published on the DEFRA website in December.</p>

	<p pid="a.1595W.8/1">The present Fairer and Better Environmental Enforcement proposals and consultation do not extend to local authorities, who are responsible for household waste matters. Any proposals to give local authorities powers to use the civil sanctions enabled by the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 would be subject to a further public consultation and separate secondary legislation, which would be debated in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.8/2">The present proposals would give national environmental regulators an alternative to prosecution in cases when enforcement is necessary and proportionate. The proposals would allow Environment Agency, Natural England and Countryside Council for Wales to take businesses and others with a good general approach to regulation out of the criminal courts when enforcement action was needed. However, regulator advice and guidance would remain the cornerstone of a well graduated and fair enforcement system. The worst cases of non-compliance would continue to be prosecuted. The proposed changes are designed to strengthen incentives to comply and to promote co-operation between regulator and regulated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1596W.3/1">In 2008-09 Defra directly provided &pound;78.2 million in funding to local authorities outside London via the Waste Infrastructure Capital Grant. &pound;60 million will be made available to London authorities through the London Waste and Recycling Fund for the period 2008-09 to 2010-11. These unringfenced capital grants will be paid to upper tier and unitary authorities to enable them to set up the necessary waste infrastructure to help England meet landfill targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.1596W.3/3">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) provided a total of &pound;2.68 million to local authorities during 2008-09. The funds were spent on local communications campaigns specifically to improve communications with householders about local recycling services and to promote the 'Love Food Hate Waste' campaign. WRAP has no remit in relation to waste disposal and has not, therefore, provided any funds to local authorities in relation to it.</p>

Further work in estimating dioxin emissions from domestic burning has subsequently been carried out and another research programme is currently being undertaken by DEFRA which will establish a release inventory for dioxins as well as provide information on the most effective approach for carrying out a public awareness campaign educating the public on the impacts of burning garden and domestic waste with regard to dioxin emissions.

	<p pid="a.1602W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.6/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.6/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many parents eligible for maintenance payments via the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission and its predecessor have received no payment for over (a) three and (b) 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.6/5" class="indent">The Commission estimates that at the end of June 2009, of the 1,140,400 cases due to receive at least one child maintenance payment in the past three years, no payment had been received from the non-resident parent in 57,250 (or 5%) of these cases. The Commission is not able to provide an estimate on the number of parents eligible for maintenance payments who have not received any payments for the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.6/6" class="indent">Some parents will go to great lengths to avoid fulfilling their financial responsibilities to their children. The Child Support Agency has made significant improvements over the last three years increasing the number of cases receiving maintenance by a third. The new enforcement powers set out in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 will give the Commission the tools it needs to further increase compliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1606W.5/1">The Government believe that, for most families, work is the best route out of poverty. The Department for Work and Pensions is increasing support for lone parents and disabled parents, and testing out new support for second earners, to help them find, remain and progress in work. This support takes the form of both pre-employment support and in-work support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.5/2">The latest statistics for 2007-08 show that 500,000 children have been lifted out of poverty since 1997; measures announced in and since Budget 2007 are estimated to lift a further 500,000 children out of poverty. The Child Poverty Bill is currently progressing through Parliament which will enshrine in law the commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="a.1606W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-14">14 September 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/2">As part of the Department's commitment to support people into work, substantial investment has been made since November 2008 to offer extra support to jobseekers to help them find work at all stages of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/3">An enhanced offer to all jobseekers at day one of their claim includes targeted group sessions in jobsearch techniques, access to Local Employment Partnership vacancies and help with the costs of getting back to work through the Adviser Discretionary Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/4">At the six-month point of their claim, all jobseekers now receive a substantial package of extra support including access to recruitment subsidies, work-focused training places, volunteering opportunities and support to become self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/5">We have also targeted significant resource on people under age 25 in recognition of the particular challenges young people face during a recession. These measures are designed to prevent, wherever possible, young people experiencing prolonged spells of unemployment early in their working lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-29">29 July</phrase>, the Government launched a campaign called Backing Young Britain, calling on businesses, charities and Government bodies to create more opportunities for young people, such as internships, mentoring support and coaching. As part of this campaign, all young people will receive additional adviser support and can be put forward for a work trial from day one of unemployment. We are also working with businesses to increase graduate internships and to develop work experience and mentoring support for young jobseekers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/7">In early 2010, young people will be able to benefit from the Young Person's Guarantee which guarantees a job, work-focused training, or meaningful activity to all 18 to 24-year-olds before they have reached the 12-month stage of their claim to jobseeker's allowance. This offer will become mandatory from April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/8">The Future Jobs Fund, one key element of the Young Person's Guarantee, will create at least 100,000 jobs for young people aged between 18 and 24. The first jobs will be available from October 2009 for customers approaching the 10-month point in their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/9">If young people remain on benefits at the 12-month stage, they will be referred to the provider-led Flexible New Deal programme (in phase 1 areas) and will benefit from work-focused support, tailored to the individual's needs and local labour market requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/10">In phase 2 areas at the 12-month stage, jobseekers will be participating in one of the New Deal Options. If they remain unemployed following this programme, jobseekers will move into the Follow-Through Stage of the New Deal and receive more frequent, targeted adviser support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/11">Help is also available for 16 and 17-year-olds. The September Guarantee was introduced in 2007 to ensure that every young person leaving compulsory education at 16 receives a suitable offer of a place in learning. It was extended to 17-year-olds in 2008. By the end of 2008, this guarantee helped to support an increase in the proportion of 16 and 17-year-olds participating in learning to 88 per cent., the highest ever rate. The proportion of 16 and 17-year-olds not in employment, education or training (NEET) fell for the third consecutive year, and only 5.2 per cent. of 16-year-olds were NEET, the lowest rate for more than a decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.8/12">Furthermore, the Government are delivering record numbers of apprenticeships in England and we expect 250,000 people to start apprenticeships this year.</p>

While there are a number of ways by which such a commission could be established, all would require a level of international consensus on Burma that is not presently achievable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1609W.5/2">In the past two years, our efforts have helped to secure unprecedented UN Security Council action on Burma, in the form of two strongly worded Presidential Statements. We are also active in pursuing strong resolutions in both the Human Rights Council and at the General Assembly. We fully support the efforts of UN Special Rapporteur, Tomas Quintana. His work on human rights abuses in Burma is crucial to holding the regime to account and we have urged the Burmese authorities to grant him the necessary access.</p>

A number of measures, for example on ambulance crossings and restoration of cultural heritage, have already been implemented. We hope to see further confidence building measures being implemented in the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="a.1616W.5/1">The principle of subsidiarity is not a mechanism for &quot;returning powers&quot; to the member states, but for determining whether or not Community action should be set in motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1616W.5/2">The member states, through the EU treaties, set the EU certain tasks and give it the powers to achieve those tasks. Article 5 of the treaty establishing the European Community states that, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1616W.5/3">Further guidelines for assessing whether these requirements are met are laid down by the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The Protocol also requires the Commission to justify the relevance of any of its legislative proposals with regard to the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1616W.5/4">The Lisbon treaty would strengthen the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making, so that for the first time national parliaments could challenge draft EU legislation on subsidiarity grounds.

President Ahmadinejad's repeated denials of the Holocaust&mdash; most recently at the UN General Assembly in September&mdash;only serve to increase our concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1619W.0/2">We have been disturbed by the Iranian authorities' response to the protests that followed the disputed June 2009 presidential election, and in particular by the death and imprisonment sentences handed down in recent days. One of those convicted was the Jewish teenager, Yaghoghil Shaolian. He has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison. We are seeking more information about his case, as well as those of the other defendants, and will raise our concerns with the Iranian authorities, since those convicted and sentenced appear to have been denied a fair trial.</p>

	<p pid="a.1619W.3/1">The UK is concerned that no action has been taken on bringing to justice those accused of orchestrating Kenya's post-election violence in 2007, neither by a special tribunal nor referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

	<p pid="a.1619W.3/2">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary encouraged Kenya's reform process, including tackling impunity and post-election violence, during his meeting with Prime Minister Odinga in London last July. Since then my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for International Development and the former Minister of State for Africa have also encouraged the Kenyan Government to establish a credible tribunal to investigate and prosecute those responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1619W.3/3">The Government support the role being played by Kofi Annan and endorses his proposal that the ICC continue its discussions with the Kenyan Government to achieve justice. We continue to believe action on impunity is needed to prevent future violence and to send a strong message that Kenyans will not tolerate violence.</p>

There was an initial upsurge around the time of the April 2009 parliamentary elections, primarily in Puncak Jaya and Jayawijaya districts and Nabire and Abepura towns. There have been further incidents over the last three months in Mimika district in which an Australian national and a number of Indonesian police officers were killed.

	<p pid="a.1633W.3/2">The tri-Service medical entry standards are contained within Joint Services Publication (JSP) 346, which advises that candidates with Asperger's syndrome and autism are not suitable for recruitment into any post in the Armed Forces. The only exception is where a potential recruit presents with a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome but on examination appears to exhibit none of the symptoms of the condition. While those with a confirmed diagnosis should normally be graded as unsuitable, it is recognised that there are instances when the original diagnosis may have been made in error, based on unusual adolescent behaviour which has resolved. In these doubtful cases further referral will normally be recommended before a final decision is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.3/3">It is our policy that armed forces personnel should be recruited to be fully fit for deployment worldwide on operations. For this reason, the services do not recruit or commission personnel with existing medical conditions which may adversely impact on the effectiveness of the armed forces, or which may themselves be exacerbated by military circumstances. This is particularly relevant in cases of individuals with autism or Asperger's Syndrome, as military personnel are expected to perform in multiple roles, which may be difficult for someone suffering from these disorders. Further, all military personnel are required to work in close-knit teams, and in operational environments the pressures are such that anyone with significant disability in social interaction may well be a danger to themselves or their team. These two diagnoses have significant disability in social interaction as part of their defining features.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.3/4">While it may be possible to retain in-service individuals who are already serving and are subsequently diagnosed as autistic or suffering from Asperger's (provided that there are worthwhile military roles for them to fulfil), this will normally mean that they will have to be re-graded and will not be able to deploy on operations. This also applies to other disabilities which might arise while an individual is in service but the forces do not recruit individuals where they would only be able to serve from the outset in a medically restricted capacity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1638W.2/1">The Territorial Army (TA) continues to play a vital role in support of the Regular Army, not least on operations in Afghanistan. TA personnel in Wales offer a variety of essential skills and capabilities including infantry, artillery, medical, engineers and transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1638W.2/2">The current period of restricted activity does not affect those TA personnel preparing for operations or those new recruits in Phase 1 (initial) training. Approximately 2,300 TA personnel are attached to TA units based in Wales. Of these 30 are attached to units based in Pembrokeshire. Of the 2300, 60 are currently on operations, a further 120 are currently training for operations and a further 420 are in Phase 1 training. Fewer than 10 of the 30 personnel attached to units based in Pembrokeshire are currently training for operations; and a further 10 are in Phase 1 training. None is currently mobilised. All TA personnel will be provided with opportunities to undertake activities required to meet the minimum standard to qualify for their bounty this year, if they have not already done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1638W.2/3">Approximately 930 TA personnel have mobilised to serve on operations overseas from units based in Wales since 2003. Of these fewer than 10 have deployed from units based in Pembrokeshire. These figures include small numbers of personnel who deployed on operations other than in Afghanistan and Iraq. Information prior to 2003 and on numbers who have deployed to specific operational theatres is not held centrally.</p>

The Insolvency Service's monitoring of SIP 16 information is continuing and a further report will be published in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1651W.5/5">It should be noted that the number of insolvency practitioners involved in the provision of non-compliant SIP 16 information is not the same as the figure indicated above. This is because the majority of insolvency practitioners undertaking pre-pack administrations, and therefore providing SIP 16 information, are appointed on multiple appointments. In addition, the majority of administration appointments are held by more than one insolvency practitioner on a joint basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1651W.8/2">The Insolvency Service carries out the Secretary of State's function with regard to both the direct authorisation of insolvency practitioners and the regulation of the recognised professional bodies that authorise the vast majority of insolvency practitioners. The Department has therefore not had any direct liaison with the recognised professional bodies on the issue of SIP 16 as this has been undertaken by the Insolvency Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1651W.8/3">There have been three separate meetings during 2009 between the Insolvency Service and representatives from the recognised professional bodies to discuss the implementation and monitoring of SIP 16. The most recent meeting was held in September to discuss issuing guidance to practitioners to improve compliance with SIP 16. As a result of that meeting, the Insolvency Service has drafted guidance for insolvency practitioners, which is currently being reviewed by the recognised professional bodies prior to being issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.1651W.8/4">Many of the recognised professional bodies issued their own guidance on SIP 16 immediately following the publication of the report on the first six months operation of the SIP, to improve compliance. The bodies have welcomed further guidance and have agreed to issue the latest guidance at the same time as it is issued by the Insolvency Service. R3, the trade body for insolvency practitioners, has invited the Insolvency Service to take part in training at meetings and conferences to improve compliance with the SIP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1651W.8/5">The Insolvency Service is also a member of the Joint Insolvency Committee along with all the recognised professional bodies, which holds quarterly meetings to review guidance issued to insolvency practitioners. In the course of these meetings and those of sub-groups of the Committee, SIP 16 will have been discussed in general terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1651W.8/6">The Insolvency Service is working closely with the recognised professional bodies to improve insolvency practitioners' compliance with the SIP and to consider whether and how the SIP may be strengthened.</p>

The drafts were read at the offices of the Secretariat to the inspection.</p>

	<p pid="a.1656W.3/1">The provision of fertility treatment by primary care trusts (PCTs) is determined at local level. The Government support the clinical guidelines on the assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), and has made it clear that PCTs are expected to move towards full implementation of the guideline. Many have already made firm progress (the number of PCTs offering three cycles of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment has increased by 22 percentage points between 2007 and 2008) and others continue to develop their policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1656W.3/4">in June 2009showed that in 2008 50 per cent. of PCTs provided either two or three full cycles of IVF, with 25 per cent. providing one full cycle and 22 per cent. providing one fresh cycle. A copy has already been placed in the Library. The North Staffordshire PCT reported offering treatment in exceptional cases only. The North Yorkshire and York PCT is the only PCT providing funding for one cycle of IVF for women age 39 years and six months only. We understand that this was instituted as a temporary measure from 2007 pending a review of provision across the Yorkshire and the Humber Strategic Health Authority.</p>

It will also help to reduce immediate security and protection threats, and boost co-ordination within the humanitarian response effort.</p>

This is because data on places available is not collected; only data on places filled is available and as children can access their free entitlement across different local authority areas, part time equivalent places are not on a comparable basis with the local authority population figures. Population figures at this level of disaggregation are also not as reliable as at the national level.</p>

	<p pid="a.1664W.2/1">In April 2007 Ofsted assumed responsibility for the inspection of children's social care and local authorities became responsible for notifying Ofsted of serious incidents involving children.
