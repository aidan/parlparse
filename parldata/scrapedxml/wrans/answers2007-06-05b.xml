	<p pid="b.328W.3/1">It is impossible to determine an exact figure relating to offences committed abroad, since there is no general requirement for foreign police forces to notify the PSNI of offences committed by residents of Northern Ireland while overseas. Nor are foreign nationals migrating to Northern Ireland required to declare convictions for offences committed in another jurisdiction. However, in the case of serious offences committed within Europe, the Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance applies, in which case notification is given to the host country of the offender in question. Via this mechanism, 519 people resident within Northern Ireland have so far been identified as having committed criminal offences abroad.</p>

	<p pid="b.332W.6/2">The UK Government are strong supporters of fair-trade products. They help farmers and other producers earn a decent living and get more of the final value of the product. Many Government Departments, including DFID, use fair-trade tea and coffee. And DFID supports initiatives to help producers benefit from fair-trade certification and develop new products. A number of individual impact assessments have been carried out, for example on DFID support to the Kuapa Kokoo cocoa growers' cooperative in Ghana to achieve fair-trade certification. The findings of this and other studies of fair-trade suggest the greatest benefits come through improved farmer organisation and improved availability of agricultural supplies. Direct impacts on long-term poverty reduction are less easy to measure. How the poverty impacts of fair trade can be more reliably and clearly monitored is at the centre of our current discussions with fair-trade organisations, including the Fairtrade Foundation, around future DFID support.</p>

	<p pid="b.333W.2/1">The European Community and EU member states use a variety of mechanisms to deliver aid to the Palestinian people. Since the suspension of direct budgetary support in March 2006, the EU created the temporary international mechanism (TIM) in order to deliver aid directly to the Palestinians. The European Commission and the World Bank have begun a review of the TIM. A report is expected in June.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.2/2">The UK Government and other EU member states will wish to consider the review's recommendations in deciding future policy on the TIM. Decisions will also be based on an assessment of the Palestinian National Unity Government's progress towards Quartet's three principles of engagement. These are renouncing violence, recognising Israel and signing up to previous peace agreements.</p>

	<p pid="b.340W.2/1">Food waste is not recorded or monitored separately from other general waste, except used cooking oil. The quantities of cooking oil collected in the last three years are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.340W.2/10">This used cooking oil is sent to a processing plant which converts it to biodiesel fuel.</p>
	<p pid="b.340W.2/11">Following a joint meeting between officials and the House's waste management contractor in December 2006, it was concluded that an insufficient quantity of suitable waste is produced on the parliamentary estate for it to be economic or practicable to collect separately food waste for composting. Only a small amount of raw food waste suitable for composting is produced, as most fresh fruit and vegetables purchased by the Refreshment Department are pre-prepared off-site.</p>
	<p pid="b.340W.2/12">Food waste is disposed of within the general waste stream; this is collected and sent for incineration, which is harnessed for electricity generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.340W.2/13">The potential for schemes such as composting and the generation of methane from biodegradable waste will continue to be reviewed on a regular basis and we have set ourselves challenging targets taking account of such future developments in recycling.</p>
	<p pid="b.340W.2/14">The House has set a target of 44 per cent. for recycling of waste in 2007-08, and the current policy for waste recycling is to increase this target by 5 per cent. per year.</p>

	<p pid="b.350W.0/4" class="indent">Customers claiming Jobseekers Allowance are screened for a potential basic skills need as part of the personal adviser interview after six months unemployment. Customers are asked to complete the Basic Skills Agency Fast Track Assessment and those with a skills need are given information, advice and guidance about the importance of basic skills in terms of finding a job and how to get a more detailed assessment and further help if needed. The outcome of the screening process is recorded on our Labour Market System.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.0/5" class="indent">From the outset of the claim and throughout all our face-to-face contacts, customers receive information about what they must do to receive payment of Jobseekers Allowance as well as the support we will provide to help them look for work. These requirements are first explained at the new jobseeker interview when a personal adviser will discuss and agree with the customer their job goals and those steps that, if taken, will offer the best chance of success. The adviser also tells the customer they must attend the Jobcentre for regular jobsearch reviews and that failure to attend or not being able to show they have been actively seeking work will affect payment of benefit. This information is reiterated in the Jobseekers Agreement and the JCP40 'signing' booklet, both of which are issued to the customer.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.0/6" class="indent">Where there is a subsequent doubt about entitlement to Jobseekers Allowance, the adviser will give a clear explanation to the customer, telling them what happens next and how their benefit could be affected. As part of this we are required to issue written notifications, but these are not issued without a full explanation to ensure that the customer understands. The adviser will explain the decision-making process, the outcome of which will be notified in writing. However, as part of the initial referral process, the customer will be advised to contact the Jobcentre if they want a personal explanation of the decision and the appeals process.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.0/7" class="indent">I hope this reply is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.351W.9/1">In order to determine the likely cost of the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), data were collected on the numbers and characteristics of 380 affected pension schemes and specific data were collected on some 1,300 members of a smaller number of these schemes expected to be representative of the overall eligible membership. These sample data have then been fed into an actuarial model developed by the Government Actuary's Department to generate detailed time profiles of costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.351W.9/2">The actuarial model calculates the amount of pension that would be paid in each year to each individual in the sample, reflecting the design of the FAS. The key pieces of information used to calculate these costs are age, retirement age, accrued pension, percentage of pension lost and the likely longevity of eligible members and any survivors. The results, in terms of likely cash flow in each year, are scaled up to the level of the total assumed numbers of affected scheme members.</p>
	<p pid="b.351W.9/3">The main assumptions used in the calculations, based on the best available evidence, are as follows: 125,000 eligible pensioner and non-pensioner members; an average funding level of schemes in respect of non-pensioner members of 30 to 35 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.351W.9/4">An average accrued pension for non-pensioner members of &pound;3,300 per year; and longevity estimates from standard tables from the UK actuarial profession's Continuous Mortality Investigation, based on the longevity experienced by pensioners whose pensions are secured with insurance companies.</p>

	<p pid="b.361W.8/2">As the recent Energy White Paper makes clear, the Government recognise tidal power represents a massive untapped clean, green energy resource. That is why the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) is leading a major study looking at issues related to harnessing tidal power in the UK. The SDC study will consider a wide range of locations and technologies, including the potential of tidal power in the Severn Estuary and the proposals for a tidal barrage.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.8/3">With the second largest tidal range in the world, the Severn Estuary is one of the most promising locations in existence for tidal energy. A Severn Barrage could produce up to 5 per cent. of UK energy consumption by 2020, save up to 3 per cent. of total UK carbon emissions, and last for 150 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.361W.15/2">Since its inception the Bookstart programme has been delivered in partnership with Sure Start local programmes which were located in areas with large numbers of disadvantaged families. This link has been maintained as Sure Start Children's Centres have been created, many of them based around the local programmes, initially serving families living in the most disadvantaged areas. By 2010 we aim to deliver 3,500 children's centres, one for every community, giving many more families with young children access. This, together with the wide reach of contact points for pack delivery, has helped to ensure that the packs are received by a diverse range of families, including those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Bookstart makes special efforts to ensure that its local schemes work proactively to facilitate delivery of book packs to &quot;hard to reach&quot; groups. Local scheme performance on accessing &quot;hard to reach&quot; groups is evaluated periodically, and best practice is shared and its adoption encouraged.</p>

	<p pid="b.362W.2/1">The Bookstart scheme aims to encourage a love of books by children in their earliest years, and helps to support the development of early communication and language skills in young children. A number of studies have assessed the impact of the Bookstart programme on reading standards. Among these, Wade and Moore's longitudinal study in Birmingham in 2000 offers the most comprehensive examination of the immediate and long-term impact of the programme. The study compared a cohort of Bookstart children who received the book pack at nine months with a control group who did not receive a pack. The children's performance on a range of literacy and reading measures was evaluated at intervals from the age of two-and-a-half to three years up to the end of Key Stage 1 in primary schools. Observations of book sharing in the home at the initial evaluation demonstrated that Bookstart children concentrated more and showed more interest in books, pointed to text more and tried to turn pages more than did the comparison group. The second evaluation stage, using Baseline Assessment of children in their reception year, demonstrated significantly improved performance on reading scores for Bookstart children. The final evaluation used the SATS tests at the end of Key Stage 1. Results for each group showed that Bookstart children were on average between 20 to 30 per cent. superior in their 'reading task' and 'reading comprehension' scores.</p>

Where it is safe to do so, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) undertakes dispute resolution with separating parents when they have been unable to reach agreement over arrangements for their children and court proceedings have been initiated. CAFCASS has no power to refer people to mediation, but, its officers do advise separating parents about taking up, or returning to, mediation. Many CAFCASS teams work closely with local mediation services, deciding which service is most likely to be successful in individual cases.</p>

One member of staff (a senior executive officer) is currently leading the development of the programme with the support of colleagues and senior management. We will consult the maths community as we develop our plans and make a more detailed announcement in due course. Delivery is expected to begin during 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.366W.2/1">The Government have allocated a total of &pound;384 million to local authorities in England over the period 2006-08 to support the development and provision of extended schools. These allocations are set out in the annex.</p>
	<p pid="b.366W.2/2">The Department for Education and Skills does not hold information on how much funding each London secondary school was allocated, their projected expenditure per head or what percentage of Government allocation was withheld for central administration and support in each London local authority, and the information requested can be supplied only at disproportionate cost. The Department for Education and Skills encourages all local authorities to devolve their extended schools funding to their schools. This should be done in line with their plan for rolling out extended schools which they will have drawn up in discussion with all schools in their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.366W.2/3">The Department for Education and Skills issued guidance about planning and funding extended schools in June 2006. The guidance provides information on charging for extended activities for those who can afford it, and recognises that children and young people from low-income families will benefit from free access to some extended school activities. To ensure this since 2006-07 schools have been able to use their School Standards Grant to support the development and delivery of extended services including supporting access for their most disadvantaged children and young people to extended activities. By 2010-11 an additional &pound;217 million will be invested so that disadvantaged children and young people will be able to access at least two hours a week of extended activities and some activities during the school holidays.</p>

	<p pid="b.370W.3/1">Under the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 it is an offence for an individual disqualified from working with children, by means of listing upon the Protection of Children Act (PoCA) List or List 99, to work in a regulated child care position. A regulated child care position would include an individual working as a nanny.</p>
	<p pid="b.370W.3/2">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act which will be implemented from autumn 2008 provides the legislative framework to introduce a single list of those barred from working with children. This will replace List 99, the PoCA list, and the disqualification orders regime thus providing a more integrated system for vetting and barring. Individuals who are barred under the children's list will commit an offence if they seek to work as a nanny or in child care.</p>
	<p pid="b.370W.3/3">Those who employ an individual in a child care setting, such as a nursery, will commit an offence if they fail to check that their employee or a volunteer they use is a member of the vetting and barring scheme. An individual will need to become a member of the vetting and barring scheme before they seek work in a nursery.</p>
	<p pid="b.370W.3/4">While the SVG Act enables those employing people to work with children or vulnerable adults in domestic arrangements (e.g. nannies and care workers) to check the individual's status in the scheme, it does not place a 'requirement' to check status in the scheme on parents using a nanny. Nor does it require nannies to become members of the new scheme. We believe it would not be appropriate or proportionate to regulate family life in this way and that parents are best placed to determine the suitability of nannies whom they are employing to work in their own home. We believe a sustained communications campaign to parents is preferable to a requirement, clearly explaining to parents their responsibility for ensuring their children are safe when they employ people to work with them, and setting out how the scheme can help them with this. It is likely that it will become desirable for those who work as nannies to become members of the scheme so that they may offer that reassurance to parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.370W.3/5">The Government have begun an extensive programme of communications, planned to culminate in summer to autumn 2008 with a campaign to ensure that all those subject to the requirements of the new vetting and barring scheme are aware of their responsibilities. There are many groups, organisations and individuals who need to know about the new scheme, so a range of ways of communicating nationally, regionally and locally will be used. Just one part of this task will be to work with parents' groups, organisations involved in providing child care, child care professionals and others to raise parents' awareness of the opportunities afforded by the scheme. Further information on the scheme and details of a programme of information sessions already running across the country can be found at</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.2/1">It is important for the community to be involved in all aspects of community justice. Judicial deployment is the responsibility of the judiciary under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. For magistrates, local people are involved in the advisory committees that make recommendations on appointments. For district judges, the final decision is taken by the judiciary after the district judge has met the community and has reported with the senior local official for the initiative to the presiding judges on whether the scheme will be workable. The district judge in Nottingham will be announced shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.5/1">Reoffending rates for custodial and community sentences are published in &quot;Re-offending of Adults: Results from the 2004 Cohort&quot; (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 06/07). Figure 10 in this report suggests that community punishment orders and community punishment and rehabilitation orders may be more effective than prison sentences in reducing reoffending. Proven reoffending rates for all community sentences have been steadily improving since 2000 and now stand at 51 per cent. This compares with proven reoffending rates of over 70 per cent. for those given short custodial sentences, although the difference can be partially explained by differences in offender characteristics. However, only a limited range of offender characteristics are currently accounted for in the figures used. Further evidence that will explicitly investigate the effectiveness of sentencing will be provided by our current research programme. This includes a major study of sentencing that will provide more information about the relative effectiveness of sentencing than currently available from central statistics and reconviction studies.</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.8/1">In May 2006, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) issued a national multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) communications strategy to each of the 42 MAPPA strategic management boards in England and Wales. The aim of the strategy, and the accompanying toolkit, is to support MAPPA leads to promote MAPPA's work locally, including with the general public. In addition, the national MAPPA guidance is being revised and reissued this year, and a new public information leaflet will accompany it. Finally, the Home Secretary last year commissioned a review into existing arrangements for managing child sex offenders in the community which looked at, among other things, how the arrangements might be strengthened and how information might be better shared with the public. The review is due to be published shortly.</p>

Probation boards do have requirements to achieve levels of expenditure through sub-contracting services to other providers&mdash;10 per cent. during 2007-08, up from 5 per cent. in 2006-07&mdash;but only if such arrangements offer better value.</p>

This covers offenders who were released from prison or commenced a community penalty in the first quarter of 2004, for England and Wales.

The actual reoffending rate was 64.7 per cent. for custodial sentences and 50.5 per cent. for community sentences for the 2004 cohort.

Parts of the network are already cleared to this standard. Network Rail's Freight Utilisation Strategy (March 2007) sets out a strategy for accommodating predicted freight growth, including proposals for selective extension of W10 gauge.

There are no published figures for the perceptions data for the West Midlands police force area in 2003-04 as at that time the reporting of antisocial behaviour was measured using five strands of behaviour rather than the seven strands used currently. However, the BCS detected no statistically significant changes in the overall level of antisocial behaviour between 2003-04 and 2004-05 in the West Midlands police force area.</p>

	<p pid="b.430W.0/1">Methotrexate is used in the treatment of a variety of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancers (including leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and head and neck cancer). Leflunomide (Arava) is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Leflunomide is not authorised for use in conjunction with any other disease-modifying medicine, such as methotrexate.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.0/2">Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Commission for Human Medicines (CHM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the yellow card scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.0/3">For the three year period up to <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-30">30 April 2007</phrase>, the MHRA/CHM had received a total of 19 spontaneous reports of suspected ADRs with a fatal outcome in association with methotrexate when used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In the majority of the 19 reports the cause of death was attributed to lung disorders (such as pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonitis) and infections (septicaemia/septic shock). There were seven reports with a fatal outcome that were reported in association with leflunomide therapy. The cause of death in the seven reports was attributed to liver failure (one), lung disorder (two), heart attack (one), chest infection (one) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (two). The MHRA has not received any ADR reports with a fatal outcome associated with the combined use of methotrexate and leflunomide.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.0/4">It is important to note that the submission of a suspected ADR report does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medications and the patient's underlying disease. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk of developing serious infections and lung disorders as part of the natural disease process even in the absence of drug treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.0/5">The product information for methotrexate and leflunomide which is provided to doctors and patients has extensive information regarding the risk of developing serious lung disorders and infections. The product information also mentions the need for patients to have a full blood count and liver function tests before starting treatment and at regular intervals thereafter to detect potential adverse effects on the blood and liver. As with all medicines, the MHRA and CHM will continue to closely monitor the safe use of methotrexate and leflunomide.</p>

	<p pid="b.437W.5/2">The Government are planning to introduce a 'permitted level' for night noise (11 pm to 7 am) from licensed premises, through the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, later this year. This power will enable local authorities to take action once a warning notice has been served, with the option to offer the opportunity to discharge the offence through payment of a fixed penalty notice of &pound;500. This will be a power for local authorities, not a duty. In addition, local authorities have a duty to deal with statutory noise nuisance from premises under Part 3 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.5/3">No research has been undertaken specifically on the use of similar legislation in other countries in this area. However, the World Health Organisation recommends that a general outdoor daytime limit of 55 decibels (A) Leq is desirable to prevent any significant community annoyance. The WHO also recommends that, for good sleep, the sound-level should not exceed 30 decibels (A) for continuous background noise, and individual noises events exceeding 45 decibels (A) should be avoided.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.5/4">The code of practice on environmental noise control at concerts recommends that music noise levels should not exceed guidelines at one metre from the fa&ccedil;ade of any noise sensitive premises or events held between the hours of 9 am and 11 pm. These guidelines are set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="b.438W.2/1">Most national health service orthodontic care in the primary sector is provided by dental practitioners working as independent contractors. Prior to April 2006, most orthodontic services were provided under general dental services arrangements. These were demand-led services where the pattern of dental expenditure was largely determined by where dentists chose to practice, and how much NHS work they chose to undertake. Primary care trusts were not awarded fixed funding allocations for GDS.</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/2">PCTs only assumed full responsibility for local commissioning of primary care dentistry and received devolved budgets with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>.

Those allocations reflected the most current data on levels of expenditure on general and orthodontic services by dental contractors in each area. Subject to offering contracts to all serving contractors, PCTs were free to vary the balance of resources committed to either general or orthodontic care, or to supplement provision from within their total NHS resources, if they considered this an appropriate local priority.</p>

	<p pid="b.441W.0/13">In the case of County Durham and Dartford and Gravesham, the leases terminate either on expiry of the contract period or on an earlier termination at a break point. In any event, the excess lease period is of insufficient length to be of any commercial value. While the trusts have the right to abandon the site at the end of the contract period to the private sector, at present the only situation in which it is envisaged that the trust would want to abandon the site was if the land and buildings had a negative value and there was no health care use.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/14">Given that this is highly unlikely, the trust will almost inevitably exercise its right to take the site back into public ownership, thus automatically terminating the lease.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/15">In the case of Hereford, on termination at the end of the contract period the trust has four options, three of which result in it retaining the land at no cost and one where the private sector retain their long lease. The only scenario where the head lease would continue in the private sector's hands is if the trust itself wants to let it continue. Given that the trust has the option to terminate and use the land as it wishes, it is again difficult to envisage why the trust would ever want to exercise this option.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/16">The position at North Cumbria and Greenwich is less straightforward. At Carlisle, if the contracts continue for the full 45-year term, the head lease falls away at the end of term. If, however, the trust terminates the contract at the 30-year break point, the trust must either compensate the special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the residual value of the contract (essentially any profits foregone and any unrecovered costs that would have been covered if the lease had run its full term), or it could simply vacate the site and the SPV could then retain the lease for the remainder of the 125-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/17">It is not possible to determine what decisions the trust would make at the 30-year point, but it will be primarily dependent on operational need as if the hospital was still required, renewing the lease for 15 years would result in its full term being served. If there was no operational need for the hospital or the site, the relative costs and benefits of the termination payment would be compared to those of surrendering of the lease, and the most beneficial option for the taxpayer selected. However, given the remote location of the hospital, it is unlikely that there will be no need for the hospital in 20 years' time (30 years from 1997).</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/18">The contract at Greenwich (Queen Elizabeth hospitals) has a base term of 60 years, with a head lease of 125 years. If the contracts run for the full 60-year term, the trust has the option to cancel the head lease provided there is a healthcare purpose either for the land or for the cash proceeds from any sale. It is impossible to see how the trust would not exercise this option.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/19">At the breakpoint of 30 and 45 years, the trust can terminate the private finance initiative (PFI) contract, but the SPV would have the right to retain the head lease for the land for the remainder of the 125-year period. However, at the 30 and 45-year point, the availability payments fall away and the trust will make no building related payments. At the same time all domestic and support services are re-tendered and the trust need only pay for what it specifies at that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/20">Again, it is not possible to predict with certainty what will happen in many years time. If there was a health care need the contract would be renewed after the re-tendering. However, if there was no health care need, in the area, decisions would be taken on the basis of best value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/21">In all cases, the freehold of the land remains with the NHS, unless it resolves to sell or vacate it.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.0/22">These variations arose because, in the early days of PFI, each trust developed its own contract, and there were differences in the way leases were managed. In all contracts after these five, contracts and head leases are coterminous and the head lease automatically falls away with the contract.</p>

	<p pid="b.444W.9/1">The security situation varies across Iraq. Sectarian violence and attacks by terrorist groups represent the biggest challenge around Baghdad. In the south, the most serious problem is competition among Shi 'i militias and criminal gangs. In Basra, most attacks are against coalition forces. In provinces where the Iraqi authorities have assumed responsibility, they have shown themselves capable of dealing with security challenges. We continue to support them in developing their security capability.</p>

Following the adoption of UNSCR 1747, their assets in the UK were frozen immediately under the terms of the UK's Iran (Financial Sanctions) Order 2007. The Bank of England, at the Treasury's direction, provided public notification of the sanctions via its website.</p>

The resolution also makes provision for the licensing of basic and extraordinary expenses, subject to UN approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.0/4">The Treasury has been working to give effect to these provisions in a way that ensures that sanctions are applied robustly, while minimising the impact on innocent third parties. Having notified the UN, and, where appropriate, obtained its approval, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-17">17 April</phrase> the Treasury issued a licence allowing Bank Sepah International to make routine payments, such as staff salaries or payment of suppliers. The licence included a number of safeguards to ensure no prohibited payments are made.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-24">24 May</phrase>, the Treasury issued a number of licences allowing Bank Sepah International to make payments under certain letters of credit issued by the bank prior to its designation and to certain high-value depositors, subject to safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.0/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-31">31 May</phrase>, HM Treasury granted a general licence authorising UK companies and individuals to receive payments due to them under prior contracts with branches of Bank Sepah in the European economic area, where these payments have been duly authorised by the competent authority in the EEA state concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.454W.11/1">The picture is mixed: while there have been some positive developments, opposition parties are in practice considerably more constrained than the ruling National Democratic party.</p>
	<p pid="b.454W.11/2">Specifically, several new parties were licensed in 2004 and 2005 and in May this year a licence was granted to the new Democratic Front party. But applications from a number of other parties were refused earlier in the year on the grounds that they did not meet the technical requirements. Most political parties operate their own newspapers. All licensed parties were allowed to put forward a candidate in the presidential elections in 2005. Other political movements have managed to secure election to the People's Assembly as &quot;independents&quot;. A number of parties have declined to run candidates in the Shura Council elections this June.</p>

	<p pid="b.455W.2/2">The current Foreign and Commonwealth Office global opportunities fund human rights programme is global. Priority countries are identified through strategies on the key human rights issues the programme addresses: abolition of the death penalty, child rights, criminal justice and freedom of expression. In 2007-08, over 50 countries are eligible as priorities for one or more of the key issues. A full list can be found in the GOF human rights strategy at:</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/GOF_%20HR_ProgrammeStrategy07-08.pdf">http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/GOF_%20HR_ProgrammeStrategy07-08.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.455W.2/4">The GOF sustainable development programme (2005-07) had 30 eligible countries for human rights projects. The GOF human rights, democracy and good governance programme (2004-05) targeted countries under each of its thematic priorities, but did not establish a list of eligible countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.2/5">All GOF programmes have the flexibility to be able to respond to project proposals from any country, if the proposal has a clear regional impact or can act as a pilot project.</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.2/6">Several other GOF programmes such as Reuniting Europe and Engaging with the Islamic World also support some human rights projects. Funding for human rights related activities is also provided from our public diplomacy fund, Chevening programme, the global conflict prevention pool and directorate programme budgets. The FCO also provides grant-in-aid to organisations that carry out human rights related activity such as the BBC World Service, the British Council and the Westminster Foundation for Democracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.461W.5/1">An effective peacekeeping force is needed to protect citizens in Darfur. All parties agreed in Addis Ababa in November last year that this would involve a phased increase of UN support to the African Union mission in Sudan (AMIS) culminating in a joint AU-UN hybrid force. We are pressing the AU and UN to ensure that this force is effective and deployed as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.5/2">The initial stage of UN assistance to AMIS (the light support package) is approximately 80 per cent. deployed. The Government of Sudan have agreed the 3,000 strong second stage (the heavy support package) and the UN is generating the required personnel and assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.5/3">The details of the hybrid force are being agreed between the AU and UN. The Government of Sudan must accept the hybrid and facilitate its deployment. If they do not co-operate, we will be prepared to introduce tougher sanctions.</p>

	<p pid="b.463W.2/1">The UK Government are committed to the full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, going beyond the requirements of the initiative by giving 100 per cent. flow relief at decision point and 100 per cent. debt stock cancellation at completion point. The UK also holds in trust any loan repayments made since 2000 by HIPC countries, who have not yet begun to receive debt relief under the HIPC initiative, and returns them at HIPC completion Point.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.2/2">The Department for International Development no longer gives official development assistance in the form of loans. The Government cancelled existing aid loans to the poorest countries under its retrospective terms adjustment policy, and under the Commonwealth debt initiative delivers debt relief to the poorest Commonwealth countries committed to poverty reduction. The few outstanding loans are to countries that were middle or high income countries at the time the loans were cancelled.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.2/3">In 1999, a portfolio of loans to public sector and parastatal bodies previously held by the Commonwealth development corporation were transferred to DFID following CDC's part privatisation. For HIPC countries, repayments are held in trust until countries qualify for the HIPC Initiative, then payments are suspended and the loans are cancelled once they complete the HIPC process.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.2/4">The UK's Export Credit Guarantee Department does not make loans to other states. ECGD guarantees payment for specific contracts involving UK suppliers. Over time, ECGD has made a number of corresponding payments to lenders in respect of these guarantees, and some of these have been consolidated into debt agreements with particular debtor countries, although these do not constitute loans. In this regard ECGD has delivered significant amounts of debt relief through the Paris Club.</p>

	<p pid="b.467W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the number of workers from other countries in the UK labour market. I am replying in her absence. (140178)</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/4" class="indent">The attached table shows the number of people of working age in employment by their country of birth. The table gives an average estimate for the 12 months to December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/5" class="indent">When interpreting the figures in the table, it is important to bear in mind that the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas for the following reasons:</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/6" class="indent">The LFS sample covers people living in private households, those in National Health Service (NHS) accommodation, and students living in halls of residence who have a UK-resident parent. Students living in halls of residence who do not have a UK-resident parent are not covered by the sample.</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/7" class="indent">The LFS does not cover people living in other types of communal establishment (such as hostels, hotels, boarding houses, or mobile home sites).</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/8" class="indent">Individuals living at sampled addresses are generally included in the survey only if they regard the address as their main residence. Those who have been living at the address for less than six months are not eligible to take part in the survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/9" class="indent">The survey results are weighted to estimates of the 'usually resident' UK population living in private households, NHS accommodation and student halls of residence. The population figures cover long-term international migrants (people who change their country of usual residence for 12 months or more). They do not include people moving to the UK for less than 12 months, nor do they exclude from the usually resident population people moving out of the UK for less than 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/10" class="indent">The LFS estimates at this detailed level are only consistent with the UK population estimates published in February and March 2003 and they do not incorporate the more recent population estimates that are used in the headline LFS series.</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.3/11" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty, particularly for such small sub-groups of the population.</p>

	<p pid="b.471W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding fraudulent registrations, inaccurate information held by the General Register Office and the number of births and deaths that are unregistered for the last five years. (139969, 139970, 139971)</p>
	<p pid="b.471W.2/4" class="indent">Very small numbers of births are found to be improperly registered either because no birth has taken place or the person registering the birth is falsely claiming to be a parent. We are aware of no more than 50 instances of one kind or the other in the last 4 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.471W.2/5" class="indent">Births and deaths registration information held by the General Register Office is generally provided by a family member who has knowledge of the facts. In the event of any inaccurate information being brought to the General Register Office's attention the law provides for corrections to be made. In the period 2005/06 General Register Office received 4292 applications for corrections to birth entries and 1553 applications for corrections to death entries.</p>
	<p pid="b.471W.2/6" class="indent">The NHS issues a birth notification to the General Register Office for each birth it is aware of. This provides a check against births registered and enables follow up of any that remain unregistered. The number of births notified in the last 5 years that remain unregistered is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.471W.2/17" class="indent">Known unregistered deaths most often occur where the family are in dispute, for example with a hospital, regarding the treatment received or the cause of death, and are therefore unwilling to sign the death entry. Cases also occur where a body is found and the coroner is unable to provide sufficient information. The number of known deaths in the last five years that remain unregistered is as follows:</p>
