	<p pid=".1225W.9/1">Around 40 per cent of the International Development Association's (IDA's) resources currently come from re-flows from previous loans being repaid. During negotiations for the 13th Replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA-13), the British Government argued consistently that if some loans were to be converted to grants under IDA-13, IDA donors should ensure that a scheme was agreed to compensate IDA for the resulting future loss in re-flows. Such a scheme would require donors to start putting aside a small amount of resources now and during future replenishments.</p>
	<p pid=".1225W.9/2">Very regrettably, IDA donors have not yet managed to agree such a scheme, despite strong UK pressure to do so. Donors have, however, accepted the principle that extra resources do need to be put aside in advance of future shortfalls. They have agreed to make a final decision on what sort of scheme should be used during the Mid-Term Review of IDA-13, which is scheduled to begin in around six months' time. The British Government will continue to press hard to ensure a satisfactory outcome which will protect IDA's long-term financial sustainability.</p>

	<p pid=".1226W.3/1">Fines are imposed by both Magistrates' Courts and the Crown Court. The Crown Court is part of the Court Service, which is an executive agency of the Lord Chancellor's Department. The Court Service does not collect fines. Fines are collected by Magistrates' Courts and their staff, which constitute an independent local service with statutory powers for the enforcement and collection of financial penalties.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/2">The Government are committed to improving the enforcement of financial penalties. Variations in performance across the country are too wide. We have transferred lead responsibility for warrant execution from the police to Magistrates' Courts Committees, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/3">We have established an information sharing scheme, which enables Magistrates' Courts to obtain basic information on defaulters from the Department for Work and Pensions. We have set performance targets for 2002&ndash;03 and Magistrates' Courts Committees have also been given nearly &pound;10 million extra from April 2002, ring-fenced for enforcement purposes. We will monitor the position carefully to check that performance improves.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/4">Magistrates' Courts Committees have responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed through the courts, including not only fines but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not possible to separate out just the fines from the total.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/5">Arrears is described as the total of missed lump sums or missed instalments on impositions where deferred payment was allowed. The latest available figures for the level of arrears of all debt are:</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/6">(c) &pound;246 million as at <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>; and</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/7">(d) &pound;226 million as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/8">Data are only collected on the financial value of the debt, not the number of fines. Fines are normally payable from the moment of imposition unless time to pay is granted.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/9">Since the transfer, the write-off rate has reduced from 19 per cent of total debt imposed in 2000&ndash;01 to 15 per cent. of total debt imposed in 2001&ndash;02, which was equivalent to &pound;19.5 million.</p>

	<p pid=".1230W.2/1">The Highways Agency has received numerous complaints from local residents living adjacent to the M1 south of junction 25 about the high level of traffic noise. As part of the Government's &quot;New Deal for Trunk Roads in England&quot;, revised criteria and a ring fenced annual budget have been established to help the Agency to deal with some of the most serious and pressing cases of noise from the motorway and trunk road network.</p>
	<p pid=".1230W.2/2">Following an initial assessment of sites on the network, the M1 junction 25 was identified as an area with a particular noise problem and was subsequently included in the list of locations to be prioritised for treatment published in <i>Hansard </i>in November 1999. This was followed by a detailed Scheme Identification Study to determine the most appropriate and viable method of reducing the noise problems at this location. Environmental barriers were found to be the most cost effective solution. A local consultation exercise was carried out in October 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".1230W.2/3">The estimated final cost of the works is &pound;1.2 million, but this includes an element for the upgrade of part of the motorway communications network (approximately &pound;130,000), which is being carried out at the same time. The work was authorised and is being funded by the Highways Agency.</p>

Officials in my Department are working closely with representatives from the livestock industry to identify the priority markets and to pursuade those countries to lift any remaining restrictions. The priority countries for pigs and porcine genetic material include Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovak Republic, South Africa, Thailand, USA. This is being pursued by a variety of methods such as lobbying officials at trade shows, bringing them in on inward missions, getting British Embassies to make representations and through further correspondence.</p>

	<p pid=".1236W.0/1">The accounts of the principal contractors used by DEFRA during the FMD outbreak have been the subject of detailed examination.

This work is on-going.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.0/2">It has necessitated DEFRA obtaining legal advice from a number of external law firms as well as the establishment of invoicing panels and commercial teams staffed by forensic accountants and quantity surveyors, all of whom come from external professional firms.</p>

In many cases, the deductions have been substantial. The process is on-going.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.0/4">Wide-ranging issues have arisen on the accounts. These include legal issues such as matters of contractual interpretation, forensic accountancy issues and evidential issues involving the assessment of both a large amount of documentation and proofing of witnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.0/5">Some of these disputes will inevitably result in court proceedings although DEFRA remains committed to resolving matters by mediation where appropriate.

	<p pid=".1246W.5/2">Beyond that, we support continued discussions in the TRIPS Council on the relationship between TRIPS and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and how TRIPS and the CBD can be implemented in a mutually supportive manner.</p>

	<p pid=".1246W.5/4">On GATS, the Government strongly support the current negotiations. The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world. Our aim is to achieve further steps in the progressive liberalisation of trade in services, which we believe will have a positive impact not only on our own economic interests but also on the development of developing countries. That said, the EC has made clear in its liberalisation requests that it is not seeking the dismantling of public services nor the privatisation of state owned companies. Under GATS, countries cannot be forced to privatise services where it is not in their interest to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".1249W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-03">3 July 2002</phrase>, announcing the publication of a consultation paper on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud. The consultation period will last until <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-10">10 January 2003</phrase>. The Government have made it clear that the introduction of an entitlement card would be a major step and that it would not proceed without consulting widely and considering all the views expressed very carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.5/2">The paper includes a number of estimates of what a scheme would cost, depending on the sophistication of the card. A reasonable estimate would be that a scheme would cost around &pound;1.5 billion over a 13 year period covering the three years it would take to set up the necessary Information Technology systems and the 10 year period for which the first cards would be valid.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.5/3">This would include much more stringent identity checks than currently apply for passports and driving licences in response to increased levels of fraudulent applications.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.5/4">It would also include the costs of using biometric information (fingerprints or iris images) which would uniquely link the card holder with a card.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.5/5">This estimate does not include any savings to Government through more efficient administration and reductions in fraud. The paper also sets out how the costs might be recovered through increases in fees for driving licences and passports and charging a fee for entitlement cards issued to those who did not qualify for or who did not want to apply for a card in the form of a photocard driving licence or passport card. It would not be the Government's intention to use funds allocated for investment in public services for a card scheme.</p>

Also, police forces may give priority to tackling particular types of crime, with the detection rate of those crimes having some effect on the force's overall detection rate.</p>

This section makes it an offence for employers knowingly or negligently to employ persons aged 16 or over who are subject to immigration control unless they fall into one of two categories. They must either have current and valid permission to be in the United Kingdom which does not prevent them taking the job in question, or they must fall into a category where such employment is otherwise allowed.</p>

	<p pid=".1263W.5/2">There are a number of national organisations which provide support and services for people with dementia and their carers, including the alzheimer's society, dementia voice and carers UK. In South Tyneside, there is a network of community services, provided through the community services department, which support people with dementia and their carers; and other services are being developed. The Alzheimer's Society provides a wide range of support services in collaboration with the personal advisor service which works in local primary health care teams and with the specialist mental health trust. Day care facilities are provided at Palmers Community Hospital in Jarrow.</p>
	<p pid=".1263W.5/3">The Department is promoting the availability of information through implementation of Standard 2 of the NSF, and of the information strategy which underpins the NSF, and through more general developments to promote patient and public involvement, for example, through patient advice and liaison services.</p>

A study has been commissioned by the Department of Health Radiological Protection Research Programme (RPRP) and is a multicentre study co-ordinated by the childhood cancer research group in Oxford. This study is nearing completion and the Department has asked COMARE to advise on which, if any, nuclear installations in Great Britain have incidences of childhood cancer and leukaemia in their vicinity which are statistically outside the distribution seen nationally. COMARE is hoping to report on this aspect of the study to the Department in 2003. The study is investigating, among other topics, clustering as a feature of childhood cancer. This will be broken down as leukaemia and other childhood cancers and other groupings considered relevant. The study will also relate leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma around nuclear installations to the Great Britain clustering analysis.</p>

	<p pid=".1268W.8/2">In November 2001 the HFEA and the Human Genetics Commission (HGC) published the outcome of their joint public consultation on PGD which had begun in November 1999 as a joint consultation between the HFEA and the then Advisory Committee on Genetics Testing. This supported the use of PGD, subject to strict licensing arrangements, and concluded that tissue-typing as part of PGD would require further discussion. Following further consideration of the issue by the HFEA's ethics committee, the HFEA announced in December 2001 their decision in principle to allow PGD for serious genetic disease to be used in conjunction with tissue typing. Applications are considered on an individual basis and to date only one licence has been granted after very careful and lengthy consideration of the issues involved.</p>

	<p pid=".1271W.0/1">An assessment of safety issues associated with herbal medicines, whether comprising of one or more ingredients, will be placed in the Library. In summary, safety issues relating to unlicensed herbal remedies leading to public health risk have arisen in the United Kingdom and elsewhere as a result of a number of factors. These include: interactions between herbal remedies and other medicines; the inherent toxicity of a herbal ingredient; the inclusion of toxic herbal ingredients or contamination as a result of poor manufacturing standards; and the adulteration of herbal remedies with other ingredients, such as prescription only cortico- steroids.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.0/2">There are a range of possible reasons why a product currently sold as an unlicensed herbal remedy under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act, 1968, might not satisfy the criteria of the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products. There are no specific quality or safety standards set under the current regulatory regime for unlicensed herbal remedies and it is therefore possible that in some cases, without adjustment to the product, the safety and quality standards applicable under the proposed directive might not be met. Concerns have been expressed by some respondents to a recent consultation exercise (MLX 283) carried out by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) that some products, currently legally sold as unlicensed herbal remedies may fall outside the scope of the directive as a result of an inability to demonstrate traditional usage as currently defined in the directive. The consultation period has been extended to the end of July specifically to allow those expressing concerns to identify any examples of such products.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.0/3">As the MCA's consultation exercise on the proposed directive is still in progress analysis of the results is ongoing. There have, however, been some representations suggesting that the 30 year period for demonstrating traditional use might be reduced. The figure of 30 years as a reasonable indicator of traditional usage was one that commanded wide support among many member states throughout the informal development of the directive. The specific examples which the MCA has asked the herbal sector to provide by the end of July should help to demonstrate whether the proposed 30 year criteria would in practice present a significant threat to the regulatory position of herbal remedies which could reasonably be regarded as traditional.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.0/4">An initial discussion of the proposed directive took place in the Council of Ministers' working group on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-10">10 June</phrase>. The UK Government indicated their view that the quality, reliability and relevance of the evidence of traditional use was more important than its geographical origin. We will continue to argue this position as negotiations proceed.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.0/5">The purpose of the positive list of herbal substances within the proposed directive is to facilitate applications for traditional use registrations so that, where an application complies with the positive list, the applicant need not demonstrate safety or traditional use of the product. The directive proposes that the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products will be responsible for establishing and maintaining the list. Items will be included on the list where the committee accepts that a particular herbal substance, used within the parameters laid down in the list for example as to strength and therapeutic indication, meet the requirements of the directive as to safety and traditional usage.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.0/6">The terms used in the initial regulatory impact assessment of the proposed directive were intended to give a very broad indication of the relative impact of the proposals. The actual costs attributable to the directive are likely to vary widely between companies, depending on many factors. For example, the impact of the directive could be very high on a company which was currently placing large numbers of herbal medicines on the market while not following any systematic quality standards. This assessment of very high regulatory impact is unlikely to apply, for example, to those UK companies which manufacture unlicensed herbal remedies in compliance with various systematic codes of practice operated by a number of trade associations in the herbal medicines and health food sector. Similarly, the potential for increased sales, which may for example flow from increased public confidence in the quality of products on offer and improved product information will depend on the response of individual companies.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.0/7">The proposed directive would require product information for a herbal medicine with a traditional use registration to include a statement indicating that the efficacy of the product was not proven. A separate proposal in the review of European Union legislation for licensed medicines would allow companies to state in advertising that a medicine with a marketing authorisation was licensed. Both herbal medicines with a marketing authorisation and those with a traditional use registration would have been assessed by the competent authority as having acceptable safety. The indication for a traditional use registered product would be based on long usage rather than proven efficacy, as is required for a product with a marketing authorisation. The MCA has indicated that it has no present plans to review licensed herbal medicines with a view to assessing whether some might more appropriately come within the category of traditional use registration. This is a complex issue and it is possible that the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products as proposed in the directive may develop guidance on this area in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.0/8">Concerns have been expressed by some in the health sector that the proposed quality and manufacturing standards may be over-regulatory. Those expressing such concerns have been invited during the extended period of consultation on the directive to identify which particular standards might be regarded as unnecessary or inappropriate. Further dialogue on this issue should enable the regulatory impact assessment to be enhanced.</p>

My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and I are meeting representatives of the herbal sector during July to discuss the proposed Directive. In the light of points which may emerge from this further consultation and dialogue, we will consider what additional points we may wish to pursue during the course of the negotiations. We have already highlighted that we wish to see greater flexibility to take account of non-European herbal traditions and that we intend to press for an early date to be specified for the review of the scope of the directive with a view to its possible extension to at least some categories of non herbal traditional medicines.</p>

	<p pid=".1273W.5/1">I am advised that food and fluids should always be offered to patients who are capable of swallowing them. For terminally ill patients in the final days of life the objective is to control distressing and painful symptoms. Achieving such control may result in sedation. Many patients stop drinking and eating during the final days and it will be for clinical judgment to decide what is the appropriate treatment. Where nutrition and hydration have to be provided by artificial means, their possible withdrawal is in all cases a matter of clinical judgment which is undertaken in accordance with professional advice in accordance with a responsible body of medical opinion and the general law.</p>
	<p pid=".1273W.5/2">An adult patient who is capable of making his or her own treatment decision is entitled to do so and can refuse artificial hydration and nutrition just as he can any other form of treatment. In the absence of a valid advance refusal of treatment, doctors are required to act in the best interests of a adult patient who is unable to make his or her own treatment decisions. Sometimes this will mean that medical treatment (which includes artificial hydration and nutrition) which is no longer beneficial to the patient should be withdrawn. In these circumstances, suitable medical or other care should be provided to ensure that the comfort and dignity of the patient are maintained. In line with good practice, decisions to withdraw medical treatment should be made only after discussions with the healthcare team and those close to the patient.</p>
	<p pid=".1273W.5/3">Guidance in relation to palliative care <i>(Changing Gear&mdash;Guidelines for Managing the last days of life in adults</i>) was issued by the Department of Health in 1998, and advice on withdrawing and withholding treatment was included in the <i>Reference Guide to Consent for Examination and Treatment,</i> published in March 2001. Further guidance is also available from the British Medical Association.</p>

	<p pid=".1275W.2/1">The new National Health Service information technology programme was outlined in the document &quot;Delivering 21st Century IT Support for the NHS: National Strategic Programme&quot;, published by the Department in June 2002. The key change of direction is to take greater central control over the specification, procurement, resource management, performance management and implementation of the information and IT strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".1275W.2/2">Existing local procurements, and the development by local primary care organisations of system specifications and functional requirements, are valuable in the development of a new national approach. Guidance published by the Department in support of the June 2002 document states:</p>
	<p pid=".1275W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Procurements are underway in many places to deliver electronic patient records and other systems and these procurements need to proceed. Certainly by 2008, as indicated in Delivering the NHS Plan, we expect to see all key applications and functionality of electronic patient records in all PCTs and Trusts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1275W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-29">29 April 2002</phrase> the NHS primary care information modernisation programme published a guidance document advising local organisations that have not yet begun procurements to await further guidance arising from the new approach to system certification and accreditation. There was no advice to halt existing procurements; instead the programme advised:</p>
	<p pid=".1275W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;Primary care organisations that have already begun the procurement of new primary and community information systems should contact the Primary Care Information Modernisation team. This will enable the team to have a clear understanding of all local activity and the impact that this will have on current and future national initiatives. The team will ensure that the primary care organisation is made aware of any other relevant activity, including contact details, and will provide more detailed guidance and support if required.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1275W.2/6">As the new procurement strategy is developed, the Department will issue further advice as to how migration to the new arrangements will be made. This will cover all NHS IT procurements, including those relating to primary care organisations, and will take into account developments arising from existing local procurements.</p>

	<p pid=".1279W.0/1">A defibrillator advisory committee (DAC) was established at the outset of the initiative to assist the government with the implementation of the defibrillator initiative. One of its tasks was to recommend criteria for the training competencies of those individuals who may be required to use an automated external defibrillator (AEDs) at sites identified. An initial four hour training programme was agreed that covered the training outcomes of basic life support (BLS) and the use of an AED. Trainees are not certified if they fail to achieve the crucial competencies. Refresher training occurs at six monthly intervals to ensure skill and knowledge retention. All trainees who pass the course are issued with a training record card that is certified by the trainer to show they have attended a training course in BLS and the use of an AED; this is updated following the successful completion of subsequent refresher training courses.</p>
	<p pid=".1279W.0/2">A formal procurement process to purchase training services was undertaken to meet the training requirements of the programme's national roll-out and to ensure the appropriate training of personnel at sites identified. Training contracts were awarded under the direction of the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) and in conjunction with medical and educational advisors from the resuscitation council (UK) Training contracts for five National Health Service regions were awarded to ambulance service training departments, St. John Ambulance was awarded contracts for two regions, and the British Red Cross was awarded a contract for one region.</p>

The programme consisted of 19 projects, nine of which have now completed. The projects ranged in size from one to exchange information between NHS Direct and general practitioner (GP) systems, to a pan community service covering a health authority (as previously defined), linking hospitals, general practice, ambulance and social care. Two general practices (Bury Knowle and Hatfield) have explored the issues of allowing patients access to their own GP records.</p>
