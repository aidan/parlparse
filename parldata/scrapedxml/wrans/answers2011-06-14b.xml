In the last two years the Gambling Commission has undertaken research into a range of issues associated with gaming machines and published several independent reports. Building on the Commission's work, the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board, which now determines the strategy and priorities for research, education and treatment, has included research on gambling machines within its strategy to be implemented through the Responsible Gambling Fund (RGF). The RGF's first project on terrestrial gaming machines is due to report in the summer and will seek to identify the distribution of machines across Britain against population density and socio-economic information. RGF has recently invited tenders for its second study in this area which will explore the relationship between gaming machines features and consumer behaviour in Britain.</p>

Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers now have more flexibility in the way they help benefit claimants, enabling a more personalised service that is better able to meet individual and local labour market needs. To help facilitate this, we have amalgamated a number of discretionary funds to create one Flexible Support Fund, which provides additional means to supplement and tailor the core back to work support available for claimants.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/3">Jobcentre Plus advisers will consider helping with costs associated with travel to interviews outside a claimants' local travel to work area or, in some discretionary circumstances, the costs of travelling to local interviews. Advisers also have the discretion to assist claimants with travel expenses to support the transition between benefits and sustained work, e.g. travel passes for the first month of a new job. This additional support is potentially available to claimants across the country whether or not a Workwise programme is in operation.</p>

	<p pid="b.683W.7/1">Where necessary the Ministry of Defence consults with other Government Departments on the implications that international agreements may have on our acquisition programmes. In this case there are no implications for the import of the Watchkeeper system to the United Kingdom. The Watchkeeper system is classed as a Category II system in that it does not have the ability to carry a 500 kg payload to a distance of at least 300 km. Exports of Category II systems are permitted under Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines in accordance with national export licensing arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.683W.7/2">Israel states that it voluntarily adheres to MTCR guidelines despite not being a member. In this context it is therefore Israel&#8217;s responsibility to have made an assessment of the Watchkeeper system against MTCR controls before approving its export.</p>

Member on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June 2011</phrase>, <i>Official R</i> <i>eport</i>, column 161W, prisoners have access to television in-cell as part of local incentives and earned privileges schemes. Prisoners rent the televisions from the prison service for a weekly rental charge of &#163;1 per set per week or part week. The rental charge is deducted from prisoner's earnings which average &#163;9.60 per week. The revenue from this charge is used to purchase new and replacement televisions and the costs associated with the switch off of the analogue TV signal. There are no plans to raise this charge.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.5/2">In addition to television in-cell prisoners may have access to television in communal areas. The National Offender Management Service does not record centrally which prison establishments provide communal television. However, most public sector prisons provide communal television viewing facilities. The National Offender Management Service Central Accounting System does not record separately expenditure on television equipment purchased for use in communal viewing areas. To identify these costs would require examining each establishment's payment records and this would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.693W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice announced in the Green Paper, &#8220;Breaking the Cycle&#8221;, published in December 2010, that it will test a local approach to payment by results. The aim is to encourage local statutory partners to reduce crime and reoffending, and enable them to reinvest any savings that their success realises for the justice system in further activity to prevent reoffending in their communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.5/2">The Ministry of Justice will run pilots for two years in Manchester City region and across a number of London boroughs, including Croydon and Lewisham.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.5/3">The local approach focuses on whether more effective working to reduce crime and reoffending can result in reductions in demand on the justice system. The Ministry of Justice has developed a model to measure the demand on the justice system during the pilots and make payments to the pilot areas accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.5/4">Partners in the pilot boroughs are developing their delivery plans for the pilots, and have the freedom to approach the pilots according to their local needs and priorities. The London Crime Reduction Board (LCRB) is supportive of the opportunity to test this justice reinvestment approach in London. The members of the LCRB Delivery Management Group, including the Metropolitan Police Service, London Probation Trust, Greater London Authority, Metropolitan Police Authority and London councils, have agreed to support the pilot areas to unlock barriers to delivery; identify opportunities for collaboration, and share good practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.5/5">The Ministry of Justice will evaluate the pilots to understand how they are associated with changes in demand on the criminal justice system. This will include the monitoring of reoffending and crime rates, as well as a wider range of criminal justice system data, including policing trends, and this will be finalised as part of the evaluation approach for the pilot. The Ministry of Justice has done some analysis of demand in setting up the pilots, but there are no projections moving forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.5/6">The Ministry of Justice will use the learning from the pilots to help to inform proposals for future reforms to the system, alongside the other payment by results pilots. There are no immediate plans to expand the approach to other areas.</p>

The Business Growth Fund is a long-term intervention, funded fully by the banks, and designed to provide finance for firms seeking growth capital helping to fund the recovery which fall between initiatives for small business support and those for larger companies.</p>

	<p pid="b.701W.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the Office of Tax Simplification (OTS), and I have asked the OTS to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from John Whiting, dated June 2011</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/3">Guto Bebb MP has submitted a written parliamentary question about the tax administration strand of the Office of Tax Simplification's final report for the review of small business taxation. The question was:</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/4">&#8220;To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether the Office of Tax Simplification review of tax administration for small business includes consideration of VAT registration; and when he expects the Office of Tax Simplification to report its findings.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/5">The OTS's interim report on small business taxation was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-10">10 March 2011</phrase>. The report included a short section (paragraphs 4.61-4.66) on VAT, which did address the question of the registration threshold. Our conclusion was: &#8220;On balance we think the registration threshold should stay as it is, though it is an area that is worth further study.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/6">The Chancellor responded to this report in Budget 2011, and commissioned the OTS to look into tax administration in the final report on small business taxation. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-09">9 May 2011</phrase>, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury wrote to the OTS Chairman, Rt Hon Michael Jack, outlining the Government's response and setting out priorities for the next stage of the Office's work in more detail<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/7">As set out in the Exchequer Secretary's letter, the remit of the work on tax administration will require the OTS to &#8220;examine closely small businesses' experience of tax administration and their contact with HMRC at key stages of their annual cycle&#8221; and to &quot;give specific consideration of the issues involved in starting and growing a new business.&quot; The terms of reference for this work are attached in the annex of this document.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/8">Over the summer, the OTS will gather evidence and conduct research to determine the areas of tax administration that ought to be prioritised. The operation of VAT registration is very much within the remit, although we understand that HMRC is already working hard to improve the registration process. As highlighted in the interim report, the OTS is also interested in the administrative difficulties related to VAT and international trade that pose particular problems for small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/9">An exact date for publication has not yet been determined, but the OTS has been asked to deliver recommendations on tax administration for small business ahead of Budget 2012. We would be happy to inform the questioner when the report is published.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.0/10">I hope this is helpful, and would like to thank Mr Bebb for his interest in our work.</p>

We have also committed to review the impact of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and we continue to fund the National Stalking Helpline and lead a monthly National Stalking Strategy Group to support the quarterly ACPO Stalking Working Group.

	<p pid="b.708W.8/1">Since April 2009 the UK has had in place a multi-agency framework for identifying and protecting victims of trafficking&#8212;the National Referral Mechanism (NRM).</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.8/2">There is currently no record of any enforced return of individuals conclusively found to be victims of trafficking under the NRM. However, being a victim does not automatically entitle someone to remain in the UK indefinitely. Where a recognised victim of trafficking does not meet established criteria the expectation must be that they return to their own country. In all cases voluntary departure is the preferred option and repatriation would only be enforced where it was deemed safe and appropriate to do so in accordance with the UK's domestic and international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="b.716W.0/2">While the dry spell is continuing to have a variety of effects on crops with some, particularly on light land, showing the effects of water stress, it remains too early to predict with any certainty what the eventual impact of this particular period of dry weather will be in terms of crop yields. Many factors will continue to combine to affect production and we are working closely with the industry to help farmers in managing and adapting to the changing circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.716W.0/3">Ministers have taken a close and hands-on interest in the impacts of the dry spell. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40391" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman)</phrase>, held a drought summit on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-16">16 May</phrase> with water companies, farming groups and environment agencies to make sure the country was prepared for drought conditions and to hear first-hand of the impacts being felt. At that summit she asked the Environment Agency to report on the likelihood of a drought in the longer term, and how it might affect our farmers, our food industry and consumers. The Environment Agency now produces weekly drought management bulletins and will report back to the Secretary of State later this month, assessing the likely impacts of prolonged dry weather including the plans in place to manage drought.</p>
	<p pid="b.716W.0/4">The summit is scheduled to reconvene later this month but, in the interim, the Secretary of State has arranged a meeting of those who get their water from rivers to find immediate steps they can take to make that water go further&#8212;not just to deal with the current dry weather, but also to help inform longer term reliance issues for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.716W.0/5">Prices of agricultural commodities such as grains are determined on international agricultural markets. As such, any final impact on crop prices will be determined by global weather conditions and their impact on global production, rather than by the impact of drought on UK crop production.</p>

	<p pid="b.717W.2/3">At retail level, prices for domestically produced salad (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers and courgettes), have remained relatively stable, although demand has declined, with the result that more produce is being sent to the wholesale market, which is experiencing movement in prices.

	<p pid="b.717W.2/4">One impact of the decision by the Russian Federation to impose a ban on EU fruit and vegetable produce is that surplus produce has been directed to alternative EU markets, including our own.

	<p pid="b.719W.0/1">DEFRA has had no recent discussions with Natural England on this. Standards for this type of work are currently a matter for the professional bodies and associations. Both DEFRA and Natural England support their efforts to promote standards through codes of conduct and the use of independently produced standards such as the British Standards Institution Publicly Available Specification on planning and biodiversity. We have no plans to regulate.</p>

	<p pid="b.721W.11/1">The Appraisal of Sustainability outlines how the preferred route has managed to avoid most potential impacts on designated habitats and sites. No sites of international significance would be adversely affected and impacts to nationally protected sites would be restricted to just a few locations. Should Government decide to proceed with high speed rail an environmental impact assessment (EIA) will be prepared to accompany a Hybrid Bill. It is at this stage that detailed assessments would be made regarding wildlife populations. Results of the assessment and proposed mitigation would be consulted upon before the Hybrid Bill goes before Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.731W.4/1">We are clear that annual growth in the EU budget must be curbed. EU external spending, about 6% of the total EU budget, can complement the UK's own efforts in promoting growth and stability, tackling poverty and preventing conflict. However, there remains scope for rationalisation in this area of the budget, including administration costs. In addition, the European External Action Service must fulfil its commitment to budget neutrality over time, and as such the Council and Commission budgets for external spending also need to contribute to efficiency savings.</p>

While we do not consider there is a need to establish new posts in the region, we have frequently and substantially reinforced our staffing in recent months. We have an honorary consul in Nouakchott and expect to re-open our political office in August to bolster existing work from Rabat. We will keep the need for additional deployments under review</p>

	<p pid="b.737W.2/1">The European Neighbourhood Policy was launched in 2004 with the objective of promoting stability, security and well-being in the countries in the EU's Neighbourhood, including Egypt and Tunisia. European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument assistance for 2011-13 stood at &#8364;240 million for Tunisia and &#8364;449 million for Egypt before the revolutions. In recent months the EU has committed additional financial resources to support the transition process in Egypt and Tunisia.</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.2/2">Discussions are continuing between the EU and the interim authorities in Egypt and Tunisia as to how these additional resources can be best used. In Tunisia, initial funding has been allocated for supporting elections; the work of the three commissions on political reform, human rights and corruption; and funding for civil society and judicial reform. For Egypt, the proposed package covers assistance to review laws relating to non-governmental organisations, media, association, political parties and the penal and criminal code; support for justice reform and review of the security system; support for elections and civil society; political capacity building; support for health and education reform; and vocational training.</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.2/3">As the Prime Minister made clear in March, we believe the EU needs to make a real and credible offer to its neighbours. We believe the joint European Commission and External Action Service Communication of <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-25">25 May</phrase>, reviewing the European Neighbourhood Policy, delivers that ambitious and far-reaching offer to the Neighbourhood, including through further opening of EU markets.</p>

Together with European Union partners, we regularly make clear that we expect all countries to fulfil their obligations, either as ICC States Parties or as United Nations members, to co-operate with this investigation including the enforcement of arrest warrants issued by the court.

	<p pid="b.738W.5/1">Obtaining independently verifiable information out of Syria is difficult given the Syrian Government's stance restricting the access of international humanitarian organisations to towns and cities affected by the current violence and by their barring entry to Syria of the international media.

We must not stand silent in the face of those outrages, and we will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.5/3">The EU has already frozen the assets of, and banned travel by, members of the regime, and President Assad is included on that list. We are exploring with our European partners the potential for further sanctions if the violence continues.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.5/4">In New York, Britain has circulated a draft UN Security Council resolution condemning the repression in Syria and calling for the Syrian Government to meet their people's legitimate demands, release all prisoners of conscience, lift restrictions on the media and internet and co-operate with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. A resolution is not in our gift, and needs the support of nine UN Security Council members and no vetoes. We are working to persuade other countries that the Security Council has a responsibility to speak out. President Assad is losing legitimacy and should reform or step aside.</p>

	<p pid="b.739W.6/2">The big society bank aims to boost the ability of civil society organisations, including charities, to deal with social issues. It will do this by supporting organisations that invest in civil society; helping them provide a greater range of financial services to charities; and helping them raise more money for onward investment into the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.739W.6/3">The financial intermediaries supported by the big society bank are expected to primarily support charities that generate enough revenue through their activities to repay the investment they receive. The additional financial provision facilitated by the big society bank is likely to include increased access to working capital for charities, which is an important contributor to operational viability.</p>
	<p pid="b.739W.6/4">Increasing the financial options available to charities as well as the overall level of capital coming into the sector, should also mean that grant finance can go where it is most needed.</p>

Our work with the Clinton Foundation to drive down treatment costs will generate enough cost-savings to purchase medicines- for an additional 500,000 people by 2015.</p>

A 2008 report &#8220;Tax evasion, tax avoidance and tax expenditures in developing countries: A review of the literature&#8221; by the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation for the Department for International Development highlighted the methodological and data difficulties with estimates of this type.</p>

The strategy set out a range of areas where it plans to improve outcomes, such as survival rates and patient experience, in line with the NHS Outcomes Framework and the draft Public Health Outcome Framework. We will be assessing progress against those outcomes but it is too early to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.5/2">We can however assess progress in relation to actions that the strategy committed to in order to support delivery of improved outcomes. There has been progress across a wide range of these. For example, we launched pilots for the first national bowel cancer symptom awareness campaign on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-31">31 January 2011</phrase> and have also funded a range of local activity to encourage earlier presentation with symptoms which could be cancer. Subject to evaluation and the lessons learned, the bowel cancer campaign will be rolled out nationwide.</p>

A review of cancer waiting times standards undertaken as part of the development of &#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January</phrase>, determined that this standard is beneficial for patients and that it should be maintained.</p>

Statistics for the most recent period available (Quarter 4 2010-11) show that 87.3% of patients began cancer treatment within 62 days of urgent referral for suspected cancer.

	<p pid="b.755W.0/1">&#8216;The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011-12&#8217; states that commissioners should work with their local services and national health service cancer screening programmes to implement human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as triage for women with mild or borderline screening test results, leading to a more patient centred service and major cost savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.0/2">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes held a workshop with front-line cervical screening staff in March 2011 to develop recommendations on how this will be achieved. Advice to the service, including implementation guidance, will be issued later in the summer. The intention is that, subject to meeting certain criteria, local cervical screening programmes will implement HPV triage in 2011-12 and HPV test of cure in 2012-13. Implementing both improvements in the same year would risk the quality and safety of the current programme, and put an unnecessary burden on colposcopy services.</p>

Further information on these proportions can be found at www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf The application of the NWPHO methodology was updated in summer 2010 and is now available directly from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). As such, information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data. <sup>(2)</sup> Finished admission episodes (FAEs): FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. It should be noted that the figures provided for eligible FAEs relate to English resident patients with a known sex and age only and not admissions in England of individuals who reside in other parts of the United Kingdom or foreign nationals. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients. <i>Note</i>: Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i>Source</i>: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.759W.8/1">Patients not detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 are free to discharge themselves from hospital at any time. Where it is considered that a patient may be a danger to themselves if they were to leave, there is provision under the Act for that patient to remain in hospital under holding powers. One power may be exercised by the doctor (or nominated deputy) or approved clinician in charge of the patient's treatment and can remain in force for up to 72 hours. In addition, in the absence of the doctor or the approved clinician, certain nurses may authorise detention for up to six hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.8/2">National health service staff also have to consider the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act, which provide a framework for decision making for people who lack capacity to make their own decisions. This requires best interests decisions to be made and the deprivation of liberty safeguards to be applied if a deprivation of liberty is being considered.</p>

The campaign included a tour of shopping centres in areas with a high concentration of Black and Asian communities, visits to Hindu, Sikh and Muslim faith organisations and places of worship, advertising on Black and Asian television channels, radio stations and newspapers, a social media campaign and a poster display in community shops and outlets.</p>

The prompted choice approach requires people applying for a driving licence online to make a choice about organ donation.

	<p pid="b.762W.5/1">Death is confirmed by a doctor or doctors who are entirely independent of the transplant team. Death is confirmed in exactly the same way for people who donate organs as for those who do not. Donation will only proceed with valid consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.5/2">Most organ donors are patients who have died as a result of a brain haemorrhage, severe head injury, or stroke and who are on a ventilator in a hospital intensive care unit. In these circumstances, death is diagnosed by brain stem tests. There are very clear and strict standards and procedures for doing these tests and they are always performed by two experienced doctors.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.5/3">The ventilator provides oxygen which keeps the heart beating and blood circulating after death. Donation following the irreversible cessation of brain-stem function is called Donation after Brain Death or DBD.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.5/4">Patients who die in hospital but are not on a ventilator can, in some circumstances, also donate. This is called Donation after Cardiac or Circulatory Death or DCD.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.5/5">&#8220;A Code of Practice for the Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death 2008&#8221; is available on the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges website:</p>

	<p pid="b.763W.2/2">It has been estimated that the impact of increasing the number of organs available by 50% for transplant by 2013 would increase the savings to the national health service by an additional &#163;200 million a year.

The benefits of flood defence projects tend to be in terms of avoided losses, land and property values, and insurability against flood damages. We do not therefore anticipate that the GIB will be making any such investments.</p>

Support under the new loans package will not be means-tested, and can be accessed by eligible students studying at an intensity rate of at least 25% of the full-time equivalent course (FTE) each year (currently grants are available only to students studying at 50% FTE).
