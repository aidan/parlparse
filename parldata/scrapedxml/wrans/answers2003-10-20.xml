Our immediate priority was to tackle pensioner poverty and we have, through the Pension Credit, both increased the amount individuals receive and also rewarded those who have saved. Through our Green Paper and Action on Occupational Pensions proposals we have sought to increase security, promote flexibility of provision and reinvigorate the pensions partnership. We want to give individuals real choices about the savings decisions they take through the provision of the right information and the right products&mdash;this we are doing through our informed choice programme and proposed suite of stakeholder products, as proposed in the Sandler review. The Government's overall objective is to promote secure and sustainable pensions provision for individuals.</p>

	<p pid=".359W.6/1">I have asked the acting Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, to write to my hon. Friend on these matters.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Keith Miller to Helen Jones dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-20">20 October 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".359W.6/3" class="indent">Tony McNulty has asked Stephen Hickey, Acting Chief Executive of the Highways Agency to reply to your two recent Parliamentary Questions about traffic congestion in North Warrington, arising from ongoing works to the M6 Motorway Thelwall Viaduct, and the expected timescale for completion of those works. Stephen is currently away on official business and I am writing on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.6/4" class="indent">The Highways Agency is responsible for the operation, management, maintenance, and improvement, of the trunk road and motorway network in England, including the M6 Thelwall Viaduct. As you may be aware, the Agency's ongoing works are to replace 140 support bearings, following the discovery, during a routine inspection in July 2002, of a single failed support bearing on the viaduct carrying northbound traffic. All but one lane of that particular viaduct was then closed, and traffic is now carried on this single lane allowing access to Warrington at Junction 21, and on six reduced-width lanes on the viaduct carrying southbound traffic (three lanes in each direction) in contraflow, with a 40mph speed limit. Detailed investigations were urgently carried out and these revealed other failures in the bridge support bearings.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.6/5" class="indent">The Agency is conscious that traffic is diverting onto the local road network, including the Winwick area, as a result of the ongoing works and is working closely with Warrington Borough Council on this issue. Data is being collected by both the Council and the Agency to assess the impact of the traffic diversions.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.6/6" class="indent">Our aim is to re-open the northbound viaduct as soon as is practicable, and expect to complete the repair works by Spring 2005. However, we are in discussions with the Contractor to identify whether an earlier completion date for the works is possible.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.6/7" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. If you would like any further information on this matter, please contact the Agency's Project Manager for the viaduct repairs, David Brindle, Room 803, Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4BE telephone 0161 930 5653.</p>

	<p pid=".361W.11/1">World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements include a large number of special and differential treatment provisions (some 155 in all). However, there is dissatisfaction with the existing system of differential treatment by both developed and developing countries alike. A total of 88 proposals have been submitted to amend and modify the existing provisions and to provide for new concessions. The UK has worked hard with the European Commission, and others to assess and meet the concerns of developing countries. Accordingly the WTO membership has now agreed to 25 of these agreement-specific proposals. However, central to the issue concerning special and differential treatment is how to take account of country differences (e.g. Singapore to Ghana) within WTO agreements. Developing countries are reluctant to address the issue of country classification now and only within the wider context of future negotiations. DFID is working with others on possible options to provide an effective delivery mechanism for special and differential treatment.</p>

In considering support for fossil fuel based investments, it is standard procedure for DFID to liase with other relevant Government Departments to ensure balance and consistency between these objectives. In addition, our policy is to ensure that lending institutions take account of possible social and environmental impacts such as climate change as part of their policies and procedures in assessing fossil fuel projects, before providing loans or loan guarantees. I refer the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green to the reply to his question Hansard ref 132501 on this matter, at column 359W.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.5/2">The UK Energy White Paper sets out four core objectives of UK Energy Policy: Tackling Climate Change, Energy Security, Cutting Fuel Poverty and Competitiveness. DFID is working closely with other Government Departments, notably FCO, DTI and DEFRA, to ensure a co-ordinated Whitehall approach to international energy issues.</p>

	<p pid=".364W.8/1">The ability to assess the domestic economic and social impact of commitments taken under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is of vital importance to developing countries. Meaningful assessments will help ensure that the commitments they take on are in line with, and contribute to, wider economic growth and poverty reduction policies.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.8/2">It is important that such assessments are conducted by developing countries themselves in the process on making their own decisions during the GATS negotiations. We do however recognise the serious capacity constraints faced by many developing countries. We are therefore working closely with the World bank and UNCTAD to build a framework for supporting developing country efforts to carry out their own impact assessment work.</p>

Because of well-founded concerns over security and smuggling, the Kuwaiti authorities check carefully both people and goods crossing the border.

	<p pid=".367W.5/1">UK policy is to assess proposed EBRD and IFC projects against the mandates, policies and procedures of those institutions. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (&quot;the Guidelines&quot;) are recommendations addressed by adhering countries to multi-national enterprises (&quot;MNE's&quot;). They represent a framework of principles of good conduct for multi-national companies in their business activities, designed to help ensure that they act in harmony with the policies of the countries in which they operate and that they consider the views of other stakeholders (for example in respect of social and environmental issues). The Guidelines aim to promote and develop a sustainable approach to business conduct and to build an atmosphere of confidence and predictability between business, labour, governments and society as a whole. It is intended that companies use the Guidelines as a benchmark when developing their own codes of conduct. The Government takes complaints under the guidelines very seriously and has an established mechanism for dealing with complaints through the National Contact Point in DTI. This mechanism applies equally to projects for which financing by a multilateral financial institution is being considered.</p>

	<p pid=".370W.2/1">The Zimbabwe Emergency Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment released in April made a provisional estimate of 5.5 million people needing food aid by the first quarter of 2004. This figure might rise, since, with inflation now almost 500 per cent., many more people, particularly in cities and towns, cannot afford food even where it is available. The Government of Zimbabwe lacks the foreign exchange to import grains and continues to restrict the role of the private sector in importing and distributing food. The number of people needing feeding in urban areas is being assessed this month.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.2/2">To date, less than 40 per cent. of the funding required for the current World Food Programme's Emergency Operation has been pledged by donors. Food aid supplies are therefore secure only through December. An interruption in food supplies, combined with the high level of HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, would obviously risk a significant increase in mortality rates. We are working closely with other members of the international community to update the overall estimates of humanitarian need. We will continue to monitor the position closely and encourage further contributions as necessary. This week we announced an additional contribution of &pound;5 million to the WFP Emergency Operation. This is in addition to some &pound;11 million of new commitments we have already made this year through NGO partners for food aid and agricultural recovery, and some &pound;2 million granted to UNICEF for vaccines to immunise against childhood diseases.</p>

	<p pid=".373W.12/1">The armed forces have a long standing tradition of including the families of all personnel in the overall welfare process which is an essential component in the maintenance of morale and operational effectiveness. A comprehensive audit of procedures within initial training establishments undertaken during 2002 nevertheless confirmed the need for units to sustain links with parents and for individuals to have regular access to external communications which is seen as significant in maintaining morale. Personnel staffs in each of the Services have identified best practices to be adopted. These include better access to mobile phones, the provision of internet cafes and plans to hard-wire internet infrastructure into barrack blocks, all with the aim of improving the ability of personnel of all ages to maintain contact with their families. The parents of personnel under the age of 18 are written to, with background details of the training unit and the regime involved. In addition, some units are encouraging 'parent days' at which parents and families are able to visit their sons and daughters and discuss issues with appropriate staffs and unit personnel.</p>

Mr. Denktash's latest statements, however, suggest that he is opposed not only to the Annan Plan but also to the UNSG's Good Offices. We hope the Turkish side will find a way out of this rejectionist stance, in time to enable all Cypriots and Turkey itself to reap the benefits.</p>

For the first time in 13 years the economy achieved positive growth levels in 2002. The situation should improve further, with the decision on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-23">23 July</phrase> by the international financial institutions to reduce the DRC's total external debt by around 80 per cent.&mdash;some US$10 billion in monetary terms.</p>

	<p pid=".389W.8/2">The UK is at the forefront of international efforts to curb the problem of small arms proliferation and the damage they cause. The UK fully supports the UN Programme of Action on SALW and the OSCE document on SALW which commit states to dispose, preferably by destruction, of small arms stocks that are surplus to national requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".389W.8/3">The UK strategy on small arms and light weapons is supported by the &pound;20 million (2001&ndash;04) SALW Global Conflict Prevention Pool jointly funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence. The UK has given the United Nations Development Programme &pound;7.5 million over three years to help fund a global programme of weapons collection, stockpile management, capacity building and destruction. In addition, the FCO has also directly funded SALW destruction projects in five developing countries including part funding for an EU SALW project in Cambodia.</p>
	<p pid=".389W.8/4">The Government spends approximately &pound;15 million per year on humanitarian mine programmes. The Department for International Development is currently funding mine action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Cambodia, Angola and Georgia. We also actively work towards the destruction of anti-personnel landmines by encouraging states which have not become party to the Ottawa Convention to ratify or accede at the earliest opportunity. Once party to the Convention, states are legally obliged to destroy stockpiled anti-personnel landmines and to clear mine-affected areas within a given timeframe.</p>

	<p pid=".390W.5/1">The bilateral agreements on trade provide an effective framework for trade between the EU and Switzerland. Switzerland is the EU's most important trading partner after the United States. In 2002 Switzerland was Britain's fourth biggest market for goods outside the EU with exports valued at &pound;3.3 billion. The UK is Switzerland's fifth biggest export market, valued at &pound;4.9 billion in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.5/2">The 1999 Agreement relating to free movement of workers between the EU and Switzerland allows member states and Switzerland to maintain quotas on granting residence to Swiss or EU workers respectively for a transition period up to 2014. The Agreement has been operating smoothly. The UK, like many member states, has chosen not to maintain such quotas, in the interests of reaping the full economic benefits of free movement of labour. Negotiations are now underway to amend this Agreement to take account of EU Enlargement.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.5/3">The Commission is directly responsible for monitoring the bilateral Agreements and does so through a framework of Joint Committees that meet at least once a month. The Government follows this process and can raise any relevant issues in Council Working Groups in Brussels.</p>

If assembly centres, staging points or slaughterhouses are included in the planned journey, staff check that these are EU approved premises.

	<p pid=".401W.8/2">The role of the Food Standard Agency (FSA) regarding importation of agricultural produce includes ensuring necessary action is taken to protect public health where the use of illegal pesticides or veterinary medicines is detected. The FSA receives information on these from the European Commission and from surveillance carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The FSA can also carry out its own surveillance where there are concerns for public health. The FSA and local authorities have regulatory powers to prevent food that poses a threat to human health from entering the food chain or to withdraw it from sale.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.8/3">All food products of animal origin being imported to the United Kingdom from non-European Union countries are subject to documentary and identity checks at designated border inspection posts by an official veterinary surgeon. A percentage of consignments are subjected to a physical check, which may include laboratory tests for residues from illegal chemicals. These controls have been enhanced on certain produce from countries with known chemical residue problems. Products of non-animal origin are subject to routine inspection at ports of entry and may be examined, sampled and detained.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.8/4">Products of animal origin from other EU member states must have been produced in accordance with harmonised EU rules for hygienic production. Such products are in free circulation in the EU as part of the EU single market, but are subject to inspection inland as part of routine enforcement and surveillance activities.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.8/5">Given recent concerns over import controls, the FSA is taking forward a range of measures to improve the co-ordination and delivery of local authority inspection of imported foodstuffs and products of animal origin at ports and inland.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.3/2">Responsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters and the broadcasting regulatory bodies&mdash;the Governors of the BBC, the Independent Television Commission, the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority and the Radio Authority. The regulators' codes of practice place a requirement on broadcasters to treat controversial subjects with due accuracy and impartiality, both in news services and in the more general field of programmes dealing with matters of current public policy or industrial controversy. It is for the regulatory bodies, not Government, to decide whether any particular broadcaster is or is not complying with its obligations regarding impartiality.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.3/3">Under the Communications Act 2003 the Office of Communications (Ofcom) will have similar responsibilities for maintaining impartiality from the end of this year.

This will enable them to be combined with the European Parliamentary elections and provide convenience to electors, enabling them to participate in all the elections at the same time rather than voting twice in a short period of time. As a consequence of combining these elections, the term of office for those sitting councillors in England affected will be extended by five weeks with that for councillors elected on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-10">10 June 2004</phrase> being reduced by five weeks. The Government will shortly be consulting key stakeholders on draft legislation which facilitates these intentions. More generally there are no plans at present to bring forward legislation to extend the tenure of Councillors but the Terms of Reference of the current review of electoral cycles in local government, being undertaken by the Electoral Commission, includes identifying options for change which may include, if appropriate, options involving changes to councillor's terms of office</p>

Approximately 50,000 additional applications were received above the Bureau's normal intake at that time of about 43,000 applications per week.

	<p pid=".412W.5/2">At present, all applicants for licences as taxi and private hire vehicle drivers are eligible for a Standard Disclosure. Some&mdash;principally those whose duties regularly involve being in sole charge of unaccompanied children (for example, under a school contract) or vulnerable adults&mdash;are eligible for an Enhanced Disclosure. Earlier this year, as part of a wider consultation exercise about recommendations of the Independent Review Team appointed by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to look at the operation of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), we sought views on a proposition that the criteria for levels of Disclosure should be set by Ministers, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, on the basis of risk assessment and that it would then be the function of the CRB to ensure that the criteria were observed. An analysis of the responses received was placed in the Library on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-05">5 June</phrase>. We have since received a number of representations on this matter, instigated by the National Association of Taxi and Private Hire Licensing and Enforcement Officers. These argue that licensing authorities should determine the level of Disclosure required. This view will be taken into account in arriving at a conclusion on the matter.</p>

	<p pid=".414W.0/1">The Government set out its position on these issues in its response, published in April this year, to the Fourth Report of the Home Affairs Committee (Session 2001&ndash;02) &quot;The Conduct of Investigations into Past Cases of Abuse in Children's Homes&quot;:</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;55. The Committee's recommendation [that the law of similar fact evidence is reformed to require a &quot;striking similarity&quot; in historical child abuse cases] would return the law on similar fact evidence (for these cases) to the position that applied following the case of Boardman in 1975. However, the test for admitting such evidence has developed since then to recognise that its value is not limited to cases of &quot;striking similarity&quot;. For example, multiple accusations against an offender have a significance that derives from the unlikelihood that a person will be independently falsely accused of offences of a like nature, whether or not there is a particular degree of similarity. Whilst such accusations do not establish that an incident is true, and issues of collusion need to be considered carefully (as they would if the threshold were &quot;strikingly similar&quot;), such evidence is certainly relevant to assessing the cogency of a witness's account. Evidence of other incidents might also be relevant when considering an innocent explanation put forward by the defendant&mdash;what might credibly be explained as a mistake on one occasion becomes much less so in respect of repeated incidents. Here, too, the relevance of the other allegations does not depend on establishing a particular level of similarity between the events.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/3" class="indent">56. The Government is therefore concerned that reverting to the &quot;strikingly similar&quot; test would risk denying juries and magistrates a range of potentially highly relevant evidence. Our approach, as embodied in our proposals for reforming the law on evidence of bad character in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament, is to enable juries and magistrates to hear the widest range of relevant evidence that will assist them to reach a fair verdict. The admissibility of bad character evidence should therefore depend on its relevance to the issues in the case, rather than on a particular degree of similarity.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/4" class="indent">57. We are not, however, complacent that dangers cannot arise where evidence is admitted in these circumstances. However, there are safeguards to ensure that trials are fair. For example, in determining whether to admit the evidence, the courts must consider whether it would be more prejudicial than probative. The judge will therefore be able to direct that the charges be considered evidentially separate if necessary. And where this might not be sufficient to secure a fair trial, the judge can order that the various charges are tried separately, ensuring that the jury in each case is not aware of the evidence in the others. The Criminal Justice Bill also proposes that judges should be under a duty to withdraw a case from the jury where it becomes clear that seemingly independent allegations are in fact the result of collusion or other distortion and a conviction would be unsafe.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.0/5" class="indent">58. The Committee also recommends a presumption in favour of ordering separate trials where allegations cannot be heard as evidence in support of each other on a similar fact basis. In their judgement in the case of Christou (1997), dealing with the severance of charges for sexual offences, the House of Lords held that a trial judge should exercise his discretion to sever to achieve a fair resolution of the issues. This is buttressed by the Human Rights Act 1998, which makes it clear that the courts must act in a way that is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights including ensuring a fair trial. Given the centrality of fairness to the issue of severance, it is not clear what the proposed presumption would substantively add. The Committee is concerned that &quot;sexual offences tend to engender greater prejudice than non-sexual offences&quot; (paragraph 96). However, we do not agree that this warrants a special rule to deal with historic child abuse cases: the issue of prejudice will clearly be an important aspect of deciding whether severance is required and to the extent that there is a greater risk of prejudice in any particular case, whether of historic child abuse or any other, the argument in favour of severance will clearly be stronger.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".417W.2/1">When the drug Gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB), commonly used in drug rape, was outlawed by the Government in July 2003, we ensured that this was accompanied by high media coverage.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/2">In addition, the Eastern Government Office Drug Team recently supported production of a new drug rape awareness video called Spiked! The Production of the video was funded through Drugscope's Millennium Awards scheme. The video was launched at the end of September and will be shown in public and university cinemas until November in Eastern Region cinema during screenings of newly released films. These showings are supported by the Regional Screen Agency for the East of England. The stylish but hard-hitting infomercial aims to increase awareness of the dangers of drug rape and make people aware of how they can protect themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/3">Finally the Government's new drug awareness campaign, FRANK also supplies information about date rape. The FRANK website <a href="http://www.talktofrank.com">www.talktofrank.com</a> pays particular attention to GHB. It warns the reader that GHB has been linked to rape cases. It states '. . . because it's almost tasteless it's easily slipped in a drink'.</p>

	<p pid=".419W.0/1">The Prison Service Security Manual gives instruction to all prisons on how to strip search prisoners in line with Prison Rule 41 and Young Offender Institution Rule 43. The frequency with which this is carried out is generally decided by the prison governor and the area manager, except for certain activities where there is mandatory routine strip searching, such as reception.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/2">There is no equivalent central guidance issued by local authority secure children's homes. Each home operates its own policy according to their security needs. Some homes do not strip search any young persons in their care, while others may strip search all new arrivals. Strip searching may also be carried out where there is suspicion that illicit items are being concealed, sometimes with the assistance of the police. The methods used to perform a strip search are also decided by each centre without central guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/3">The Secure Training Centre (STC) Rules 1998 and the Operational Procedures of the companies that run the three STCs provide guidance that must be followed by staff involved in strip searching. These techniques are similar to those used by the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/4">The current Prison Service Policy on strip searching in the Security Manual (Prison Service Order 1000) applies to all categories and types of prisoner. This includes instructions on techniques and frequency of strip searching.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/5">The Prison Service recognises the sensitivities around the strip searching of young prisoners, and separate guidance has recently been issued to Governors of prisons holding juvenile prisoners emphasising the need for staff to be aware of specific child protection issues.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/6">Training modules for new entrant officers also include specific advice for staff involved in conducting strip searches of young prisoners. Officers conducting strip searches are expected to be aware of the ways in which searches, and the way they are conducted, may affect young people.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/7">Young Offender Rules and the Prison Service Security Manual allow force to be used where a young person refuses to comply with a lawful order to submit to a strip search. No more force than is necessary will be used and it will be used only as a last resort.</p>

No retired officers have been refused permission to use police leisure facilities and it remains the Chief Constable's policy to encourage retired officers to avail of the health and fitness facilities available.</p>

The fund was established to provide one-off pump priming support to aid the creation of new, or extended, in-service training and development opportunities for teachers and other staff, both in mainstream and special schools. The aim was to help improve and reinforce skills in the area of SEN and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.6/2">This particular project is being delivered by the Institute of Education at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU), working in collaboration with the British Dyslexia Association. It involves a validated module, targeted at new or recently qualified teachers and learning support assistants, and includes the creation of course materials and video case studies of successful practice in schools and classes. This material has now been completed and is in the process of being edited and transferred to a DVD format for the classroom and a CD-ROM covering the teaching methods and philosophies of the teachers involved. It is proposed that the material will be available via the MMU website.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.8/1">The Government recognises that making child care affordable is a key challenge for the National Childcare Strategy and has made a substantial investment to achieve this. We have funded a substantial expansion in child care provision in the public, private and voluntary sectors, with a wide variety of types of child care&mdash;nurseries, child minders, before and after school provision and increasingly delivered alongside early education and other family services&mdash;to ensure diversity and choice for parents and to provide better services for children.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.8/2">Working parents, subject to the level of their income, may receive support through the child care element of the Working Tax Credit (WTC). Tax credits are rightly targeted at lower and middle income families who may use a range of registered or approved child care. The child care element of the Working Tax Credit provides for up to 70 per cent. of costs of eligible child care. It can pay up to &pound;94.50 a week for one child (where the childcare cost is &pound;135), and up to &pound;140 a week for two or more children (where the cost is &pound;200).</p>
	<p pid=".432W.8/3">No Government has provided the kind of direct support for the costs of child care that is delivered by the child care element of the Working Tax Credit. Over &pound;650 million a year is now spent on supporting parents with child care costs.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.8/4">Families are further supported through early education places, which can be used to off-set the cost of child care. As a result of our policies, all four year olds are able to access a free, good quality, part-time early education place. From April 2004, six months ahead of the original target, this will be extended to all three year olds. Currently 88 per cent. of three year olds are able to benefit from some level of free provision.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.8/5">Support is also available through various grants and access funds for parents studying further and higher education, for participants on the New Deals and those receiving Job Seekers' allowance.</p>

	<p pid=".440W.6/1">Pay, contractual arrangements and job descriptions are matters for local determination: the Government believe that this is the best way of ensuring a flexible system that can respond to local needs and circumstances. Many local authorities, including Leicestershire, have reviewed support staff pay and undertaken job evaluations in the light of the agreement&mdash;commonly known as the Single Status Agreement&mdash;made in 1997 by the National Joint Council for Local Government Services. I understand that that National Joint Council is in the process of issuing guidance about the grading of school support staff.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.6/2">The Standards Fund for 2003&ndash;04 contains a grant of &pound;37.45 million for the training and development of support staff and Leicestershire's share of this is &pound;424,542. Responsibility for deciding how to devolve the funding to schools rests with LEAs. The grant can be used for those participating in induction training programme for teaching assistants, developed by my Department, as well as for the professional development of more experienced teaching assistants including course fees for training leading to National Vocational Qualifications. Schools have always been able to use their own budgets to fund teaching assistant training and to 'buy in' or pay for any training available locally.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.6/3">The National Agreement on raising standards and tackling workload signed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-15">15 January 2003</phrase> by the Government, local authority employers and school work force unions will improve training and career progression opportunities for support staff and makes clear that we expect their pay to reflect their level of training, skills and responsibilities. Following the Agreement, the Teacher Training Agency has published standards for Higher Level Teaching Assistants and training and assessment for these standards will be rolled out from April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".441W.2/1">We do not expect that any tuition fees will be paid to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in advance of the academic year for which they are charged. From 2006, students will decide whether they will defer payment until after they graduate, or whether to pay their tuition fees up front. Where a student chooses to defer payment, the Government will pay the tuition fee to the HEI during the academic year for which it is charged. The details of the arrangements for the timing of the payment or payments during the academic year have yet to be finalised.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.5/1">The government's Sector Advisory Panel for IT meets regularly to assess the system for issuing work permits. The composition of the panel is broad and includes members from representative organisations and contractor groups. This panel advises in the UK's national interest and ensures that we strike the right balance between enabling employers to move skilled staff from within their companies while protecting job opportunities for resident workers. This policy is kept under regular review.</p>

	<p pid=".447W.8/1">There are 19 interruptible Combined Cycle Gas Turbine stations (CCGTs) in England and Wales. Transco has rights of interruption over all of these CCGTs. The shippers' contractual arrangements are not fully known, but it is thought that in the great majority of cases, they do have interruption rights. Even if they do not, the stations may still be self-interrupted in order to arbitrage between the gas and electricity markets. One of these CCGTs is a Network Sensitive Load, which means that its position within one of the Transco Networks makes it more likely to be interrupted for reasons of local capacity constraints. Another CCGT is in a network sensitive position from an electricity perspective. Based on National Grid Transco's latest information and experience of this station switching fuels when interrupted in the past, there is a high degree of confidence in the station's alternative fuel capability.</p>

	<p pid=".453W.2/1">It is not clear exactly what causes breast cancer, but it is thought that there are many risk factors, some already well established and some still being investigated. The main risk factors are being female and increasing age. The majority of other risk factors are linked to lifestyle. Key prevention measures include improving dietary intake, including increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, increasing physical activity and staying at a healthy weight.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/2">About five per cent. of all breast cancer cases (fewer than 2,000 per year) may be caused by breast cancer genes. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is developing a clinical guideline on the classification and care of women at risk of familial breast cancer in primary, secondary care and tertiary care. The guideline is expected to be published in February 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/3">The Government's White Paper, &quot;Our Inheritance, Our Future&mdash;Realising the Potential of Genetics in the NHS&quot;, was published in June 2003. The Department has collaborated with Macmillan Cancer Relief to develop a model approach to genetic cancer services for people at risk of, or concerned about, familial cancer. The model is patient-centred, describing a continuum of advice and care involving primary care, local cancer services and specialised genetic and cancer services. A tendering exercise has begun to pilot all or certain aspects of the model. It is envisaged that there will be six evaluated pilot sites in England to inform the future development of cancer genetic services, as envisaged in the National Health Service Cancer Plan. Bids for pilot project funding must be submitted by <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-31">31 October 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/4">Women should be breast aware at all times. The Government promote the overriding importance of teaching women to be breast aware, knowing that 90 per cent. of breast cancers will be found by women themselves. The breast awareness five point code is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/5" class="indent">know what is normal for you;</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/6" class="indent">look and feel;</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/7" class="indent">know what changes to look for;</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/8" class="indent">report any changes without delay; and</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/9" class="indent">attend for breast screening if aged 50 or over.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/10">The Department, together with Cancer Research UK, produces a leaflet entitled &quot;Be Breast Aware&quot;. The leaflet is widely available from general practitioner's surgeries and breast screening units. 1.5 million copies were printed in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/11">Officials from the Department have had discussions with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs regarding possible links between environmental chemicals, in particular, organochlorine pesticides, and breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/12">In 1999, the independent Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) considered this issue and concluded that lindane and other organochlorine pesticides were not a significant risk factor in breast cancer. The remit of the COC is to advise Government Departments on all aspects of the carcinogenicity of chemicals. The COC is currently reviewing new data on this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/13">The COC has also considered the possible association between alcoholic beverages and breast cancer. A statement was issued in 1995, indicating that there was not enough evidence to conclude that the ingestion of alcoholic beverages was a cause of breast cancer. The COC is reviewing new data on this issue with a view to updating its statement next year.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.2/14">There have been allegations of an association between environmental radiation and breast cancer and these are being considered by the independent Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment. The remit of this Committee is to advise Government Departments on the health effects of environmental exposure to radiation.</p>

	<p pid=".456W.0/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, all new staff in care homes have been required to obtain a satisfactory Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check as part of their pre-employment checks. The impact of this requirement was assessed as part of a Regulatory Impact Assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/2">However, in the light of the initial difficulties experienced by the CRB in dealing with the level of demand for checks, in June 2003 the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) issued interim guidance on how to deal with recruitment of care home staff, while steps were taken to improve the CRB's performance. The intention of the guidance was to enable care homes to recruit staff while ensuring residents were protected.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/3">Following significant improvements made at the CRB, the NCSC rightly decided to look again at its guidance. Where CRB clearances are not in place, the NCSC will continue to apply its discretion on the use of its enforcement powers on a case by case basis, where this is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/4">The Department has not made an assessment of the effectiveness of the NCSCs interim guidance. However, we are aware that provider organisations welcomed the guidance and their recent concerns were not with its operation, but its withdrawal.</p>

	<p pid=".461W.2/1">The table shows the number of national health service sight tests paid for in Calderdale and Kirklees Health Authority (HA) for 1997&ndash;98 to 2002&ndash;03. Figures for the number of sight tests by constituency or age are not collected centrally. The table shows the number of sight tests where &quot;patient aged 60 and over&quot; was given as the eligibility category and all other sight tests.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.2/2">Eligibility to NHS sight tests was extended to those aged 60 and over from <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase>. There was an increase of 2.4 million sight tests between 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000 in England. It is fair to assume that the vast majority of this increase was due to newly eligible people aged 60 or over obtaining NHS sight tests.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.2/3">However, some patients aged 60 and over will be eligible for sight tests for other reasons as well (for example, on income grounds). The classification for such patients will depend on the patient and the practitioner. The increase in the number of sight tests for those over 60 may therefore reflect an increasing awareness of the eligibility of over 60s.</p>

	<p pid=".470W.2/1">Good Practice in Continence Services was issued by the Department in April 2000 and provides guidance to primary care trusts (PCTs) on continence services. This includes that PCTs should have specialist continence services in place, which provide patients with an individual assessment of their needs. Provision of these services in England is a matter for PCTs, which are responsible for determining the level of services required to meet the needs of their local populations.</p>

The NSF will emphasise the promotion of evidence-based clinical guidelines and a number of examples of good practice in a range of different areas.</p>

	<p pid=".473W.0/1">The Department does not collect data on stroke physicians; a number of specialties are linked with the treatment of patients with strokes. The main specialties are geriatric medicine, neurology and rehabilitation medicine but it is not possible to say how many of the physicians within these specialties specialise in the treatment of strokes.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.0/2">The table shows the number of hospital medical staff in geriatric medicine, neurology and rehabilitation medicine from 1998 to 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.0/3">Between September 1997 and June 2003, total consultant numbers in geriatric medicine, neurology and rehabilitation medicine increased by 380 (37 per cent.).</p>
