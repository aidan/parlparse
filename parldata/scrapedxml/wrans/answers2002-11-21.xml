	<p pid=".210W.3/1">We believe the L21A1 baton round, fired from the LI04 gun and using the LI 8 optical sight to have state of the art accuracy over its designed range. Such accuracy is critical in reducing the risk of serious injury. The L18A1 optical sight met the accuracy requirement for the baton round and is an intuitive sight to use. It is not possible to cost a laser sight for L21 without examining all the issues of the visibility of a laser spot when viewed through a visor at relevant ranges, against representative targets and in varying lighting conditions. Laser sights can cost between #50 and #1,000 dependent on specification.</p>

	<p pid=".211W.0/1">Personnel undergo a three-day urban operations package as part of their operational training for use of the baton gun for situations other than public disorder. The circumstances under which members of the Armed Forces may discharge baton rounds at a human target, are set out in the guidance on the Rules of Engagement for the use of baton rounds, which has been previously placed in the Library of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-23">23 October</phrase> <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-10-23.351"><i>Official Report</i>, column 351W</phrase>. The tactical use of a baton gun is controlled by either an officer or non-commisioned officer, although ultimate authority is vested in the individual baton gunner who is authorised to use the weapon as and when deemed necessary. If a baton round is fired, a baton log report, giving details of the incident, is completed and forwarded through the chain of command.</p>

	<p pid=".212W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-19">19 November 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".212W.9/2">The number of personnel that were sent the last Continuous Attitude Survey (CAS) for each Service is as follows: Naval Service 2,000; Army 4,006 and RAF 2,000. The proportion of personnel this represented for each Service was 5.3 per cent., 3.9 per cent. and 4.1 per cent. respectively, based on Trained Strength figures for United Kingdom regulars as at <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-01">1 September 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.9/3">In the Naval Service the distribution of the CAS is now carried out through the chain of command rather than directly to the individuals and personnel are encouraged to answer by the offer of participation in a prize draw. The sample groups are entirely random and the sample is sufficient to produce statistically significant results across all ranks.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.9/4">In the Army the Adjutant General writes a personal letter to all unit Commanding Officers asking them to encourage individuals to respond to the survey. The selection criterion works on a rolling basis using the last two digits of Service numbers. The overall population of respondents is large enough to have statistical confidence that the results can be extrapolated against the wider military population.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.9/5">For the Royal Air Force a letter from the Chief of Staff Air Member for Personnel accompanies each survey encouraging individuals to take part and emphasising the importance placed on the survey. The survey is a rank-stratified random sample. This means that while the number of personnel at each rank to whom the form is issued is determined in advance, taking into account previous response rates, the individuals who actually receive the form are chosen at random, using the last three digits of their Service number. This results in a total sample that is fairly representative of RAF personnel in rank, branch/trade, gender and ethnic group.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.9/6">The response rates as a percentage for each Service by rank are shown below:</p>

	<p pid=".218W.5/1">The Gurkha Welfare Trust (GWT) is a registered charity independent of the Ministry of Defence. It was established in 1969 to provide financial, medical and community aid to alleviate hardship and distress among Gurkhas and their families when they leave the British Army. The Department recognises the valuable work of the Trust and makes an annual grant in order to pay for the administrative costs of its field arm, the Gurkha Welfare Scheme (GWS). This year the Grant was #710,417. Our Defence Attache in Kathmandu heads the GWS. It spends over #6 million each year in Nepal and our contribution enables nearly all the money raised by the Trust through charitable donations and public appeals to be used for welfare purposes. This includes the payment of welfare pensions to Gurkhas who, in common with many other soldiers recruited to British colours for wartime service, were discharged before completing the requisite period of employment to qualify for a Service pension. The GWS provides, even in the most remote areas of Nepal, primary health care, first aid and emergency treatment, doctors' clinics and elementary dentistry, all free of charge. It is also involved in community projects and the award of one-off hardship payments in respect of individual catastrophes. No genuine case of hardship is ever turned away and its work not only benefits our ex-Servicemen, but is also of value to the infrastructure of Nepal as a whole.</p>

Individuals do not apply to take the L104A1 competency qualification, rather, assessments are made by commanders who then choose who should be trained as a baton gunner. To complete the L21 training course, a minimum of 20 rounds must be fired of which five rounds must be fired under test conditions achieving a grouping of 200mm. There is no score pass or percentage pass rate as such, as training is continued until the standard has been achieved.

	<p pid=".222W.8/1">Ministry of Defence's plans to withdraw from the Royal hospital Haslar site, following the 1998 decision, are tied to the Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust's development of its Queen Alexandra hospital site at Cosham. It would be premature for the MOD to enter into formal discussions with Gosport borough council until the timescale for the completion of that development is more definite, but informal discussions take place periodically with the Leader of the Council to apprise him of progress, and MOD officials met Council officers on one occasion in 1999 prior to a review of MOD estates in the Gosport and Portsmouth area and after the decision to close Haslar as a MOD site had been taken. At that stage, the local authority&mdash;which will ultimately be responsible for determining the future of the site&mdash; was reviewing its plans for the local area.</p>

The project had not secured full main gate approval by the time that the project was suspended on grounds of affordability at the time. The requirement, including the continuing need for a deployed inventory management capability, will be addressed as part of a wider end-to-end review of the logistic process, involving the DLO, front-line commands and industry which should complete by mid 2003. Expenditure on DSMS to date totals #140 million and estimated net savings of #650 million over a 10 year period were anticipated from its implementation.</p>

	<p pid=".225W.3/1">There are no formal definitions of affordable housing within housing policy. For the purposes of securing affordable housing through the planning system, affordable housing encompasses low-cost market and subsidised housing (irrespective of tenure, ownership&mdash;whether exclusive or shared&mdash;or financial arrangements) that will be available to people who cannot afford to rent or buy houses generally available on the open market. Local authorities are expected to define through their local plans what they consider to be affordable in the plan area in terms of the relationship between local income levels and house prices or rents for different types of households.</p>
	<p pid=".225W.3/2">The research report, XDelivering Affordable Housing through Planning Policy&quot;, published by DTLR in February 2002, noted that local authorities were not consistent in defining affordable housing, with a tendency in the south to equate affordable housing with social rented housing, and not to consider the full range of alternatives. The report concluded that local authorities should ensure their consideration of affordable housing, including the wider definition given to it by national planning guidance. There are no plans to make the definition less flexible.</p>

	<p pid=".227W.6/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has one funding commitment which flows directly from the Urban White Paper and which meets both criteria of requiring bidding and of being linked to a set funding formula.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.6/2">The future rough sleeping strategy was included in the wider programme set out in XMore than a Roof&quot; (March 2002) with a total budget of #125 million in 2002&ndash;03. #10 million of this has been allocated to local authorities by &quot;formula&quot; and the rest is subject to a Xbidding&quot; process. Some goes direct to voluntary sector organisations funding existing or new services, agreed as part of a local strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.2/1">The BBC has statutory responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system and for determining the licensing requirements in specific circumstances. I cannot, therefore, comment in detail on how those requirements would apply in particular cases. However, the requirement to have a licence relates to the installation or use (actual or intended) of the apparatus in question and not simply its capability. A television licence is required for the installation or use of a television receiver. A television receiver is equipment installed or used for the purpose of receiving television programme services, as defined by section 2(4) of the Broadcasting Act 1990. A personal computer which is capable of receiving television programme services, and which is installed or used for such purposes, is therefore a television receiver, and its installation or use as such requires a television licence.</p>

	<p pid=".234W.3/1">a) Since the genocide and civil war in 1994, the Rwandan Government and people have been rebuilding their country and lives. The Government has embarked on a programme of recovery through national reconciliation and poverty reduction.

In the DRC the <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-30">30 July</phrase> Pretoria Agreement was a welcome development, resulting in the withdrawal of all Rwandan forces by <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-05">5 October</phrase>. The Government of DRC must now honour its Pretoria commitments to deal with the anti-Rwandan militia operating in DRC, and reach agreement with the rebel groups (MLC and RCD-Goma) on a transitional Government.talks resumed on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-15">15 November</phrase>. It is hoped this will end the conflict conclusively and result in the withdrawal of the remaining Zimbabwean and Uganda forces soon.</p>

Part of the adviser's role will be to represent the views of young people and to advocate on their behalf with the agencies whose services will be necessary to prepare them for adulthood.

The SDR was designed to deliver, after expenses, a target annual net income (TANI) for dental practitioners with an average commitment to the national health service.

	<p pid=".242W.8/1">The Food Standards Agency has undertaken two surveys investigating added water in poultry and poultry products. The survey reported in October 2000, in the Food Survey Information Sheet 8/00, focused on added water in whole chicken and chicken parts, including half, quarter, boneless and skinless breast, thigh, drumstick and wing, sold mainly in the retail sector. The second survey reported in December 2001, in the Food Survey Information Sheet 20/01, investigated added water, chicken content and hydrolysed protein in frozen chicken breast products supplied to the catering trade. Copies of the two survey information sheets have been place in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.8/2">The water content found in the poultry samples analysed in the two surveys is summarised in Tables 1 and 2.</p>

	<p pid=".249W.2/1">The international donor community has now disbursed $1.3 billion of the $1.8 billion pledge for 2002; of this, a total of $200 million has been paid into the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, which is used by the Afghanistan Transitional Administration to meet recurrent costs and finance the most pressing of reconstruction requirements. Recent payments into the fund mean that the ATA now faces a far smaller potential budget deficit this financial year than was originally feared but my Department is continuing to work closely with other donors to help ensure budget requirements are fully met. In addition, I recently approved a contribution of $20 million in support of Afghanistan's arrears clearance with the major international financial institutions, and am confident this will enable the Asia development bank and world bank to finance the implementation of substantial reconstruction initiatives in the near future.</p>

	<p pid=".250W.11/1">The Government are working to bring about increased supplies of essential medicines to developing countries, in a way which is sustainable and</p>
	<p pid=".250W.11/2">predictable and ensures they reach the poorest.</p>
	<p pid=".250W.11/3">The Government will shortly be launching the report of the UK's high level working group on access to medicines. The report is a result of a year's collaboration between representatives of UK industry, WHO, WTO, The European Commission, a developing country and international foundations. It outlines an approach intended to facilitate voluntary differential pricing of essential medicines for the poorest developing countries-and all of sub-Saharan Africa-as the international operational norm. The UK is committed to working with others to take the report's recommendations forward as a matter of urgency. The report complements ongoing work in the context the Doha Ministerial Declaration on TRIPS and public health, and it also emphasises the importance of sustainable financing and reliable health and supply systems. The UK has already pledged $200 million over five years to the Global Fund to Fight TB, AIDS and Malaria (GFATM), and has committed over #1 billion since 1997 to strengthen developing countries' health systems. The Government have also introduced tax incentives to encourage longer-term development of new medicines to treat AIDS, TB and malaria in developing countries.</p>

We are also legal advisers to the Government. There is a long-standing convention, followed by successive Governments and reflected in the Ministerial Code, that both the content of legal advice to the Government and the fact that it has been given remains confidential. Thirdly, the Attorney General has the power to apply, when he thinks it appropriate, to the High Court for an injunction to prevent breach of the criminal law, including offences under trade union legislation.

	<p pid=".257W.6/1">Under the legislation covering the private recruitment industry, employment agencies and employment businesses, who have placed job vacancy advertisements in either a newspaper or on the internet, before supplying or introducing a work-seeker to an employer, are required to make all such inquiries as are reasonably practicable to establish that the worker-seeker is suitable and has such qualifications as are required by law and that employment of that work-seeker by the employer would not breach any other duty or restriction imposed by law.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.6/2">It is in the best interests of all those involved in this sector to ensure that the legislation covering the private recruitment industry operates effectively and is relevant to the flexible labour market of today and of the future. On-line recruitment companies have proposed that the Employment Agency legislation should not apply to on-line job boards. I will consider the case for treating on-line job boards as a special case on its merits within the normal framework.</p>

The latter include reports commissioned by the Strategic Rail Authority and the Commission for Integrated Transport on the potential for rail-air substitution and the different environmental effects of journeys made using different modes on key inter-regional journeys within the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".260W.5/4">The Strategic Rail Authority is also conducting a study into a potential North-South high speed line which will consider its likely impact on other modes, including air.</p>
	<p pid=".260W.5/5">The service quality improvements resulting from use of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link are expected to result in some transfer of international air passengers to Eurostar. However, the forecast of Eurostar demand does not allow the transfer from international air services to be separately identified. The report of this research was not published because of the subject's commercially sensitive nature.</p>

It should, however, be noted that the majority of commuting by train is in London and the south east, where the majority of trains are electric and so have zero local emissions. The car and bus data refer to Euro III standards (ie current standards for new vehicles) at an urban speed. The car emissions are averages, weighted by the proportion of petrol and diesel cars in the fleet. A full environmental comparison would need to incorporate occupancy figures but comparative data per passenger km are not available.</p>

	<p pid=".265W.8/1">In December 1998 this Government's introduction of a tonnage based corporation tax for UK tax resident shipping companies requires applicant companies to satisfy a minimum training obligation and recruit and train one British Cadet for every 15 officers. We estimate the number of cadets undergoing training for the year, as of October 2002, to be in the order of 650. The total cumulative training commitment for the training year beginning October 2002 is 660. This is an encouraging and significant increase on previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".265W.8/3">The Government appreciates that the consequence of the tonnage tax has been an increased demand for cadets. We are therefore heartened and supportive of the industry led initiative to raise the profile of the maritime industry in the eyes of the general public. This major campaign, co-ordinated by the Chamber of Shipping, has the active support of over 70 maritime organisations including the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and goes under the title of XSea Vision UK&quot;. The campaign is gaining momentum and hopes to attract public attention at the London Boat Show in January 2003 and other events through the year.</p>

	<p pid=".271W.2/1">My Department does not provide specific funding for school transport. Responsibility for the provision of statutory home to school transport lies with the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid=".271W.2/2">However, as part of their Local Transport Plan strategies, whose objectives must include the improvement of safety, the promotion of accessibility and the protection of the environment, local authorities in England can propose strategies to provide support for and improve school transport provision. They may also take advantage of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding route. An example of the latter is Surrey County Council's (Pegasus) School Bus Scheme for which my Department announced 16 million in PFI credits, which will be paid through supporting special grant, in December 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".271W.2/3">Local authorities are able to fund bus services that would not otherwise be provided from their Revenue Support Grant; in some cases these will be on routes that serve schools. They may also bid for funding for innovative road passenger transport schemes, which may include school transport services, under the Rural and Urban Bus Challenge schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".274W.12/2">When setting the level of the national minimum wage the Government take account of the recommendations of the independent Low Pay Commission. The commission has recently consulted widely as part of the process of preparing its fourth report on the minimum wage and industry, trade unions and other interested parties will have made representations to them, although we have received copies of these from only a small number of respondents. The Government submitted their evidence to the commission earlier this month and a copy of this has been placed on my Department's website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk">www.dti.gov.uk</a>. We expect the commission to present the fourth report to the Government in February 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.6/1">Officials are currently finalising detailed plans in response to the Parliamentary Ombudsman's findings. However, we expect to be writing to around 500,000 individuals to offer further clarification of their SERPS position.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/2">The background to this is that the Pension Service has sent out 5.1 million letters to people who will reach state pension age between <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-06">6 October 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-20">5October 2010</phrase>. This letter informed them of the changes to the rules regarding the inheritance of SERPS announced to the House by my predecessor on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-29">29 November 2000</phrase> and subsequently approved by Parliament in March 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/3">This letter gave people the option of requesting a SERPS estimate, and by <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-16">16 November</phrase> some 1,248,104 estimates had been requested.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/4">This follow-up estimate letter was the subject of exhaustive drafting and an approval process that included the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) and outside bodies. One key complexity was around how to explain SERPS and its interaction with Contracted Out Deductions (COD).</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/5">However, it has come our attention that some people may have possibly misunderstood the estimate despite the caveat in the letter. This group may believe that they stand to receive their full SERPS without appreciating that if they have contracted out, their SERPS will be lower because of their occupational or private pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/6">We have therefore decided that officials should write again to all those people who have received an estimate letter and have some COD deductions except people who will reach pension age between now and <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-05">5 July 2003</phrase>-they will get pre-retirement pensions claim material including full personal details of their new final entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/7">In addition we will continue the provision of the very successful Contact Centre, incorporating a helpline which has already dealt with in excess of 270,000 phone calls and 1.5 million pieces of post.</p>

We are supporting the Department of Trade and Industry in establishing an independent group of experts to help develop guidance on how directors should assess whether an item is material to their company and would therefore have to be included in its OFR.

	<p pid=".282W.9/1">Bovine TB in cattle is one of the most difficult animal health problems being faced, and the increase in its incidence is continuing to give considerable concern. The Government are keen to tackle the problem and have implemented a wide-ranging strategy at a cost of #35 to #40 million a year. Action is centred around a five-point strategy as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/2" class="indent">protecting human health;</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/3" class="indent">developing a TB vaccine;</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/4" class="indent">carrying out research into bovine TB;</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/5" class="indent">testing cattle for TB and putting controls in place; and</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/6" class="indent">the randomised badger culling field trial.</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/7">The strategy is kept under review by officials. Some elements of the overarching bovine TB strategy will not produce results in the immediate future, e.g. the badger culling trial and development of a TB vaccine. We are therefore exploring and, where appropriate, implementing interim measures to help control bovine TB, while taking account of the affects of disease control measures on farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/8">A package of measures was announced in early October. This introduced:</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/9" class="indent">the licensed movement off farm of non-reactor cattle in certain specified circumstances;</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/10" class="indent">the imposition of movement restrictions on herds with overdue tests;</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/11" class="indent">a pilot project to assess the effectiveness of the gamma interferon blood test in detecting bovine TB; and</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/12" class="indent">the establishment of an industry group to monitor progress in implementing the new measures.</p>
	<p pid=".282W.9/13">Defra is currently considering how to manage the risk from movement of animals onto herds affected by bovine TB. An announcement will be made shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".285W.0/1">We propose to amend the Environmental Protection (Duty of Care) Regulations 1991 to allow waste collection authorities to serve notice on businesses, which will allow the authority to see their duty of care waste transfer notes. This should mean better enforcement of the duty of care requirements. The amended regulations should be laid before the House shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".285W.3/1">The Government are committed to reducing the environmental impacts of pesticides. To this end, the Government have invited industry to implement a package of measures, under the badge of the XVoluntary Initiative&quot;. These measures are designed to deliver real environmental benefits over a five year period, commencing in April 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.3/2">The Government are closely monitoring progress on implementing the Voluntary Initiative. The Government hope that the initiative will produce results and urge farmers, growers and their advisers and suppliers to give it their full support. If the Voluntary Initiative does not produce tangible environmental benefits, the Government will need to take other action. One option would be a pesticides tax, which the Government believe could be a useful tool in conjunction with other measures.</p>

In total, over 35,000 samples are collected per annum. All of the results are published quarterly in the VMD's newsletter and annually since 1996 in a report on surveillance and previously in the VMD's Annual Report and Accounts.

	<p pid=".286W.2/18">The second scheme complements the statutory scheme and concentrates on raw imported produce and samples of popular processed foods collected from shops.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.2/19">The two surveillance schemes are subject to independent scrutiny from the Veterinary Residues Committee, which was established in January 2001. Prior to that, the Advisory Group on Veterinary Residues oversaw the work.</p>

	<p pid=".287W.5/4" class="indent">the use of the Agency's regulatory powers to reduce the discharge of phosphorous from Keswick waste water treatment works. The introduction of phosphorous stripping in 1996 has lead to a significant reduction in the amount of phosphorous being discharged to the lake. Additional upgrades to the treatment works planned for 2004 will further reduce phosphate discharges. The Environment Agency will consider what other enhancements are required to waste water treatment works within the Bassenthwaite catchment for the water utilities Asset Management Process period 2005 to 2010;</p>
	<p pid=".287W.5/5" class="indent">the promotion of the Still Waters partnership within the catchment to promote solutions to nutrient enrichment caused by diffuse pollution that are beyond the remit of any one regulatory body or party. Since land use and land management practices are the primary cause of diffuse phosphorous entering Bassenthwaite Lake and diffuse sources are the biggest contributors of phosphorus pollution in the lake, the Still Waters partnership will focus on ways and means of reducing such inputs.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.2/1">In October 2001 we published a consultation document on measures to remove abandoned and untaxed vehicles from the streets more quickly and, for the longer term, bring forward changes to vehicle registration and licensing procedures to ensure greater accuracy of DVLA's vehicle record.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.2/2">Regulations reducing the statutory notice periods after which local authorities can remove abandoned vehicles from the highway and the storage periods for unlicensed vehicles came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-09">9 April</phrase>. Local authorities can now remove those vehicles that they consider merit destruction from the highway after the expiry of a 24 hour notice placed on them.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.2/3">We have supported pilot schemes in the London boroughs of Newham and Lewisham in which the local authority was given DVLA's powers to wheelclamp and remove unlicensed vehicles after 24 hours. Following the success of the Newham pilot on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-19">19 April</phrase>, we announced that all councils who wished could operate in the same way.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.2/4">In addition, councils have targeted over 6,000 abandoned unlicensed vehicles in multi-Agency XOperation Cubits&quot; with over 4,000 vehicles crushed and more operations are planned. To date we estimate that the operations have induced more than 15,000 motorists to relicense voluntarily bringing in over #2.3 million in additional revenue.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.2/5">The Government are currently developing proposals for the reform and modernisation of vehicle registration and licensing, to reduce evasion and to bear down on vehicle crime. In response to the recommendations of a report commissioned by the Department for Transport from the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science DfT have established a Modernising Vehicle Registration Implementation Board (MVRIB). This includes representatives of motorists' organisations, the motor trade, the police and the insurance industry to advise on and develop those proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.2/6">The 2002 Finance Act contained provisions under which the responsibility for licensing and taxing vehicles will be placed on the registered keeper, who will remain liable for doing so until such time that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has properly been notified of a change of keeper. These proposals will also mean that it is not necessary for a vehicle to be detected on the road for effective enforcement action to take place. The implementation of these new powers is at the heart of MVRIB's agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.5/1">The Environment Agency has established and implemented systems and procedures in all of its regions and areas covering England and Wales for the collection of flood event data during and after flooding. Flood and hydrometric data is collected from instrumentation (rain gauges, river level and flow recorders, tide gauges, wave buoys) and by using techniques such as aerial/remote sensing, land survey, on-site monitoring and post-event questionnaires.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/2">A project led by the Environment Agency (funded by DEFRA) in collaboration with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Rivers Agency of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland, is being carried out to improve the capture and archiving of flood flows at river gauging stations in the UK. Known as XHIFLOWS-UK&quot;, the main aim of the project is to extend and improve the data available for flood estimation primarily using Flood Estimation Handbook methods, and to develop a single authoritative UK dataset. The project also aims to make the data widely available and easily accessible via the Internet, and to establish structures and procedures for future updating and dissemination. The project is due to complete in March 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/3">Work started in 2002 to improve accessibility to sea level data. Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) who manage the UK Tide Gauge Network for DEFRA and the Scottish Executive are being given extra funding from DEFRA to collate a new data base of tide data over the last 30 years and make it available on CD. In addition recent historic data from the network is now freely available from the POL web site. In September 2002 DEFRA installed the first of two of a network of six near-shore wave recording gauges which, together with data from existing offshore wave gauges run by the Met Office, will be collated to form the first long term archive of wave data for England and Wales. Data from the archive will be freely available on the CEFAS web sitewho are managing the network for DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/4">In the South-East of England a new #8.2 million pilot project has been established by the Agency in partnership with all the maritime authorities (via the coastal groups) for the strategic regional coastal monitoring of the shoreline form and coastal processes (including wind, waves and tides). This project has been supported and grant-aided by DEFRA, and similar projects are likely to be established in other regions of England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/5">In all cases, collating date and making it freely available facilitates the user community who undertake statistical analysis including flood frequency analysis for many purposes.</p>

At a stakeholder meeting on the <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-18">18 September</phrase> the collection and disposal industries submitted a joint proposal for a National Fallen Stock collection and disposal scheme.

	<p pid=".292W.0/1">There are no specific regulations in place to control the use of claims for improving mental and physical well-being made on 'functional' foods. Claims on foods are controlled by provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, which prohibit false and misleading claims. In addition, the Food Labelling Regulations 1996 (as amended) lay down general labelling requirements for foods and prohibit medical claims i.e. claims that a food will prevent, treat or cure a disease.</p>

	<p pid=".295W.2/2">The Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 (as amended) require that no person shall carry on the business of a slaughterhouse unless the premises are licensed under the Regulations. Furthermore the regulations also require that no person shall sell fresh meat for human consumption unless it has been slaughtered in a licensed slaughterhouse.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/3">It is unlawful for a mobile licensed slaughterman to kill and dress an animal outside of licensed premises where it is intended that the meat be used for human consumption. In addition, the slaughterman would further contravene the Regulations as he would be supplying goods&mdash;the dressed carcase&mdash;and a sale would therefore have taken place.</p>

	<p pid=".295W.5/1">The Government has made it clear the importance it attaches to developing and maintaining high welfare standards for all animals both domestically and internationally. We have made clear that trade liberalisation must not compromise EU standards of animal welfare and hygiene. Our concerns are fully reflected on the negotiating proposals that the Commission has submitted in the Doha Development Agenda</p>
	<p pid=".295W.5/2">All poultry in the European Union must be slaughtered or killed in accordance with the requirements laid down in Council Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing. This Directive should have been implemented in all Member States by <phrase class="date" code="1995-01-01">1 January 1995</phrase>, and has been implemented in this country by the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 (as amended). The Directive contains a requirement that birds imported from third countries must be slaughtered under conditions which offer guarantees of humane treatment at least equivalent to those provided for in the Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.5/3">In respect of chemical contact where illegal veterinary medicine residues, for example nitrofurans and chloramphenicol, have been detected in imports of poultry meat from third countries there is a requirement under community law to test all consignments at border inspection posts. Consignments are not allowed entry if they are found to contain these chemicals. Nitrofurans and chloramphenicol are not permitted for use in food producing animals in the EU due to public health concerns. Therefore their residues should not be present in food.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.5/4">Imports into the United Kingdom of animal products are governed by European community legislation, which contains provisions to protect both animal and public health. Under these rules only third countries approved by the Commission on the advice of the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health may export into the community, and only from establishments which meet community hygiene standards. The lists of countries and establishments allowed to export particular products into the community, are available on the Commission's website at the following address:</p>

	<p pid=".295W.5/6">Imports of poultry meat from third countries must have been produced to the standards at least equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 71/118/EEC. In addition, all consignments of fresh poultry meat imported from third countries are subject to veterinary inspection on entering the EU to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and to ensure that they have remained in a satisfactory condition during transport.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.5/7">Responsibility for ensuring that third countries meet these requirements lies with the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) of the European Commission . FVO reports are published on their website at: <a href="http://euroDa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/insDections/vi/reports/indexen.html">http://euroDa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/insDections/vi/reports/index en.html</a>.</p>
