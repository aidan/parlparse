	<p pid=".324W.0/1">There is no central record of the total area which each licensed bingo club covers; but we have seen estimates that over half of the current total of about 700 clubs have a total area in excess of 10,000 sq ft. We indicated last August that, under the proposed Gambling Bill, the minimum size of the area set aside for table games in a new casino should be 5,000 sq ft. We are now looking again at that requirement in the light of the views of the Joint Scrutiny Committee on the Bill and the points made by interested bodies and individuals in commenting on the Bill proposals. It is, however, relevant to note that a 5,000 sq ft minimum table gaming area would entail a total casino size considerably in excess of that, particularly if the casino also wanted to provide bingo for its customers.</p>

	<p pid=".325W.6/1">The North West Development Agency (NWDA) is working closely with the Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board, the nominated Destination Management Organisation (DMO) for Lancashire. The new DMOs are, in effect, smaller versions of tourist boards. They aim to ensure a strong visitor and market focus to all that is done within the region and strengthen the connection between businesses and other organisations in the tourism sector.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.6/2">During 2003&ndash;04, the Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board received &pound;275,000 from the agency's tourism budget for a variety of tourism marketing and development projects.

	<p pid=".327W.5/1">No. Cluster bombs are legal weapons that are not indiscriminate. They provide a unique capability for use against wide area or dispersed targets. Were we not to use them, it would be necessary to use a large number of either unitary bombs or artillery shells to cover an equivalent area, involving a greater tonnage of explosive. Increasing the number of munitions launched also increases the risk that one or more launches may go astray. In many instances, using munitions other than cluster bombs may pose a far greater risk to civilians at the time of attack. Any applications for the export of cluster bombs would be considered on a case by case basis against criteria announced by the Foreign Secretary on 28 July 1997 and the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Sales.</p>

National planning advice in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 &quot;Housing&quot; (PPG3) and Circular 6/98, 'Planning for Affordable Housing' makes it clear that each local authority should assess the local need for affordable housing within its area. Policy UR9 of Regional Planning Guidance for the North West gives further advice on the need for affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/2">PPG3 advises that where there is a demonstrable lack of such housing, local planning authorities should include a policy in their development plan seeking affordable housing in suitable housing developments. It advises them to identify sites on which affordable housing will be expected and to indicate the amount of such housing to be sought as a proportion of the overall dwelling provision on a site. Decisions about the amount and types of affordable housing to be provided in individual proposals should reflect local housing need and be a matter for agreement between the local authority and the developer.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has published for consultation proposed changes to the current policies for affordable housing set out in PPG3 and Circular 6/98. The proposed changes re-emphasise the above policy, but also include allowing local authorities to seek affordable housing on smaller sites where this is justified. The changes are designed to help deliver more affordable housing where it is needed, and deliver a better match between a community's housing needs and supply.</p>

	<p pid=".334W.7/1">Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) has been developed in response to recommendations made by the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. The ELS is intended to tackle countrywide environmental problems such as diffuse pollution, loss of biodiversity and landscape character and damage to the historic environment. A pilot scheme has been running in four areas of England since February 2003, and an evaluation of these pilots has confirmed that the scheme is popular with farmers and has the capacity to deliver widespread environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.7/2">Following the success of the pilot, Defra intend to launch Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) as part of a new agri-environment scheme called Environmental Stewardship in early 2005. Proposals for the new scheme have recently been submitted to the European Commission for approval. It is proposed that the ELS should be open to all farmers in England and that they will be paid at a flat rate of 30 per ha in return for carrying out a certain amount of environmental management options across their whole farm.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.7/3">A parallel Organic Entry Level Stewardship (OELS) is proposed, which will have the same design as the standard Entry Level Scheme but would be tailored towards organic farming systems. It is proposed that organic farmers will receive a higher payment rate of 60   per ha, in recognition of the contribution that organic farming systems make towards increases in soil health and fertility, benefits for biodiversity and wider landscape benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.7/4">Entry Level Stewardship and its Organic equivalent will be complemented by Higher Level Stewardship, which is designed to build on the basic Entry Level in order to deliver significant environmental benefits in targeted high priority situations and areas. Further information on Environmental Stewardship will be available once Commission approval has been received. Final details of the new Scheme will be made available immediately prior to the launch in 2005. Application packs will not be available until the launch of the Scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".335W.2/1">I understand the recent flash floods in Worcester resulting from exceptionally intense rainfall equivalent to around a month's rain in just a few hours. This caused extensive highway flooding and some local property flooding. This flooding was from surface runoff and storm sewer/highway drain overflow and not from the main river system.</p>
	<p pid=".335W.2/2">Although the Environment Agency (EA) issued a Floodwatch and were operating a local storm balancing system on the Barbourne Brook in Worcester, the wider emergency response to the flash flooding fell for the most part to Severn Trent water and the local highway authority who are primarily responsible for responding to such incidents, the EA will be assisting its partners in the follow up investigation and the review of the storm event.</p>
	<p pid=".335W.2/3">The Government recognise the need for Integrated Drainage Plans for urban areas prone to such flooding, and this will be considered as part of Defra's new strategy on flood and coastal erosion risk management. However any assessment on flash flooding would need to take into account detailed knowledge of the drainage systems in the area, the local topography, together with modelling of the effects of different types of event. This information is not generally available and carries a high degree of uncertainty. The EA are in the meantime working with Research Councils and the Flood Risk Management Research Consortium to develop improved modelling and prediction of flooding in urban areas.</p>

	<p pid=".338W.2/1">Most commercial consignments of live animals must be imported into the UK via a Border Inspection Post (BIP) where import checks are carried out by a veterinarian. The only BIPS approved to check live animals in the United Kingdom are at Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow, Luton, Manchester, Prestwick and Stansted airports. There are no live animal BIPS at UK seaports.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/2">Rabies susceptible mammals, including some commercial consignments, may be imported into specified ports and must be pre-licensed and moved directly from the port of entry to an approved quarantine establishment by an authorised carrying agent. The carrying agent submits a report to Defra to state that the animal has been delivered to the quarantine premises.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/3">As an exemption to quarantine, cats and dogs may also enter under the Pet Travel Scheme. The animal must enter using an approved transporter on an approved route where the transport company is responsible for checks on the animals documents for compliance with the rules of the Scheme. If an animal is entering on an unapproved route then they are licensed into quarantine.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/4">It is illegal to import rabies susceptible mammals into the UK without a licence issued by the Government. The penalties for not complying are detention of the animal in quarantine at the owners' expense, re-export or destruction. The person responsible is also liable to prosecution and/or imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/5">Accompanied pet birds have to be pre-licensed and under go quarantine under the supervision of a veterinarian at the place of destination.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/6">Outside border inspection posts enforcement responsibility for ensuring that animals are not introduced illegally rests with the local authority. The State Veterinary Service (SVS) also take action when they receive information that animals have been illegally imported.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/7">HM Customs and Excise have a presence at all points of entry and if they find live animals they detain or seize (as appropriate) and inform the local Divisional Veterinary Manager of the SVS.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/8">The &quot;Washington&quot; Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, more commonly known as CITES, aims to protect certain plants and animals by regulating and monitoring their international trade to prevent it reaching unsustainable levels. My Department acts within the UK as the UK CITES Management Authority.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/9">As part of our efforts to stop the illegal import of endangered species a dedicated team of Customs officers is located at Heathrow airport and they are recognised worldwide as a &quot;centre of excellence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.2/10">Furthermore, we are continuing to contribute to the National Wildlife Crime Intelligence Unit, to help counter serious national and international wildlife crime, including the import of endangered species.</p>

Over 100 Ministers attended the ministerial segment (28 to 30 April) including my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and myself, along with senior representatives of the major UN and other international institutions. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan addressed the opening session.</p>
	<p pid=".342W.9/3">The UK delegation, led by the Secretary of State, played a leading role at CSD 12, in concert with EU partners, in identifying obstacles to progress and examples of best practice. Amongst the priorities we identified were: incorporation of water, sanitation and human settlements issues in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and national Sustainable development strategies; integrated water resource management plans to be in place by 2005; innovative financial mechanisms, such as the UK's proposed International Finance Facility; promotion of small-scale local initiatives and partnerships; and improved coordination between UN agencies and with international financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".342W.9/4">CSD 12 raised the profile of these issues and stimulated inclusive and interactive debate by all parties. The Chairman's Summary of the ministerial segment recognises that we are not yet on track to meet the targets, identifies the main obstacles faced and picks up on most of the UK's priorities. It also sets out a number of challenges to be addressed in the second year of the cycle on water, sanitation and human settlements, culminating at CSD 13 in May 2005, which has the task of agreeing the policy responses needed to get back on track with these international targets.</p>

They both provide protection against standard ammunition fired from short-barrelled handguns. In the case of HG1A a back face deformation of the armour to a maximum depth of 44mm is allowed and in the case of HG1 this maximum deformation is reduced to 25mm. The back face deformation is a measure of the trauma that would be inflicted.</p>

They did not inform the Home Office of this change. It has now been established that the fully cured material affords a lower ballistic trauma protection level than the partially cured material. The Home Office was informed of the problem in February 2004 and established its extent in March 2004. All affected forces have been told what action they should take, and the manufacturers are providing upgrade packs to return the armour to the specified protection level.</p>

	<p pid=".346W.9/2">In mid 2001, Highmark Manufacturing Co Ltd. started using a material that makes up part of the construction of the armour model KCW223 which was supplied to police forces. This material had been cured in a different way to material previously used. This resulted in the armour in having a reduced ballistic (trauma) protection level in terms of the HG1/A specification and a slightly reduced stab protection level that placed it just below the KR2 level in some carriers and just above KR2 in others.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.2/2">The Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) of the Home Office produces a body armour standard. HG1A is a body armour protection level, which was introduced in early 2002. PSDB approved test houses test body armour to the current PSDB standards and the results are published in the Manual of Ballistic and Stab Resistant Body Armour maintained by PSDB. When body armour is tested at a PSDB test house the manufacturer is asked to provide a Declaration of Construction that details the material used in the manufacture of the armour along with a detailed description of the construction of the armour. Any model of armour tested is assigned an identification number that uniquely identifies it and the test sample is retained by PSDB. This procedure is designed to ensure that all armour bearing a particular model number that has met a PSDB defined protection level, which is subsequently supplied by the manufacturer, is of the same construction as the original test armour.</p>

	<p pid=".348W.5/1">Over the past two years, in addition to the regular contacts we have with European colleagues in the Council of Ministers and with other counterparts at other international meetings, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has met counterparts from Greece, Belgium, Denmark, the United States, Italy, Ireland, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany and France; my predecessor as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office with responsibility for drugs issues, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/691" name="Bob Ainsworth">my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth)</phrase>, met his counterparts from Ireland, Jamaica and France; I have met my counterparts from Jamaica and the Netherlands. As a matter of major concern to Home Affairs and Justice Ministers across the world, drugs will have featured in most of these discussions. Home Office Ministers also have ready access to drug policies and practice in those countries through published reports from and about them and through advice from officials and others who keep in close touch with developments.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.6/2">The AGNIR experts confirmed that it was unlikely that the specific features of TETRA technology could pose a risk to health and suggested a number of areas where further research would be useful. These suggestions have been taken forward as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".352W.6/3" class="indent">The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) is assessing the effects of TETRA exposure on various types of cells. Dstl concluded that TETRA has no effect on calcium exchanges in cells. Further work on epileptiform activity and cognitive performance is underway.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.6/8" class="indent">The Radiocommunications Agency (now Ofcom) checks emission levels from TETRA base stations.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.6/9">In addition, we are funding TETRA research as an adjunct to the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme. Studies funded under this arrangement are selected and managed by the MTHR Programme Management Committee. As part of this adjunct programme, the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol is examining possible effects of microwave radiation on the electrical activity of the brain.</p>

	<p pid=".353W.11/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning what assessment has made of the incidence of cancer in each region since the Chernobyl nuclear accident.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.11/4" class="indent">The Chernobyl nuclear accident occurred on 28th April 1986. The attached table gives the incidence of all cancers in England, from 1986 to 2000 (the most recent year for which data are available), by Government Office Region.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.11/5" class="indent">Changes over time in the number of cancers registered are affected by many factors unrelated to the Chernobyl accident. These include historic change in smoking patterns, increased testing and screening for specific cancers (e.g. prostate, breast, cervix), and improved ascertainment by regional cancer registries.</p>

	<p pid=".355W.8/1">The Financial Ombudsman Service is an independent organisation. In November last year, I announced the two-year review of the operation of the Financial Services and Market Act 2000. As part of that review, I asked the Financial Services Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service to review the circumstances in which the Financial Services Authority takes regulatory action instead of individual cases being determined by the Ombudsman and to consider introducing a process by which firms may appeal against Ombudsman decisions. The Financial Services Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service plan to publish a joint consultation paper by early June.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.8/2">Responsibility for setting timescale targets for the resolution of complaints is a matter for the Financial Ombudsman Service. The Financial Ombudsman Service sets out for consultation annually a draft Plan and Budget of its overall financial and workload targets, including the number of cases it expects to receive and the number it intends to resolve, overall costs, productivity rates, and average timescales within which it aims to resolve cases. Cases that are not resolved within 12 months are monitored by the Board of the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.8/3">The role of the Independent Assessor is to carry out a final review of the service provided by the Financial Ombudsman Service, in cases where the consumer remains dissatisfied with the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Independent Assessor can investigative the Ombudsman's process and the behaviour of its staff. Disagreements about the merits of decisions are expressly excluded from his jurisdiction but is authorised to make findings and recommendations for redress in cases where he believes it is justified.</p>

Friend the Minister of State for the armed forces on 6 May 2004, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/.1714W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1714W</phrase>, I can confirm that in the UK, off-site civil nuclear emergency planning has been well established over many years. This includes emergency plans which are prepared for all UK nuclear sites by first tier local authorities under the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001. The emergency response arrangements are regularly tested in a programme of off-site exercises which bring together local and national organisations, and which are followed up both locally and nationally through the DTI-chaired Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.0/2">Restricted areas of two nautical miles radius are in place around all major nuclear installations, which apply to both military and civil aircraft.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.0/3">The Secretary of State for Wales meets with the Secretary of State for Defence and the First Secretary of the National Assembly for Wales on a regular basis to discuss a range of issues, including emergency planning.</p>

	<p pid=".362W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mr. George Osborne, dated 12 May 2004</p>
	<p pid=".362W.2/3" class="indent">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the Jobcentre Plus Provider Liaison Group. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.2/4" class="indent">The inaugural meeting of the Jobcentre Plus Provider Liaison Group was held on the 6th September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.2/5" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus Provider Liaison Group's membership includes representatives from several of our largest work-based private sector providers, together with providers in the voluntary and community sector, smaller private providers and Further Education establishments. In addition, membership includes the Association of Learning Providers (ALP), a trade body for the work-based sector who represent approximately 30% of Jobcentre Plus providers. The Group is supported by a small secretariat from Jobcentre Plus. Full membership of the Group is set out in Annex 1.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.2/6" class="indent">The purpose of the Group is to provide a forum in which providers are consulted on changes to policy and operational processes. In practice this gives them the opportunity to comment upon policies from their perspective as organisations that deliver these policies. The Group enables Jobcentre Plus to obtain the views of providers from a wide background and should help ensure that our business can be delivered more effectively and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.2/7" class="indent">There is no formal selection process. In order to ensure the arrangements are manageable, the Group has a membership of approximately 20. However, we do try to be inclusive as possible, and membership is potentially open to each of our providers. In setting up the group we attempted to ensure that a range of providers was represented. In addition to our inviting a number of the largest providers, each Jobcentre Plus Region was requested to nominate a local provider, to ensure that the Group offers views from smaller providers. Some Jobcentre Plus regions also hold their own meetings of local provider groups where there are region-specific issues to discuss.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.2/8" class="indent">The Group meets on a regular basis, usually bi-monthly, and meetings are held in Sheffield.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.2/9" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.2/1">The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) reports that average electricity production is in the region of 4,000 megawatts (MW), approximately the same level as before the 2003 conflict. A number of generating units are undergoing maintenance and should be back in service by the summer peak demand period. The CPA's power generation target for 1 June is 6,000 MW.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/2">It is estimated that immediately after the 2003 conflict coverage of water services was 60 per cent. of the urban and 30 per cent. of the rural populations. Considerable work has taken place since then to improve the quantity, quality and reliability of water services to the population. There are no complete statistics on current coverage, but informal estimates suggest that, in the south, supply has increased by 10 to 15 per cent. since May 2003. By the summer of 2004, water quality and volume in Basra is expected to have exceeded pre-conflict levels.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/3">A total of US$32 billion was pledged for the reconstruction of Iraq at the Madrid Donors' Conference in October 2003. Very significant sums are now being committed to specific projects for the reconstruction of power and water infrastructure and in a wide range of other sectors including health, education, transport, irrigation, telecommunications, housing and oil production.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/4">The maintenance of essential services is to a very large extent undertaken by Iraqis rather than by foreign contractors. However, it is clear that some reconstruction projects may be delayed as a result of restrictions imposed by the present security situation on the ability of contractors and development agencies to operate normally throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.5/1">In January 2003 HM Treasury and the Department for International Development (DFID) launched a proposal for an International Finance Facility (IFF). The IFF is designed to &quot;frontload&quot; aid to help meet the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The IFF has the following advantages; it provides the additional resources necessary to help achieve the MDGs, making funds available for education, health, economic development, debt relief and building trade capacity; it is the only feasible proposal at the moment which would deliver these resources; it locks in the political commitment of donors to Monterrey pledges and it provides the predictability and critical mass of aid needed for simultaneous and sustainable investment in developing systems across sectors, tackling the causes rather than the symptoms of poverty.</p>

	<p pid=".368W.2/1">The Government of Angola has not yet set a date for the next elections, indicating that 14 steps, including conclusion of the new constitution and re-establishment of the Electoral Commission, are necessary before an election can take place.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.2/2">DFID is supporting the electoral process. One of the key aims of our Country Engagement Plan for Angola is &quot;a political system which allows all people to influence state policy and practice&quot;. Hence DFID is working closely with the international community and Angolan civil society in developing a strategy to support the forthcoming elections. Specifically, DFID is funding a large-scale programme to help civil society, the media and political parties to prepare for the elections. Through this project DFID envisage providing assistance on technical processes such as election monitoring, although details have yet to be agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.2/3">Once the date for the elections is set, DFID would anticipate working with other members of the international community to do more. DFID is also willing to consider supporting nationwide consultations on the new constitution. As of yet, there have been no clear indications on how the Government intends to carry out this process and how donors can best support it.</p>

	<p pid=".368W.5/1">DFID completed its first Country Engagement Plan for Angola in September 2003. One of the three outcomes highlighted in the Plan is &quot;government systems for raising and using resources which are transparent and give priority to poverty reduction&quot;. Since then DFID has made significant progress on developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy on transparency in Angola. This includes encouraging Angola to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), contributing to the World Bank's Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), and assisting in development of a G8 Anti- corruption and Transparency (ACT) programme. We have also followed negotiations between the Government of Angola and the IMF on a new staff monitored programme for which greater fiscal transparency is a key pre-condition.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.5/2">With respect to civil society in Angola, DFID is one of several donors contributing to the Transparency Coalition set up by the international NGO World Learning in September 2003. The coalition consists of six different national NGOs who are working together to raise awareness and disseminate information on transparency issues throughout the country. The coalition recently put forward a proposal, which DFID has agreed to fund, to analyse and make accessible in layman's terms the complex and very technical Angolan National Budget (OGE). This should allow Angolan civil society to more actively participate in debates on the annual budget process. DFID has also participated in a new forum established by the National Democratic Institute (NDI) in Luanda to look at transparency issues. Through this forum, donors help keep civil society informed on developments in transparency at the political level.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.5/3">Much of this transparency work is still in its early stages and it will take some time before we see the full effects. It is worth noting however, that one positive result is already evident. Within the Angolan media there is a more open and animated discussion on transparency issues and civil society has been actively participating in this.</p>

	<p pid=".370W.11/1">In 2003 DFID provided &pound;700,000 for police vehicles to help increase the efficiency and visible presence of the Palestinian Civil Police. A DFID funded Police Adviser is currently working with the Palestinian Police and Ministry of Interior to assess the type of assistance that would most effectively help to build capacity within the Civil Police. This assistance is likely to be in the form of technical assistance, training and equipment. It is too early to say what impact this will have on police recruitment.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.2/1">The BTC pipeline has the potential to deliver substantial economic benefits to Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey and it will strengthen regional co-operation, developing new economic and political links between the three host countries. All the international parties involved in the BTC pipeline (including BTC Co., EBRD and IFC) are keen to make sure that the revenues generated by the project do not exacerbate regional tensions. Mitigation measures are already in place, including an IMF approved oil fund in Azerbaijan, a commitment by BP to publish what it pays to the host Governments and support by the World Bank and IMF on budgeting and public expenditure management. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is in the first wave of countries to begin to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI aims to increase the transparency of payments by extractives companies to Governments, as well as the transparency of revenues received by those host countries. Increasing transparency is a key component to reducing poverty, corruption, and the potential for conflict. The UK Government are helping Azerbaijan implement EITI, whereby BTC revenues are channelled through the State Oil Fund to ensure that the people of Azerbaijan benefit. We are also in discussions with the Government of Georgia on the possibility of their involvement in the EITI.</p>

	<p pid=".372W.2/1">Under the joint DFID/FCO/MoD Global Conflict Prevention Pool Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) Strategy the UK Government have been supporting, since February 2003, a programme to conduct in-depth assessments of small arms issues. The aim is to develop and implement National Action Plans (NAPs) in four East and Southern African countries to address the problem of the proliferation and illicit trafficking of SALW. The NGOs Saferworld and SaferAfrica are undertaking the work together with national Governments and local civil society organisations in Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia and Uganda.</p>
	<p pid=".372W.2/2">This process is most advanced in East Africa where a draft NAP is with the Kenyan National Security Council for approval. In the Southern African states of Mozambique and Namibia the process is not as advanced. In Namibia the preparatory phase commenced in late 2003 and the mapping process only began last month. In Mozambique the process has been delayed due to a variety of local circumstances, and the timetable is currently being re-assessed.</p>
	<p pid=".372W.2/3">Although no formal assessments have yet been undertaken due to the preparatory nature of the work in Southern Africa, DFID is committed to evaluating what progress has been made and the effectiveness of the National Action Plans overall at the appropriate stages in the process. The NAPs will be regularly reviewed through on-going reports from the field and by undertaking more formal assessments as part of on-going programme management. An external review of the programme in East Africa is planned for June and this will guide future evaluations of the work in Southern Africa.</p>

These priorities are set out in developing countries' own development plans. DFID has been working with developing country partners to ensure sustainable development considerations underwrite these strategies if they are to be effective.</p>

	<p pid=".374W.2/1">The risk of politicisation of humanitarian assistance, particularly food aid, has been regularly discussed in Parliament and with our international partners. As a result, significant emphasis is placed on monitoring incidents of political interference in the provision of humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/2">Humanitarian assistance provided by the European Union and UK to Zimbabwe is channelled through UN agencies and NGOs. In collaboration with those agencies, DFID operates a policy of zero tolerance towards political interference&mdash;including political manipulation of aid&mdash;in humanitarian operations. The UN and DFID's NGO partners have procedures in place for those affected to report irregularities. Any such incidents are quickly identified, reported and followed up, including by suspending food distribution where appropriate. As a result of these measures, there has been minimal interference with international assistance. DFID and other donors and agencies also use the media when appropriate to publicise our activities and to explain the extent of donor support to Zimbabwe during the present crisis.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/3">My reply to the hon. Member of Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) on 15 March 2004, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/.25W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 25W</phrase>, set out the position on the report by the European Court of Auditors on the effectiveness of EC aid to Zimbabwe. There was no DFID announcement of a further investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/4">UK programmes in Zimbabwe provide both humanitarian assistance and support for the fight against HIV/AIDS. EC programmes provide humanitarian assistance and support for a range of social programmes. The EC and DFID have well established systems in place to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those for whom it is intended. DFID has not received any representation in 2004 on misuse of either UK or EC humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/5">The DFID office in Zimbabwe is in close contact with the World Food Programme (WFP) and meets regularly with WFP, NGOs and other donors to discuss issues affecting WFP's operations.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/6">The Government of Zimbabwe's decision not to make an immediate appeal to the United Nations for general food distributions is of concern to the humanitarian community. Although the Government of Zimbabwe appear confident of a good harvest there is considerable divergence of views on the crop forecast. The Government also remain unwilling to discuss with the international community what stocks they hold, and what volume of grains they expect to import to meet any deficit in domestic supply. Without an appeal WFP will face difficulty in planning, securing donor funding for and implementing emergency operations beyond the coming months when existing agreements and stocks will run out. DFID will continue to monitor the situation closely in collaboration with WFP and other partners.</p>

I took part in the launch of the consultation on the new UK Sustainable Development Strategy on 21 April this year. I will attend a Royal Parks presentation and discussion in St. James's Park in June to explore how sustainable development relates to the strengths of Government departments.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/2">I am a member of the cabinet committee of Green Ministers. FCO officials attend pre-ENV(G) meetings co-ordinated by the Sub-Committee of Green Ministers. However, exemption 2 of Part 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information precludes me from divulging the details of cabinet committee business or attendance at meetings. The committee has helped the FCO and other Departments to consider how Government policies can best contribute to sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/3">As part of our commitment to Sustainable Development in Government the FCO has implemented an Environmental Management Systems (EMS) across its main London Offices which is certified to environmental standard ISO14001. This covers 78 per cent. of UK based staff and a further 20 per cent. of staff will be covered by an extension to our rural site at Hanslope Park in late 2004. The EMS promotes sustainable development principles in our day-to-day operations. The FCO is working with Defra, DFID and DTI to ensure that international issues are integrated into the new UK Sustainable Development Strategy. The FCO worked with DFID, Defra and DTI to organise a consultation event in New York on the back of the Commission on Sustainable Development 12 on international issues. A further consultation event will be organised in London in July.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.0/5">The Strategy will cover a range of economic, social and environmental issues. It will identify specific actions that the FCO can take through multilateral and bilateral processes and organisations. For example, the strategy will identify how the FCO is working through UN and related international bodies, trade, finance and investment bodies, the EU, G8, the Commonwealth, international partnerships, bilateral action through our posts and programme funds and the UK's Overseas Territories. The Strategy will also set out how the FCO is managing its Estate sustainably. Country action plans will also be developed in conjunction with posts and other stakeholders. We are working closely with other government departments, external stakeholders including the Sustainable Development Commission. We aim to complete the Strategy by autumn 2004.</p>

Israel should implement a settlement freeze and remove the settlement outposts erected since March 2001.

	<p pid=".378W.5/1">The Third Session of the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for the 2005 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in New York concluded on 7 May. The key procedural issues were agreed and this will enable all the necessary preparations for the 2005 Review Conference to go ahead. This outcome met the United Kingdom's main objective for this PrepCom.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.5/2">The major issues of how to deal with nuclear proliferation and tackle compliance with States' non-proliferation obligations were fully discussed and the United Kingdom presented its ideas and views on these issues in a series of detailed statements. The UK gave full accounts of the practical steps we have taken towards nuclear disarmament and made a presentation on the verification of nuclear disarmament, dealing with the issue of warhead dismantlement.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.5/3">The United Kingdom also distributed Publicity Material entitled &quot;Making a Safer World&quot; setting out our proposals on countering the proliferation of WMD and the initiatives we have taken; our record on nuclear disarmament; and how we ensure compliance with non-proliferation obligations.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.5/4">We are now looking forward to working with other States Party and the President-designate of the Review Conference, Ambassador Duarte of Brazil, as he carries out his consultations in the period running up to the Conference in May 2005. It is the role of the Review Conference to take decisions on all issues and recommendations, and the UK will continue to play a major role in strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime.</p>

	<p pid=".379W.2/1">Current legislation provides for the criminalisation of involvement in nuclear weapons proliferation by UK citizens or corporations including when operating from abroad. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which came into force on 14 December 2001, strengthened then existing legislation controlling chemical, nuclear and biological weapons. It introduced equivalent offences to those contained within the Chemical Weapons Act 1996 in respect of biological and nuclear weapons, and introduced a new offence of assisting or inducing certain weapons-related acts overseas. In the nuclear field these are:</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/2" class="indent">knowingly causing a nuclear weapon explosion;</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/3" class="indent">developing, producing, or participating in the development or production of, a nuclear weapon;</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/4" class="indent">having a nuclear weapon in (his) possession;</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/5" class="indent">participating in the transfer of a nuclear weapon; or</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/6" class="indent">engaging in military preparations, or in preparations of a military nature, intending to use, or threatening to use, a nuclear weapon.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/7">The Act applies to acts outside the United Kingdom when they are carried out by United Kingdom nationals, Scottish partnerships and bodies incorporated under the law in any part of the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Isle of Man or any colony. We will keep under review the need for any further legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.2/8">Tackling the threat posed by the spread of weapons of mass destruction remains a top priority for the UK, as my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear in his Statement to the House on 25 February 2004, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/.46WS"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 46&ndash;49WS</phrase>. The UK was instrumental in getting Security Council agreement to UNSCR 1540, passed on 28 April 2004. The UNSCR addresses a current gap in international law in addressing the problem of WMD proliferation by non-state actors and is a concrete example of the Security Council responding to a threat to international peace and security. It makes clear that all states have a responsibility to take steps to prevent WMD proliferation, and places legally binding obligations on all states of the UN under Chapter VII of the UN Charter (threats to international peace and security).</p>

These are a HM Treasury initiative and at present there are no indications that they will be extended to Northern Ireland.

Department officials are therefore monitoring developments on the implementation of the Pilots particularly in regard to their effectiveness and value for money.</p>

	<p pid=".394W.5/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has written to the hon. Lady directly in response to these questions.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Lady Hermon, dated 11 May 2004</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me to respond to your recently tabled Parliamentary Questions about funding allocated to develop school travel plans in Northern Ireland and what assessment has been made of the six safe routes to schools pilots that are being developed.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/4" class="indent">You will be aware that, as proposed by the Regional Transportation Strategy 2002&ndash;12, Roads Service has been working to address the issue of the 'school run', given its impact on morning traffic congestion, through the &quot;Safer Routes to Schools&quot; initiative with the aim of encouraging more children to walk, cycle and use public transport for their journey to school.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/5" class="indent">The Department of Education, the Department of the Environment Road Safety Team and other agencies are working alongside Roads Service in this project. The following six schools are currently participating in the initiative:</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/6" class="indent">St. Joseph's College, Belfast;</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/7" class="indent">Oakwood Integrated Primary School, Dunmurry;</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/8" class="indent">Wallace High School, Lisburn;</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/9" class="indent">St. Anthony's Primary School, Craigavon;</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/10" class="indent">Parkhall College, Antrim; and St. Brigid's College,       Londonderry.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/11" class="indent">This is the first time a schools initiative to promote sustainable modes of transport in response to a traffic congestion issue has been undertaken in Northern Ireland. Measures at the six schools are mainly exploratory and at different stages of development. The overall aim is to assist each school in developing a travel plan, which sets out a package of measures for reducing the number of car trips made to school. Where appropriate, Roads Service will subsequently introduce improvements to the roadway such as installing pedestrian facilities and traffic calming measures to facilitate children who may want to walk, cycle and use public transport. Additionally, other measures such as cycle shelters and lockers are provided by the Department of Education inside the schools premises.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/12" class="indent">To get the school travel initiative started, Roads Service and its partners have spent nearly &pound;85,000 over the last three years (2001/02-&pound; nil, 2002/03-&pound;48,391, 2003/04-&pound;36,253) on assisting development of travel plans for the participating schools. The funding was used to investigate existing infrastructure and facilities at the schools, examine accident data, undertake surveys to establish baseline school travel information and pay for the training of a Travel Plan Co-ordinator who was appointed to champion the initiative in the schools. This work was followed by the preparation of draft travel plans, which were given over to the schools to take ownership of and develop in line with the ethos of the school and its thinking on the sustainable transport concept. No specific funding has been allocated yet for the further development of travel plans as resources are being concentrated for the time being on the pilot group of six schools. However, it is intended, as part of the next stage of the initiative, to develop a practical support package that encourages other schools to engage in the travel plan process.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/13" class="indent">The improvements to the infrastructure and facilities at each of the pilot schools will be completed this financial year. While we will undertake a preliminary assessment at the end of the school year 2004/05 of how successful these measures have been, initial work including installation of cycle shelters at the schools has had very positive results and generated an increase in cycling among pupils for the school journey. It is anticipated that the planned infrastructure work to the road network adjacent to the schools should have equal effect in facilitating and encouraging more children to use sustainable modes of transport.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/14" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".398W.3/1">In April 2002, DfT awarded &pound;20 million supplementary credit approval (SCA) to support 19 local authorities (LA) and passenger transport executives (PTE) in providing real time information (RTI) on their local bus services. The SCA programme ended at the end of March 2004. It has been used to support the provision of:</p>
	<p pid=".398W.3/2" class="indent">over 2,600 buses equipped to provide RTI</p>

	<p pid=".398W.3/6">The transport direct team (TDT) is currently working on a national database of bus stops and public transport interchange points. Bus stops are recorded by LA, rather than by rural and urban areas. The information provided below is therefore broken down into PTEs and shire counties. PTEs are amalgamations of adjacent urban LAs, and as such have been used as an indication of urban areas. Shire counties have been taken to represent rural areas. The TDT database holds a total of 277,363 bus stops in England, of these 65,954 are in the PTEs outside London and 191,760 in the shire counties.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.3/7">In late 2003, a survey of bus real time information capability in English local authorities, recorded 361 at stop RTI signs in the PTEs outside London, and 2,067 at stop RTI signs in the shire counties. In addition to signs, there are &quot;virtual stops&quot;, which provide bus real time information through short messaging service (SMS). The total number of stops equipped with this capability is: 22,639 in the PTEs and 3,933 in the shire counties.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.8/1">The Government are raising the profile of public transport crime as an issue which needs to be addressed by a partnership approach between operators, local authorities, the police, Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs), and other interested parties.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.8/2">Examples of effective partnership working include the work of the National Route Crime Group to reduce the risks posed by acts of trespass on railway property and associated acts of vandalism. This and other local and national initiatives have led to a 32 Per cent. reduction of vandalism on the railways in 2002&ndash;03. The Secure Stations Scheme encourages train operators to work with other organisations to improve the 'whole journey' experience of rail passengers. Currently approximately two thirds of all overground rail journeys and one half of all London Underground journeys involve passengers starting or finishing their journey at a Secure Station. The Safer Travel on Buses and Coaches Panel is looking at ways to combat assaults, anti-social behaviour and vandalism on vehicles and property. The Panel has recently produced practical guides to protect bus and coach crews.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.8/3">The British Transport Police (BTP) also play a vital role in keeping Britain's railways safe and secure, and pleasant to use. The Force works closely in partnership with those who manage the railway, staff and tenants, and local police forces. BTP covers crime from serious violent and sexual offences to pick-pocketing and car crime. It also takes a lead in combating the anti-social behaviour that can impact so much on those who use and work on the railway. Other examples of the spreading of crime prevention good practice include a toolkit on reducing crime on public transport, and good practice case studies to improve personal security in bus travel. Department for Transport guidance (to be issued this summer) to local transport authorities on giving greater emphasis to accessibility issues within Local Transport Plans will encourage authorities to adopt a partnership approach with CDRPs, local partners in the health, education and welfare to work sectors, and the local community to address crime and the fear of crime issues as one way of improving people's ability to access jobs and key services.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.2/1">Candidates are able to book driving tests with the Driving Standards Agency by phone, by post or online via the internet. They can also amend their appointment by phone or post to seek an earlier or later date, so appointment availability at individual test centres continually varies. No applicant for a driving test is refused an appointment.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/2">The Agency has a national target for the average annual waiting time for a practical car driving test in England, Scotland and Wales of six weeks. The national average waiting time at the end of April for car tests was 9.2 weeks. Against the national average waiting time target for a motorcycling test of four weeks, the waiting time was 4.6 weeks. Against the national average waiting time target for a lorry or bus driving test of three weeks, the waiting time was 4.9 weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/3">The latest information about appointment availability for each type of test, at each test centre has been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/4">In order to reduce the current high waiting times for tests in Great Britain the Agency recruited 283 new driving examiners in the last financial year and plans to recruit a further 330 in the coming year. An extra 7.30 am test slot is being added to weekday programmes in some test centres and tests are now offered on Sundays. The Agency is deploying as many driving examiners as possible from Scotland to the London and South East area to tackle the problem of high waiting times there. In the context of its Business Plan for 2004&ndash;05, I have set the Agency a target to bring national waiting times for a car driving test down to six weeks by January 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/5">The Agency estimates that it will handle 1,563,000 applications for practical car driving tests in 2004&ndash;05. The current pass rate for the practical car driving test is 43 per cent., so the applications will include a number from candidates who have been unsuccessful at a previous test attempt&mdash;some of whom will delay reapplying for a further test for over a year. Taking these factors together suggests that between 670,000 and 940,000 people will be making applications in the coming year.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.6/1">A number of regulatory provisions apply to both heavy and light rail systems. These include: the Level Crossings Act 1983; the Railways and Other Transport Systems (Approval of Works, Plant and Equipment) Regulations 1994; the Railways (Safety Critical Work) Regulations 1994, and the Railway Safety (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 1997.

	<p pid=".403W.6/2">The measures necessary to meet these provisions reflect scheme specific risk, and so will vary depending on the nature and characteristics of the rail system concerned.</p>

Likewise it has not been feasible to obtain comparable figures for periods before April 2001 when the Skills for Life strategy was launched and the LSC was formed, but information shows it was considerably less than at present.</p>

	<p pid=".422W.0/1">No changes have yet been made to the fee structure for Level 2 courses in further education institutions. From September this year we will be trialling, in the North East and South East regions, a new entitlement enabling adults in the labour force without a full level 2 qualification to have access to free tuition for their first full level 2 qualification. Where a learner is taking a publicly available course in further education through this entitlement there will be no tuition fee cost to the learner or their employer. We will continue to expect colleges to collect fees from employers for customised provision. From September the Learning and Skills Council's funding assumption that for dedicated provision employers pay above the standard fee assumption for individual learners will be abolished. As outlined in our White Paper '21st Century Skills&mdash;Realising Our Potential' we will consult the sector later this year on changes to the fees framework from 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid=".424W.2/3">The practicality, time scales and best means of moving to three year budgets aligned to the school year will depend on decisions to be taken about the schools' funding regime for 2006&ndash;07 and beyond. The Government will consider what changes are required to the schools' funding regime in light of experience of the measures introduced for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 to improve stability in individual schools' budgets. Any changes will be fully discussed with local government and schools representatives.</p>

	<p pid=".431W.6/1">Statutory Paternity Pay was introduced in 2003 for fathers of children born or expected to be born on or after 6 April 2003 and adopters of children placed for adoption on or after 6 April 2003. Statutory Paternity Pay was therefore not paid before 6 April 2003, except to a small number of fathers whose children were born prematurely.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.6/2">Some employers will, of course have offered contractual paternity leave and pay to their staff before April 2003. Contractual provision is not recorded centrally but surveys suggest that where this provision was available fathers used it.</p>

It is possible to make an estimate of the numbers of mothers taking ordinary maternity leave based on employer returns to Inland Revenue for payment of Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) they recover. Nationally around 300,000 women receive SMP each year. Some of the women will take additional maternity leave, but as SMP is not paid during additional maternity leave, it is not possible to estimate the number taking additional maternity leave.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.12/2">In addition, there will be some women who will qualify for maternity leave but not SMP (because they do not meet the earnings criteria) and similarly some who qualify for SMP but not leave (because they are employed earners for the purposes of SMP but not employees in order to qualify for leave).</p>

	<p pid=".434W.0/1">It is not possible to provide estimates specifically for the constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey. However, based on the Office for National Statistics' Low Pay data released in 2003, the DTI estimates that around 120,000 people in the South East stood to benefit from the introduction of the National Minimum Wage in April 1999. Between 80,000 and 100,000 people were expected to have benefited from the October 2003 uprating of the National Minimum Wage.</p>

	<p pid=".434W.3/1">My officials are in discussion with all interested Government Departments, including officials from the Department of Health, to explore how flexible working arrangements can help carers. This is part of on-going work which will inform the review of the flexible working law in 2006 and shape future policy. It is too early to consider the implications on the demand for paid care staff.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.3/2">As part of this work, we are aiming to hold two roundtables involving employers and individuals who have caring responsibilities, such as those caring for elderly or sick relatives. The roundtables will explore how individuals balance work and caring responsibilities, including how different working patterns suit both carers and their employers. We are discussing the roundtables with the Department of Health and bodies representing carers.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.3/3">The Government's work-life balance campaign seeks to persuade all employers of the business case to adopt work-life balance policies and to follow best practice by providing flexible working opportunities across the workforce. This applies equally to those providing paid care as it does to those providing unpaid care.</p>

Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 3.8 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".442W.9/1">As I made clear in my answer of 28 April, Postcomm's advice on the future of the rural post office network was submitted to the Government in confidence. There are good reasons for this. The report contains detailed material which is commercially sensitive, both in relation to Post Office Ltd. and to the many individual businessmen and women who own and run sub-post offices. While I do not rule out the publication in due course, it would be inappropriate to publish it before the Government has taken any decisions on the future of the rural network. The Government is currently considering that advice and will take decisions on the shape of the rural post office network after 2006 in good time to allow for a smooth transition from the current support arrangements. The current funding arrangements for the rural post office network have nearly two years to run yet.</p>

	<p pid=".444W.2/1">The Government's target for renewables is that, by 2010, 10 per cent. of our electricity sales will come from renewable sourced electricity. The target is challenging as we are starting from a low base.</p>
	<p pid=".444W.2/2">The Government's main policy mechanism for achieving the target is the Renewables Obligation (and Renewables Obligation Scotland). Introduced in April 2002, it places an obligation on all licensed electricity suppliers to supply a specified and growing proportion of their sales from electricity generated from a range of eligible renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".444W.2/3">Through the Renewables Obligation (RO), we are looking to accelerate the development of renewables in a wide range of sources and technologies. In order to encourage a more vigorous and diverse renewable energy sector, the Government have also allocated a total of &pound;350 million over four years for capital grants and research grants to promote forms of renewable energy that are further from becoming commercially competitive. This includes among other things grants of &pound;117 million for offshore wind, &pound;66 million for energy crops and biomass, &pound;25 million for solar photovoltaics (PV), &pound;10 million for community schemes and &pound;5 million for wave and tidal demonstration projects.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.2/1">&quot;The Second Work-Life Balance Study (WLB2): Results from the Employees' survey&quot; was published in March by my Department as report number 28 in the Employment Relations Research Series. It is based on a survey carried out by MORI in January and February 2003. Key findings from the study are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".446W.2/2" class="indent">There was a high level of support for work-life balance amongst employees with 95 per cent. agreeing that 'people work best when they can balance their work and other aspects of their lives'. However, they were also clear that business considerations should still come first with three-fifths (60 per cent.) agreeing that employees should not expect to 'change their working pattern if to do so would disrupt the business'.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.2/3" class="indent">Reported availability of work-life balance practices appeared to have increased since 2000 for several arrangements, but varied considerably from 67 per cent. of employees who said part-time working was available to only 20 per cent. who said that working from home on a regular basis was available.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.2/4" class="indent">There has also been an increase in take up of several flexible working practices since 2000. Where employers provided flexible arrangements, take up among employees in the previous year and with their current employer was highest for flexitime (55 per cent.) and working from home (54 per cent.), but lower where hours of work (and thus pay) would be reduced such as for job-sharing (15 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".446W.2/5" class="indent">A sixth of employees (17 per cent.) had approached their employer in the last two years to make a request to change how they regularly work for a sustained period of time, and 77 per cent. said their request had been agreed. Almost one-third (29 per cent.) of mothers had requested a change in how they regularly worked from their employer in the last two years, compared to only 12 per cent. of fathers.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.2/6" class="indent">However, there was some employee concern, particularly among men, about the consequences of adopting flexible working practices in terms of their job security and career prospects. Although when asked about various working patterns and leave arrangements, only in the case of working reduced hours (such as part-time working) did more employees consider that adopting this way of working would negatively affect their career (51 per cent.) than those who stated that it would not (38 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".446W.2/7">The findings indicate strong support for work-life balance among employees. The increases in provision and take up indicate a shift towards improved work-life balance for employees, and the Department has encouraged this trend through the new employment rights introduced in April 2003. This legislation gives new rights to parents including introducing paternity and adoption leave for the first time, and the right to request flexible working for parents of children under six-years-old and of disabled children under 18-years-old (with a statutory duty on the employer to consider the request), as well as increasing maternity pay and leave.</p>

It is possible to make an estimate of the numbers of women taking maternity leave based on employer returns to Inland Revenue of the Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) they recover (since 2003 this has covered the first 26 weeks of leave).

	<p pid=".450W.8/1">The Government are committed to rebuilding and restoring national health service dentistry to improve oral health. New legislation in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 will underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service, properly integrated with the rest of the NHS. The aim is to deliver better access to services, better working lives for dentists and their teams, better oral health and an improved patient experience.</p>
	<p pid=".450W.8/2">As part of the new arrangements, the current remuneration system, which is based on item of service fees, will be abolished and replaced by a much simpler contract. Under transitional arrangements we are developing a simple but robust 'base contract' which all dentists and primary care trusts (PCTs) will be able to put in place from 2005. These transitional arrangements will provide protection of dentists gross earnings for three years to enable them to come off the treadmill of item of service fees, to see their patients at intervals appropriate to their oral health needs and to modernise and adjust their workload. These proposals are set out in &quot;Framework proposals for primary dental services in England from 2005&quot; which was published on 24 February and on which we have been seeking views from dental representative bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".450W.8/3">In the meantime we have provided new investment totalling &pound;90 million to NHS dentistry over the last year. &pound;59 million will support access and is aimed at increasing access to NHS dentistry for patients. Strategic health authorities have been advised of their shares and are working with their PCTs to address access issues. &pound;30 million is to support information technology and the balance of &pound;1 million will support organisational development locally.</p>

	<p pid=".456W.6/43">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".456W.6/44">1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.6/45">2. Figures are grossed for coverage, except for 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.6/46">3. Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid=".460W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 4 May 2004</p>
	<p pid=".460W.5/2">A review of recent research entitled, &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, published by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) advisory group on non-ionising radiation concluded:</p>
	<p pid=".460W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".460W.5/4">Nevertheless, following the precautionary approach advocated by the independent expert group on mobile phones (IEGMP) in May 2000 (<a href="http://www.iegmp.org.uk">www.iegmp.org.uk</a>), the LINK mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme, was established under an independent programme management committee (PMC), following the publication of the IEGMP report. The PMC has expressed its wish to undertake research into the effects of 3G exposures and discussions are already taking place on how this can be added to the overall programme of research. Further information about this programme as a whole can be found on the MTHR website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".460W.5/5">The operators of mobile telephone equipment, including 3G technologies, ensure that public exposure does not exceed national and international guidelines. A substantial number of measurements of potential exposures of the public from base station emissions, have been made by a number of bodies, including the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) (<a href="http://www.nrpb.org">www.nrpb.org</a>) and Ofcom, formerly the Radiocommunications Agency (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>). In all cases, exposures have been very much lower than guidelines.</p>

	<p pid=".461W.2/1">While we do not collect data centrally on the number of primary care trusts (PCTs) that have schemes in place so that older people can get more help from pharmacists in using their medicines, there is good evidence to indicate that the number of pharmacists providing support to patients, general practitioners and PCTs to improve medicine taking has increased significantly since 2001, when the older people's national service framework was published.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.2/2">PCTs now employ over 1,000 pharmacists, some of whom provide hands on support to GP practices to set up medicines management schemes, which help patients take their medicines more effectively. Through the national medicines management collaborative at least 393 community pharmacies are actively involved in programmes such as prescription intervention schemes, medication reviews, return of unwanted medicines, and minor ailment schemes, thereby encouraging self-care and support to vulnerable groups, particularly older people. This includes enhanced prescription collection and delivery services, medicines management services to care homes and domiciliary visiting. The Department is also funding a trial of structured services based exclusively in community pharmacies for patients with coronary heart disease, led by the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.2/3">The proposed new community pharmacy contractual framework, which is currently being negotiated, will also be an important driver for change and will help to ensure that pharmacists are more involved in supporting patients in using their medicines. Repeat dispensing, which is expected to be an essential service provided by all pharmacies, will enable patients with stable conditions to obtain a prescription from their GP, which can then be dispensed in several instalments by their pharmacy over an agreed period of time.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.2/4">The first pharmacist supplementary prescribers have qualified and will be writing their first prescriptions imminently. Supplementary prescribing within a clinical management plan agreed with the doctor will be particularly beneficial for patients with chronic diseases. The work of the medicines partnership taskforce, funded by the Department, has helped professionals and older people to become more involved in medication reviews.</p>

	<p pid=".466W.3/3">Maximum waiting times have fallen over the past few years and will continue to do so. By the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant will fall to three months and the maximum wait for inpatient treatment will fall to six months. Also, the older peoples' national service framework set standards that will improve treatment and care for a range of older people, including those with rheumatological conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".470W.3/1">As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and its independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The MHRA and CSM have thoroughly reviewed the safety of mercury-containing vaccines, including alleged links with autism, on a number of occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.3/2">In 2001, CSM conducted a major review of the available evidence and has since then considered new data as it has emerged. In 2003, following a review of further studies, including two United Kingdom studies involving more than 100,000 children, CSM advice was placed on the MHRA website at <a href="http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk">http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.3/3">Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children have also specifically investigated the suggested link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies found any evidence of a causal association.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.3/4">On the basis of the available data, the advice of CSM remains that there is no evidence of harm from the form of mercury contained in vaccines, with the exception of possible hypersensitivity reactions, typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection. The CSM advises that the benefits of immunisation with such vaccines outweigh any potential risks of vaccination. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.3/5">Despite the strong evidence supporting the safety of mercury-containing vaccines, the European medicines regulatory body, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) continues to promote the development of vaccines without, or with the lowest possible levels of, mercury compounds. The CSM supports the EMEA position. In response to this, several UK licensed vaccines have had levels of such compounds reduced or removed completely from the manufacture of the component antigens or from the final vaccine.</p>
