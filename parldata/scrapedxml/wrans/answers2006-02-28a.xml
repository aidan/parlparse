We are particularly pleased with the emphasis the QDR gives to working with allies and partners to resolve international security issues and the recognition that Defence is only one part of a range of responses. Given this increased emphasis on continuing to work closely and effectively with allies, the overall impact on UK Defence Policy as set out in the Defence White Paper (Cm6041-I) is limited.</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.3/13">Decisions about the future of the unit will be taken after the current consultation on a badger culling policy has ended. The cost benefit analysis which supports our consultation shows that state operated culling could lead to higher costs and slower delivery compared with other options. So our intention is to redeploy or release workers who have carried out cage trapping at the end of the RBCT. Remaining staff, who could be used to support any future culling policy, will be retained.</p>

Very few apply for refugee status. Most try to formalise their stay with work permits, or are prepared to remain as illegal immigrants.

	<p pid="a.637W.4/1">The tables show gross and net expenditure on general dental services (GDS) and gross expenditure on personal dental services (PDS) pilots. Expenditure on GDS since 1998&ndash;99 has been affected by the progressive movement of services into PDS pilots. Charge income from PDS pilots is not separately identified in national health service accounts up to 2004&ndash;05, so it is not possible to provide data for net PDS expenditure based on NHS accounts. Based on estimates obtained from Dental Practice Board payments data, we estimate that PDS expenditure in 2004&ndash;05 net of patient charge income was around &pound;240 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.12/1">Nationally, it is imperative that domestic violence is integrated throughout work with children. The harm that can arise to children from domestic violence is set out in &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; (1999) and these references will be updated when the new version of this guidance is published later in 2006. Domestic violence will be included as a factor to consider as part of the Common Assessment Framework (the nationally standardised approach to conducting an assessment of the needs of a child or young person and deciding how those needs should be met).</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.12/2">The Department for Education and Skills is also reviewing the inclusion of domestic violence, as it affects children, in the Joint Area Reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.12/3">The Children Act 2004 addresses the issue of services for all children at risk including those affected by domestic violence. The Children's Act should deliver greater accountability and integration of services locally, regionally and nationally, with a lead member for Children's Services and director of Children's Services in every local authority and a local safeguarding children board in every local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.12/4">In West Lancashire, there are currently three Sure Start children centres, each offering a multi-agency approach to a range of services for children and their families, based on individual need; including early learning integrated with day care, health services, parental outreach, jobcentre plus, information and advice to parents and access to specialist services. Two further children's centres are to be developed in the West Lancashire area during 2006 to 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.663W.5/2">The decision to site the treatment works at Donaghadee was taken in February 2002 by the then Minister for Regional Development, Peter Robinson MP MLA, following a rigorous site selection and evaluation process. The site adjacent to the carpet factory was identified as the Best Practicable Environmental Option. The Crown Development application was approved by Planning Service in April 2005. The new &pound;42 million works is being constructed under Water Service's Omega Wastewater Public Private Partnership Project.

	<p pid="a.666W.2/1">The budget announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase> made provision for the development of the core part of the Northern Ireland Railways network in line with the funding estimates in the Railway Review Group (RRG) report. It also made provision for an element of capital renewal on the lesser-used lines in accordance with option 2 of the RRG report. The lesser-used lines are those between Whitehead and Larne, and between Ballymena and Londonderry (including a spur to Portrush). The option 2 proposal envisages some &pound;17 million investment on the lesser-used lines over a five-year period and is designed to ensure the maintenance of services at current levels. While this approach effectively secures the delivery of rail services on the lesser-used lines during that five-year period, it makes no provision for any significant improvement to the rail services offered on those lines during that period. It is inevitable that there will be some degree of betterment arising from works to improve parts of the track or to enhance railway stations, but there are no plans to enter into any further funding commitments until it has been possible to review the impact of recent investment in the railways. This cannot be undertaken before 2007.</p>

The Department and employing authorities are committed to reducing teacher absenteeism, and this has now reduced significantly: between 2002 and 2004 the average absence rate has reduced by 1.9 days per teacher per annum. Work is ongoing on a teachers' health and wellbeing strategy, which, when agreed and implemented by employers, will help to reduce sickness absence levels even further.</p>

For the example below, we have assumed 3,000kWh electrical use. Since PV produces Electricity it can only displace the CO <sub>2</sub> from the electrical use in the building. 3,000kWh of electricity equates to 1,290kg/CO <sub>2</sub> p.a. (assuming 0.43kg CO <sub>2</sub> /kWh). A typical dwelling built to 2002 part L standards would have annual emissions of around 3040kg CO <sub>2</sub> (830kg Carbon). Assuming a 25 per cent. improvement on 2002 standards under 2006 part L standards, the annual emissions would be around 2,600kg CO <sub>2</sub> (710kg Carbon). Assuming a quality PV system delivers&mdash;800kWh/kWp/yr, the size required to meet a 10 per cent. carbon emission reduction would be around 0.75kWp, which would cost between &pound;4,500 to &pound;6,500 to install (assuming installed costs of &pound;6,000 to &pound;8,500/kWp depending on type of PV specified).</p>

The value of the exported electricity is typically &pound;0.02/kWh. Offices will utilise all PV generation on site. Dwellings may export to percent.</p>

Where the Government have a majority shareholding, appointments are made strictly in line with the procedures laid down by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA). Where the Government do not have a controlling shareholding and the appointments are not subject to OCPA, we nevertheless insist that the fundamental principle of UK public appointments should still apply and appointments be made purely on merit.

In recognition of the extra costs that would be incurred by local highway authorities taking over responsibility for detrunked routes, the Government gave a commitment to ensuring that detrunking would be accompanied by a fair transfer of resources. It was agreed with the Local Government Association (LGA) that the most effective way of ensuring that authorities were provided with resources for the routine maintenance of detrunked routes would be by means of an annual special grant. This was intended to be a transitional distribution method, and it remains the Government's policy that detrunked roads will, in due course, be incorporated into the Revenue Support Grant system. Capital support has been through the issue of SCAs (Supplementary Credit Approvals) to 2003&ndash;04 and from 2004&ndash;05 SCERs (Supported Capital Expenditure (Revenue)).</p>

	<p pid="a.688W.11/1">Carer's allowance is an income maintenance benefit for people aged 16 or over who regularly provide at least 35 hours of care per week for a severely disabled person who receives an attendance allowance, or the equivalent rates of the disability living allowance care component or a constant attendance allowance paid under the industrial injuries disablement benefits scheme or the war disablement pension scheme. The allowance is not income-related and entitlement does not depend on the payment of national insurance contributions, but it is not available to people in work who have earnings of more than &pound;82 per week net of a range of allowable expenses. To avoid duplicate provision from public funds, it is not payable when a carer is receiving another non-income-related benefit or a training grant to maintain their income which is paid at the same or higher weekly rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.688W.11/2">Subject to these entitlement and payment rules, carer's allowance is available to young carers aged 16 to 21 years who undertake training or part-time education. However, it is not available to those in full-time education involving 21 hours or more of supervised study a week. This is because young people aged 16 or over who remain in full-time non-advanced education are regarded as financially dependent on their parents who can receive child benefit and child tax credits, whilst support for those who choose to undertake full-time advanced education is provided by the student support system rather than by social security benefits.</p>
