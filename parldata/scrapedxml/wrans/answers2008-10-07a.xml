Despite a fourfold increase in funding over the last 10 years, we recognise the need to expand the service to provide more help to more people. We are doubling the budget on Access to Work. This will be a major expansion of the support we can offer to disabled people to help them get and sustain employment. We estimate that this will expand the programme's capacity to around 48,000 people by 2013-14. The extra funding being made available is in addition to what was agreed in the 2007 spending review settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.548W.3/3">Following a consultation in January 2007 and subsequent work through LSC advisory groups, changes were made to the way additional learning support was calculated for 2008/09. These changes were introduced to ensure that the funding was better focussed on need rather than purely on an historical basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.548W.3/4">ALS now has a funding formula that has two levels, low cost and high cost. For learners aged 16-18, low cost claims&mdash;that is, those under &pound;5,500&mdash;will be allocated using the learners' GCSE English and Maths points profile from the college's previous year's cohort.</p>
	<p pid="a.548W.3/5">For learners over the age of 19, low level claims are based on the level of qualification being studied.</p>
	<p pid="a.548W.3/6">To allow for transitional arrangements for ALS, and to minimise the impact on colleges' budgets, 60 per cent. of the low cost ALS has been distributed using the formula approach in 2008/09. The remaining 40 per cent. has been allocated on the basis of the historical proportion of the budget. The intention is to move to 75 per cent. (formula)/ 25 per cent. (allocation) in 2009/10.</p>

It is also used to target media activity for the Skills for Life campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.550W.5/2">Under the current arrangements, institutions are required to pay a minimum bursary to all students receiving the maximum grant. Beyond this, it is for institutions themselves, subject to approval from OFFA, to decide how to support their students. The latest figures show that acceptances to universities for England are at an all time high, with the proportion of applicants from lower socio-economic groups also up. A national bursary scheme would be very complex and costly to administer, and would lead to reduced support for students at a number of universities, damaging our fair access agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.5/3">As we made clear during the passage of the legislation introducing the new fee and student support arrangements, there will be an independent review in 2009 which will work on the basis of evidence from the first three years' operation of the variable fee arrangements. The review will report to Parliament. The draft terms of reference were announced to Parliament in 2004 by the then Secretary of State. The final details about the arrangements for the review, its remit and methodology will be determined in due course. That will take place after the Government have conducted a wider debate among both higher education providers and users which will set the framework for the future of Higher Education over the next ten to fifteen years. The Secretary of State recently announced the next steps to that process in his speech to Universities UK at Cambridge.</p>

	<p pid="a.551W.2/1">The UK Government fully support academic freedom and are firmly against any academic boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics.</p>
	<p pid="a.551W.2/2">Boycotts and any severing of links with Israel would be counterproductive, and completely at odds with the principles of open exchange that should underpin academic life. I profoundly believe ending such links would do nothing to promote the Middle East peace process. Both Israel and the occupied territories contain progressives and reactionaries, and the problem with boycotts or moves to severe links is that they make the job of progressives much more difficult and entrench the position of the reactionaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.551W.2/3">The UK Government have made their support of international academic links clear. Alongside the Israeli Government, we have actively supported the establishment of the Britain Israel Research and Academic Exchange partnership&mdash;BIRAX which aims to strengthen academic links between the UK and Israel through the awarding of grants to support academic exchanges for research purposes. We are exploring options for supporting academics in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.0/2"><i> </i>HEFCE does not allocate funding for student bursary schemes. Instead, each higher education provider which wishes to charge variable tuition fees for regulated courses has to agree an access agreement with the Office of Fair Access (OFFA) under which it commits to recycle some of the extra income from variable fees to support some of its students. Information on the 2007/08 academic year will become available in the spring. The following table sets out the position for 2006/07&mdash;the first year of the new arrangements.</p>

It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the overall detection rate have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.</td> </tr>

It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the overall detection rate have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.</td> </tr>

Offences in the Identity Cards Act 2006 target those who possess and use false identity documents and genuine documents belonging to someone else. More powers to share data to combat fraud were enacted in the Serious Crime Act 2007 and the Disclosure of Death Registration Information Scheme, under the Police and Justice Act 2006, was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-16">16 January 2008</phrase>.</p>

Anyone who has had their personal details used fraudulently can contact one of the three credit reference agencies for help in resolving any credit related problems.

	<p pid="a.573W.2/2">There are two primary sources of statistics on crime held by the Home Office. Police recorded crime is based on aggregate returns from police forces of the number of notifiable offences reported to and recorded by the police. Such returns do not contain information on the characteristics of victims or their families. The British crime survey is a sample survey of households in England and Wales and covers crimes experienced in the 12 months prior to interview. Currently, the survey is restricted to the experiences of adults aged 16 years and over. Following a recommendation of the independent Smith review of Home Office crime statistics, the survey is being extended to include those aged under 16 years from 2009.</p>

Police recorded crime is based on aggregate returns from police forces of the number of notifiable offences reported to and recorded by the police. Such returns do not contain information on the characteristics of victims or their families. The British Crime Survey is a sample survey of households in England and Wales and covers crimes experienced in the 12 months prior to interview. Currently the survey is restricted to the experiences of adults aged 16 years and over. Following a recommendation of the independent Smith review of Home Office crime statistics, the survey is being extended to include those aged under 16 years from 2009.</p>

These figures include an allocated proportion of General Budget Support and funding to the Education for All fast track initiative.

Technical assistance was also used to recommend improvements in the ways government departments operate and train officials to discharge their duties more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.0/2">There was no formal education component in the Andhra Pradesh Rural Livelihoods project, although there was a strong emphasis on capacity building of community members, particularly women to develop new skills, in areas related to livelihoods and income generating activities. The project ended in December 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.583W.3/1">The International Health Partnership's (IHP) goal is to accelerate progress on the health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through improvements to health systems as well as more effective use of aid. The Government of Nepal (GoN) joined the IHP while the GoN's Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) were designing how to scale up the free health care policy: a policy designed to improve access by the poor to services. The IHP launch event provided the Minister of Health and Population with valuable global evidence to inform policy-making and expansion of delivery. The Department for International Development (DFID) has provided technical support to the policy both preceding the launch of the IHP and subsequently. DFID provided an additional &pound;3 million for fiscal years 2007-08 and 2008-09 in recognition of the IHP and supporting the free health care policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.3/2">For 2008-09 DFID is providing &pound;20.5 million to the health sector. This funds three programmes: the overall health programme (called the Nepal Health Sector Programme), Support to the Safe Motherhood programme and the HIV/AIDS programme. Most of the fund is provided as budget support to be managed by, and through, the government's system.</p>

	<p pid="a.583W.6/1">The UK attaches great importance to the work of the OECD Development Assistance Committee in developing best practice guidance for donors whether in the form of principles, guidelines or policy statements. Where appropriate we will continue to work with others to ensure such guidance is associated with clear commitments and targets for its implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.6/2">For example, the Paris principles (partner country ownership, alignment, harmonisation, managing for results and mutual accountability) provide an organising framework for the commitments set out in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The international community agreed 12 targets to monitor the implementation of these commitments, and most recently reviewed progress in doing so at the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in Accra on 2-<phrase class="date" code="2008-09-04">4 September</phrase>. The Accra Agenda for Action, which resulted from that meeting, represents an important further means to accelerate progress towards the Paris Declaration targets set for 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.6/3">UK delivery of the Paris Declaration commitments and targets now forms part of the Department for International Development's (DFID) Departmental Strategic Objectives rather than of a separate action plan. There are therefore no costs associated with fulfilling a separate plan. Our progress in meeting our Paris Declaration commitments and targets is subject to DFID's normal management and reporting mechanisms.</p>

	<p pid="a.585W.2/5">Also at the HLF, 14 donors, including UNDP, World Bank, EC, Germany and the Netherlands, signed up to a new UK-led 'International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)'. This will enable donors to implement and go beyond the commitment made in the Accra Agenda for Action and ensure that information on aid flows is available to everyone. Donors will work together to agree, before the end of 2009 an accessible common format for the publication of information about aid. The initiative will help citizens hold donors and governments to account for their promises and enable partner governments and their citizens&mdash;those who ultimately benefit from aid&mdash;to plan for and make the best use of aid.</p>

	<p pid="a.599W.3/1">The Estates Consolidation Programme (ECP) is a five-year undertaking designed to deliver &pound;250 million cumulative accommodation running cost savings by releasing surplus accommodation across the HMRC estate. Accommodation is chosen for retention or vacation in conjunction with HMRC's Workforce Change Programme, which aims to ensure that the offices retained are those best suited to the Department's long-term business needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.599W.3/2">The overall projected estates savings for the Eastern England region in the period 2007-08 to 2011-12 are estimated at around &pound;25.9 million. The overall costs associated with delivering those changes over the same period are estimated at around &pound;10.7 million. For reasons of commercial confidentiality, more specific figures cannot be made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.599W.3/3">Treasury Ministers and officials receive representations from a wide range of organisations in the public and private sectors as part of the process of policy development and delivery. As was the case with previous Administrations, it is not the Government's practice to provide details of all such representations.</p>

	<p pid="a.608W.6/2">Because of the small numbers of personnel who have suffered an amputation we do not provide further details of amputations as this would increase the risk of an individual being identified and compromising their right to medical confidentiality.</p>

The Amputee Unit provides high quality prosthetics and adaptations, manufactured on site and individually tailored as necessary for the specific patient. The aim is to provide prosthetics to enable Service personnel to resume Service duties where possible.</p>
