The allowance was estimated by DCMS and was based on spending in Manchester on the Commonwealth Games. The allowance was revised downwards to &pound;32 million, as a result of the cost review carried out by DCMS after the bid was won, and this amount was included in the revised public sector funding package that I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.816W.0/1">Action on the National Domestic Violence Plan, including the delivery of support to victims and their families, is monitored through the Inter-departmental Ministerial Group on Domestic Violence, on which I sit.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.0/2">A lot has been done to improve and increase the support available for families affected by domestic violence:</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.0/3" class="indent">This year, the Home Office has allocated just under &pound;6 million to tackle domestic violence including &pound;2 million to support and improve local delivery on domestic violence for victims and their children and funding for improved public protection arrangements for domestic violence victims and a matrix of help lines to provide advice and support to victims and their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.0/4" class="indent">The Ministry of Justice has allocated &pound;3 million for Independent Domestic Violence Advisers whose aim is the safety and support of victims and their children. This is in addition to annual court business costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.0/5" class="indent">The Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme aims to improve the welfare of all children by putting in place arrangements for earlier and more effective assessment and intervention for vulnerable children, such as those affected by domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.0/6" class="indent">Communities and Local Government has developed a range of accommodation options for victims including Sanctuary scheme guidance, and &pound;61 million of Supporting People funds were used by local authorities in 2006-07 to provide housing related support for victims of domestic violence and their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.0/7" class="indent">Guidance available for Jobcentre Plus staff provides advice about domestic violence and its potential impact on victims, explains the sorts of support they may need and provides advice on taking account of their particular circumstances when dealing with a benefit application. The guidance also has contact details of a range of organizations which provide advice and support to domestic violence victims.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.0/8" class="indent">Financial support in respect of children, such as child benefit and child tax credits, is paid to the person who is responsible for those children and is often already paid directly to mothers. Where there is any family breakdown, the benefits will, where necessary, normally be transferred to the person with whom the children are residing.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.0/9">Domestic violence tears apart families and always negatively impacts on children. The Government recognise the strong links between child protection concerns and domestic violence. Victims leaving a violent relationship will often need a range of financial and practical support for themselves and their children. The Inter-departmental Ministerial Group will continue to monitor this aspect of delivery.</p>

	<p pid="c.817W.3/1">The Government introduced statutory protection from harassment on grounds of religion or belief in employment and vocational training in 2003, as part of the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations. As a consequence, where an individual is subjected to unwanted conduct in the workplace, which violates their dignity or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading or offensive environment for them, they have recourse to a civil remedy through employment tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="c.817W.3/2">As part of the Discrimination Law Review, we recently consulted on the possibility of extending similar statutory protection from harassment on grounds of religion or belief in the provision of goods, facilities and services, education in schools, the management or disposal of premises and in the exercise of public functions.</p>
	<p pid="c.817W.3/3">The Government Equalities Office is currently analysing over 4,000 responses which were received as a result of the consultation, and we will carefully consider the views expressed in these responses before any decisions are taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.817W.3/4">The aim of any provisions in this area would be to clarify the existing protection from less favourable treatment because of a person's religion or belief when accessing goods, facilities or services, offered by part 2 (religion or belief) of the Equality Act 2006. If we decided to legislate in this area, it would not affect social interaction between private individuals, or prevent proselytising in the street. As with the employment provisions, harassment provisions in this context would give rise to civil remedies, not create any criminal offences of religious harassment.</p>
	<p pid="c.817W.3/5">The separate, criminal offence of incitement to religious hatred came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>. This covers threatening words and behaviour which is intended to stir up religious hatred.</p>

	<p pid="c.821W.2/1">The Government recognise the importance of young, developing musicians having access to affordable and professional facilities to rehearse and perform live music. That is why, following a recommendation by the Live Music Forum, we recently asked Feargal Sharkey, the ex-chair of the Forum, to work with local authorities, the music industry and other partners over the next two years to establish a number of pilot music rehearsal spaces across the country. &pound;500,000 has been allocated to assist with the cost of setting up these pilots. In the longer term, we will continue to explore what other funding streams may be available for this purpose, such as our proposed unclaimed assets scheme. As part of this initiative, my officials have spoken to representatives of the British phonographic industry, the Association of Independent Music and Sony BMG Music Entertainment (UK) who have agreed to assist.</p>

	<p pid="c.824W.2/9" class="indent">We have provided figures from April 2007 to end of November 2007 in the table below. However, as Unit Costs are calculated at the end of each financial year we have used the Unit Cost figures from 2006-07, therefore these figures should be considered as indicative only. The cost has been calculated by multiplying the number of hours spent on Dispute Resolution in the year by the Unit Cost<sup>(1)</sup> (2006-07) for an hour of practitioner activity. Statistics do not currently fully capture all case related support activity and we plan a diary survey in the spring which will enable us to make more accurate calculations and calculate averages in respect of time taken on such work. Related activity in screening cases coming before the courts prior to embarking on Dispute Resolution is also not included in these figures but plays an important part in ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>

We did not receive a Gateway application from schools in Hendon to offer the new Diplomas from September 2008. We have, however, received an application from a consortium in Barnet aiming to offer the Creative and Media Diploma from September 2009. This consortium includes Copthall School from Hendon. The London Academy is also a partner in a joint application to offer the Construction and Built Environment Diploma from a group of North London boroughs. We plan to announce the results of this year's Gateway exercise by the end of March and financial assistance will depend upon whether these applications are successful.</p>
	<p pid="c.829W.0/2">Local authorities with pupils starting Diplomas in 2009 will receive funding for pupils taking Diplomas at Key Stage 4 through the Diploma grant and through the Dedicated Schools Grant. The Learning and Skills Council will provide funding for 16 to 18-year-olds taking Diplomas in sixth forms and colleges. Other support will also be provided to those who pass through the Gateway in March 2008 to ensure they are fully equipped to deliver from September 2009. This will include a comprehensive package of work force training and support, and a specific Gateway support grant to support Diploma and Functional Skills delivery.</p>

	<p pid="c.842W.17/1">Train operators will be properly compensated for the loss of, or disruption to, services during the construction and operation of Crossrail. The Secretary of State's policy is set out in Crossrail Information Paper H2, &quot;Railway Compensation&quot; (<a href="http://billdocuments.crossrail.co.uk">http://billdocuments.crossrail.co.uk</a>), and discussions are on-going with the rail industry to develop suitable arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.842W.17/2">The project cost estimate has taken into account that compensation will be payable to other train operators as a result of the Crossrail works, based on experience elsewhere on the national rail network. However, exactly what compensation might be payable to any given train operator will vary according to the detail of how the Crossrail works are carried out.</p>
	<p pid="c.842W.17/3">Once Crossrail services commence in 2017, they will be subject to the normal industry processes for compensation for disruption. It is not possible to estimate at this time what compensation might be payable between train operators and Network Rail.</p>

The detailed planning of these works, which Network Rail envisages undertaking, will be managed through the normal industry processes nearer to the start of construction. The Crossrail Environmental Statement (ES) contains an assessment of the expected disruption to services on the Great Western Main Line (<a href="http://billdocuments.crossrail.co.uk">http://billdocuments.crossrail.co.uk</a>; ES Volume 1, 2.5.19 and Volume 8a, 6.15-6.16).</p>

Since the Welsh services will continue to use the &quot;fast&quot; lines, no changes are proposed to services to Wales as a result of Crossrail during normal operations (ES, Volume 1, 2.4.9).</p>

	<p pid="c.855W.7/2"><i> </i>The proposed closed period for organic manures with high available nitrogen, as set out in the consultation on implementation of the Nitrates Directive in England, reflects long-standing advice contained in Fertiliser Recommendations for Agricultural and Horticultural Crops (RB209) and the Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water. These publications advise that organic manures should be applied in late winter or spring as these are times of maximum crop growth and will optimise the use of nitrogen contained in the manure. This is particularly important for slurry which has a high available nitrogen content.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.7/3">The Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Air advises farmers to avoid spreading at weekends and bank holidays to reduce odour problems but suggests that this practice may be acceptable if a band spreader or an injector is used or the slurry has been treated.

	<p pid="c.868W.5/1">No specific assessment has been made by my Department or the Environment Agency of the level of burning of domestic waste by households in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/2">Complaints about statutory smoke nuisance from domestic bonfires, or the burning of other materials, are made at the local authority level. Statistics are not held centrally by my Department. However, in 2006 DEFRA published a research project to review complaints received by local authorities about bonfire smoke, which advised on the legal and practical remedies available to local authorities and private individuals. It reported that a total of 29,147 complaints were made to local authorities in 2000; and that in a part year survey of 2004 involving 47 local authorities 5,424 complaints were made. The research report did not attempt to analyse the type of burning that was the subject of complaint.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/3">In addition, DEFRA carried out research into emissions of dioxins from the burning of domestic waste in 2006. The review recommended that further work should be done to establish what practical measures could be taken to reduce dioxin emissions from bonfires and domestic combustion and, consequently, exposure to dioxins. Further work in estimating dioxin emissions from domestic burning is currently being undertaken by my Department. Results from the on-going work will be due later this year.</p>

Two such centres have been visited to date and their response has been very positive. Further visits are planned in the coming months, after which detailed procedures will be drawn up to enable veterans to access these regional centres if they so wish.

	<p pid="c.874W.9/1" class="letterinlibrary">I will write to the hon. Member and place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.9/2" class="italic"> Substantive letter from Bob Ainsworth to Bernard Jenkin:</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.9/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question (174665) on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-17">17 December 2007</phrase>, (Official Report, column 1023W) about:</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.9/4" class="indent">&quot;the cost of providing legal representation for the families of servicemen and women killed on operations, the Department and for the Department at coroners' inquests in the last 12 months for which figures are available.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.9/5" class="indent">With respect to the funding for the families of Service personnel, the Legal Services Commission is responsible for legal aid. Legal aid is not usually available for representation at inquests because an inquest is a fact-finding process to determine who the deceased was and when, where and how he or she died. It is not adversarial. However, as a result of changes introduced by the Government (under the Access to Justice Act 1999) legal aid can now be granted in cases, such as inquests, where it is not normally available, but only where there are exceptional circumstances. There are published criteria that help determine whether a case is exceptional. Applications for exceptional funding must be made to the Legal Services Commission and where the Commission considers that the criteria have been met the application will be passed to the Ministry of Justice for consideration. Where conditions have been met, legal aid has been provided to service families.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.9/6" class="indent">For the majority of inquests, MOD does not have legal representation because they are non-adversarial, fact-finding proceedings. However, on some occasions the MOD, as an &quot;interested person&quot; may engage Counsel to assist the coroner in establishing the relevant facts surrounding the death, particularly in cases which are complex, often involving sensitive matters relating to national security. The presence of Counsel may make the proceedings appear more formal, but it does not change the fact-finding nature of an inquest. The MOD believes that the assistance we can provide to the coroner in these cases, and thus the proceedings more generally, is worthwhile and of benefit to everyone involved. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-14">14 December 2007</phrase>, the MOD has been billed for &pound;793,971.66 on legal representation at the inquests of Service personnel and Service related deaths (the majority of which will be for operational deaths).</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.9/7" class="indent">As mentioned above, legal aid for the families of Service personnel is ultimately the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice and it would therefore not be appropriate for the MOD to fund legal representation. Nonetheless, the MOD takes its responsibilities towards the families of deceased seriously. All casualties and deaths suffered by the UK Armed Forces are a source of profound regret. Nevertheless support to families is part of our debt to those who have given their lives, from the time when the tragic news must be conveyed to the next of kin, through to the potentially difficult experience of a Coroner's inquest and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.9/8" class="indent">The MOD has robust policies and procedures in place to ensure the best possible support is offered to all families. These procedures are continually under review to ensure they reflect the needs and expectations of all those concerned. Support is given to families through visiting officers who are drawn from members of the Services and who have received relevant training. Visiting officers are appointed to act as a liaison, through regular contact, between the bereaved family and the Services. They establish links with the various agencies to provide ongoing support, both financial and emotional, and help the bereaved family to adjust to life without their loved one. Specific financial help is available to the bereaved family to help meet the costs of the funeral, incidental funeral expenses, travel and accommodation and subsistence to attend the repatriation ceremony and the pre-inquest and inquest hearing.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.9/9" class="indent">I am placing a copy of this in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.877W.2/1">It is assumed that the question refers to our post-operational stress management policy. This applies to all the Armed Services, although each has its own individual processes that recognise its particular structure and culture. Operational deployments can be very stressful experiences, so wherever possible we look to offer individuals briefing prior to returning to their home base. Where possible a &quot;decompression period&quot; is arranged during which personnel can begin to unwind mentally and physically after their operational tour while having time to talk to colleagues and superiors with whom they have deployed about their experiences. Decompression can take place in a number of locations, for example in theatre while waiting for the return flight, or the Commander can arrange for it to take place in a third location (i.e. not home base and not theatre), such as Cyprus. For seagoing units, including embarked forces, decompression usually occurs as a matter of routine during the return passage to the UK which may include one or more operational standoffs or foreign port visits providing an opportunity for individuals to separate themselves, albeit briefly, from their working environment. Alternatively, Service personnel returning from operations can spend a period of time in their home base location to assist with the winding down period prior to progressing to Post Operational Tour leave. Access to specialised mental healthcare is available if required, both during the decompression period and back in the UK at MOD's regional Departments of Community Mental Health.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.2/2">The families of returning personnel are also offered presentations and issued with leaflets to alert them to the possible after-affects of an operational deployment. Welfare Officers, Padres, and other associated organisations (such as regimental and other support groups) also provide information and advice to families.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.2/3">Reservists are treated in a similar fashion where possible, with all having access to the Regular welfare support system or having support delivered through their parent unit. All Reserve units in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force have Welfare Officers, while in the Territorial Army the Regimental Operational Support Officer will perform Welfare duties. Their duties will include support to the families of mobilised reserves, including the provision of briefing and leaflets.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.2/4">Where mobilised Reservists are returning to regular civilian employment, support and advice is available to the civilian employer to help them understand the potential after-effects of an operational deployment on an individual.</p>

	<p pid="c.884W.2/2">Where responses to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act are judged to be of wider public interest, the Ministry of Defence publishes them through the Department's online Disclosure Log. In determining which responses are of wider public interest, the Ministry of Defence assesses whether responses meet one or more of the following criteria:</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.2/3" class="indent">response to a request received from parliamentarians, businesses and academics;</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.2/4" class="indent">response to a request received from the media;</p>

	<p pid="c.884W.2/6" class="indent">response to a repeated or common request; and</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.2/7" class="indent">response to a request that asks for a copy of a response to a previous request.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.2/8">These criteria are broadly in line with the &quot;Best Practice Guidance on Disclosure Logs&quot; issued by the then Department for Constitutional Affairs in 2005. However, these criteria are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive, and other responses are considered for publication if they are identified as potentially being of wider public interest.</p>

	<p pid="c.887W.9/1">His Royal Highness Prince William attended the Officers and Aircrew Selection Centre and a medical board prior to his attachment to the Royal Air Force and he met the standards required to be trained as a pilot. He will continue to be attached to the Royal Air Force once he has completed his flying training, gaining experience with several different units, to familiarise him further with the Royal Air Force, its structure, roles, history and ethos. No specific estimate has been made of the cost of his flying training but it is unlikely to exceed that of equivalent training undertaken by other trainees. After his time with the RAF, Prince William will be attached to the Royal Navy. As with the RAF, he will spend time gaining an understanding of the fullest spectrum of the Royal Navy's capabilities&mdash;from submarines to the ships of the surface fleet, including the Royal Marines and Fleet Air Arm.</p>

	<p pid="c.889W.0/1">Royal Air Force pilots continue to train throughout their careers and new entrants are not considered to have joined the trained strength until they have completed a course at an Operational Conversion Unit (OCU); on starting with an OCU, they incur an obligation to incur a minimum of six years further service following completion of their OCU tour. For the purposes of the information requested, the end of training has been defined as the point when a pilot moves to an OCU. At this point pilots have learnt to fly and are transferred to front-line aircraft types. The indicative cost to train a Royal Air Force pilot up to transfer to an Operational Conversion Unit is about &pound;3.1 million for Fast Jet, &pound;0.6 million for Multi-Engine and &pound;0.8 million for Rotary Wing aircraft. These costs are for financial year 2007-08 and cover flying training and related activities, for example, recruitment, ground training, aircraft maintenance and training on simulators. They are made up of both direct and indirect costs, and include an allowance for broader MOD overheads.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.0/2">For a career as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, potential recruits need to be aged between 17 and a half and 23 years of age and have been a British citizen since birth or hold dual British/other nationality. The qualifications required are five GCSEs/SCEs at Grade C/3 minimum (to include English Language and Maths) and two A-levels or three Highers or equivalent. During the application process the aptitude, health and fitness of applicants is tested to ensure that they are ready for a career in the RAF. All applicants have to attend the Officers and Aircrew Selection Centre (OASC) based at Royal Air Force College Cranwell.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.0/3">The details of the numbers who applied to enter the Royal Air Force as a trainee pilot and the number who progressed into service in each of the last three financial years (rounded to the nearest 10) are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.890W.2/6" class="indent">these omissions has been identified as unfamiliarity with the new JPA processes. I can confirm that the issue was not caused by any problem with the JPA Information Technology system.</p>

	<p pid="c.891W.5/2">In commercial UK ports, in addition to the ship's protection teams, bespoke advice is provided as to the security measures that are required. This is dependent on threat analysis and existing security measures in place within the port. It may include water-borne patrols, booms and jetty access control.</p>

While central collection of data began in 2005, concerns over quality, which we are currently addressing, mean that figures have yet to be published. However, information from the Crown Prosecution Service, made available to practitioners, shows that between <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November 2007</phrase>, almost 5,000 conditional cautions were issued.

Some of these can be clearly identified as relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract.

	<p pid="c.900W.14/4" class="indent">National population projections, based on a full review of all the underlying assumptions, are normally produced every two years. The most recent set is the 2006-based national projections published in October 2007. In the intervening year between these 'full' projections, special sets of 'interim' national projections may be produced. Two sets of interim projections (2001-based and 2003-based) have been produced in recent years.</p>

It will include recommendations on the powers and sanctions available to the regulator and courts in the legislation governing data sharing and data protection.

To inform its recommendations, the review panel will consult with:</p>

	<p pid="c.917W.6/2">Research on the potential health effects from mobile phone technology is evaluated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). The HPA's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation, in its comprehensive scientific review of Health Effects of Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields, concluded that</p>
	<p pid="c.917W.6/3" class="indent">&quot;exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.917W.6/4">Further information is available on the HPA's website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.917W.6/6">Responding to continuing concerns however, the independently managed Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme, jointly funded by Government and Industry, has supported a number of studies into the possible health effects of technology relating both to masts (base stations) and hand-held mobile phones. These studies, some in progress and some already published, are described on the MTHR website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>. None of the research published in its 2007 report so far demonstrates that biological or adverse health effects are produced by radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones or base stations.</p>

Broadly speaking, it will help deliver an increase in the environmental sustainability of waste management in London. To this end, it will manage the London Waste and Recycling Fund and may provide advice to such persons as it sees fit. It will also have to act in accordance with the Mayor's municipal waste management strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.927W.5/3">The details of the constitution and administration of the Board are currently being considered and an Order setting this out will be laid in the House as soon as possible. It is disappointing that the Mayor has announced his intention not to sit on the Board or contribute to the Fund. However, the Government will continue to seek ways of working together to ensure that the efforts of the Board and the Mayor to improve waste infrastructure in London are mutually reinforcing.</p>

	<p pid="c.929W.10/1">South-West Lancashire magistrates courts will be migrating to a new IT system (called Libra) on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May 2008</phrase>. This migration is part of a national roll-out programme to bring a new, improved and consistent IT package to all magistrates courts in the country. An integral element of the implementation will be the training of staff to operate the new system efficiently. To reduce the impact of staff absences, and keep disruption to court users to a minimum, staff training will take place on site at Chorley magistrates court.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.10/2">To facilitate this, one courtroom at Chorley magistrates court will be closed for six weeks. The work that would ordinarily be accommodated in this court will be allocated to neighbouring courthouses, namely Leyland and Ormskirk (primarily to Leyland). This arrangement will be monitored to ensure it is operating effectively, and to minimise any impact on court services.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.10/3">Timely roll-out of Libra is particularly important for the Lancashire magistrates courts, as their existing IT systems are coming to the end of their working life, and are becoming increasingly unreliable. Were the existing IT to fail, it is unlikely that the position could be recovered, and court data would be corrupted and or lost.</p>

	<p pid="c.932W.5/1">The NOMIS programme consists of:</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/2" class="indent">(a) A version of C-NOMIS to be provided to HM Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/3" class="indent">(b) 'Data Share' which will provide a new mechanism for the sharing of information between Prisons and Probation Areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/4" class="indent">(c) A redeveloped OASys system to provide a single offender risk assessment system across Prisons and Probation Areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/5" class="indent">(d) National Probation Service Case Management Systems, with Delius (a system already in use in some Probation Areas) being implemented in others where systems are in urgent need of replacement. Options to address a range of issues associated with CRAMS (the case management system currently in use in most probation areas) are also being considered.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/6">This response considers these, but does not cover legacy systems such as LIDS, existing OASys systems and the existing CRAMS, which are all outside the NOMIS Programme. Advisory and design expenditure around such legacy systems is understandably limited.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/7">The NOMIS programme has so far this financial year employed five firms for providing advice and 15 firms for providing design services. The numbers cover firms directly employed and exclude those engaged through a subcontracting route.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/8">The NOMIS programme is about the development and associated implementation of new systems and so most of the expenditure can be considered as relating to design activity, especially as a full implementation has not yet been commenced for any of its elements. The total amount expensed by the programme with firms providing just advisory services in the nine months to the end of December 2007 is estimated at &pound;0.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/9">The cost of each contract is commercially confidential and therefore this information is not provided.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.5/10">Until recently the focus of the NOM1S Programme has principally been on C-NOMIS and so nearly all the expenditure, and hence numbers of firms employed, are attributable to it. One firm providing limited design services to the redeveloped OASys is not though engaged on the C-NOMIS project. The other parts of the NOMIS Programme have also involved discussions with various potential parties but have not involved the employment of additional advisors or designers.</p>

	<p pid="c.934W.2/76" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Bonus structure. SCS bonuses are allocated by the Departmental Pay Committee in accordance with guidelines issued by Cabinet Office each year following the Senior Salaries Review Body recommendations. Within the former Department for Constitutional Affairs, the Office for Criminal Justice Reform and the National Offender Management Service Performance Bonus is paid to staff who achieve the top performance marking over the appraisal year. The level of bonus payments vary by grade and business unit. There is no defined bonus structure for staff other than senior civil servants in the Prison Service. In addition, the Ministry of Justice' staff have access to a range of in-year bonuses awarded locally under various Recognition and reward schemes. These awards include small gifts or vouchers, small bonuses of up to &pound;100 and special bonuses of &pound;100 or more. Special bonuses provide recognition for outstanding achievements by staff for working on demanding tasks or situations.</p>

	<p pid="c.947W.0/1">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme pays compensation to blameless victims of violent crime within Great Britain. Compensation is based on the criminal injury sustained not on the criminal act which caused the injury. Victims of trafficking do not therefore receive compensation under the scheme for the fact of being trafficked, but only if they were victims of a violent crime in Great Britain. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) does not record centrally how many award recipients were also victims of trafficking, since that information is not necessary for the purpose of determining claims. CICA are accordingly unable to supply the information requested.</p>

	<p pid="c.947W.3/1">In January 2007 the Office for Criminal Justice Reform (OCJR), in conjunction with Criminal Justice Agencies, published a revised National Agreement on Arrangements for the Use of Interpreters, Translators and Language Service Professionals in Investigations and Proceedings within the Criminal Justice System to help ensure that only suitably qualified interpreters and translators are used in criminal proceedings. Sign language and lip speakers fall in the category of interpreters known in the profession as LSPs (Language Service Professionals). In addition, a Good Practice Guide for HMCS staff on the use of interpreters in the criminal courts has been produced to supplement the new National Agreement. I have placed a copy of the National Agreement and the Good Practice Guide for HMCS staff in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.951W.0/1">The Prison Service is committed to making savings by more efficient management of energy and water. This is achieved through local and central initiatives, management information, training, awareness campaigns, and advice.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.0/2">To ensure the Prison Service is capable of delivering its obligations in respect of energy efficiency, the Energy Efficiency Project Board (EEPB) monitors implementation of an annual work programme. The EEPB reports to the Sustainable Development Working Group, provides quarterly progress reports to the Prison Service Management Board and publishes an annual report.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.0/3">Prisons calculate and report energy and water consumption monthly. The Prison Service aims to develop a comprehensive, automated reporting, monitoring and targeting system to improve management information. These initiatives will give prisons a greater incentive to achieve their targets. However, 68 establishments passed the carbon dioxide target, 58 establishments passed their water target and 31 passed both in the year ending March 2007. Individual prison performance is detailed in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.958W.2/32">It is not possible to show the circumstances of the original fine without disproportionate cost as the information is not held centrally and it would entail examination of every individual record. Therefore the proportion of these that were for the offences of loitering and soliciting is unknown. At the end of October 2007, the last date for which figures are available, there were eight females held in custody in England and Wales as fine defaulters.</p>

These include the costs of corporate security, in-house security arrangements and, at those sites where there is a regulatory requirement for a dedicated, on-site armed response provided by the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), the cost of providing and maintaining this dedicated policing resource.

Between March 2005 and March 2007, CNC Support Units comprising authorised firearms officers were recruited, trained and deployed to the nine nuclear generating sites to augment the in-house, unarmed civilian security staff. The costs of this deployment (including start-up costs) and the charges raised since March 2007 are &pound;30.l million. These were met by British Energy and Magnox Electric, the operators of the sites.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-01-14c.175689.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-01-14c.980W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" colnum="980W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080114/text/80114w0035.htm#08011543004642">
	<p pid="c.980W.2/1">There are a number of fiscal incentives to encourage renewable generation: renewable generators are exempt from the climate change levy; microgenerators are exempt from income tax on any renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) which they sell and electricity which they export; there is a reduced rate of VAT on microgeneration technologies; and homes meeting the zero carbon criteria are exempt from stamp duty up to &pound;500,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.2/2">In addition to these, the renewables obligation is the Government's key mechanism for encouraging new renewable generating capacity. The RO is a market-based mechanism, which requires electricity suppliers to source an increasing percentage of their electricity sales from eligible sources of renewable energy. Suppliers can meet their obligation by presenting renewables obligation certificates (ROCs) as evidence of renewable generation, by paying a penalty (the 'buyout' price), or a combination of the two. The price of a ROC is subject to the market and is affected by various other factors. The buyout price, which rises in line with inflation each year, caps the costs of the system to suppliers and thus ultimately electricity consumers. Generators of all sizes can claim ROCs for each megawatt of electricity they produce.</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.2/3">We recognise that additional help is needed to encourage small-scale renewable generation, and have a number of beneficial measures in place to provide support. For those wishing to install microgeneration technologies, we provide grants under the low carbon buildings programme, to contribute to the costs of installation.</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.2/4">We are taking steps to ensure that excess electricity generated by small operators can be sold to the grid for adequate reward; an important incentive for microgenerators. The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act gives powers to the Secretary of State to require that energy suppliers offer a tariff to their own customers for exported electricity from microgeneration units. We are working closely with the energy suppliers to encourage voluntary action, and all major suppliers are now committed to offering some form of export tariff. Some smaller companies too, like Good Energy, offer a rate for all renewable energy generated &mdash;9p/kWh&mdash;regardless of whether it is used on site or not. We will keep under review the need to exercise the power to require action.</p>
	<p pid="c.980W.2/5">We are committed to ensuring that generators are aware of the benefits that are available to them, and can access them readily. Ofgem are currently examining the prices paid to green homes when they sell electricity back to the grid. In considering this they will also be looking at how easy it is for green homes to access this information and determine the value of the excess electricity that they sell. We will consider the outcomes of this work and the need for further action. In other areas, a number of steps have been taken to make it easier for smaller generators to access ROCs and we have recently published a joint BERR/Ofgem consultation on a range of initial proposals to make it easier for smaller distributed generators to interact with the wider electricity system and realise the value of the electricity that they generate.</p>

During the years that these records have been collected from the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  HES, The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

However, Figure 17 in the Cancer Reform Strategy sets out the estimated cost per head of NICE-approved cancer drugs used in hospitals between January-June 2005. This chart was based on data from the National Cancer Director's 2006 report plus estimates of drug prices. The chart is anonymised because the data on which it is based has many limitations and the error range is large. It provides a useful indication of the likely spread of spend across the country but is not deemed accurate enough to provide a fair comparison between named networks.</p>
	<p pid="c.993W.3/10">Progress has been made in reducing variation in usage of cancer drugs across the country but there is scope for further reductions. The National Cancer Director recommended in his 2006 report repeating his evaluation of cancer drug usage periodically to ensure that the level of variation is reduced as much as possible. The Cancer Reform Strategy confirmed that the next evaluation will take place during 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1003W.5/2">During the local delivery planning exercise last summer, strategic health authorities raised the need for flexibility to change their target envelopes for community matrons in situations where they could provide compelling evidence that there was a local need to do this.

Food alerts, in particular, are the FSA's formal method of communication with local authorities, who have responsibility for enforcing food law, on food safety issues that are of particular relevance to them. In determining the need for a food alert the agency takes into account the food safety requirements as specified in Regulation (EC) 178/2002 Article 14 of General Food Law, information already placed in the public domain, for example by a food business operator: and the need to provide relevant additional information to local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.1017W.2/4">In line with the agency's policy of openness these alerts are also published on the agency's website bringing them to the attention of other stakeholders. This information can be accessed on the FSA's website at:</p>

These incentives include identifying people who smoke, or who are obese, or who have high blood pressure, as these are all key risk factors for serious diseases such as coronary vascular disease, strokes, diabetes and a number of cancers. Identifying people with these risk factors facilitates the earliest possible opportunity of diagnosis.</p>

While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes (FAE)</i><br/> A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider.

During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data.

	<p pid="c.1022W.2/1">In primary care, users of stoma and incontinence appliances listed in part IX of the Drug Tariff are prescribed these appliances whether they live in their own home or a care home. The Department's policy on maintenance and improvement is set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.2/2" class="italic"> Supply systems</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.2/3">In primary care, stoma and incontinence appliances which have been prescribed on a FP10 are dispensed by a dispensing pharmacist, dispensing appliance contractor or dispensing doctor. As a related service, patients may also receive home delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.2/4">However, the Department has consulted on new arrangements for the provision of those appliances and related services in primary care in England. A key objective is that patients should receive the same standard of care no matter where they live. Consequently, one of the proposals is that dispensing appliance contractors and dispensing pharmacists shall, in the normal course of their business, provide a home or care home delivery service in respect of these appliances if the patient desires it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.2/5" class="italic"> Quality of stoma and incontinence products</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.2/6">Manufacturers apply directly to the prescription pricing division (PPD) of the NHS Business Services Authority Manufacturers to have these products approved for listing on part IX of the Drugs Tariff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.2/7">In assessing whether the product is appropriate for prescribing in primary care, the PPD may require applicants to provide clinical data to demonstrate that the product delivers clinical benefits, and any products required to carry a CE marking must do so. Providing these conditions are met, the PPD also requires that products are safe and of good quality and that they are cost-effective.</p>
	<p pid="c.1022W.2/8">In relatively rare cases, the PPD may seek independent advice bearing on these issues although responsibility for the eventual decision will remain with the PPD and the evidence required will depend on the individual application. The need for evidence is likely to be greater if similar products have not been listed before.

This was subsequently wrongly described in media reports as a leaked document. However, no such formal review has taken place and the reference was in respect of a general question asked by some suppliers as to whether patient data in respect of the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) could be held abroad. It was subsequently confirmed to all suppliers that there was no change to the policy that NPfIT patient data should not be held or processed overseas.

	<p pid="c.1025W.5/1">Requests made by patients under the provisions of section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 must be considered on a case by case basis. For section 10 to apply, the data in question must be personal identifiable data and processing must not be subject to a legal requirement or other exception set out in the Act. Patient contact details held as part of the National Health Service Care Records Service (NHS CRS) are subject to legal requirements so are exempt from the section 10 provisions. Clinical information held nationally is not exempt from the section 10 provisions, but this information can only be accessed by NHS CRS users directly involved in the patient's care.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/2">Information is added to the national system in a number of different ways, some by deliberate clinical decision and some by automated processes. In some cases local organisations able and willing to accede to a request under section 10 may be able to withhold information from record systems. In other cases the record is created as a consequence of the treatment or action that takes place, for example the creation of an x-ray image in the new digital picture recording systems, and a section 10 request could only be considered after the event. In the case of the summary care record, which is fed by both clinical decision and automated processes, patients may elect not to have a summary care record or to impose access controls upon it so that information is only shared either with their consent, when anonymised, or where required by law.</p>

A very small number report a temporary suspension of the service. We are working with the patient support organisation Infertility Network UK to help PCTs share best practice in the provision of fertility services and move to the implementation of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommendations.

	<p pid="c.1028W.0/1">The Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) continually oversees the development of the weighted capitation formula. ACRA's current work programme includes a review of the market forces factor (MFF). The review of the MFF will also inform the MFF adjustments made to providers of national health service services paid for through the national tariff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1028W.0/2">Although ACRA has made good progress on some major aspects of its work programme, it has requested, and been granted, additional time to finalise the work that it is doing to review the formula. Given the importance of the weighted capitation formula it is crucial that ACRA has the time required to produce a robust and transparent formula.</p>
	<p pid="c.1028W.0/3">Only when this work programme is completed will ACRA finalise its recommendations to Ministers on potential changes to the funding formula. Ministers will then look at all of ACRA's recommendations and decide how to take these recommendations into account when making allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) for 2009-10 and 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.1028W.0/4">We will inform providers and PCTs of the changes to the formula, and the revenue allocations as soon as is practically possible after the completion of ACRA's work programme. The aim is to announce revenue allocations to PCTs for 2009-10 and 2010-11 by the summer 2008. The MFF indices applied to providers of NHS services paid for by the national tariff were published on the Department's website on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase> as part of the national tariff package for 2008-09, and are available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1028W.3/1">There has been no renegotiation of primary supplier contracts let by national health service Connecting for Health under the national programme for information technology, and no changes to their terms and conditions. There have, however, been 'resets' of the contracts. Reset is a normal, repeatable, process, for contracts with a long lifetime to ensure that their ongoing delivery reflects progress to date, current priorities, and deployment plans for the future, and that they continue to support the evolving needs of the NHS. However, reset allows for the option of agreeing enhancements to existing services or functionality that does not effect a change in contract scope or risk allocation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1028W.3/2">In the course of the reset of the BT contract for London, new requirements and additional services were identified by the NHS, for which a separate business case and funding of &pound;55 million&mdash;&pound;41.8 million capital and &pound;13.2 million revenue&mdash;over the lifetime of the contract was subsequently approved. This does not represent an increase in the original cost of the contract for the original specification, but reflects new requirements for additional functionality.</p>

	<p pid="c.1030W.2/3">The remainder of the available funding is allocated according to the social care relative needs formulae. These are mathematical formulae designed to allocate funding for relevant services between LAs according to the needs of each LA relative to other LAs. They are a rigorously developed and accepted method of allocating funds to LAs (and are recognised by key organisations such as the Local Government Association). There are separate formulae for older people, younger adults and children. The formulae take into account the population in the LA area and other key factors. The older people's formula consists of a basic amount per person aged 65 and over and top-ups for age, deprivation, sparsity, low income from fees and charges, and area costs. The younger adult's formula consists of a basic amount per person aged 18-64 and top-ups for deprivation and area costs. The children's formula consists of a basic amount per child aged 0-17 and top-ups for deprivation, foster costs and area costs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1033W.5/1">Varenicline (Champix) was first launched in the United Kingdom in December 2006 as a stop-smoking aid for adults. Since that time its safety has been monitored closely by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in conjunction with the European Medicines Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.1033W.5/2">To date over 1,400 reports of suspected adverse reactions have been received via the yellow card scheme in the UK. The reactions most commonly reported through the yellow card scheme are recognised side effects and are listed in the product information. The most commonly reported side effects are nausea, depression/depressed mood, headache, vomiting, and dizziness. It is important to note that the suspected reactions are not necessarily caused by the drug and may relate to other factors such as nicotine withdrawal, other illnesses or other medicines taken concurrently.</p>
	<p pid="c.1033W.5/3">Recently concerns have arisen about reports of depression including suicidal thoughts and behaviour reported in association with the use of varenicline. These data have prompted a Europe wide review of this issue and careful consideration of the available data. Following the most recent consideration the varenicline product information for doctors and the Patient Information Leaflet is being updated to contain warnings that depression has been reported in patients who are trying to stop smoking using varenicline and that the symptoms of this depression may include suicidal thoughts and behaviour. In December 2007, information was posted on the MHRA website regarding this issue. Suicidal behaviour associated with the use of varenicline remains under close review in the UK and within Europe.</p>

	<p pid="c.1051W.2/2">Since 1997, Ireland has maintained an immigration control on non-CTA nationals arriving directly from the UK by air and sea. British and Irish passengers are only required to show an acceptable form of photo-identification to prove their nationality and exempt them from immigration control. Irish Garda National Immigration Bureau work collaboratively with UK border agencies and run regular intelligence-led operations to counter immigration risks to the intra CTA borders. These joint operations have successfully prevented non-CTA nationals attempting to cross the boundary illegally in both directions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1068W.0/2">Where the error is significant, in that the resultant change would qualify or contradict the conclusions that would previously have been drawn from the data, the protocols would require that Home Office would amend the electronic version of the release as soon as possible and include a prominent alert on the website to notify users of the change.</p>
	<p pid="c.1068W.0/3">On only one occasion since 1997 has a significant error occurred to police numbers statistics. The statistical bulletin on Police Service Strength in England and Wales for <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-30">30 September 2000</phrase> was re-printed after one large police force notified the Home Office of large corrections to its officer numbers. This was enough to affect the direction of the national trend. At the time, the bulletin was not produced electronically, but the correction was highlighted on the front page and a re-printed version issued to all subscribers, including the media.</p>

	<p pid="c.1078W.8/1">Changes in rules of origin for those countries which have signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) will primarily benefit those with textile, clothing and fisheries industries where there have been significant relaxations. These industries will now be able to sell more of their products to the EU under the preferential arrangements, where before they would have been excluded. Further changes to rules of origin for the EPA countries are possible as it is open to these countries to request areas for further relaxation. The form that these changes will take will depend on the negotiations which take place in the coming year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1079W.5/1">In 2007-08 DFID provided 5&pound;0 million in aid to Kenya. The UK's aid programme in Kenya is directed largely at supporting health, education and social protection for poor Kenyans, and at improving governance in the country; any suspension of the programme would inevitably have a direct and immediate negative impact on the poorest people. It is too early to make decisions about any long-term impact on our aid programme, but we are keeping the programme under review to make sure that it continues to best meet the needs of the poorest Kenyans.</p>
