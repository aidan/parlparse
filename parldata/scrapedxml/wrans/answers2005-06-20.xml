MOD policy also complies with Part III of the DDA where it considered itself to be a service provider, and reasonable adjustments have been made where it was considered necessary in relation to the physical features of MOD occupied premises to overcome physical barriers to access by members of the public.</p>

	<p pid=".665W.6/1">It is the Ministry of Defence's intention to seek both an in-house option and bids from contractors for the delivery of key support functions under Project Pegasus. Unfortunately, until the Trade Unions return to the Whitley process, we will be unable to pursue the in-house option.</p>
	<p pid=".665W.6/2">However, we do not judge an in-house option feasible to deliver estate services efficiently. There is no in-house expertise in key areas including the provision of trained and experienced personnel to implement mandated safe systems of work; tendering and letting works contracts; and the management and control of directly employed labour to carry out maintenance tasks. An in-house option could neither achieve the economies of scale that could be offered by industry, nor the transfer of large elements of risk (both financial and health and safety) from the Department. It would not therefore deliver the required savings or achieve full value for money for the tax payer.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.8/1">The Government have made available an additional &pound;25 million over the three financial years from 2003&ndash;06 to tackle illegal imports from outside the European Union of any meat, other animal products and plant products. The majority of this funding is for additional resources to be deployed by Customs to detect illegal imports at the frontier. The current level of funding has been included in Customs' allocation for future years. Funding will also continue to be available for Defra to examine the risks and help increase public awareness, and for the FSA for work on inland controls.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.8/2">Overall, the money for the illegal imports programme needs to be looked at in the context of the whole control regime including the legal trade. Funding has to be proportionate to risk. Our controls compare well with other EU member states.</p>

	<p pid=".670W.2/1">The Government have made available an additional &pound;25 million over the three financial years from 2003&ndash;06 to tackle illegal imports from outside the European Union of meat (including bush meat), other animal products, and plant products. Customs are responsible for anti-smuggling controls at the border. In addition to their 3,500 detection staff, they also have dedicated extra resources (c 100 officers and a 10 'meat' detector dog programme) targeting higher risk import routes.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/2">This has resulted in a considerable increase in seizures in 2003&ndash;04 to 15,838. There was a further significant increase in 2004&ndash;05&mdash;final figures will be published in DEFRA's annual review in July. However bush meat forms only a very small part (approx 3 per cent.) of Customs seizures of POAO.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/3">The National Audit Office recently published (<phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase>) a report recognising the good work of Customs in detecting illegal imports, and that our controls compare well to those of other EU member states. I am also pleased that there have been eight successful prosecutions, the most recent in June resulting in a custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/4">Customs will continue to be vigorous in tackling illegal imports, including the use of new technology such as over-the-belt X-ray scanners at selected major airports to assist in its operations.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.2/5">We recognise that the risk of disease can never be reduced to zero, but a number of measures that the Government have taken to improve prevention, detection, and domestic biosecurity, has we believe, reduced the risk.</p>

	<p pid=".670W.5/1">The cost to local authorities of meeting the Landfill Directive targets for the reduction of biodegradable municipal waste to landfill through the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme was considered in the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Landfill Allowance and Trading Scheme (England) Regulations 2004. The aim of the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme is to enable local authorities to meet these targets in the most cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.5/2">In terms of administrative costs, there will be no significant additional burden on waste disposal authorities as a result of implementing the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme. Authorities are now required to submit monitoring information quarterly rather than annually but Waste Dataflow enables them to do this electronically. They will also need to register any transfer of allowances on an electronic register. Neither are considered onerous tasks.</p>

However, given the large increases in the amounts of recyclates targeted for collection, we have tasked the Waste and Resources Action Programme to develop markets for recycled materials and products. Six core materials streams have been identified as priorities for market development purposes, four of which (glass, organics, paper and plastics) arise both in the household and the commercial waste streams. WRAP is targeting the creation of an additional 4,225,000 tonnes of market capacity per year for these six materials in the course of their 2004&ndash;06 business plan.</p>

It is our view that primates are not suitable for the general pet trade and permits are therefore limited to zoos, scientific institutions, or specialised private keepers.

	<p pid=".679W.3/2">Crossrail is currently the subject of a hybrid Bill before Parliament and the timing of its construction and operation is therefore dependent on the outcome of that process. The tender documentation notes that, in the event that Crossrail is authorised by Parliament and proceeds, the impact of its construction will be dealt with under the Network Change provisions of the Track Access Agreement. Furthermore, bidders have been advised to assume that Crossrail services will not operate during the term of the Greater Western franchise.</p>

Extensive research has shown that road pavement damage is strongly influenced by axle loadings, which have not increased since that time; for an individual axle mass of 10.5 tonne, there is approximately 40 per cent. less road wear than for an axle mass of 11.5 tonnes. Thus 44 tonnes gross weight vehicles as are now permitted to operate on UK roads and mainly fitted with six axles, each with a limit of 10.5 tonnes, cause less road wear than 40 tonne vehicles operating with five axles each with an 11.5 tonne limit.</p>

	<p pid=".688W.3/1">The Government continues to seek a successful World Trade Organisation ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005. Multilateral liberalisation that reduces tariff barriers among all countries will lead to the greatest gains for poor developing countries, including within Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.3/2">Reducing trade barriers in Africa requires national governments to place a strong emphasis on trade as a source of growth. DFID supports the inter-agency Integrated Framework (IF). This helps countries to develop trade policies and the capacity to implement them as a part of wider poverty reduction plans. Countries where DFID will continue to play a leading role in the IF include Lesotho, Zambia, Rwanda, and Malawi.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.3/3">DFID supports several trade policy capacity building projects, including in Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Ghana, and Nigeria. These assist Governments to develop trade policy, link this to poverty reduction and identify and negotiate their strategic interests in international trade negotiations. Any reduction in trade barriers within Africa must build on African countries' own regional integration efforts and development objectives and promote the development of supply side capacity to take advantage of market access opportunities.

	<p pid=".689W.2/1">Timing on a donors' conference has not as yet been confirmed. In order to ensure that the Government of Angola takes the necessary steps towards a successful conference, Donors have made clear to the Government of Angola, their view that the Government should have in place both an agreed programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and an effective poverty reduction strategy. There have been a number of discussions between the Government of Angola and the IMF on the framework for a staff monitored programme, focusing largely on issues of financial transparency and public accountability. I understand that an Angolan mission will be visiting Washington soon for further discussions on this, which we hope will achieve agreement. On the issue of the poverty reduction strategy, DFID has offered support to the Government to improve the present draft, working with civil society and other donors.</p>

	<p pid=".692W.5/1">As in all the tsunami-affected countries, in Sri Lanka, the unprecedented scale of the disaster put considerable pressure on logistics and co-ordination mechanisms. DFID gave direct support to overcome these challenges, including the secondment of an air operations co-ordinator, two shelter advisers, an adviser to the United Nations Humanitarian Information Centre and a member of the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination team.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.5/2">During the relief and recovery phase, DFID has supported the humanitarian work of Help Age, World Vision, Save the Children Fund, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Sri Lankan Red Cross, the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food Programme and the United Nations Security Co-ordinator in the areas under LTTE control in the North and East of the island. The United Nations has commented that the relief effort in Tamil areas has been impressive. Our humanitarian advisers in-country are monitoring the international response and are confident that aid is getting to those in need.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.5/3">On my recent visit to the east and south of Sri Lanka, I met with many families affected by the tsunami disaster and numerous national and international non-governmental organisations, United Nations and government officials working to support them.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.5/4">The Sri Lankan Government's response to the relief needs have been effective and spread evenly throughout the country. However due to the geography of many affected areas government officials have struggled to identify and acquire sufficient and appropriate land to relocate houses, schools, hospitals from the Government imposed exclusion zone. To tackle this issue the Sri Lankan Government are reconsidering the decision to exclude reconstruction in a 100 to 200 m buffer zone and attempting to fast track the acquisition of land. However more needs to be done to allow the numerous donors to start reconstruction. The sheer amount of work required to obtain land has delayed the implementation of reconstruction.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.5/5">Despite this, much work has been done with the construction of over 32,000 transitional shelters; 5,000 permanent houses under construction and a further 15,000 families receiving cash grants for self help reconstruction.

The presidency is due to be inaugurated, on time, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-09">9 July</phrase>, but the formation of the Government of National Unity will be delayed by up to one month, to allow the presidency to conclude discussions on the new Government.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.2/2">During my recent visit to Sudan, I pressed the parties urgently to implement the agreement, and will continue to do so. Implementation is a huge task, and our assessment is that delays are due in large part to a lack of capacity of the parties to implement the agreement. This underlines the need for international support, which DFID is are already providing, and have made clear our willingness to do more. Through the embassy in Khartoum and the (expanded) joint DFID/FCO Sudan unit in London, we will continue to monitor implementation of the CPA and work to support the parties in achieving this. We are also urging others to do more.</p>

This places great importance on economic growth, which has averaged 5.4 per cent. (2.7 per cent. per capita) since 2000, as a means of reducing poverty. Last year DFID allocated &pound;65 million directly to Government budgets to support the National Strategy and also to directly support a Tax Modernisation Programme (TMP) and Business Environment Strengthening Programme (BEST), both of which aim to improve the environment for stronger private sector-led growth. In addition, DFID is funding The Financial Sector Deepening programme which improves the access of small and micro-businesses to financial services.</p>

	<p pid=".695W.8/1">The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) human poverty index (HPI) is an internationally recognised measure of poverty.

The HPI is considered a useful measure of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.8/2">The HPI is not directly taken into account in the allocation of UK aid to Africa. The allocation model used takes account of gross national income per capita, progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and vulnerability to economic shock. However, as the HPI measures deprivation, there are of course indirect links between it and these factors. Factors that will affect the impact of aid, such as governance, are also taken into account when making country allocations.</p>

	<p pid=".700W.2/1">The experience of the last five years of the HIPC Initiative has shown that debt relief can be an extremely effective tool in support of poverty-alleviation. The debt burden of the world's poorest countries is being reduced by some US$70 billion dollars overtime, allowing the savings from debt relief to fund country-owned strategies aimed at reducing poverty. Poverty reducing expenditures in HIPCs have on average increased from 6.4 per cent. of GDP in 1999 to 7.9 per cent. of GDP in 2003, a level about three times that spent on debt service. These increases in expenditure are increasingly being reflected in improved outcomes in HIPCs themselves.</p>

	<p pid=".702W.5/1">Race awareness is integral to Treasury's diversity training, which is mainstreamed into the management and employment learning and development for senior managers and all staff. The Treasury has held events on race to address learning needs and to role model the need to promote equality across all diversity strands. In 2003 presentations were given to all Treasury directorates on the duty to promote race equality. In 2004 a seminar 'Raising our Sights on Race' was conducted with the Treasury's Ethnic Minority Advisory Group to raise awareness with representatives across all directorates of duties under the Act and the experience of ethnic minority staff in the Department.</p>

The Treasury has, however, recently introduced a computerised learning management system which will automatically capture data on the ethnicity and grade profiles of staff who receive training in the future. This data will be made available annually on the race equality section of the Treasury's website from spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.2/1">In the mid to late 1990s, the UK suffered higher child poverty than nearly all other industrialised nations. Over the previous 20 years, the proportion of children in relative low-income households had more than doubled. As our first step towards eradicating this problem, we set an aim to reduce the number of children living in relative low-income households by a quarter by 2004&ndash;05. The data for this period will be released in 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.2/2">The PSA target set in the 2004 Spending Review is to halve the number of children in relative low-income households between 1998&ndash;99 and 2010&ndash;11, on the way to eradicating child poverty in 2020. As part of this, the Government will set an additional target in the 2006 Spending Review to halve by 2010 the numbers of children suffering a combination of material deprivation and relative low income.</p>

	<p pid=".710W.5/1">We are currently testing the effectiveness of the &pound;40 per week In-Work Credit in a range of areas across the country and, from October 2005, in a further six areas across the south-east.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.5/2">The aim of the pilot is to gather evidence about the proportion of lone parents taking up the Credit and the Work Search Premium, and the impact in terms of supporting more lone parents to move off benefit and into work. There is strong evidence, from the evaluation of New Deal for Lone Parents, that nearly all lone parents would be more positive about considering work if the gains were over &pound;40 per week.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.5/3">The Leeds pilot began in October 2004 and preliminary analysis of administrative data shows that in the four months to January 2005, 280 payments to lone parents had been recorded.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.5/4">It is too early in the life of the pilot to make an assessment. DWP has commissioned a wide ranging programme of evaluation, using independent experts to carefully assess the pilots overall. The evaluation programme includes both an impact assessment and qualitative research. The findings from the qualitative research are due to be published in autumn 2007. The first impact assessment report that will assess the pilots that started in October 2004 is due to be published in spring 2007.</p>

	<p pid=".713W.5/39">1. Sure Start Maternity Grants were introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-27">27 March 2000</phrase>. The change from Maternity Payments was phased in gradually, with Sure Start Maternity Grants being available to claimants whose babies were expected, born, adopted or the subject of a parental order on or after <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-11">11 June 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/40">2. Data by Government office region (GOR) are not available for 2002&ndash;03 or 2003&ndash;04. Prior to 2002&ndash;03 a different district structure was in use.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/41">3. Sure Start Maternity Grant awards are recorded in the GOR where they are administered. In 2004&ndash;05, a small area of the East Midlands GOR was administered for social fund purposes from a district within the North West GOR.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/42">4. For a multiple birth, only one Sure Start Maternity Grant is awarded (with a payment being made for each baby). In the general population, the number of maternities resulting in twins is about 15 per 1,000 maternities (and triplets and higher order multiple births can be ignored). The number of babies for whom a Sure Start Maternity Grant was paid was estimated using this figure.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/43">5. A claim for a Sure Start Maternity Grant can be made from the 29th week of pregnancy and up to three months after the baby is born. A grant paid in one year can therefore be for a birth in a different year.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/44">6. The approximate percentage of births in a year for which a grant was paid is calculated as 100 x (the number of babies for whom a grant was paid in that year)/(the number of births in that year).</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/45">7. Numbers of awards are rounded to the nearest 100, expenditure to the nearest &pound;0.1 million and the approximate percentage of births for which a grant was paid to the nearest whole number.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/46">8. For 2004&ndash;05, the sum of the number of awards by GOR differs slightly from that for Great Britain due to rounding.</p>

	<p pid=".725W.8/1">The Sure Start, Extended Schools and Families Group in the Department has the responsibility for delivering the Every Child Matters Change for Children Programme in relation to children in their early years. The aim is to create a joined-up system of health, family support, child care and education services so that every child gets the best start in life. The planned development of 3,500 Sure Start children's centres by 2010 will be a key part of this, enabling early identification of potential problems for the child and providing families with appropriate support they need.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.8/2">Research evidence, such as the Department's Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) study, shows a link between social deprivation and the risk of poor social and behavioural development in the early years. It is also known from research that quality pre-school education and child care, and the importance of the home environment have a positive effect on children's social and emotional development in the early years and into primary school.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.8/3">To respond to this research we are funding a number of programmes to raise the quality of early years education. All providers of Government funded early education for children aged three to five are required to provide the Foundation Stage part of the National Curriculum. Personal, social and emotional development is a key area of learning and children are supported to understand what is right, what is wrong and why; and to consider the consequences of their words and actions for themselves and others. The Foundation Stage guidance indicates that practitioners should involve children in agreeing codes of behaviour and taking responsibility for their implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.8/4">The Department has appointed the Institute of Psychology, King's College London to develop a training programme to support practitioners on young children's personal social and emotional development to support the Birth to Three Matters and Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage documents. The materials will help providers support children develop respect for others, social competence and a positive disposition to learn.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.8/5">The Department's Parental Community Support Project aims to support parents in supporting their children's early learning and development&mdash;improving educational, health, social and emotional outcomes for children in 500 communities. The project will identify and disseminate existing effective practice in engaging with parents, creating effective intervention models to increase parents' engagement with their children's early learning, and creating effective links between local settings and parents. A key part of the project will be to train front line staff working with children and parents.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.8/6">In recognition of the importance of young children starting to develop good social skills in their earliest years of life the Department has a PSA target to improve children's communication, social and emotional development and to reduce inequalities between the level of development achieved by children in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas and the rest of England.</p>

	<p pid=".726W.2/1">The formal evaluation of On Track is still in progress with the final report due in December 2006. This report will look at the effectiveness of On Track and provide evidence about how it has contributed to delivering the Every Child Matters outcomes. It will also explore how On Track is positioned as part of the Children's Fund and within the broader preventative agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".726W.2/2">Evidence from Phase 1 of the evaluation suggests that On Track has been effective in tackling a range of known individual, family and school based risk factors for children and young people linked to later involvement in crime. The programme has had a positive impact on both children and adults especially in improving their confidence and self-esteem. Children are more resilient, and more likely to be in positive peer groups; families exhibit greater stability and more affectionate relationships. This has led to reductions in school absences, temporary exclusions and nuisance behaviour among the children and young people involved in the On Track programme.</p>

	<p pid=".727W.5/1">For the first time in history, the 2004 GCSE results for state schools in London overtook the national average. We know that the single most important factor in the control of the education service in changing how well children do is the quality of the teaching that they experience. The quality of school leadership is the most important factor in determining how well a school is able to promote effective teaching. And the quality of local support for school improvement is the biggest external influence on the effective leadership and management of schools.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.5/2">A range of factors are therefore significant. First, the focused attention of teachers, heads and LEAs on improving the quality of teaching and learning has been critical. Second, Ofsted identifies this generation of teachers as the best ever and strong improvements in teacher supply have been disproportionately beneficial in London, since times of shortage affect London most. There are now 63,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers in London, compared to 58,300 in 2001. Third, the quality of leadership in London's schools is now identified by Ofsted as being better than the national average. Fourth, local education authorities play a crucial role in supporting school improvement, and we have seen their capacity to do so improve over the past five years. In 2004 20 London authorities were rated 'excellent' or 'good' in the comprehensive performance assessment (compared to 13 in 2002) and no authorities were rated 'poor' (compared to 4 in 2002).</p>
	<p pid=".727W.5/3">National programmes have contributed to supporting this improvement. Excellence in Cities has provided focused support and very significant resources in London, as in other urban areas across the country. Intervention in those local education authorities which were failing has contributed to bringing in to those authorities the people and resources which have enabled them to be effective.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.5/4">The London Challenge, which began in 2002, has sought to focus national programmes and get behind the efforts of all those who seek to raise standards in London. Through both targeted and pan-London work, it has sought to support teachers, leaders and local authorities in their work for raising the achievement of young people and creating a world-class education system.</p>

	<p pid=".729W.8/1">Though the development of extended schools, we want children and young people to be able to access a wide range of interesting activities such as homework clubs, sport, music tuition, dance and drama, arts and crafts, special interest clubs such as chess and first aid courses, visits to museums and galleries, foreign language tuition, volunteering, or business and enterprise activities. It will be up to schools in consultation with parents to develop activities that will best meet the needs of their children. The Department for Education and Skills' Extended Schools Prospectus' sets out the Government's expectation of a core set of extended services, including after school activities, that we want to see in or accessible through all schools by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.8/2">The funding for local authorities announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June</phrase> is to help 'kick-start' extended services, such as after school clubs. Funding was also announced to be directly distributed to schools. Overtime, in order to ensure that schools can make a sustainable all year round offer of extended services to families they will need to establish realistic costing and charging arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.8/3">Local authorities will allocate funding to schools to develop extended services taking into account factors such as existing services in the community and levels of deprivation. Funding released to schools on that basis should be spent in accordance with that agreement. Local authorities already audit public funds spent by schools. Any additional funding provided for extended schools will fall within this existing audit regime.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.8/4">It will be for individual schools to determine, in consultation with parents and young people, the focus of the funding provided directly to schools but it has been provided to help schools develop and sustain extended services.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.8/5">There is no expectation that teachers will deliver extended services, nor is it necessary for head teachers to be responsible for their management. The funding made available can be used flexibly to support whatever barriers schools might face in developing extended services. This can include, for example, appointing a manager who works across a cluster of schools to develop extended services and hence ease any burden on existing school staff. The National Remodelling Team will take a lead role in supporting schools on the development of extended services and will provide schools with the support they need to ensure that services develop in way that is consistent with the tenets of school workforce reform.</p>

Proposals in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill would give all schools additional powers to search outer clothing and belongings without consent, where they reasonably suspect an offensive weapon is being carried. State school head teachers can permanently exclude a child for carrying an offensive weapon, even on a first offence, and appeal panels should not normally reinstate such pupils. Private school proprietors draw up their own discipline policies and decide what sanctions the head teacher can impose.</p>

On request from parents or schools, local authorities are under a duty, where necessary, to assess children's SEN and draw up statements which set out the provision to meet those needs. The Education (Special Educational Needs) (England) (Consolidation) Regulations 2001 require local authorities when making assessments of a child's SEN to seek advice from the social services authority as to the educational, medical, psychological or other features of the case which appear to be relevant to the child's educational needs and how those features could affect the child's educational needs. The local authority would have to take account of any relevant advice from the social services authority concerning a child's family and social situation, rather than the child's social class, when making an assessment.</p>

Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer reported Office of Government Commerce (OGC) value for money gains in central civil government procurement for 2003&ndash;04 of &pound;2 billion. OGC value for money procurement gains for 2004&ndash;05 are being calculated and will be published in the 2005 Treasury Autumn Performance report.

Under its efficiency plans, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is committed to reduce staffing levels by 313 by <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase>. The rollout of a new database over the period in question makes exact comparisons difficult, but excluding staff paid for by fee income, we estimate staff numbers have declined by about 50 between April 2004 and April 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.2/1">Our embassy in Bogota reports regularly on internally displaced people (IDPs) in Colombia, and discusses the situation with the Colombian authorities, the UN and NGOs. Given the nature of the issue, it is very difficult to put a completely accurate figure on the number of IDPs. Statistics provided by the Government of Columbia and unofficial statistics differ slightly, but the figures are in the region of 3 million people internally displaced. This humanitarian crisis has arisen as a direct result of the internal armed conflict in Colombia. Recent years have shown a marked decline in numbers of newly displaced people, although the overall figure of internally displaced people as a whole continues to rise, as the security forces made some headway against the illegally armed groups. Government of Colombia figures for 2003 and 2004 for new displacements are 219,469 and 137,315 respectively. But the situation is still critical and more needs to be done to address the issue. South-West Colombia, where the security forces are making a concerted push against the illegal armed groups, is particularly affected.</p>

On the recommendations of the assessment team, the AU decided to expand its mission in Darfur to over 7,700 personnel in order to fulfil its current mandate and to provide a secure environment throughout the region.

	<p pid=".737W.3/1">Jan Egeland estimated in March that 10,000 Sudanese civilians were dying each month in Darfur. Estimates of deaths in Darfur vary from 70,000 to 300,000 and above. Accurate figures are not available and, even though the World Health Organisation is undertaking a second crude mortality survey, it will only give a snapshot of the situation. We are unlikely ever to get a full and wholly accurate picture of deaths from this conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.3/2">There are 2.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Darfur and many of these would be put at great risk if humanitarian operations were suspended by any organisation for reasons of insecurity. This is why the Government fully supported the African Union's (AU) decision to increase their troop numbers from 3,000 to 7,700 and why the Government recently announced a further &pound;19 million in funding to the AU mission in Darfur. This brings the UK's total funding to the AU to almost &pound;32 million.</p>

	<p pid=".737W.6/1">There is no doubt that violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been committed in Darfur. We have consistently made clear that the perpetrators of these terrible crimes must be brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.6/2">The UK applies the definition of genocide given in the International Criminal Court Act 2001. Under the Act, &quot;genocide&quot; is defined by reference to Article 6 of the Rome Statute, as certain acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.6/3">With regard to Sudan, the UK did not have sufficient evidence to judge whether the acts were undertaken with the intent necessary to constitute genocide.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.6/4">For this reason, we pressed strongly for the establishment of an expert International Commission of Inquiry (ICI) by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to investigate the reports of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in Darfur in 2004, and to determine whether genocide had occurred. The ICI's report, issued to the Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>, concluded that the Government of Sudan did not appear to have pursued a policy of genocide in Darfur and that, while individuals may have done so, this was a determination which only a competent court could make. The conclusion that no genocidal policy had been pursued by the Government in no way detracted from the gravity of the crimes committed including crimes against humanity and/or war crimes. Following this, the UK played a leading role in sponsoring UN Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005) of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>, in which the Security Council referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC)&mdash;as recommended by the ICI.

	<p pid=".743W.9/1">We continue to take a close and active interest in the case of Mr. and Mrs. O'Malley's murder. This has included high-level representations at an early stage in the investigation. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary asked the Spanish Foreign Minister, Ana Palcio, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-09">9 April 2003</phrase> to ensure that DNA samples relating to the murder could be tested as soon as possible. My hon. Friend the former Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Office Affairs (Mr. MacShane) also raised the issues of the speeding up of forensic testing and repatriation of the deceased with the Spanish Minister for Europe, Ramon de Miguel on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-06">6 June 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".743W.9/2">Spanish legal proceedings against the two Venezuelans accused of the murder are now under way. These differ significantly from a trial in the UK system. Since the proceedings began, we have not made representations to the Spanish authorities on any aspect of the case, as, under international law, we are unable to interfere in the judicial process of other countries. Our own judicial proceedings are similarly protected.</p>

	<p pid=".748W.6/1">The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) pilot evaluation report, 'Driving Crime Down&mdash;Denying Criminals the Use of the Roads' tracked the first year of ANPR Project Laser Two and tested the roll out and operation of ANPR-enabled police intercept teams. The report concluded that ANPR is one of the most effective technologies currently available to the Police Service.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.6/2">ANPR has had an impact on crime at all levels and has also proved effective in intelligence gathering and post-incident investigation. Dedicated police intercept officers in 23 forces using ANPR technology during Laser Two, achieved a nine fold increase in their average arrest rate to that of the nationally accepted average. In addition, the same officers produced three times the Offences Brought to Justice compared to conventional policing.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.6/3">The national rollout of ANPR is now well under way and it is the Association of Chief Police Officer's (ACPO) vision, supported by the Home Office Police Standards Unit, for each police force to have at least one dedicated ANPR intercept team in place by October 2005 and for this facility to be extended to the equivalent of one per Police Basic Command Unit by April 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.6/4">The Government remain committed to ANPR so that it may both build and improve upon the level of success it has achieved so far.</p>

We are making funding available to help increase the number of CSOs to 24,000 by 2008.

The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) is unable to provide information on Disclosure applications based on specific employment sectors. The CRB is planning enhancements to the Disclosure application form which will enable greater analysis in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.17/2">Based on all applications issued in May 2005, the average waiting time expressed in days from receipt of a Disclosure application form to the issue of a Disclosure is 10.7 days for Standard Disclosures and 28.2 days for Enhanced Disclosures. This includes the time taken for applications that are returned to customers for further information. This provides an average waiting time of 26.3 days for all Disclosures issued in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.17/3">However, it is worth stating that the average waiting time for 95 per cent. of Standard Disclosures was 7.6 days and 22 days for 95 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures, resulting in an average waiting time of 20.2 days for 95 per cent. of all Disclosures, including the time spent with customers. The CRB has published service standards of issuing 93 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within two weeks and 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks. This service standard does not include the time taken for applications that are returned to customers.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.17/4">The CRB has consistently achieved the service standard for Standard Disclosures. For Enhanced Disclosures, where an additional check is performed by local police forces for any relevant non-conviction information, the CRB has over recent months failed to achieve the service standard. For May 2005, the CRB issued 88.9 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks.</p>

It is estimated from a specific exercise undertaken last year that dispersal powers were authorised in over 400 areas between January 2004, when the powers came into force and September 2004. We are in close touch with practitioners from both police and local authorities who consider dispersal powers to be a key tool for tackling antisocial behaviour, often used in conjunction with other measures.</p>

	<p pid=".764W.5/2">These figures relate to violence recorded by the police rather than violence committed. Therefore they should not be taken as a complete illustration of the number of violent offences committed in connection with licensed premises.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.5/3">For example, in certain areas where alcohol-related violence is particularly prevalent, local police are more likely to police city centres on Friday and Saturday nights thus recording more incidents of violent offences committed in connection with licensed premises. If football-related violence is a problem, the choice to send police officers to the match will undoubtedly lead to more violent crime being recorded than if they did not attend. There are other examples, such as the pro-active policing of antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid=".774W.0/1">Information on staff vacancies against operational staffing requirement at <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-31">31 December 2002</phrase>, 2003 and 2004 for each public sector prison establishment is contained in the table. Operational posts are highlighted separately within the table. The figures represent a snapshot of the staffing position in establishments. Details about levels of vacancies within privately managed establishments are not routinely collected and are therefore not included in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.0/2">The Service has had considerable success in filling posts over the past three years and shortfalls among operational staff over the past three years have fallen steadily. To cover vacancies in the short-term certain establishments are allowing officers to work additional hours as part of the 'Contracted Supplementary Hours Scheme'. This scheme contributed the equivalent of 463 full-time officers at <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>. At that time the total operational staff availability was 25,383 compared with an operational staffing requirement of 25,704, resulting in a Service-wide shortfall of just 1.2 per cent., well within an acceptable operating margin.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.0/3">Staffing levels in non-operational roles are more fluid and vacancy figures reflect a number of reviews taking place across the Prison Service and work to introduce greater efficiencies. This led to decisions to leave posts unfilled.</p>

	<p pid=".778W.0/1">The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 places a general duty on Government Departments to have regard to the need to <i>(a)</i> eliminate unlawful racial discrimination; and <i>(b)</i> promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups. The general duty also applies to a large number of specified public authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".778W.0/2">The Home Secretary has also made Orders under the Act to place the &quot;specific duties&quot; on named public authorities. The list of bodies subject to the general and specific duties is updated periodically in consultation with the Commission for Racial Equality and other Government Departments. One of these specific duties is to produce a Race Equality Scheme that sets out their arrangements for complying with the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".778W.0/3">The Home Office published its revised race equality scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-26">26 May 2005</phrase>. In addition to the legislative requirements the scheme also sets out key challenges, objectives and targets on race equality. The Home Office race equality scheme encompasses a number of associate schemes such as the Prison Service, United Kingdom Passport Service and National Probation Directorate and includes the associate race equality scheme for Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. The Home Office will continue to ensure that other public bodies comply with the Race Relations (Amendment) Act.</p>

	<p pid=".782W.0/1">Asylum and human rights claims by Zimbabwean nationals are considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). As with any other nationality, Zimbabweans who meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 Convention are granted asylum. If they do not qualify for asylum, but there are other circumstances that make them particularly vulnerable and engage our obligations under the ECHR, they are granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave. If their application is refused, they have a right of appeal to the independent Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. In this way we ensure that we provide protection to those Zimbabweans who need it.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.0/2">Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information from a wide range of reliable sources including international organisations, non-governmental organisations and the media. In addition, we are in continual dialogue with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about country conditions in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.0/3">Asylum decisions are based on the circumstances of the individual claimant and, while we are aware of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' advice based on a general assessment of conditions in Zimbabwe, that does not mean that it would be unsafe for failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers to return to Zimbabwe. Where it is clear that there are Zimbabweans in need of international protection and the asylum system will continue to provide that, but if an asylum and human rights claim is refused, and any appeal to the independent Asylum and Immigration Tribunal is unsuccessful, that means that it would be safe for that particular individual to return to Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid=".786W.2/1">The recent publication by Dr. Draper and colleagues on leukaemia and distance from power lines have reinforced the need for continued departmental support for research into the causes of leukaemia and the role of electromagnetic fields (EMF). Measurements of EMF will be included in the next phase of Dr. Draper's work. The Department, together with the Health and Safety Executive, is continuing to fund the World Health Organisation (WHO) EMF project that started in 1997. The WHO is due to review the health risks from power frequency fields later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.2/2">The Health Protection Agency's (HPA) radiation protection division (RPD), which have statutory responsibilities to advise on health risks from electromagnetic field exposure, also undertakes research in support of its advice. In 2004, the HPA-RPD, when it was the National Radiological Protection Board, published a comprehensive scientific review in support of its new EMF guidelines. It recommended that, in view of the scientific uncertainties in relation to power frequency EMF, the Government should</p>
	<p pid=".786W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;consider the need for further precautionary measures&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.2/4">The HPA have also noted that the majority of higher magnetic fields are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather than proximity to power lines.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.2/5">In addition to funding research, therefore, the Department is leading a stakeholder group to consider practical precautionary measures. The group includes Government departments, agencies, the electricity industry, specialists and public concern groups.

To support this 25 per cent., increase in capacity, we have allocated revenue funds growing to &pound;29 million by 2010&ndash;11 and &pound;20 million capital in each of the four years 2005&ndash;06 to 2008&ndash;09. A joint implementation group (JIG) comprising the Department and the Higher Education Funding Council for England is managing the expansion programme.

	<p pid=".790W.2/2">The meeting between officials in the Department and the South and East Dorset Primary Care Trust (PCT) on June 8 2005 was positive. A number of applications for local practitioners to move to personal dental services (PDS) pilot contracts were reviewed, including the establishment of new practices. The applications for two of the new practices were subsequently agreed by the Department on June 10 2005, including the application for the new Whitecross dental practice in Christchurch. The two new practices will include a total of nine new full-time national health service dentists, delivering care to 22,500 patients. The PCT has assured me that all patients currently registered as NHS patients at the Robinsons dental practice will be able to transfer to the new Whitecross dental practice in Christchurch when it becomes operational in August 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".795W.5/1">The Department has no immediate plans to commission further research into the effect of interference from a mobile phone on the cardiovascular system. The mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme in this country supports a range of studies including one on the effects of mobile phones on blood pressure and cardiac function in healthy people. The decisions on the scientific research priorities for this programme are in the hands of an independent programme management committee. Details of the MTHR programme and descriptions of all the studies are available on the MTHR website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".802W.5/4">The formula used to inform the revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) does not specifically take account of the administrative costs associated with the recovery of payments for treating tourists from other parts of the UK in the summer months. The administrative cost of the process for reimbursing for out of area treatments falls on all PCTs, and there should not be a material difference in these costs between PCTs.</p>

	<p pid=".805W.6/1">Three short unsigned draft witness statements were provided by a solicitor Mr. Phil Shiner to the Army Prosecuting Authority. The prosecutor decided not to seek an adjournment because there was inadequate evidence to confirm the authenticity of the statements, the trial was at an advanced state, and it was not possible to ascertain the required length of the potential adjournment as there was insufficient information to identify the whereabouts of the makers. As the statements appear to support charges other than those before the court, if the witnesses can be identified, further charges can be brought. The material was provided to the defence who also took the view that they did not wish to seek an adjournment, so the trial continued.</p>
	<p pid=".805W.6/2">The Judge Advocate was made aware of the existence of the material but was not asked for any ruling on it.</p>
	<p pid=".805W.6/3">The material was passed to the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police who have twice written to Mr. Shiner to seek his assistance in identifying the makers of the draft statements. This has proved difficult because though they are identified by name and employment, no address is provided and so it is not possible to trace them. Mr. Shiner replied on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-21">21 April</phrase> saying that he would provide a substantive reply within 28 days. No further reply has been received. While the RMP will seek to trace the makers of the draft statements, on the basis of the scant information provided it may not be possible.</p>

	<p pid=".814W.5/1">Sub-division of fields and woods into small plots for sale can lead to neglect and other unsightly consequences. In January the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister issued new Best Practice Guidance which, among other things, encourages local authorities to use notices under section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to require landowners to remedy damage to rural amenity. Later this year, as part of our review of permitted development rights, we will consult on proposed improvements to the procedure for making article 4 directions. Article 4 directions can prevent permitted development where it would significantly threaten the amenity of the countryside.</p>

	<p pid=".818W.5/45"><sup>(47)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). A sector breakdown for combined LEA and school based expenditure is not available in 2002&ndash;03 and consequently this table shows the total LEA recurrent expenditure (except youth and community) per pupil by LEA since 1994&ndash;95.</p>
	<p pid=".818W.5/46"><sup>(48)</sup> 1999&ndash;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&ndash;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown in italic. In 2002&ndash;03 the combined LEA and school based expenditure is calculated by Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE) plus line 60 NCE (with adjustments to income to take account of School Standards Grant and Standards Fund scored here) plus lines 61 to 74 NCE. For 2001&ndash;02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as line 27 NCE after recharges for columns (b) to (f) and (h) plus line 15 from the remaining continuing education column (g, i and j). This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999&ndash;00 to 2001&ndash;02 and from the RO1 form previously.</p>
	<p pid=".818W.5/47"><sup>(49)</sup> Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under 5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only include for 1999&ndash;2000 onwards. For 1995&ndash;96 onwards other LEA maintained pupils are included in the pupil count. This includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the Authority for whom the Authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the Authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>
	<p pid=".818W.5/48"><sup>(50)</sup> Spending in 1997&ndash;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&ndash;99. The 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.</p>

This is in part due to known misreporting of funding by some LEAs which had the estimated effect of reducing the 2002&ndash;03 England unit cost by around &pound;50 per pupil (in cash terms).</p>

It is important that such incidents are reported to the police. During the passage of the Act the question of further provision was considered and we were not persuaded that it would assist.</p>

An awarding body has been approved for the new qualification in home inspection, and four assessment centres have been approved so far to assess courses offered by educational institutions and other organisations. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is assisting recruitment of home inspectors with awareness initiatives aimed at publicising this new career opportunity. A highly successful national conference and trade fair held on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-25">25 November 2004</phrase> was attended by between 800 and 1,000 potential home inspectors. Four regional conferences have been well attended, and further regional events are planned.

	<p pid=".828W.6/7" class="indent">We have carried out two inspections at Brent which include leisure facilities. The second inspection by its very nature (a whole service inspection of culture services&mdash;July 2004) did not focus solely on leisure facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/8" class="indent">April 2002&mdash;An inspection of sport and leisure was undertaken at Brent. The service was judged to be poor with poor prospects for improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/9" class="indentitalic">The service was judged to be poor because:</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/10" class="indent">The council at the time did not have clear aims and the service lacked focus and direction</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/11" class="indent">Some aspects of service delivery to the customer were unacceptable in terms of quality and user focus</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/12" class="indent">Service and performance data was incomplete and too unreliable to make comparisons.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/13" class="indentitalic">The service was judged to have poor prospects for improvement because:</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/14" class="indent">The service at the time lacked political, financial and managerial commitment and leadership</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/15" class="indent">Provision of the service was fragmented</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/16" class="indent">The council's own planning and performance management was weak</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/17" class="indent">There was no on-going consultation about the service with local community and relationships with local stakeholders are poor</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/18" class="indent">July 2004&mdash;A culture whole service inspection was carried out in July 2004 at Brent. The service inspected consisted of the parks service and sports service which are located within the environment directorate and the library service, heritage service, out of school support service and cultural services which are located within the directorate for education, arts and libraries. Culture services were judged to be good with promising prospects for improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/19" class="indentitalic">Key findings from the inspection include:</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/20" class="indent">Clear links can be demonstrated between the ambition for cultural services' and the ambition for the local area. This has been developed through extensive consultation with local stakeholders;</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/21" class="indent">projects to improve physical access have now been addressed in light of DDA legislation and the website has been developed as an effective tool to encourage participation;</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/22" class="indent">all the cultural services can demonstrate outcomes against local priorities and are applying programmes targeted at the needs of local people in this diverse community;</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/23" class="indent">though not all service areas are delivering to a consistent standard the progress made in sport over the past eighteen months is significant and the quality of service in parks and libraries is strong; and</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/24" class="indent">A sports strategy entitled, 'A strategy for Sport and Physical activity' has been developed and approved by the Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/25" class="indentitalic">However:</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/26" class="indent">satisfaction ratings in the sports service as measured by MORI are low at 38 per cent;</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/27" class="indent">while improvements are noted in the sports service, these now need to be sustained in the long term and the pace of improvement maintained; and</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/28" class="indent">The outcomes and impacts of some local projects are not being measured and it is therefore difficult for the council to demonstrate the added value of such projects.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/29" class="indentitalic">Prospects for improvement are promising because:</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/30" class="indent">clear leadership from councillors and senior mangers is evident and the two directorates which share responsibility for the provision of these services work and communicate effectively together;</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/31" class="indent">capacity has been increased and performance management systems are in place to support further improvement;</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/32" class="indent">the directorates have mainstreamed equality and diversity issues into service planning and partnerships have been used to increase capacity and attract resources; and</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/33" class="indent">The strategic planning framework effectively links cultural priorities with relevant priorities in corporate plans and other directorate plans and these have benefited from external stakeholder engagement. However it is early days in the embedding of this framework and the council needs to keep focussed on ensuring appropriate mechanisms are in place for monitoring and reviewing existing and future plans.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/34" class="indentitalic">However:</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/35" class="indent">With some exceptions, the quality of the building stock is deteriorating. While this is partly related to the age of facilities it does also demonstrate corporate weaknesses in asset management in recent years;</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/36" class="indent">Improving the infrastructure for cultural services will require significant levels of investment. The challenge of identifying these levels and then putting in a robust framework to attract them has riot yet been tackled; and</p>
	<p pid=".828W.6/37" class="indent">Whilst we found some service operational plans to be of a high standard, some need to be more rigorous in their specification of targets, action, deadlines and the assignment of tasks to staff.</p>

	<p pid=".835W.8/1">The Government are committed to helping those who wish to live and work in the region where they were born and brought up to do so. That is why it is looking at how it can secure sustainable growth and affordable housing in the wider south-east. Constraining growth in the more prosperous regions would not necessarily benefit other regions. Investment displaced from the wider south-east might well go abroad, or simply not happen.</p>
	<p pid=".835W.8/2">Nevertheless the Government do have a range of initiatives in place to encourage growth in other regions. For example, work is under way to implement the proposals that emerged from the Lyons Review of Public Sector Relocation, which reviewed the scope for relocating public sector jobs out of London and the south-east. Departments have confirmed 20,000 jobs for dispersal from London and the south, which should be completed by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".835W.8/3">The Government have a PSA target to improve the economic performance of all the English regions by 2008 and over the long-term reduce the persistent gap in growth rates between the regions, demonstrating progress by 2006. Furthermore, the Government are actively supporting the Regional Development Agencies and their partners in the north, Midlands and south-west in developing inter-regional growth strategies to achieve economic growth in their regions. For example, the Northern Way Growth Strategy which was published in September 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".840W.5/1">The Environment Agency is responsible for protecting and improving the environment in England and Wales, and will be presenting evidence to the forthcoming examination in public of the East of England plan.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/2">The water companies' water resource plans, which must be submitted for periodic scrutiny and review by the Environment Agency, provide the mechanisms for calculating the amount of water required for each new dwelling and the source, or sources, likely to be available. The current plans were rolled forward in 2004, and the Environment Agency published its advice to Ministers in July 2004. The next full review is due in 2009, but plans will be monitored by the agency, and revised and updated by the water companies, on an annual basis.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/3">The water companies have generally allowed for the level of growth currently planned to 2016; hence the panel's role will be to test whether the water companies' plans have allowed for the additional development proposed in the East of England plan. Where they have not, the panel will wish to be satisfied that, on the evidence presented by the water companies, the Environment Agency and others, it is reasonable to conclude that any forecast increase in demand can be met when it arises.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/4">The agency has indicated that it intends to make the results of its most recent water resource modelling available to the examination. As part of the testing process, the panel will consider the sustainability of proposals for meeting additional demand and possible environmental impact. From 2008 onwards, this will include considering the links with the river basin plans which the Environment Agency will be producing to implement the Water Framework Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".849W.8/2">I have been advised by the PSNI that they have recently increased the numbers of police officers trained within the serious crime branch investigation teams, in the process of cartridge discharge residue swabbing.

	<p pid=".855W.9/1">The lock out crime scheme aims to provide additional home security in the form of door and window locks, exterior lighting and front door security free of charge to all those in Northern Ireland aged 65 and over, who are in receipt of housing benefit of rate rebate. The scheme is funded by the Northern Ireland Office and delivered by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.9/2">There is no application process. The Housing Executive identify all eligible older people and write to each one individually offering the benefits of the scheme. To date 19,500 letters have been issued and 5,526 individuals have returned forms and will be admitted to the scheme. A further 7,500 letters have also been issued on which final information about returns have not yet been compiled. The scheme applies right across Northern Ireland, but has been rolled out on a district council basis. All those eligible aged 75 and over will be contacted by July 2005 and those aged 65 and over by mid 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.9/3">The criteria used in the scheme targets those older people in the community least able to afford home security. There are almost 250,000 older people in Northern Ireland and the Government could not offer the free supply and installation of home security measures under the lock out crime (LOC) scheme universally within current resources. I was however pleased to recently announce a reduction in the age criteria for the scheme from 75 to 65.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.9/4">There are no plans to carry out a formal evaluation of LOC. Recipients of LOC are asked to complete a satisfaction survey after completion of the work and the NIHE undertake random evaluation from scheme recipients.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.9/5">While NIHE do intend to provide information about their findings from this survey it was not possible in the time available from notification about this PQ to provide any meaningful data. However anecdotal and first hand information from recipients clearly indicate that the additional security makes them feel more secure, particularly at night.</p>

	<p pid=".856W.2/1">Marfan's syndrome is a rare, but distressing, condition that affects a small number of people in Northern Ireland. Currently, patients suffering from this syndrome are treated by consultants working in the Regional Genetics Centre at Belfast City Hospital and other appropriate specialists, particularly those within the cardiology unit at the Royal Group of hospitals. The specialist clinicians in this area already work quite closely with one another to provide quality care for all patients and their families. They are moving towards closer and more formal links to further improve the care provided to families in terms of screening for genetic abnormalities, counselling and appropriate treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".862W.2/49">The Government are currently taking steps to tackle the issue of racially motivated incidents. The Criminal Justice (No2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 has already been introduced. This directs the courts to take account during sentencing of any offence where there is evidence of hostility based on, among other things, race, and it increases the maximum sentences available for certain specified, mainly violent offences including where racial aggravation is proven.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.2/50">The Police Service of Northern Ireland is investing considerable time and effort in addressing race crime. Recent initiatives include the introduction of an on-line reporting system on the PSNI website as part of the &quot;Hate Crime is Wrong&quot; campaign. minority liaison officers have been appointed in each District Command Unit. Their role is to record and monitor racially motivated and other types of hate crime in their area, advise and support victims of such crime, and work in partnership with statutory and voluntary agencies to address these issues. The PSNI has also introduced targeted patrolling in areas where people are deemed to be at greatest risk of attack and are working in partnership with other agencies to develop solution to the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.2/51">The PSNI is determined to investigate fully all hate related incidents and where possible to secure sufficient evidence to prosecute offenders.</p>

	<p pid=".865W.2/1">The Street Works (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 is the Northern Ireland equivalent of GB legislation, designed to regulate the opening and reinstatement of public roads by utilities. Also, any private developer placing or retaining apparatus in the street must have a street works licence and comply with the requirements of the Street Works Order. This regime is regulated and enforced by Roads Service. I believe this regulation is effective, and there is no need for an additional regulator. Water Service aims to comply fully with the terms of the order; however, as it is an agency of the Crown it cannot currently be prosecuted as other utilities. This will change when Water Service becomes a Government owned company. In the interim, any offences by Water Service, which would be prosecutable under the legislation, will be recorded in a register along with the remedial actions agreed with Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.2/2">Works for roads purposes, on the other hand, is specifically excluded from the Street Works Order. This is the same as the position in the rest of the UK, where in no instance is the work of highway authorities covered by the street works legislation, nor is it subject to independent regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.2/3">The safety of the work operations themselves is subject to the Health and Safety legislation, which is enforced by the Health and Safety Executive. This would apply to promote safe working practices, such as avoiding underground pipes or cables being damaged. All of the parties you mention are treated equally under this legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.2/4">Roads Service is ultimately responsible for the maintenance of the road infrastructure to keep it safe, effective and reliable and to preserve the value of the asset. With utilities making over 45,000 openings each year I am sure that you will appreciate it is important that Roads Service retains enforcement responsibilities for Street Works in respect of the various agencies working there.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.2/5">I can confirm there are no plans for Roads Service to relinquish this authority by introducing an independent regulator.</p>

	<p pid=".867W.0/1">The revenue generated by speed cameras in each police district command unit area is as detailed in the following table. All such fine revenue is paid into the UK consolidated fund. The unique nature of how the PSNI is funded means that the PSNI currently only recovers costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the N.I. Safety Camera scheme. As such, none of the revenue generated by the scheme is returned to PSNI for the express purpose of funding road safety initiatives at present.</p>

	<p pid=".870W.5/1">The Chief Executive of Water Service (Mrs. Katharine Bryan) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Katharine Bryan to Mr. Eddie McGrady, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-17">17 June 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked a Parliamentary Question asking what steps are being taken to identify which households in Northern Ireland are not connected to mains water or sewerage (5741). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/4" class="indent">Around 99% of households are connected to the public water supply and around 83% are served by public sewers. We do not currently hold comprehensive records of all households connected to mains water or sewerage services and are therefore not aware of the details of those households not connected. Water Service applies a system of reasonable cost allowance to determine whether applications for new first time services can be fully met at public expense.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/5" class="indent">However, in preparation for the proposed introduction of domestic charging a comprehensive Customer Database is being developed. This process includes liaison with other government agencies and available data is matched with our water and sewerage infrastructure records. This is a significant task and we are going to considerable lengths to ensure maximum accuracy in the data which will be required to support future customer services.</p>

	<p pid=".871W.2/1">In 2004, 14 of the 16 (87.5 per cent.) identified bathing waters met the mandatory standards of the Directive, however, those at Castlerock and Ballyholme failed to comply.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/2">The failure to meet mandatory standards was due mainly to the wet weather during the summer period Studies have shown there is a direct correlation between bathing water compliance levels and the frequency and intensity of rainfall during the bathing season. Heavier rainfall leads to an increase in the number of spills from combined sewer overflows and an increase in agricultural run-off.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/3">To address the sewerage problems, Water Service has commenced construction of a new wastewater treatment works to serve the North Coast. It is scheduled for completion in the spring of 2007. The works will treat all wastewater from Portrush, Portstewart, Coleraine, Castlerock and Articlave. This should result in an overall improvement in the bathing water quality in the North Coast area.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/4">Water Service plans to construct a new wastewater treatment works at Donaghadee to treat the wastewater from Bangor, Donaghadee and Millisle. The project is schedule for completion in December 2007. In addition, a number of Drainage Area Studies in the North Down area, have been completed and have identified approximately &pound;13 million of networks improvements. Major programmes of work to implement the necessary improvements will be implemented on a phased basis from 2006. Completion of this investment will result in an overall improvement in the bathing water quality in the area.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.2/5">Action is also being taken to control diffuse pollution from agricultural sources through the imminent introduction of an action programme under the EC Nitrates Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".872W.2/1">Firstly I would like to take this further opportunity to express my deepest sympathy to the family of Mr. Stevenson, who so tragically lost his life in the accident at Carmoney.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.2/2">Following the events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-02">2 June</phrase>, an independent inquiry by the Health and Safety Executive (NI) is under way. Water Service is liaising closely with them as their investigation proceeds and will, of course, take immediate action to implement any actions, should they be recommended as a result of this investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.2/3">In the meantime, Water Service has completed a precautionary inspection at all other 18 similar installations across Northern Ireland, which are essential for the maintenance of drinking water quality and is satisfied that the health and safety procedures are robust. I am assured that it is safe for the installations to continue operating.</p>
