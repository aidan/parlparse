The remaining outstanding debt on past UK aid loans to Belize amounts to &pound;10.470 million, covering a repayment period which lasts until 2008.</p>

This drew on response to the April 2000 Green Paper &quot;Quality and Choice: a decent home for all&quot; which almost universally agreed on the need to bring more coherence into the structure of social rents.

Over a 10-year period this will result in average RSL rents rising by around 6 per cent. in real terms. Estimates for housing association tenants' rents in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham will only be available once their landlords have completed their rent plans. However, later this summer the results will be available from the case study research into the practical issues arising from the rent reforms in west London.</p>

	<p pid=".661W.0/22">Addressing pilot shortfalls is a key priority for the Government and RAF and a number of initiatives are being undertaken to address this problem. These include the introduction of an in-service degree scheme to attract aircrew at a younger age, fully manning the RAF training systems, and the introduction of targeted financial incentives and the Linkup scheme to help improve retention. A comprehensive review of aircrew retention measures across the armed forces is also being undertaken and will report later this year, hopefully in time to influence the Armed Forces Pay Review Body's deliberations for their 2002 report.</p>

	<p pid=".661W.3/2">The Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Night Observation and Counter-surveillance (STANOC) centre is currently part of the Royal Artillery Trials and Development Unit, which is an element of Headquarters Director Royal Artillery based at Larkhill in Wiltshire. As a result of the General Staff Review and a further study into Army Trials and Development Units, it has been decided that the STANOC centre's outputs would most effectively be provided in the future by disaggregating its prime responsibilities to the Land Warfare Training Centre (LWTC) and Infantry Trials and Development Unit (ITDU), both of which are based at Warminster. The current annual cost of the STANOC centre is &pound;242,878. The provision of new infrastructure at Warminster is currently estimated at &pound;65,000. Six military personnel were employed at the STANOC centre in 2000, and from <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-01">1 September 2001</phrase> three of these posts will be transferred to the LWTC and ITDU at Warminster and the remaining three posts will be redeployed elsewhere in the Field Army. Therefore, there will be no overall saving to the defence budget.</p>

	<p pid=".666W.0/2">The Department obtains advice on potential health effects risks associated with electromagnetic fields (EMF), such as those from power lines or mobile phone masts, from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).</p>
	<p pid=".666W.0/3">Power line EMF has been reviewed in a report published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-06">6 March</phrase> by the NRPB's Advisory Group on non-ionising radiation and provides an assessment of the potential risks of cancer. (Documents of the NRPB Vol. 12, No 1, 2001). Copies have been placed in the Library. The board of the NRPB also published a response statement which can be found on the NRPB website <a href="http://www.nrpb.org.uk">www.nrpb.org.uk</a>. The report states that any possible risk of childhood leukaemia relates to those exposed at relatively high levels of domestic magnetic field exposure but that these are not necessarily associated with proximity to pylons or overhead power transmission lines. The conclusions indicate that the question of whether exposure to electromagnetic fields can influence the development of cancer cannot at present be completely resolved.</p>
	<p pid=".666W.0/4">Mobile phone base stations (transmission masts) emit radio waves at very different frequencies to those fields generated by power lines. They are therefore being dealt with as a separate issue. The possible public health implications of mobile phone technology has been investigated by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (the Stewart group). Its report, published in May 2000 concluded that:</p>
	<p pid=".666W.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".666W.0/6">It also included a recommendation for a substantial research programme to be set up to investigate the possible effects of mobile phone technology more generally. A three year programme, jointly funded by Government and industry, has now been launched and has invited proposals relating to all aspects of mobile phone technology including telecommunications masts and handsets. The research is being undertaken under the direction of an independent programme management committee. Details can be found on the Department website <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/mobilephones">www.doh.gov.uk/mobilephones</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".666W.0/7">The Department is also continuing to provide financial support for the World Health Organisation International Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Project which is comprehensively reviewing EMF effects, including those of power frequency fields and radio waves.</p>

	<p pid=".668W.3/1">The information requested is shown in the table. Waiting time information was not collected on a monthly basis in 1997 and so we have provided figures for the nearest date for which we have data.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.3/2">In 1997 we promised to reduce waiting lists by 100,000. We have done this and today there are 125,000 fewer patients waiting for in-patient treatment than when we came into power. We are going to build on this. As part of our NHS Plan the National Health Service is working to reduce the maximum waiting time for admission to hospital from 18 months today to six months by the end of 2005. By the same date the maximum waiting time for an out-patient appointment will be reduced from over six months today to three months.</p>

	<p pid=".676W.3/1">Under the respiratory disease handling agreement signed between the Department and the claimants' solicitors, the Department makes the following interim payment:</p>
	<p pid=".676W.3/2" class="indent">1. an interim payment of &pound;2,000 is made upon provision by a claimant to IRISC of verification of receipt of the Industrial Injuries Benefit, PD D12, subject to confirmation of the number of years of underground work as set out in the handling agreement;</p>
	<p pid=".676W.3/3" class="indent">2. a bereavement award is payable to the widow upon production of a death certificate for their husband citing one of eight descriptors;</p>

	<p pid=".676W.3/5" class="indent">4. interim payments are made upon completion of screening spirometry with a tariff agreed with the claimants' solicitors in accordance with the criteria set out in the handling agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.3/6">The majority of these are made directly by issuing a cheque rather than making an offer and waiting for acceptance. The only interim where there is a prior offer stage is the one in respect of an initiative agreed in May 2001 to make a &pound;2,000 interim to widows in receipt of a bereavement award. The payment of this award is dependent on a response from the claimant and subject to certain criteria. The payment of this interim is also dependent on IRISC, the Department's claims handler, being in receipt from the claimants' solicitors of the requisite documents to ensure that payment is made to the right individual, as determined by the grant of probate. I regret that the Department is unable to provide figures for the turnaround time of these interims broken down by area. This depends, among other things, on the time of responses from the claimant. However, I can confirm that once IRISC is in receipt of the necessary documents, the average length of time taken to making a payment is 1.5 weeks.</p>

	<p pid=".680W.2/1">In September 2000 the Government inadvertently issued a licence for a small quantity of military listed chemical to Libya. This was technically in breach of the UK interpretation of the EU arms embargo on Libya. The chemical was for use in the laboratory analysis of water and sewage samples. The goods have now been exported and the licence has been returned as exhausted. As a result of the error we have revised assessment procedures of export licence applications to embargoed destinations. The Government continue to support the EU arms embargo on Libya.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.8/2">Swimming is a compulsory part of the National Curriculum for Physical Education at Key Stage 2, unless pupils have met the full Key Stage 2 requirements during Key Stage 1. After Key Stage 2 it remains one of six areas of physical activity. The Ofsted report on swimming at Key Stage 2, published in November 2000, showed that well over four out of five schools inspected provided adequate time for swimming and four out of five children are able to swim 25m at the end of Key Stage 2. We acknowledge, however, that we need to work more with schools to make even more opportunities available for more children to be able to swim 25m by the time they reach secondary school.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.8/3">Swimming and water safety are important life skills. We are investing heavily in school sport and swimming will benefit. The Government's commitment includes &pound;581 million in England (out of a total of &pound;750 million in the UK) from the New Opportunities Fund for school sport facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.8/4">We have established a Swimming Advisory Group, involving, as well as my Department, representatives of the swimming associations, Ofsted, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to discuss what more can be done to create even more opportunities for children to swim and announce proposals by the end of the year.</p>

The boundaries may extend beyond the statutory minimum for disease control purposes and because, in order to simplify identification, they are determined by clear geographical features, such as roads or railway lines. Declaratory orders for England and Wales are made by my Department and a map depicting the infected area may be inspected in the DEFRA office at 1A Page street, London between 9 am and 5 pm, Monday to Friday.

	<p pid=".685W.5/2">Slurry and liquid manure are normally treated by adding chemicals to raise or lower the pH so as to inactivate any foot and mouth disease virus that may be present. However, on many large farms the volume of slurry involved may make pH adjustment practically difficult and inordinately expensive. Moreover, the ground state may now allow the application of treated slurry. In such circumstances slurry and liquid manure may well be kept in lagoons or holding tanks until it can be applied to the land.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.5/3">Environment Agency authorisation is always sought about the construction and location of lagoons. Local animal health offices have cleansing and disinfecting teams who can give advice on handling large amounts of slurry and liquid manure. This advice will include the ease with which particular amounts might be treated and the preferred disposal methods taking into account the local ground conditions and the relevant environmental considerations.</p>

Vaccination protects animals from infection, and so would not be used for animals that are already infected with foot and mouth disease. The policy remains to slaughter animals which are infected, suspected of being infected or which have been exposed to infection.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.2/2">Any steps to vaccinate need to be undertaken with full consideration of all the implications for the disease, the handling and control of vaccinated animals and products, and wide implications for the EU's 'foot and mouth disease-free, without vaccination' status. A decision to vaccinate against foot and mouth disease must, therefore, be taken at national level and take into account the views and wishes of all interested parties that would be affected by a vaccination programme.</p>

	<p pid=".688W.5/1">We would not vaccinate an animal against foot and mouth disease if it were suspected to be already carrying the virus.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.5/2">Ring vaccination is best deployed where one is confident that the size of an infected area is relatively small and the virus has not already spread beyond it, since the aim of ring vaccination is to control the spread of infection within and outside the infected area. We did not ring vaccinate at the start of the outbreak because it was apparent that the virus had potentially been spread across a wide area, due to the large number of movements that had taken place before the first case of foot and mouth disease was identified. This made ring vaccination an impractical option.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.2/2">The Environment Agency conducted a preliminary desktop study of Throckmorton airfield in order to assess its suitability as a burial site for animal carcases. The study included a risk assessment of the geological, hydrogeological and hydrological conditions at the airfield. This assessment was followed up by a full quantitative risk assessment by the agency using site-specific data gained from the site construction phase. The site was shown to be acceptable using the approved methodology.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.2/3">The contractors, Halcrows, are currently doing additional site investigation and monitoring, and they will further update the risk assessment following this work.

	<p pid=".691W.0/1">The estimated additional cost of this change would be &pound;650 million in 2001&ndash;02 (cost net of savings on Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit would be &pound;340 million). However, this change would only benefit carers not in receipt of Income Support (IS) or where the increase is greater than the current value of their IS. 230,000 people would see an increase in their net income.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.0/2">In April 2001 the Carer Premium paid through Income Related Benefits was increased by an extra &pound;10 per week and the Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) Earnings Limit was increased by &pound;22 per week. We intend to legislate to extend ICA to people aged 65 or over and to enable ICA to continue for up to eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for. These changes will help an estimated 300,000 carers at a cost of more than &pound;500 million over three years.</p>

	<p pid=".691W.0/4" class="indent">1. Estimate is rounded to the nearest &pound;10 million</p>

	<p pid=".691W.0/6" class="indent">3. The income-related benefit offsets have been calculated from data taken from the November 2000 5 per cent. scan of the Income Support computer system, and the May 1999 1 per cent. sample of HB/CTB claims. These offsets have been applied to the 2001&ndash;02 ICA forecast to obtain the savings in the income-related benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.0/7" class="indent">4. The estimate assumes that the basic rate of ICA will be increased to the level of the category A Retirement Pension, and that there would be no changes made to the dependency increases in ICA.</p>

Friend the Minister for the Environment has received representations from the chairman of the Coach Tourism Council and a managing director of a north-east of England coach company. It is the long-standing policy of successive Governments not to offer compensation for consequential losses associated with animal disease outbreaks. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is closely monitoring the effectiveness of the financial assistance measures made available by Government to rural businesses, which is worth over &pound;250 million. This package includes &pound;50 million allocated to the Rural Business Recovery Fund, substantial hardship rate relief and &pound;120 million available in loans under the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme. Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue will also agree to the deferral of tax or national insurance contributions where a business is in serious financial difficulty. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has provided an additional &pound;3.8 million to the English Tourism Council to get the message across that there is plenty for the public to do in the countryside, and &pound;14.2 million to the British Tourist Authority to rebuild confidence in Britain as a tourism destination in our key overseas markets.</p>

	<p pid=".696W.2/2">It is for each Government to apply the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (known as the Valetta Convention) in ways that fit in with national practice and legislation. In broad terms, current measures in place in the UK already meet the convention's requirements. The Government do not believe that additional legislation, requiring a licensing system, is necessary to fulfil article 3. Much archaeological work is already controlled through existing mechanisms. There may be scope for developing a voluntary code of conduct for those who wish to undertake archaeological work outside the existing systems of control.</p>

The Government set no target for the prison population as it is for the courts to determine who is sent to prison. The Government will provide the places necessary to accommodate safely and securely those sentenced by the courts. New prison capacity is opening this year. Rye Hill, a 600 place prison near Rugby, opened in January 2001 and Dovegate, an 800 place prison in Staffordshire, will open on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-09">9 July 2001</phrase>.

	<p pid=".700W.0/3">One of the newly identified infringements was essentially technical and no unnecessary animal suffering resulted. In the other case there is evidence that animals experienced unnecessary suffering because of delay in implementing the agreed humane end-point for the procedure applied to them. In mitigation, the clinicians' decisions were based upon clinical judgment rather than undisputed or unambiguous facts and the Chief Inspector's view is that the decisions taken by those concerned do not indicate any fundamental disregard for the welfare of the animals. Both infringements will be dealt by means of letters of admonishment to those responsible, none of whom is currently resident or working in the United Kingdom.</p>
