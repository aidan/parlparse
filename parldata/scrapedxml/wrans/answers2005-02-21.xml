	<p pid=".1W.6/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Maldon and East Chelmsford since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/2">In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. A school sport partnership involving four School Sport Co-ordinators and 23 primary Link teachers is based at great Baddow High School in Maldon and East Chelmsford. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Maldon and East Chelmsford have benefited from 13 Sport England lottery grants totalling &pound;3,018,773, including two awards worth &pound;504,000 in total from the &pound;108 million investment in innovative sports facilities through the Active England programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England East grants increased from &pound;4.7 million to &pound;7.7 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in the East of England will be &pound;8.3 million. Maldon and East Chelmsford has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including Aldeburgh productions and Essexdance.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/4">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Maldon and East Chelmsford will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/5">Maldon and East Chelmsford also benefits from museums initiatives such as Renaissance East of England whereby it's Hub partner Colchester Museums will provide expertise and fund 60 per cent. of a new initiative to improve access and build new local audiences.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/6">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/7">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in the Maldon and East Chelmsford area. The UK Film Council has supported a number of film-related enterprises in the Chelmsford area&mdash;including &pound;20,000 for a new feature film production set and filmed in Essex; &pound;8,000 funding to the Boreham Millennium Trust to support moving image education and &pound;2,859 to Chelmsford Film Club to enable local audiences to view a wider choice of films.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/8">The feature film 'The Lawless Heart' was set in and filmed in Maldon, directed by two local filmmakers. The film, which received &pound;200,000 from the UK Film Council's Interim Production Fund, was released in 2001 to international acclaim.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/9">Many other productions have been filmed in and around Maldon and East Chelmsford, such as the BBC's 'The Murder Game'; Granada's 'Medieval Monarchs' and the feature film 'Rules of the Game'.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/10">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Maldon and East Chelmsford with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 5,205.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/11">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/12">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Maldon and East Chelmsford, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/13">Tourism in Maldon and East Chelmsford has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including the East of England Development Agency. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Maldon and East Chelmsford.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/14">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;647,014 to buildings and organisations in Maldon and East Chelmsford since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including:</p>

	<p pid=".1W.6/30">In common with all of those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Maldon and East Chelmsford constituency are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million lottery grant. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/31">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community and informal learning value of public libraries. Essex county council has recognised this value and has undertaken various initiatives such as the ASK CHRIS project to encourage reading and lending across the county's public libraries. The project received a &pound;67,000 award from the DCMS/Wolfson Foundation Public Libraries Challenge Fund in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/32">Information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Maldon and East Chelmsford has benefited from 169 awards totalling over &pound;8.9 million. Of these, 21 awards worth over &pound;1.7 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999.

	<p pid=".6W.2/7">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity within Cheshire. Two companies based in Knutsford have received lottery funding for development work.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/8">Since April 2002 the job of promoting local locations, crews and facilities to visiting production companies has been carried out by North West Vision. In particular Tatton Hall and Park has been used extensively as a location for films and television dramas such as Granada's 'The Forsyth Saga', 'Island at War' and 'Coronation Street'.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/9">Many other productions have been filmed in and around Knutsford such as Blue Blood (BBC3), Spine Chillers (BBC3) and the new feature film of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Local crew and facility companies are promoted through North West Vision's online production database and published production guide. 50 per cent. of Cheshire's freelancers live in the district of Macclesfield and over 25 per cent. of film facility companies are based in the borough.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/10">Since 2002 Cheshire has facilitated 78 productions generating 501 filming days.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/11">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Tatton with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 5,770.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/12">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/13">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Tatton, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/14">Tourism in Tatton has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including the North West Development Agency. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Tatton.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/15">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;736,208 to five projects in Tatton since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including the Anderton Boat Lift, Belmont Hall in Great Budworth, Quarry Bank Mill in Styal, the Lion Salt Works and St. Michael and All Angels in Little Leigh.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/16">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Tatton are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/17">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community and informal learning value of public libraries. Cheshire council has recognised this value and has undertaken various initiatives such as the Fully Booked project to encourage reading among people across Cheshire, especially those of 65 plus who visit day centres and those with special needs. The project received an award for &pound;30,348 from the DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/18">Information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Tatton has benefited from over 150 awards totalling over &pound;6.9 million. Of these, 19 awards worth over &pound;245,000 were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.2/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Woodspring since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/2">In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. A school sport partnership involving five School Sport Co-ordinators and 35 Primary Link teachers is based at Wyvern in Woodspring. To achieve our challenging targets for increase participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Woodspring have benefited from ten Sport England Lottery grants totalling &pound;2,218,978.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England, South West grants increased from &pound;4.3 million to &pound;12.2 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in the South West will be &pound;14.1 million. Woodspring has benefited from this increased funding to arts projects, organisations and individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/4">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Woodspring will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/5">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/6">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries through the work of the Regional Screen Agencies have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity outside London. Last year 24 productions were shot in Somerset adding &pound;333,000 to the local economy, including Woodspring.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/7">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Woodspring with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 6,085.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/8">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11pm on new year's eve to 11am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment.

These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Woodspring.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/11">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;57,885 to five buildings and organisations in Woodspring since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including Tickenham Court, Clivedon and the Nailsea Glassworks, Nailsea.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/12">In common with all of those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Woodspring constituency are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million Lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line.

	<p pid=".9W.2/13">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community and informal learning value of public libraries. North Somerset council has recognised this value and as part of a consortium (including North Somerset, Somerset County and the Unitary Authorities of Bath and North-East Somerset and South Gloucestershire) took part in an initiative called Foursite Internet for a new Era the result of which was the installation of 24/7 phone lines, internet access by mobile phone and a web catalogue system, which was shared across the consortium. Libraries in Woodspring benefited from this project which received a total award of &pound;147,750 from the DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund in 1998&ndash;99.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/14">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Woodspring has benefited from over 176 awards totalling over &pound;9.3 million. Of these, 21 awards worth over &pound;1.4 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999.

	<p pid=".12W.9/1">Halting the growth in childhood obesity is one of our prime objectives. We have set a national target to halt, by 2010, the year-on-year increase in obesity among children under 11 in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole. This objective is shared jointly by my Department, Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.9/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-14">Tuesday 14 December 2004</phrase>, the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced a further investment of &pound;519 million from 2006&ndash;07 to 2007&ndash;08 for physical education and school sport.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.9/3">The public service agreement target shared by the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will ensure that 75 per cent. of pupils by 2006 and 85 per cent. of pupils by 2008 should receive at least two hours each week of high quality PE and school sport.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.9/4">By 2010, our ambition is for all children to be offered at least four hours of sport every week. This will comprise at least two hours of high quality PE and sport at school and, in addition, the opportunity for at least a further two to three hours beyond the school day, delivered by a range of school, community and club providers.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.9/5">My Department is working in close collaboration with key agencies including Sport England, the Big Lottery Fund, local government and others to inspire people to get active. We have allocated &pound;65.8 million of Exchequer funding to Sport England to help drive forward our agenda for increasing physical activity in 2005&ndash;06. In addition Sport England plans to invest &pound;315 million, including &pound;40 million of Exchequer funding in the development of 32 sports at all levels over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.9/6">This investment will enable us to help people to start and stay in sport, increasing and widening the base of participation for everyone regardless of age, gender, ethnic origin or disability; to create a dynamic network of clubs, coaches and volunteers thus creating a culture of lifelong participation, contributing to the wider public health agenda of tackling the problem of obesity in our society.</p>

The aims of the programme are to improve the continuous vocational training of professionals in the audio-visual sector; and encourage co-operation and exchange of know-how and best practice. Training activities supported by the MEDIA Training Programme are mainly targeted at professionals in the audio-visual industry and from radio, in particular: new media content providers, professionals from the animation industry, professionals from post-production, notably visual effects supervisors, managers, producers, directors, sales agents, distributors, marketing executives, script-writers, script-editors, commissioning editors, as well as trainers. The following table sets out the training courses (and their providers) funded to date involving United Kingdom partners.

We believe this approach is the right way to achieve the EU's objectives as set out in the Common Position of 1996, including to promote the peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy in Cuba. Normalised contact with the Cuban Government will enable the UK Government to press the Cuban Government on issues of concern&mdash;especially human rights, including our call for the release of all political prisoners&mdash;and to further UK/Cuba co-operation in areas of mutual interest such as the fight against crime, child protection and in developing sustainable tourism in Cuba.</p>

We are promoting reform in Iran through: engagement with Ministries, the Judiciary, and civil society within Iran, including through the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue; project work on good governance, rule of law and advancement of women; and action at the UN, including most recently co-sponsoring with other EU countries a General Assembly resolution in December 2004 expressing serious concern at the human rights situation in Iran and calling for change.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.5/1">Following Cyprus' accession to the EU, as a divided island, the application of the acquis was suspended in the north pending a settlement. Help in preparing for the application of the acquis in the north is therefore an important component in facilitating a settlement. The Government's ultimate objective remains a just, viable and lasting settlement for the benefit of all Cypriots.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.5/2">Since May last year, the European Commission has provided limited assistance to Turkish Cypriots through its Technical Assistance Exchange Office programme, which we welcome. The objective is to bring Turkish Cypriots closer to the European Union. We also support efforts in the EU to obtain agreement on the Commission's package of proposals for financial aid to and direct trade with the north of Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.5/3">The British Government are themselves funding a small number of projects in north Cyprus under the &quot;Re-uniting Europe&quot; programme within the Global Opportunities Fund. (More information on these can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website: fco.gov.uk&gt;Programmes&gt;Global Opportunities Fund). These projects are designed to help the Turkish Cypriot community to prepare for reunification and full participation in the EU. Our efforts are in line with EU commitments and will, we believe, help facilitate a future settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".27W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has had no such discussions with the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, although UK policy in this area has been discussed bilaterally at senior official level.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.0/2">The UK funds a number of projects in the north of Cyprus which deliver technical expertise on administrative reform and the handling of EU-related business, in order to help Turkish Cypriots prepare for the demands of a settlement and full participation in the EU. It is in the interests of the smooth functioning of a united Cyprus that this reform process should begin as soon as possible. These projects therefore form an important part of the Government's policy of promoting a Cyprus settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".29W.5/1">Reports by NGOs and in the media about prejudice and violence against minorities in Russia are concerning. These reports indicate that racially motivated crimes against black, Asian, Caucasian and Jewish people in Russia appear to be increasing. One report from the Sova human rights centre in Moscow suggests that the number of racially motivated deaths in Russia increased from around 15 in 2003 to at least 44 in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.5/2">The growth of extremist neo-Nazi and skinhead organisations is another concerning development. A report by the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights estimated that, at the end of 2003, there were 50,000 skinheads across Russia, mainly concentrated in the larger cities such as Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.5/3">While reports of growing anti-Semitism in Russia continue, Jewish groups agree that there is no state-sponsored anti-Semitism in Russia and President Vladimir Putin has demonstrated sympathy for Jewish interests. However, prejudice remains common and reports of sporadic attacks on Jewish buildings and individuals continue.</p>

	<p pid=".29W.5/5">To help combat racism and xenophobia in Russia the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has funded a one-year project to assist NGOs representing ethnic minorities in the regions. We are also co-funding an ambitious project to bring ethnic minority NGOs and the police together in different regions to develop strategies for tackling racism and discrimination. A further project, started in 2003, provides legal support and takes on strategic litigation to protect the rights of the Roma community.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-06">6 October 2004</phrase>, the Government of Sudan gave its commitment to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister that they would co-operate with the African Union (AU) mission; provide the location of militia forces and confine these forces to barracks, if the rebels would also do so; conclude the Compressive Peace Agreement by the end of the year; and to implement the Abuja Humanitarian Protocol.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.8/2">The Comprehensive Peace Agreement was concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>, and formally signed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-09">9 January</phrase> in Nairobi. The Government of Sudan have provided the location of their forces to the AU and are co-operating with the ongoing expansion of its mission. However neither the Government of Sudan nor the rebels have confined their troops to barracks. We welcome the improvement in humanitarian access from six months ago, as stated by the UN Secretary General in his latest report on Darfur. But it is still very poor, and we continue to be concerned that the security situation means that aid cannot be delivered to all that need it. We have made clear that security must improve and the ceasefire violations must stop. We are strongly pressing both sides to abide by the Abuja protocols.</p>

There are no plans at present to legislate to prevent cross-examination of a witness by a defendant in the criminal court, or by a respondent in the family court.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.0/2">Section 36 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 already gives the court discretion to prevent cross-examination by a defendant in person in criminal proceedings, if it appears to the court that the quality of the evidence given by the witness is likely to be diminished by such examination. The wide discretion afforded judges in hearing family proceedings gives them sufficient powers to ensure that victims can be protected from intrusive and unfair questioning by the respondent in family proceedings. They can offer assistance in how questions are framed and evidence is presented. The judge also has an inherent power to refuse to admit evidence at a trial if he considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.5/1">We are aware that cattle to cattle spread of bovine TB has taken place as a result of restocking following foot and mouth disease and Defra is funding research, by Warwick University, that aims to (i) identify and estimate risk factors associated with the introduction of bovine TB in restocked farms and (ii) model transmission dynamics within cattle populations. The modelling work will take account of the exposure of cattle to badgers. The research project is due to end in 2006 and results will be published on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.5/2">While no specific assessment has been made of the possible impact that pre-movement testing would have had on bovine TB in herds restocked following FMD, Government recognises that pre-movement TB testing is important as a mechanism to help prevent further spread of the disease. Defra's advice to farmers, published in the booklet 'TB in Cattle&mdash;Reducing the Risk', has always been to consider private TB testing and isolation of any animals bought in to a herd. This advisory booklet has been available to farmers, free of charge, since 1999. Officials are currently working with stakeholders to develop detailed proposals to make pre-movement TB testing of cattle from the areas of the country most badly affected by bovine TB compulsory.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.0/1">In the year 2004, the average period of late receipt for cattle passport applications was 207 days. This figure is surprisingly high, because of a fairly small number of applications that were received many months or even years late.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.0/2">It may be more helpful to explain that 50 per cent. of applications that were refused because of late application were received up to seven days late. 8 per cent. were between eight and 14 days late. A further 18 per cent. were up to six months late. 24 per cent. were over six months late, including some that were several years late.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.0/3">Approximately 20 per cent. of refused passports are subsequently issued following a successful appeal.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.0/4">The British Cattle Movement Service allows appeals on the grounds of postal delay only if the applicant can prove by independent evidence that he or she posted the application in good time.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.0/5">The Cattle Identification Regulations 1998 require that passports be refused when applications are received late. A comprehensive review of these regulations will be carried out shortly and possible changes to the procedures concerning late passport applications will be considered. However, it is important to maintain a system that encourages farmers to register cattle births promptly. The full and accurate traceability of cattle is essential for disease control, and for the protection of public and animal health and welfare.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.6/2" class="italic">Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/3">The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food was launched in December 2002. It builds on the work of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food and is a comprehensive and long-term plan for the future development of the industry. It identifies how the Government will work with the whole of the food chain to secure a Sustainable future for English farming and food industries, as viable industries contributing to a better environment and healthy and prosperous communities.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/4">In practical terms the Strategy means:</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/5" class="indent">industry, government and consumers working together to secure a more positive future for the industry;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/6" class="indent">helping farmers add value by reconnecting with their customers;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/7" class="indent">providing good quality assured food that consumers want;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/8" class="indent">improving co-operation within the food chain and improving its performance across the board;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/9" class="indent">helping farmers secure the right training and advice to develop their businesses and spread best practice; and</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/10" class="indent">protecting the environment and rewarding farmers for providing environmental goods.</p>

	<p pid=".56W.2/1">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, European Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country. At the time of the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal, we did not judge it necessary to take safeguard action since the South African authorities had prohibited the issue of export certificates for fresh meat from the area in which the outbreak had occurred. This meant that exports from South Africa could not take place.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/2">On 7&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2000-11-08">8 November 2000</phrase> the European Commission informed the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) (now known as the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) of the outcome of an inspection carried out in South Africa by Commission inspectors, and indicated that safeguard measures may be necessary because of some difficulties the South African authorities were experiencing in dealing with the outbreak. On <phrase class="date" code="">25 November</phrase> the Commission published legislation prohibiting imports into the Community of fresh meat from 16 districts in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The Government was satisfied that the action taken by the Commission and controls in place in South Africa were sufficient to prevent any risk of disease entering the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/3">By <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase> it was clear that the situation in South Africa had deteriorated. The Government reviewed the situation and a decision was taken to take safeguard action. This was delayed due to the Christmas period, and on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-05">5 January</phrase> the Government issued a Declaration under Regulation 35 of the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996, prohibiting imports into England and Wales of meat from all of South Africa. Similar action was taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/4">The outbreak in Mpumalanga was confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>. The Commission took action in February 2001 to extend EU restrictions on imports of meat in respect of Mpumalanga. By that time, the UK had already banned imports of meat from the whole country, so no further action was necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".59W.5/3">In addition, a team has been established within Defra to ensure the overall successful implementation of the Modernising Rural Delivery programme, of which establishment of an integrated agency forms a significant part. This team comprises 34 members of staff.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.5/4">As the establishment of the new agency progresses, there will be increasing involvement from additional members of staff. In due course, all those employed by the three organisations who will join the integrated agency will be involved to some extent.</p>

	<p pid=".60W.2/1">The Government have worked with all stakeholders to ensure that the REACH proposal is well focused on achieving maximum practical benefit to human health and the environment with a minimum of direct impact on industrial competitiveness. In particular, our proposal for 'one substance, one registration' is intended to lower costs to industry as well as improving the consistency of information available on chemicals across Europe and keeping animal testing to a minimum. We have recently completed a study which indicates that, if 'one substance, one registration' were to be adopted, the cost to industry and the authorities of REACH would be decreased by at least &euro;77 million in comparison to the Commission estimates on the basis of the current proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.2/2">The UK partial regulatory impact assessment is based on the current proposals and primarily reflects the direct costs to industry of REACH which are estimated at &pound;515 million over the 11-year phase in period. This is equivalent to total direct costs across the EU of approximately &pound;2.4 billion. These are in line with European Commission estimates published in October 2003 of a maximum overall cost of the revised proposal (including indirect costs) of &euro;7.5 billion. We are currently carrying out further impact assessment work to assess the indirect costs passed down the supply chain.</p>

	<p pid=".61W.3/1">It is important to draw a distinction between treated and untreated sewerage discharges. Treated effluent discharges from sewage treatment works and some intermittent discharges from overflows during wet weather are measured in cubic metres. Discharges consented by the Environment Agency are made to the Thames by three water companies: Thames Water (inland and estuary); Anglian Water and Southern Water (estuary only).</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/2" class="italic">Thames Water</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/3">Thames Water reports it has discharged an estimated 4,800 million cubic metres of sewage effluent to the Thames in the last five years. Of this, 4,500 million cubic metres receives secondary treatment. Some of this effluent also receives more stringent treatment at Abingdon, Little Marlow and Windsor's sewage treatment works, which discharge to the freshwater section of the Thames. Approximately, 100 million cubic metres will have been treated storm sewage from treatment works, and the remaining 200 million cubic metres as untreated storm sewage (sewage and rainwater run-off). It is estimated that about 30 per cent. of storm sewage is discharged unmeasured.</p>

	<p pid=".61W.3/5" class="italic">Anglian Water</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/6">The consented daily dry weather effluent flows, which receive secondary treatment prior to discharge, from three sewage works operated by Anglian Water are 95,514 cubic metres. As it is generally accepted that average daily flows are 1.25 times the dry weather flow, it is estimated that 218 million cubic metres of treated effluent has been discharged from these works (Canvey Island, Southend and Tilbury) in the last five years.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/7" class="italic">Southern Water</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/8">Southern Water discharges effluent after it has received secondary treatment from two sites (Gravesend and Northfleet). In the last five years (2000&ndash;04) the sewage treatment works at Gravesend has discharged approximately 19 million cubic metres of treated effluent. Since April 2001, when flow monitors were installed at the Northfleet sewage works approximately 12.5 million cubic metres of treated effluent has been discharge to the end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/9">Storm sewage is discharged to the Thames at three sites at times of unusually heavy rainfall when the capacity of sewerage system is exceeded. The consents for these storm overflows do not require Southern Water to monitor the volume of discharges that occur.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.8/1">Since the creation of Defra in June 2001 the following figures are available for lost and stolen passes. These passes are programmed electronically and once a loss is reported the pass is cancelled immediately. This greatly reduces the possibility of anyone using it illegally to enter Defra premises. The cost to produce an electronic photographic pass is approximately 10 (staff time and material). The sharp increase in lost passes in the core Department is in part due to the larger numbers of passes issued to contractors' staff refurbishing buildings and losses by those staff.</p>

	<p pid=".64W.0/1">Methyl bromide is an ozone depleting substance (ODS) that is now banned in developed countries under the Montreal Protocol and EC Regulation 2037/2000. The ozone depleting potential (ODP) of methyl bromide is 0.6, which is a representation of its ability to deplete ozone in comparison to a reference ODS, chlorofluorocarbon 11 (CFC 11).</p>
	<p pid=".64W.0/2">Following the ban on production, methyl bromide is only permitted to be produced for agreed critical uses, quarantine and pre-shipment and emergency purposes. The Government's policy on future use of methyl bromide is that its use should not be phased back in by excessive critical uses.</p>
	<p pid=".64W.0/3">The Montreal Protocol makes provision for critical use exemptions where there are no technically and economically feasible alternatives to methyl bromide. The UK applied to the Parties to the Montreal Protocol for a critical use exemption for use on strawberries, to allow additional limited time to bring alternatives on line. Following technical scrutiny by the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee (MBTOC) of the Montreal Protocol and the European Commission, the Commission have licensed some 30 tonnes of methyl bromide for critical uses for strawberries for 2005.</p>

Implementation of SFFS is one of the core tasks of the Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies, and their funding from Defra reflects this. Funding for the Government Offices are provided directly by Defra. The current Defra contribution of &pound;45.5 million to the RDA 'single pot', administered by DTI, is to enable RDAs to address rural productivity issues, which are a key factor in achieving the outcomes of the national Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy. In addition, Defra has made a further &pound;1.5 million available to the RDAs in the current financial year to assist with the implementation of regional delivery plans.</p>

These reforms will be implemented in April 2006 and amount to an increase in funding for the Social Fund loans scheme of &pound;210 million over the three years to 2008&ndash;09.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.5/2">'Promoting financial inclusion' also announced that the Government are considering arrangements whereby, in certain circumstances, private and third sector lenders&mdash;including existing credit unions&mdash;could apply for repayment to be made by deduction from benefit where normal repayment arrangements have broken down. The aim of this scheme would be to reduce some of the increased costs and risks of lending to vulnerable groups. The Government have been seeking responses from private and third sector lenders, on this scheme. However no final decisions have been made as to whether and how the scheme will operate.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.5/3">Subject to any necessary state aids clearance from the European Commission, the Government will also set up a growth fund for third sector lenders from within the Financial Inclusion Fund. This growth fund will be available to credit unions and community development finance institutions to boost the coverage, capacity and sustainability of the sector in providing a source of affordable credit for the financially excluded.</p>

	<p pid=".82W.2/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> The Home Office's Public Service Agreement (PSA) target for 2003&ndash;04 was to ensure that 75 per cent. of new substantive asylum applications (excluding withdrawals and third country casesl) were decided within two months. That target remains for 2004&ndash;05. This was an increase from the 65 per cent. and 60 per cent. targets met in 2002&ndash;03 and 2001&ndash;02 respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/3">The 2003&ndash;04 target was exceeded, with 82 per cent. of new substantive applications having an initial decision reached and served within two months. The speed of initial decisions continues to improve with 84 per cent. of substantive applications received in Q2 (April to June) 2004 having an initial decision reached and served within two months, and reflects the Governments commitment to, and continued success in, speeding up the initial decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/4">(ii) The PSA target for 2003&ndash;04 was to ensure that 60 per cent. of new substantive asylum applications are decided (including final appeal) within 6 months. The target increased to 65 per cent. for 2004&ndash;05. The target was exceeded with 64 per cent. of applications received in 2003&ndash;04 (April 2003 to March 2004) having a final decision, up to and including appeals at the IAT, within six months.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/5"><i>(b)</i> The PSA target for the quality of initial asylum decisions is to ensure that: 80 per cent. of asylum decisions sampled at random in 2003&ndash;04 are found to be fully effective or better, and that 80 per cent. of asylum decisions assessed by external assessors sampled at random in 2003&ndash;04 are found to be fully effective or better. Both criteria increase to 85 per cent. for the year 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/6">The 2003&ndash;04 target was exceeded with 85 per cent. of criteria assessed on asylum decisions sampled at random by internal assessors during 2003&ndash;04 (April 2003 to March 2004) found to be fully effective or better. 81 per cent. of criteria assessed on asylum decisions sampled at random by external assessors during 2003&ndash;04 (April 2003 to March 2004) were found to be fully effective or better.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/7"><i>(c)</i> The current PSA target for the removal of failed asylum seekers is to enforce the immigration laws more effectively by removing a greater proportion of failed asylum-seekers.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/8">The ratio of numbers of asylum seekers removed (including dependants) in 2003&ndash;04 to those becoming failed asylum seekers (either did not appeal or appeal rights exhausted) in 2003&ndash;04 was 21 per cent. (compared with an estimated 21 per cent. for 2002&ndash;03).</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/9">The five-year strategy for asylum and immigration, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February</phrase>, commits the department to ensure that the monthly rate of removals exceeds the number of unfounded applications by the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/10">Information on the number of asylum applications outstanding, and the timeliness of initial decisions are published quarterly on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.0/1">The Home Office is satisfied that there is already sufficient independence in the immigration statistics, for which it is responsible. Immigration control and asylum statistics are part of National Statistics. They are produced by statisticians, whose independence is established under the National Statistics Code of Practice, and the statistics themselves are acknowledged as reliable. The National Audit Office's review in May last year found that &quot;the asylum data and statistics are in most respects reliable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.0/2">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is responsible for producing National Statistics on migrants entering or leaving the United Kingdom, and England and Wales. The ONS' estimates of migrants are compiled from a number of data sources, including the International Passenger Survey and date from the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.0/3">National Statistics are produced to high professional standards set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice. As such, they undergo quality assurance reviews and are produced free from any political interference.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.0/4">The Government's White Paper, 'Building trust in statistics', sets out the framework for assuring the quality of National Statistics. A key component of the framework is to conduct a programme of thorough reviews of key outputs, at least every five years. The National Statistics Quality Review of the International Migration was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-02">2 September 2003</phrase> and covered all forms of migration between the UK and the rest of the world, including statistics relating to all migrants and statistics relating to migrants subject to UK immigration control. The Home Office is about to embark on a National Statistics review of its publications relating to the control of immigration statistics, including the presentation of asylum statistics within these.</p>

	<p pid=".86W.3/1">The provisional budget for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the member states of the European Union was set out in the legislative financial statement annexed to the first version of the Agency Regulation (14766/03). The initial estimate for the years 2005&ndash;09 is as follows: 2005&mdash;&euro;6,157 million; 2006&mdash;&euro;9.754 million; 2007&mdash;&euro;15,754 million; 2008&mdash;&euro;15.754 million; and 2009&mdash;&euro;8.754 million. But the final figures are still being discussed as part of the negotiations on the new financial perspective which begins in 2007. As the UK has been excluded from participation in adoption of the Agency Regulation, we will not be making a financial contribution to the Agency through the EU budget&mdash;we receive an automatic rebate on measures in which we do not participate. UK contributions will only be made when we request to participate in specific activities undertaken by the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/2">The role of the Agency will be to provide effective co-ordination of member states joint actions at the EU external borders. Article 2 of the final version of the Agency Regulation (2007/2004) outlines the Agency's main tasks:</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/3" class="indent">&quot;1. The Agency shall perform the following tasks:</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/4" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> co-ordinate operational co-operation between member states in the field of management of external borders;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/5" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> assist member states on training of national border guards, including the establishment of common training standards;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/6" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> carry out risk analyses;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/7" class="indent"><i>(d)</i> follow up on the development of research relevant for the control and surveillance of external borders;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/8" class="indent"><i>(e)</i> assist member states in circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance at external borders;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/9" class="indent"><i>(f)</i> provide member states with the necessary support in organising joint return operations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/10">The UK fully supports the aims and objectives of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/11">The staffing levels of the Agency will be set once the Executive Director, Deputy Executive Director and the Management Board are in place&mdash;it will be their responsibility to decide what the staffing levels should be (within the limits of the provisional budget).</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/12">The Agency Regulation was adopted by the Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-26">26 October 2004</phrase>, was published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-25">25 November 2004</phrase> and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-26">26 November 2004</phrase>. The Agency itself should be operational by May 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/13">Parliament was kept fully informed of negotiations on the Border Agency Regulation through the usual European Parliamentary Scrutiny mechanisms. It cleared scrutiny in the European Scrutiny Committee <i>[Commons]</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase> and in the European Union Committee <i>[Lords]</i>on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-02">2 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/14">The Agency will operate under a joint legal treaty base&mdash;Articles 62(2)<i>(a)</i> and 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/15">No decision has yet been taken on where the Agency will be based. Five member states (Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and Malta) submitted bids to host the Agency. The UK supports the Polish bid. The Agency will still become operational by May 2005, even if no decision has been taken on its permanent location by then.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/16">Permanent staff of the Agency will have the same status as the staff of the other EU institutions (e.g. including the Commission). This is in accordance with the existing Staff Regulations and conditions of employment of officials of the European Communities, as set out in Article 17 of the Border Agency Regulation.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.5/1">Following on from the Home Office consultation document 'Review of Charges for Immigration Applications', I am introducing new fees for a range of immigration applications. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February</phrase> I published a summary and analysis of the consultation responses, the supporting Regulatory Impact Assessments and an analysis of the likely impact of the new charges on international student numbers. These documents are available on the Home Office website at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/2">International students bring significant economic and social benefits to the UK. In recognition of this, students seeking to vary or extend their conditions of stay in the UK will be charged a reduced fee for postal applications. Our analysis, which is set out in the published Regulatory Impact Assessment, indicates that at the level proposed, the postal charges were unlikely to have a significant impact on the UK's ability to attract and retain international students. However, in order to ensure that remaining to study in the UK remains a competitive option, we have decided that charges should be at a lower rate of &pound;250 for the standard postal service. The higher, premium fee is an optional service which students can take advantage of if they so choose.</p>

The measure will consist of three tiers; absolute low income, relative low income and material deprivation and low income combined. The Government will set a target as part of the 2006 SR06 Spending Review to halve by 2010&ndash;11 the numbers of children suffering a combination of material deprivation and relative low income. This new measure will commence with estimates taken from the 2004&ndash;05 Family Resources Survey. Data will not be available below the regional level.</p>

	<p pid=".104W.0/1">The 52 week linking rule was introduced in 1998 to allow people moving off an incapacity benefit into work to re-access any higher rates of benefit that had been in payment if their job did not work out and they needed to re-claim. It was introduced as a result of research evidence which found that people feared moving off benefit in case their job did not last, leading to difficulties in requalifying for their old benefit. The importance of linking rules was confirmed in subsequent research. For example, an evaluation in 2003 of clients eligible for the new deal for disabled people identified the most important 'bridge to work' was the knowledge that they could return to their original benefit if needed.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/2">The Department of Social Security Research Report 141 incapacity benefits and work incentives included qualitative research into the operation of the 52 week linking rule. The conclusions of the researchers were that knowing about the linking rule could influence decisions to move into work; that it reduced some of the risks and anxieties about loss of income and security attached to moving into work and that it was generally appreciated by clients. There were also indications that lack of awareness of the rule reduced its incentive effect as did anxiety that the rule would be hard to access and there was evidence that this was the case. This has been borne out by recent research. The Department for Work and Pensions Research Report &quot;A Stepping Stone to Employment&quot; published last December noted the very low levels of awareness of the linking rules amongst clients on permitted work.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/3">The Department's five year strategy published earlier this month includes our commitment to review the operation of the linking rules to ensure that existing claimants' position is protected if they take a job and they then need to return to incapacity benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".104W.6/4" class="indent">In answer to your specific question, the Secretary of State assesses the accuracy of benefits provision through the Jobcentre Plus target regime. Each year, annual targets are set for Jobcentre Plus and currently include the measures of Monetary Value of Fraud and Error, and Business Delivery. The latter includes elements on the accuracy of Income Support, Incapacity Benefit, and Jobseeker's Allowance. The targets are published in the Jobcentre Plus Business Plan each year, which is placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.6/5" class="indent">Turning to the subject of efficiency, Jobcentre Plus, within its unit cost target, has one element based on the total costs incurred for benefit processing divided by the number of claims actually processed. This measure forms a key part of the Jobcentre Plus aim to improve efficiency and is continually monitored by HM Treasury.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.6/6" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus also has a range of internal management measures that detail levels of expectation for key business areas and includes average clearance times for Income Support, Incapacity Benefit, and Jobseeker's Allowance claims and changes of circumstance, and Social Fund applications.</p>

	<p pid=".107W.2/20">The figures are from the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and its predecessor the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), who collected information on pension charges and reported this using the Reduction in Yield (RIY) measurement. This is defined as the percentage point reduction in the gross return on a pension fund as a result of explicit charges and fees. Dealing costs and other implicit charges are not included.Until 2002, the figures were collected as part of the FSA and PIA annual disclosure surveys. However, they have been replaced by online comparative tables, which give present not historical data and so some figures are unavailable.</p>
	<p pid=".107W.2/21">The RIY on personal pensions has fallen significantly since the mid 1990's, from around 1.9 per cent. in 1995 to around 1.1 per cent. in 2002, where it has remained. This drop can largely be attributed to the introduction of the stakeholder pension charge cap, currently set at 1 per cent. and the FSA restrictions on advised sales of personal pensions with significantly higher charges than this.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.2/1">In the period between April 2001 and September 2004 over 40 pension providers have sold nearly 2.2 million Stakeholder Pensions, and the average charge on Personal Pensions has fallen from a 1.9 per cent. Reduction In Yield in 1996 to 1.1 per cent. in 2004, a fall the Pensions Commission attributes a significant part of to the Stakeholder Pension charge cap. This fall in charges has ensured more of peoples savings go towards their retirement, and less is consumed by charges.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.2/2">However the Government recognises that it has been difficult to ensure that the pensions industry can effectively market Stakeholder Pensions within the constraints of a 1 per cent. charge cap, and to increase the proportion of under-savers actively targeted by providers the Government have, after commissioning an independent review by Deloitte, announced a revised charge cap of 1.5 per cent. for new members joining on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> for the first 10 years of membership, reverting to 1 per cent. thereafter. These changes will increase the number of under-savers the pensions industry can cost effectively target, while still ensuring good value for the consumer.</p>

	<p pid=".114W.3/1">The Services, as part of their system of support to bereaved relatives, seek to provide full information on the progress of inquiries. However, a Board of Inquiry is an internal inquiry held to investigate the facts of an incident in order to prevent recurrence. It is not a court of law and it does not fulfil the same function as a Coroner's inquest (or a Procurator Fiscal's inquiry in Scotland), which is to establish the cause of death. Boards of Inquiry do not sit in public; and members of the public, bereaved relatives and the press have no right to be present. It has been the policy of the MOD since December 1992 to make available to the next of kin, at no cost, copies of completed Board of Inquiry reports, subject only to the redaction of security sensitive information and third party data, and the avoidance of prejudice to any other investigation.</p>

	<p pid=".118W.3/1">As has been made clear in previous responses, the process of restructuring the infantry has been worked through by the Army in consultation with the divisions and regiments concerned. As part of this process, infantry divisions were asked to suggest options for new regimental titles. 'The Royal Lancashire Regiment' was put forward by the King's Division as an option for the new regimental title. However, of the options put forward by the Division, the proposed title of the 'King's, Lancashire and Border Regiment' was judged by the Army Board to best reflect all the antecedent regiments from which it will be drawn. This was felt to be particularly important because of the fact that this reorganisation involved the merging of three previously distinct regiments, into a two-battalion regiment. That the word 'Royal' is not included in the new title should not be taken as an omission. Rather it simply reflects the fact that, of the options put forward by the Division, the one settled upon by the Army Board happened not to contain the word 'Royal'.</p>

	<p pid=".121W.3/1">Improving interoperability between networks is a key theme of Network Enabled Capability, and there are a number of initiatives to this end. The Joint Network Management System is a programme funded by the Defence Communication Services Agency to manage tactical datalink networks in the UK. The Multiple Tactical Datalink Management System (MTDMS) forms part of a programme funded from the Equipment Plan to provide a deployable tactical datalink management capability for out of area operations. Neither programme has yet received final approval to proceed but our current planning assumption is that they will be introduced in 2006. The two systems address different requirements but they are required to be interoperable as there are circumstances when the MTDMS could be used in the UK. The MTDMS is intended to be usable in operations with US forces and we are therefore monitoring closely the development of the US Joint Interface Control Officers Support System.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.0/1">The 'Future Capabilities' White Paper published in July 2003 explains how we plan to make the armed forces more flexible and deployable. At sea, deployability has already been improved through six new Roll-On-Roll-Off ships. A robust and modern amphibious capability, based around two new ships, HMS Alibon and Bulwark, supported by the Bay Class landing ships, will provide a step change in our ability to launch and support forces ashore. For the Army, there will be a shift in emphasis towards light and medium weight forces. These will be supported by a number of new equipment programmes, including the Future Rapid Effects System family of vehicles and the Light Mobile Artillery Weapon System. In the air, as well as introducing 25 A400M aircraft from 2011, we now intend to buy our current fleet of four leased C-17 aircraft together with one additional aircraft, significantly increasing our strategic lift capability.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.9/1">The Ministry of Defence's research budget is focussed on examining technical possibilities in a variety of technology areas. These can be exploited through many different routes to new techniques, concepts and equipment. It is not possible to definitively split weaponry research out of that on materials, electronics, system integration, engines, communications and others. The development of technology into equipment is handled by the Defence Procurement Agency and it has a development budget that is spent on specific items such as satellites, communications equipment, vehicles, and weaponry, such as small arms, missiles, artillery. As we do not collate information on research activity in the way requested, it would be disproportionately expensive to provide a more detailed breakdown.</p>

	<p pid=".127W.5/2">SAM is a joint project, with MOD and industry working in collaboration. It is led by a MOD team leader, with membership drawn from BAE Systems, Devonport Management Limited, Babcock Naval Services and Rolls Royce, together with key MOD project and change management teams. The aim is to reach agreement in principle on the future management arrangements during spring 2005. Subject to approval by Government and industry stakeholders, the long-term aim is to begin implementation by early 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".127W.5/3">The SAM project forms part of a wider strategy for optimising the UK industrial maritime base: other elements include the UK Naval Shipbuilding Industrial Strategy which is currently addressing future loading and skills retention within the surface shipbuilding industry, and the Surface Ship Support Study, which is addressing the in-service support strategy for surface ships.</p>

	<p pid=".128W.6/1">Significant quantities of munitions exist in Iraq as a result of the most recent period of hostilities, as well as the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf Conflict and Iraq's conflict with Iran. These consist of large stockpiles of Captured Enemy Ammunition (CEA) as well as explosive remnants of war, and the United Kingdom is not responsible for clearing these munitions, but any details of sites we hold are passed onto the relevant organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.6/2">The clearance of CEA is organised across Iraq by the Multi-National Corps-Iraq, and is done by civilian contractors, non-governmental organisations and military Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams. Over 850,000 individual munitions have been cleared from MND(SE). We do not have details of progress made by other coalition partners. Neither the total cost of the clearance of CEA nor the number of casualties from unexploded ordnance is available.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.5/3">We are undertaking the most far-reaching reforms of national health service dentistry since 1948, supported by the biggest investment programme in the history of NHS dentistry. We are providing NHS dentistry with extra funding of over &pound;250 million a year from 2005&ndash;06, an increase of nearly 20 per cent. over 2003&ndash;04 levels. We are also funding an extra 170 dental training places from this October (a 25 per cent. increase) supported by &pound;80 million capital investment. We are recruiting the equivalent of 1,000 extra dentists this year and we have allocated &pound;59 million to improve access to NHS dentistry.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.5/4">Within this programme, primary care trusts (PCTs) in the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire Strategic Health Authority (SHA) are planning to interview eight dentists from Poland. The SHA has received &pound;2 million from the access funding and the three PCTs in Gloucestershire have reported proposals to spend their share on commissioning additional capacity to provide for the registration of 7,100 patients and the treatment of 900 additional orthodontic patients. In addition, West Gloucestershire PCT is one of the 16 PCTs in England receiving assistance from the Department's dental access support team. With the team's support a new dental practice has been established in Cinderford, in the Forest of Dean, and there are plans to establish a new four surgery practice within the centre of Gloucester city by mid-2005.</p>

The launch of the &quot;Cash for Change&quot; programme in 2001 signalled the Government's determination to tackle the problem of delayed hospital discharges through a major cash investment of &pound;300 million over two years. By 2006, older people's services will receive an extra &pound;1 billion a year to expand home care services, extra care housing, community equipment, services for carers and intermediate care.

The charge has been set at a level higher than the cost of providing services to support discharge and will act as an incentive to councils to improve their assessment and service provision. It also acts as a stimulus to ensure prompt discharge.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.6/1">We have invested over &pound;2 million in providing support, advice and training for refugee health professionals over the past four years. A significant amount of this funding has to gone to refugee doctors to help them develop their knowledge of the English language and their clinical skills. This investment has helped many refugee doctors pass the General Medical Council's English language and clinical competence exams, and therefore gain limited registration to practise medicine in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.6/2">Like everyone else, refugee doctors must then apply in open competition for posts in the national health service. We have invested in curriculum vitae and interview skills coaching and NHS induction courses to help refugee doctors become more competitive at application stage. We have also supported the development of a national career advice and information website for refugee health professionals through North East London strategic health authority.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.6/3">In addition to this, the NHS is making its own investment in the refugee workforce locally.</p>

A summary record of each of the meetings can be found on the European Commission website at <a href="http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/indexen.htm">www.europa.eu.int/comm/index en.htm</a>. In addition, an ad hoc expert working group on the directive met in September 2003 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-18">18 February 2004</phrase>. The UK expert's role was to provide an update on regulation of tobacco nationally and to provide an update on the implementation of the Directive in the UK. The UK Government's priorities for the work of the expert committee are to ensure that the Directive provisions are implemented effectively across the EU and that the Directive is strengthened in line with responses to the 2004 consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".155W.2/1">Information on the number of school nurses employed in the national health service was collected in the September 2004 non-medical workforce census. This data will be published shortly. In line with our policy of &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, it is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs), in conjunction with strategic health authorities, to ensure that services meet the needs of their local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.2/2">The Department recognises the important role that school nurses have to play in addressing health priorities, and this has been reinforced in the children's national service framework and the Chief Nursing Officer's review of the nursing, midwifery and health visiting contribution to vulnerable children and young people. We are providing new funding so that by 2010 every PCT, working with children's trusts and local authorities will be resourced to have at least one full-time, year-round qualified school nurse working with a group of primary schools and its related secondary school.</p>

	<p pid=".161W.9/1">The consultation period on Leeds Mental Health Teaching National Health Service Trust's proposals for adult mental health service ran from November 2003 to until the end of March 2004 and included a one-day stakeholder event in March 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.9/2">Following a Commission for Healthcare Inspection review, it was agreed that Leeds Mental Health Teaching NHS Trust would implement a crisis resolution and home treatment service (CRHT) in line with the national service framework for mental health.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.9/3">&pound;1.4 million of funding has been made available to implement the crisis resolution service.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.9/4">CRHT has significantly reduced the admission rate and provided home treatment for service users. Between November 2003 and January 2004, the trust admitted 513 patients. During the same period in 2004&ndash;05, the trust has admitted 428 patients&mdash;a 17 per cent. reduction in patient admissions.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.9/5">The CRHT team sees 90 per cent. of patients referred to the service within four hours, seven days a week.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.9/6">The trust believes that the redesign of adult services will deliver positive benefits to service users and carers and that it will not be detrimental to existing services.</p>

The NSF sets the direction of travel for the next 10 years to improve health and social care services for people living with long-term neurological conditions. It addresses key areas to improve care and support across the neurological patient pathway from diagnosis, investigation and initial treatment, through rehabilitation and long-term support, to end of life care. It does not look at specific neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rather it identifies the common issues affecting people with long-term neurological conditions and how these may be addressed. The principles in the NSF apply equally to improving quality of life and promoting independent living in anyone living with a long-term condition.</p>

	<p pid=".175W.2/1">Health Service Guidance (95) 18, published in 1995, provides advice and guidance to NHS organisations on the use of laundry practices. This includes hospital bed linen and curtains around beds. The guidance covers the issue of temperature and disinfection. With regard to nurses' uniforms, dilution in domestic washing machines will effectively disinfect them. Single use aprons and other equipment should be used if contamination is likely and if a uniform is visibly soiled then it should be put through a healthcare laundry intended for such items.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.2/2">It is for individual national health service trusts to determine their own policy on the laundering of nurses' uniforms and the wearing of those uniforms outdoors. The prevention and control of infection is part of the overall risk management within the healthcare environment and NHS trusts are required to have risk management protocols in place with regard to effective laundry practices. The monitoring of the cleanliness of nurses' uniforms should be part of these protocols.</p>

	<p pid=".177W.2/3">However, this was qualified by the acknowledgement that there must be flexibility to reflect local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.2/4">These local circumstances include the advantages that coterminosity between PCTs and local authorities brings, as this facilitates joint-working by the national health service and social services. Geography is also important, as rural PCTs would need to cover a much larger geographical area to serve the same population as urban PCTs. Finally the configuration of hospitals and other health providers results in natural health communities which are not of equal size across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.2/5">The impact of these local circumstances on size is such that the Department has never given a figure for the optimum number of patients in a PCT. However, PCTs have tended to be larger than PCGs, as a result of their greater functions and the desire to achieve economies of scale.</p>

	<p pid=".180W.0/1">Isotretinoin (Roaccutane) is a prescription only medicine indicated for the treatment of severe acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne or acne at risk of permanent scarring). Its use is limited to specialists in dermatology (with expertise in the use of systematic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements).</p>
	<p pid=".180W.0/2">The safety of isotretinoin has been closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, with expert advice from the committee on safety of medicines (CSM), since it was approved in 1983.</p>
	<p pid=".180W.0/3">The yellow card scheme receives reports of suspected adverse drug reactions suspected to be associated with medicines. To date 22 cases of suicide that have been reported in association with isotretinoin. The first report was received in 1993. There does not appear to be any correlation between the frequency of these cases and isotretinoin usage data, which is estimated to be 30,000 treatment courses per year for the last ten years.</p>
	<p pid=".180W.0/4">Warnings about the risk of depression and suicidal behaviour were added to the product information for prescribers and patients in 1998. Following a review of the isotretinoin product information by an expert working group of the CSM and within Europe these warnings have recently been strengthened, to include more explicit descriptions of the symptoms and behaviours associated with psychiatric disorders. The latest evidence of psychiatric disorders suspected to be associated with isotretinoin will be further reviewed as a commitment of the recent European review, with the United Kingdom taking the leading role.</p>

	<p pid=".182W.3/1">There is currently no system in the United Kingdom for recording adverse or fatal reactions to food supplements. A very small number of adverse reactions are reported through the general practitioner yellow card system used for medicines and forwarded to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) by the Medicines and Health Care products Regulatory Agency. The FSA is not aware of any vitamin supplements that have been removed from the shelves due to safety concerns. The provision of dossiers for nutrient sources not included in the positive lists will allow the safety of these to be assessed and for any sources considered dangerous to be identified.</p>

	<p pid=".182W.3/4">A large number of representations were received during the negotiations on the FSD, during the consultation on the regulations and since the adoption of the directive. Consumers associations, such as <i>Which?,</i> support the FSD. Trade associations for the supplements industry supported the FSD at the time of its adoption but have since changed their position.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.3/5">An assessment of the economic impact of the Food Supplements Regulations was made in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) published with the Regulations and included an assessment of the impact of the FSD on small businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.3/6">It is not appropriate for the UK Government to provide financial assistance for dossier production by small companies, as this would set a precedent to provide financial assistance for all new legislation. To date, dossiers for nine nutrient sources have been received by the FSA with a view to these being added to the positive lists in the FSD. The FSA is unaware of any company that has moved out of the European Union as a result of the FSD.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.6/1">Trees provide benefits to urban air pollution, but can also have adverse effects on air quality.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/2" class="italic">Adverse effects of trees on air quality</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/3">Trees can have adverse effects on air quality. They can release biogenic emissions known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in combination with oxides of nitrogen (NOx), can contribute to the formation of other pollutants, especially ozone and particles. Ozone and particles are known to damage human health when in the lower atmosphere. In addition, trees release pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in sensitive people, and can be associated with hay fever and asthma.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/4" class="italic">Beneficial effects of trees on air quality</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/5">Trees deliver air quality benefits in two ways. Firstly, the cooling effect of their shade can directly reduce evaporative emissions from vehicles and other fuel storage, and by cooling homes and offices, power generation emissions are also lessened. Cooling also reduces the speed at which atmospheric chemical reactions occur.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/6">Secondly, trees can remove various pollutants from the atmosphere via deposition to their leaves and needles. Trees can remove pollutants typically associated with urban air pollution such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ammonia reducing atmospheric concentrations and improving air quality. The pollutants generally collect in the leaves or bark which are then shed as part of the tree's life cycle. Trees also reduce concentrations of harmful particulate matter when leaf surfaces collect airborne particles, that are subsequently washed to the ground when it rains. The trees most suited to removal of particles are those with large leaf areas, or sticky or hairy leaves. Studies indicate that the hairy leaves of lime trees can collect four times as many PM10 particles than plane trees.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/7">In addition, trees can have a positive benefit in terms of global warming by acting as a sink for carbon dioxide, which is the most common greenhouse gas. Trees remove carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen during photosynthesis. The carbon is stored in the tree and the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/8">A recent report entitled &quot;Trees and Sustainable Urban Air Quality&quot;, produced under the Natural Environment Research Council's Urban Regeneration and the Environment (URGENT) programme by the University of Lancaster and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Edinburgh, investigated the role of trees in reducing urban air pollution. The report concluded that trees that emit the least reactive VOCs and have large leaf surface areas have the best effect on air quality. Scots pine, common alder, larch, Norway maple, field maple, ash and silver birch were found to remove the most pollutants without contributing to the formation of new pollutants, whereas oaks, poplars and willows were found to have detrimental effects on air quality downwind.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/9">In general, the report concludes that the effects on air quality of large scale planting of most tree species in cities would be positive and for example, by doubling the number of trees in the West Midlands, the concentration of small particles could be reduced by 25 per cent., avoiding 140 deaths that are currently caused by airborne particles each year in the West Midlands.</p>

	<p pid=".202W.2/1">The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Huddersfield constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road causalities in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 290,607 in 2003, and the numbers of children aged under 16-years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 4,100 in 2003. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&ndash;07 to 40.9 billion in 2003&ndash;04, a rise of 27 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK's two main pollutants&mdash;nitrous oxides and particles&mdash;fell by 31 per cent. and 27 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".207W.5/1">Local authorities in England currently spend around &pound;500 million per year on concessionary fares schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.5/2">It is estimated that an extension of current concessionary fares schemes to provide free local public transport for people over 60 and disabled people within their local authority area would cost an additional &pound;200 million per year (approximately &pound;18 million for disabled people and &pound;182 million for the over 60s). This includes local bus journeys and, where the local authority chooses to fund wider concessions, journeys on trains, underground, light rail and ferries within the local areas. The additional cost would rise to around &pound;250 million per year (&pound;25 million for disabled people and &pound;225 million for the over 60s) if all local journeys on the national rail system were included.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.5/3">An England-wide scheme allowing free travel for all older and disabled people on all bus journeys would cost around &pound;260 million per year more than the current system (approximately &pound;24 million for disabled people and &pound;236 million for the over 60s). The additional cost would rise to &pound;500 million per year if all national rail journeys were included (&pound;50 million for disabled people and &pound;450 million for the over 60s). Breakdown by cost for each local authority or for rural and other areas is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.5/4">To provide free local bus travel for all under 19-year-olds would require additional funding of &pound;520 million per year. Extending this to an England-wide scheme allowing free bus travel would cost around &pound;580 million per year. Costs have not been estimated for free travel restricted to those in full-time education; however it is estimated that a free travel scheme applying to educational trips only would cost an additional &pound;290 million per year. No estimates have been made to include journeys on all forms of public transport. Breakdown by area is not available.</p>

	<p pid=".210W.8/1">Following a consultation last year, the Department for Transport has announced that changes are being made to all the TransportEnergy .grant programmes, including Powershift, after the end of this financial year. The Government plans to move to a technology neutral approach&mdash;to incentivise the cleanest cars regardless of the technology or fuel type. The Government will also be adjusting the programmes to ensure they comply with European rules on state aid.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.8/2">The State Aid rules limit the amount of grant that member states can offer for environmental initiatives. In some cases this will mean that future grant levels will need to be reduced to ensure the grants allocated do not exceed permitted levels. However, overall funding for the grant programmes remains at planned levels, enabling more grants to be allocated to more interested parties.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.8/3">The Department will honour grant offer letters under the PowerShift programme until <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. The timescale for introducing the new programmes will be dependent on the process of reviewing and clearing them with the European Commission. My officials will be working hard to ensure that this process is completed as quickly and smoothly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.8/4">Details of the new programmes have yet to be finalised. However, it is intended that Powershift will be replaced by a Low Carbon Vehicle programme that will award grants for cars on the basis of CO <sub>2</sub> performance. The Government also intends to seek European Commission approval of a Low Carbon Bus Programme to support demonstration trials of small fleets of low carbon buses.</p>

	<p pid=".230W.5/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Blyth Valley since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/2">In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. A school sport partnership involving four Primary Link teachers is based at St. Benet Biscop in Blyth Valley. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Blyth Valley have benefited from six Sport England Lottery grants totalling &pound;493,758.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England, North East grants increased from &pound;5.7 million to &pound;12.2 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in regularly funded organisations in the North East will be &pound;11.3 million. Blyth Valley has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including the Northern Cultural Skills Partnership and the Northern Disability Arts Forum.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/4">From September 2005, schools in Blyth Valley will be included in the third phase of the Creative Partnerships programme which began in 2002. Creative Partnerships aims to give school children and their teachers the opportunity to explore their creativity by working on sustained projects with creative organisations and individuals, including artists, theatre companies, dance studios, museums, orchestras, film-makers and historic buildings. Funding of &pound;65 million was allocated for the period 2002&ndash;05 to develop Creative Partnerships, and the programme will receive at least a further &pound;86 million in 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/5">Young people in Blyth Valley have also benefited from the setting up of the Northumberland Youth Music Action Zone, known as CoMusica, in 2000. CoMusica has received a total of &pound;866,500 and 1,450 young people from across Northumberland have taken part in its local music projects and events.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/6">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Blyth Valley will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/7">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/8">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in Northumberland. The UK Film Council has, through Northern Film and Media, awarded &pound;45,000 to a number of projects by writers based in the Blyth Valley .</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/9">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Blyth Valley with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 4,135.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/10">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday/to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/11">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Blyth Valley, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/12">Tourism in Blyth Valley has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including One North East.

	<p pid=".249W.0/1">The Mk98 Fire Control System draws together all the information needed to calculate the flight data required by a Trident missile prior to launch. The Mk98 Mod 2 Fire Control System was installed on the Vanguard class of submarines at build. The Mk98 Mod 5 programme was undertaken to update hardware to overcome obsolescence and is now complete. Initial Operating Capability was achieved in September 2002 and all SSBNs had been modified by February 2003. The update programme, for hardware only, cost $39.810 million (including the costs of fitting) and $6.987 million for initial spares.</p>

All aspects of deterrent capability are kept under continuous review.

Since early January 2005, the website has also included a FOI &quot;Reading Room&quot;. This was specifically set up to publish information released in response to requests which is considered to be of wider public interest. We are keeping the Reading Room under review with the possibility of adding new Classes of Information to the Publication Scheme if appropriate.

	<p pid=".254W.2/1">Bulava is reported to be a new solid propellant submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) which has been under development in Russia for several years and has a reported maximum range of approx 8000km. When it enters service, probably in a new class of submarine, it will supplement and eventually replace older SLBMs, thus enabling Russia to maintain its sea based strategic nuclear capability. Although not expected to provide Russia with a greater capability in terms of range, Bulava is likely to incorporate more modern materials and technology than currently deployed systems.</p>

	<p pid=".257W.3/1">There is much effective practice in preventing and addressing bullying in many LEAs around the country and the 'Make The Difference' conference programme has allowed this work to be shared and celebrated. The conferences offered LEAs as well as schools an opportunity to learn at first hand from the very successful. Many LEAs were represented at the nine regional conferences, either as speakers, workshop leaders or delegates and evaluations tell us that attendees left feeling inspired and motivated.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.3/2">The Anti Bullying Alliance (ABA) has been funded to sustain the momentum created by those conferences and each of their regional leads is working with the LEAs in their region to promote best practice and develop innovative and practical approaches to tackle bullying at strategic level. Anti bullying work has a high profile within the Key Stage 3 behaviour and attendance (B and A) strand and within the primary behaviour and attendance pilot, and there are KS3 Behaviour and Attendance Consultants in every LEA working directly with schools to tackle a range of behaviour issues including bullying.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.3/3">Many LEAs provide guidance on anti bullying to their schools to supplement and localise the guidance issued by the DfES nationally, and advice to parents on what to do if they are worried their child is being bullied.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.3/4">We know that LEAs around the country are at various stages of addressing this agenda. A number are well advanced and have been successfully working in this area for a number of years and other LEAs have recently appointed dedicated anti bullying officers or are considering doing so, but some have yet to tackle the problem in a structured and systematic way. We will continue to work through the national strategies and the ABA to encourage these LEAs to move forward on this agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".260W.2/1">To ensure a shared approach across inspection, the Children Act 2004 allows for the creation of a Framework for the inspection of Children's Services and for inspectorates to carry out joint area reviews (JARs) of all children's services provided in an area.</p>
	<p pid=".260W.2/2">The new inspection arrangements will capture how well services are delivered and how well they work together to improve children and young people's wellbeing. Through the common approach provided by the Framework, joint area reviews will provide a picture of what it is to be a child in the local authority area being reviewed. JARs will replace a number of existing separate inspections for children and young people at local authority level, including LEA inspections, Connexions service inspections and inspections of children's social care. Together, inspectorates will judge the way in which all services for education, health, social care and youth justice, both individually and collectively contribute to improving outcomes.</p>

	<p pid=".279W.2/2">However, the main measure the Department has used to identify the funding gap is the difference in Learning and Skills Council (LSC) national funding rates for an AS/A2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/3">In 2002/03 the difference between the AS/A2 base rates was 10.5 per cent. Increased funding to support our Success for All strategy enabled the LSC to deliver a 4.5 per cent. increase in funding rates in 2003/04 for all colleges that agreed development plans. In the same year school sixth form funding rates increased by 3 per cent.&mdash;resulting in a narrowing of the funding gap to 9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.2/4">FE colleges that delivered against their plans receive a further 5 per cent. increase in funding rates for 2004/05 compared with a 4 per cent. increase for schools&mdash;a further narrowing of the gap to 8 per cent. We expect a similar step in funding rates in 2005/06 reducing the gap to 7 per cent.</p>

For the academic year 2003/04, base funding rates per qualification increased by 3 per cent. for school sixth forms and by 4.5 per cent. for further education colleges on a broadly comparable basis.

The guidance suggests that any member with such an interest should withdraw from the discussion and take no part in the decision.

LOS is based on hospital spells and only applies to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded (unless otherwise stated).

	<p pid=".308W.2/23">5. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid=".313W.5/18">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/19">1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant HAs, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts (PCTs). Figures are given in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/20">2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of HAs and PCTs.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/21">3. Figures for 1996&ndash;97 to 2001&ndash;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. This is to ensure consistency between years. Figures based on strategic health authority (SHA) areas have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure, which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/22">4. In many HAs, there are factors, which distort the expenditure. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/23">the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/24">asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/25">5. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies. For these reasons, expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/26">6. Expenditure on general dental services and pharmaceutical services accounted for by the Dental Practice Board and Prescription Pricing Authority, respectively, are excluded. This expenditure cannot be included within the figures for the individual health bodies as they are not included in commissioner accounts.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.5/1">Both the national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD) and the national service framework for diabetes have set out modern standards and service models for the national health service for the prevention and treatment of these conditions. Both frameworks highlight the need to pay close attention to the needs of groups, which are particularly vulnerable to CHD and diabetes including South Asians.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.5/2">To support this work, the Department produced a best practice guide for providing CHD services to South Asians last year. The guide includes a chapter on diabetes, which describes the NSF and provides some case studies of good practice. The guide aims to support service providers, including strategic health authorities (SHAs), primary care trusts (PCTs), hospitals and other organisations working with South Asian communities to deliver heart disease services to South Asian people.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.5/3">The toolkit is entitled, Heart Disease and South Asians, and was published by the South Asian Health Foundation in conjunction with the Department and the British Heart Foundation. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.5/4">In addition, the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC) has been asked to advise the Department by the end of 2005 on policy for screening for Type 2 diabetes. The NSC will advise on whether general population screening for diabetes is necessary, or alternatively that screening should be offered to specific sub-groups of the population who are at high risk for diabetes, such as some ethnic minority groups.</p>

	<p pid=".316W.0/2">The provision of single-sex accommodation is measured as compliance with three objectives we have set, requiring national health service trusts to provide single-sex sleeping areas, separate bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women, and where appropriate, safe facilities for the mentally ill.</p>
	<p pid=".316W.0/3">Compliance is measured annually at trust level, and information at ward level is therefore not available. Nationally, 97 per cent., of NHS trusts are fully compliant with our standards.</p>
	<p pid=".316W.0/4">We do not collect information on compliance in specialised areas of a hospital such as medical or surgical assessment units, where the need to provide urgent treatment may take precedence over the strict separation of men and women. No area of a hospital is exempt from the need to protect the privacy and dignity of patients, but no hospital will turn a patient away because a bed is not available in an area appropriate to that patient's gender.</p>

	<p pid=".319W.2/1">I understand the questions relate to the report of the paediatric and congenital cardiac services review group, which considered health care services and treatment for children with congenital heart disease in the light of the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry. The group reported that all paediatric cardiac centres were providing high standards of care for children and made a number of recommendations to preserve these standards. This report and the Government's response was published in December 2003 and a copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.2/2">The Government accepted and commended these recommendations to national health service primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and the Healthcare Commission, apart from one recommendation, the effect of which would have been to immediately close centres providing a high level of service, but which were carrying out less than a minimum of 300 operations per year. There was no evidence within the report to support this measure, nor has there been any since. Responsibility for commissioning national clinical audit of paediatric cardiac surgery and congenital heart disease transferred to the Healthcare Commission, previously the Commission Healthcare Audit and Inspection in April 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".330W.6/1">The regulatory circular &quot;Tenancy Management: Eligibility and Evictions&quot; issued by the Housing Corporation in July 2004 contains clear guidance about the corporation's expectations of registered social landlords (RSLs) (more commonly known as housing associations) in dealing with eviction and in particular housing benefit. The guidance states</p>
	<p pid=".330W.6/2" class="indent">'Possession proceedings for rent arrears should not be started against a tenant who can demonstrate that they have (1) a reasonable expectation of eligibility for housing benefit; (2) provided the local authority with all the evidence required to process a housing benefit claim; (3) paid required personal contributions towards the charges. Associations should make every effort to establish effective ongoing liaison with housing benefit departments and to make direct contact with them before taking enforcement action. A certificate should be obtained, if possible, to confirm that there are no outstanding benefit enquires, according to Department of Work and Pensions good practice guidance'.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.6/3">The Housing Corporation expects RSLs as a matter of course to make continued contact with local authority housing benefit departments before and during enforcement action. It is in an RSL's interest to collect the rent that is owed to it.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.6/4">The Civil Justice Council is working with the Department of Constitutional Affairs to issue a pre-action protocol for possessions cases. If introduced, then it would require social landlords to have carried out all the actions contained within before a court will hear a possessions case. In addition the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is leading on a cross-Whitehall group on possessions and evictions which includes the Housing Corporation. We are clear that possession should be a last resort and intend to issue good practice guidance later this year which will set out the steps we would expect landlords to take in order to avoid possession action wherever possible.</p>

In their Business Plan Statistical Appendix Leicester reported that 11,350 local authority-owned properties did not meet the Government's decent homes standard at April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.5/2">Leicester reported that it would cost &pound;68 million to bring these dwellings up to the standard. This covers the cost to bring existing non-decent dwellings up to the decent homes standard, but does not cover work to prevent currently decent dwellings from falling into non-decency.</p>

	<p pid=".334W.2/1">In England housing authorities are responsible for setting their own allocation policies and procedures. However, they must ensure that their allocation scheme is framed so as to give reasonable preference to certain categories of persons.

	<p pid=".334W.2/2">The Government recognise, however, that in some areas of the country there is a great demand for social housing resulting in long waiting lists; to alleviate this we have secured funding in the Spending Review 2004 which will, along with efficiency improvements, produce 75,000 new social homes for rent by 2008.</p>

	<p pid=".334W.2/4">The Government believe that the private rented sector is an important resource in meeting housing need. &quot;Homes for All&quot; states that the Government will improve access to the private rented sector for households who might otherwise face homelessness, through schemes that provide rent deposits, guarantees or rent in advance, or which offer approved lettings with accredited private landlords.</p>

Many individual local authorities will, however, have invested their own resources in developing call centres where these demonstrate an effective way of meeting local priorities. This development will often have been supplemented with funds provided by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to support their overall e-government development programme.

	<p pid=".339W.5/1">Local income tax (LIT) was one of the options for the reform of local government funding in England considered by the Balance of Funding Review which reported in July 2004. Copies of the report are available in the Library of the House. Working papers of the review are available on the website of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/2">In looking at LIT, the review found that there are a number of potentially serious risks and disadvantages that would need to be considered in detail, including the potential additional costs that the system could impose. A LIT could be potentially complex to administer and its effects on individuals or employers would also need to be examined with great care. The review concluded that council tax should be retained but reformed and that any further work on LIT should proceed on the basis that it is a supplement to, not a replacement for, council tax.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.5/3">The Government agreed with the review's conclusion that council tax should be retained but reformed. It has appointed Sir Michael Lyons to undertake an independent inquiry that will consider, in the light of the report by Balance of Funding Review, the detailed case for changes to the present system of local government funding and make recommendations on any changes that are necessary and how to implement them. The inquiry will, among other things, conduct thorough analysis of options other than council tax for local authorities to raise supplementary revenue, including LIT, reform of non-domestic rates and other possible local taxes and charges, as well as the possible combination of such options. Sir Michael will report by the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".349W.2/1">At <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, there were around 2,800 housing association tenants in Chorley. It is not possible to say exactly how many of these have the right to buy their rented homes.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.2/2">In England, around 50 per cent. of housing association tenants qualify for the right to buy or the preserved right to buy. The right to buy is available to pre-1988 secure tenants of non-charitable housing associations. Housing association properties were generally let on secure tenancies until 1988, but all new lettings since then have been on assured tenancies which do not include the right to buy. In addition, tenants of former local authority housing stock that has been transferred to housing associations retain a preserved right-to-buy.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.3/1">The 12 fire and rescue services in England which have installed advanced technology and geographical information systems to locate callers and mobilise appliances have demonstrated that local knowledge of individual members of staff is unreliable and of diminishing use. This was stated at the presentation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-13">13 January</phrase> by a control room officer who has 25 years of experience of working in four different fire and rescue service control rooms in both urban and rural areas. The requirement to have local knowledge does not form part of the selection criteria for staff so its depth, accuracy and currency are not measurable. It would be unacceptable for the quality of control services to be dependent upon which staff are on duty.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.3/2">A joint report in 2001 by the presidents of the professional associations representing the three emergency services, entitled 'Three Distinct Services&mdash;Shared Ambitions for a Healthier and Safer Community' states that the operational requirements of the three services are very different and should not be compromised. The report cited different cultures, financial regimes, organisational structures and statutory responsibilities as barriers to joint working and that the emphasis should be on collaboration, not integration. None of the three ISB tri-service projects has yet been able to implement common mobilisation systems. Control room staff in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire have been co-located but continue to work separately.</p>

	<p pid=".360W.9/1">Our Travel Advice for Nepal is based on an objective assessment of the risks to British nationals at any given time. It is designed to help British travellers make informed decisions and to avoid trouble by providing information on threats to personal safety.</p>
	<p pid=".360W.9/2">As our Travel Advice for Nepal makes clear, the country is in a volatile state at present and there is the potential for disturbances following the King's takeover of power. There is a significant risk that there may be violent demonstrations in the weeks to come, especially in Kathmandu and the surrounding valley. Such demonstrations may flare up quickly and with little warning. However, the actual response so far to the King's takeover of power in Nepal on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February</phrase> has been fairly muted and business is still operating much as usual. We have therefore judged that it was not necessary at this stage to advise against all but essential travel.</p>
	<p pid=".360W.9/3">We are keeping the situation under regular review and will change this Travel Advice if and when necessary. In the meantime we continue to advise travellers to Nepal to exercise extreme caution and vigilance, especially in and around Kathmandu, until the situation becomes clearer. If the situation in Nepal deteriorates we would change our Travel Advice to reflect this.</p>

According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the agency responsible for registering and monitoring formal cross-border refugee flows, the numbers of Ivorian refugees arriving in these countries since September 2003 have been relatively low. Between January 2004 and September 2004, Mali registered 805 Ivorian refugee arrivals, Guinea registered nine, and none were recorded in the other countries. Following the upsurge in violence in Cote d'Ivoire in November 2004, 10,000 Ivorians were registered as newly-arriving refugees in Liberia, although more than half have since returned. The same events prompted up to 10,000 Burkinabe migrants to return to Burkina Faso, but, according to the UNHCR, there was no similar movement of Ivorians.</p>

This initiative will be funded through the additional resources allocated to DFID in the recent Spending Review, and is additional to the UK's commitments to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".366W.5/2">All low-income countries with a demonstrated commitment to poverty reduction are potentially eligible. These countries are those that have reached Completion Point under the HIPC Initiative, and all other IDA-only (i.e. eligible to borrow only from the most concessional lending arm of the World Bank) low-income countries (LICs) that have a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) approved by the World Bank. Sri Lanka has also been added in light of the impact of the South East Asia tsunami.</p>
	<p pid=".366W.5/3">The list of currently eligible countries comprises 15 post-Completion Point HIPCs, 4 IDA-only LICs with PRSCs, and Sri Lanka. The cost to the UK for these countries through to 2015 is estimated at up to around US $870 million. As more countries progress through the HIPC Initiative, or have PRSCs approved, the list of eligible countries will expand. The cost to the UK through to 2015 for all countries that could potentially qualify for this initiative is estimated at around US $1,931 million. A table listing the UK's share of (estimated) annual debt service to IDA and AfDF for each country in each year up to 2015 has been placed in the Library under the title &quot;UK's Annual Debt Service to IDA and AfDF to 2015&quot;.</p>

A joint DFID/OCHA (Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs) mission to the region in October 2004 reported that most of Manguredjipa population (more than 6,000 households) had been displaced.

	<p pid=".371W.2/1">Member state contributions to European Commission development programmes are an annual, legally-binding treaty obligation. There is no guarantee that in the event of repatriation, other member states and governments would maintain their previous level of development spend. Globally, the level of aid volumes could therefore fall.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/2">As important is that working with the EC is an effective way to leverage more resources for development. EC aid equals 10 per cent. of world overseas development assistance and the member states of the European Union and the EC together provide over half of global development assistance. This collective effort has given Europe the credibility to challenge its own member states and other Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors to increase ODA/gross national income targets and global development aid. EU co-ordination led in 2002 to a specific EU ODA/GNI volume target commitment of 0.39 per cent. by 2006 as an input to the Monterrey Financing for Development Conference. This has contributed to a considerable increase of aid resources by EU and non-EU donors in support of the Millennium Development Goals. Repatriating aid would reduce the UK's and EU's leverage to help secure such increases.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.5/1">Eritrea remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The humanitarian situation has been compounded by drought, four consecutive years of failed harvests and on-going conflict over its border with Ethiopia. The UN estimates that roughly two thirds of the population&mdash;2.2 million out of a population of 3.6 million&mdash;may need food aid assistance at some time during 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.5/2">The UN Consolidated Humanitarian Appeal (UN CAP) 2005 reports that global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates in 2004 peaked at 19 per cent. in Debub and 18.4 per cent. in Anseba. Although rates are lower at present. Maternal malnutrition rates are thought to be among the highest in the world. The UN CAP 2005 for Eritrea is for $158 million, ($144 million of which is specifically for food aid).</p>
	<p pid=".371W.5/3">Last year, DFID contributed &pound;1 million to the UN CAP 2004 through the World Food Programme (WFP) and currently supports two humanitarian supplementary feeding programmes with the Dutch Interchurch Aid and CAFOD. DFID also funds a water project with Oxfam. The humanitarian programme for 2005 will be &pound;3 million, an increase of &pound;1 million for this financial year. The increase reflects the need to ensure the most urgent humanitarian needs are met in Eritrea this year.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.0/1">The European Commission is responsible for EU member states' trade policies, including import policies. As part of this, the EU as a whole operates a series of preferential import arrangements with all developing country partners, either on a bilateral, regional or multilateral basis, including arrangements under the Cotonou Agreement, the Generalised System of Preferences, and the Everything But Arms Initiative. All of these have as part of their objectives the aim of improving the export competitiveness of developing countries and helping them take advantage of trading opportunities through privileged access to EU markets. In addition, the European Commission has recently launched an improved version of its &quot;Expanding Exports Helpdesk&quot;, aimed at boosting developing country exports to the EU by giving exporters in these countries all the practical information and advice they need.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/2">In addition, the UK and EU provide support through its Trade Related Capacity Building (TRCB) Programmes. The UK has committed a total of &pound;109 million since 1998 to building the skills and knowledge developing countries need to develop their trading capabilities, almost three quarters of which is aimed at helping small businesses export both regionally and internationally. The UK provides this support to increase the volume and value of developing country exports, including widening their range of exports and selling in a wider range of markets.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/3">For example, in Southern Africa, the UK is funding a &pound;12 million programme to boost export opportunities for small-scale farmers and traders by developing common standards across goods and services in the region and improving customs procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/4">We are also funding a &pound;2 million programme in Kenya, which is supporting the business and investment climate there, in order to strengthen Kenyan capacity to export goods to regional and international markets.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.0/6">Additionally, we contribute to European TRCB efforts, which have provided &pound;675 million to develop the exports of developing countries since 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".377W.0/1">Hurricane Ivan has been a catastrophe for Grenada. Two weeks after the hurricane hit the island, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) undertook a macro-socio-economic assessment of the damage caused. This assessed that 90 per cent. of housing stock was either destroyed or damaged, and around 30 per cent. of the population made homeless. The OECS/ECLAC assessment indicated that the damage to schools, hospitals, businesses and infrastructure was estimated to be in the region of &pound;500 million, or twice Grenada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/2">Grenada had been recording impressive growth rates in recent years and was expected to grow by 5.7 per cent. in 2004. With significant losses to the main productive sectors of agriculture and tourism caused by the hurricane, the economy is now expected to have contracted by 1.4 per cent. in 2004. Some 90 per cent. of hotel rooms on the island were affected by the hurricane. A staff mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide a further update on the post-Ivan macro-economic situation and the prospects for economic recovery at a donor briefing meeting in Barbados at the end of February 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/3">Unemployment has increased with an estimated 40,000 jobs directly affected by the hurricane. However, as the physical reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure gets under way, it is anticipated that unemployment levels will start to decline.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/4">The devastation to the agricultural sector caused by Hurricane Ivan was particularly severe: 95 per cent. of nutmeg trees&mdash;Grenada's principal export commodity&mdash;were uprooted. Regrowth and recovery of the nutmeg industry will take an estimated 7&ndash;10 years. Grenada can, however, continue to export its reserve stocks for the next three years. This should help to cushion the impact of the loss of the trees on the economy. Cocoa was also affected, albeit, to a much lesser extent. 30 per cent. of the crop will need to be replanted, and it is expected that 50&ndash;70 per cent. of the harvest for next year will be available.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/5">At the <phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase> donor conference on Grenada, the IMF announced that for the calendar year of 2004, donor contributions would fill the &pound;21 million gap in Grenada's finances. At that time, the IMF anticipated that a financing gap of &pound;4.2 million remained for 2005, which would widen in 2006 to &pound;19.2 million. The IMF currently has a team in Grenada to undertake a fuller assessment of financing needs in 2005 and 2006. The IMF team will brief DFID officials and other development partners on their findings at a meeting in Barbados on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-23">23 February 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/6">One of the key financial challenges for the Government of Grenada is a high debt burden. We are working with the United States Agency for International Development, to provide a team of debt advisers to help the Government of Grenada to restructure its total stock of debt.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/7">Despite the unprecedented scale of the damage to the agricultural sector, the Grenadian Government has identified significant potential to restructure and transform the sector with support from the private sector. DFID is currently funding an evaluation of the direct and indirect effects of Hurricane Ivan on the forestry sector in Grenada as the basis for determining the interventions needed to rehabilitate and reconstruct the forestry sector. The study will implement a detailed assessment of the key damage to forestation on the island, and prioritise activities to ensure that work is urgently undertaken to prevent landslides and provide protection to the water table.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/8">Under the United Nations Flash Appeal for Grenada, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, appealed for some &pound;2.2 <sup>1</sup> million to support agriculture. &pound;1.4 million has so far been committed and assistance has been provided to rehabilitate the cocoa crop and to assist the Government in its development of a strategy for nutmeg production.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/9">The Grenada Board of Tourism now reports 50 per cent. of hotel rooms on the island are back in operation, and predicts that the figure will be 80 per cent. by the end of December 2005. The rehabilitation has been mainly funded by private insurance and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/10">Reconstruction of the housing sector is a Government of Grenada priority, and is underway. Insurance payments are being made to those eligible, and the raw materials needed are being imported. For priority vulnerable and needy families, the Government of Grenada has committed itself to constructing 225 low-income homes between November 2004 and February 2005 at a cost of about &pound;8,000 per home, and providing material assistance for the repair of 1,125 roofs during the same period. The Government are also offering a Soft Loan Facility that provides a maximum loan amount of approximately &pound;8,000 for 10 years with a one year grace period, at an interest rate of 3 per cent. A training and a public information programme on construction tips are also on-going, with model houses displaying appropriate building techniques being driven around the island. Over a longer timeframe, the Government of Grenada has set a target to construct 10,000 low-income homes under a phased programme over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/11">In addition, the Venezuelan Government has committed to the construction of 130 homes in the Parish of St. David's; the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to constructing 200 houses and repairing a further 1,500 houses by the end of 2005; and the People's Republic of China has also undertaken to provide 2,000 low-cost homes. A number of NGOs are seeking to provide low-cost, quickly constructed homes.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/12">DFID's micro finance project in Grenada has developed a new facility for small housing loans. The European Commission are considering how their micro finance programme might provide similar support.</p>

	<p pid=".379W.8/1">Along with other member states we are engaging in the consultation process towards a new Programme for Action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis which the EC expects to adopt in 2006. The current Programme for Action does not sufficiently address the needs of orphans and vulnerable children and we will consider how best to address this gap in the forthcoming consultations.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.8/2">Last July, DFID was one of the first bilateral development agencies, along with Danish International Development Agency (DANI DA) and USAID, to endorse the UNAIDS/UNICEF Framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children living in a world with HIV/AIDS. Since then we have taken every opportunity to promote its use with governments and other organisations working to provide protection, care and support to children affected by AIDS. This includes children living with HIV and AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.8/3">We will use our Presidencies of the G8 and the EU to increase action on AIDS and will encourage those member states who have not yet endorsed the framework to do so. Committing resources to implement the framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children through national plans is key to this.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.8/4">Responding to the needs of orphans and vulnerable children needs to be part of the larger picture of the AIDS response. By the end of 2005, we want to have agreement among donors and the international system on a well coordinated and funded plan to tackle AIDS which will include support for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children.</p>

	<p pid=".380W.2/1">Officials from the Department for International Development (DFID) are in constant contact with the other major donors, and receive regular updates on commitments and disbursements. Thus far, the Government of Grenada have received considerable commitments from the international donor community to provide reconstruction and recovery assistance. At the <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-19">19 November 2004</phrase> Second Donor Conference on Grenada, the World Bank reported that the total commitments were in the order of &pound;105 million. However, this remains a fluid situation, and additional monies have also been pledged from non-traditional donors such as Taiwan and Venezuela.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.2/2">DFID is leading on the development of a single donor framework for monitoring and reporting on finances and implementation progress. This will reduce the burden on the Government of Grenada to fulfil a number of different reporting requirements. It will also provide a clearer picture of donor commitments and disbursements, allowing the Government to plan better their reconstruction programme.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.2/3">The UK Government have provided nearly &pound;7.1 million of additional support to Grenada since the hurricane, as represented in the following table. On <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>, the Secretary of State for International Development announced the provision of &pound;5.5 million worth of emergency budgetary support to the Government of Grenada in order to help meet their wage and salaries bill in the last quarter of 2004. This budgetary support was released to the Government at the beginning of January 2005 while emergency response contributions were released immediately after the hurricane hit Grenada.</p>

A national workshop, conducted by the MoH in June 2004, discussed priorities for mental health promotion and strengthening of services.

	<p pid=".383W.5/1">DFID has had numerous discussions with the Government of Kazakhstan, to urge them to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a UK-led international initiative to promote transparency over revenues from oil, gas and mining. The UK Government believe that EITI could lead to significant improvements in resource management in Kazakhstan, and help to ensure that Kazakhstan's significant oil revenues fulfil their potential as an engine for growth and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".383W.5/2">Kazakhstan sent representatives to the EITI conference held in London in 2003, and signed the statement of principles agreed at that conference.

	<p pid=".384W.2/1">The anti-corruption ticket, which swept the Kenyan Government into power in 2002, has been almost totally discredited. Though Transparency International records a slight reduction in the perception of petty corruption and bribery, grand corruption seems to have returned to pre-2002 levels and possibly higher. The resignation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February</phrase> of the Permanent Secretary in the Office of Governance and Ethics, John Githongo, was a particularly severe blow to the Government's anti-corruption credentials.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/2">In continued dialogue with the Government, the UK and other donors have made clear that allegations about unsatisfactory tendering and contracting procedures are serious and need to be fully investigated. We have remained categorical that firm action should be taken against those found to have acted corruptly. We have continued to press the Government to pass important legislation including the Public Procurement Bill, and the Public Financial Management Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/3">At the same time, we continue to encourage the Kenyan Government to give their full and undivided support to the country's anti-corruption institutions. The UK authorities have assisted the Kenyan authorities with their ongoing investigations. We will continue to give them co-operation and would consider further help with investigations into corrupt cases that are followed through with energy and probity. They should be followed through to their conclusion and those found responsible made to answer for their wrong doings, regardless of position or connections.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/4">To this end, DFID is supporting the central Government systems that are intended to ensure that public financial resources are monitored and used more effectively. DFID, alongside 16 other donors, is also supporting the Kenyan Governance, Justice, Law and Order sector. This programme is working to strengthen key institutions that are directly involved in fighting corruption. There is to be increased support to the Director of Public Prosecution, Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission and civil society organisations, such as Transparency International, that work to improve the transparency of public resources. The donors will take recent events into account when making their assessments and planning their joint ongoing support, and the emphasis must be on building the institutions over the medium term, but the Kenyan Government will have to demonstrate that they are serious about tackling corruption.</p>

	<p pid=".385W.5/1">Our Country Assistance Plan, launched with the Government of Kenya in June 2004, makes clear that we want to support the implementation of Kenya's Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS). Our CAP makes provision to increase our development assistance to &pound;50 million in 2005&ndash;06, but final decisions will depend on ERS progress, including tackling corruption. Our assistance is designed to support long term change in Kenya that will lead to improved governance, and to help Kenya to make sustainable progress towards the MDGs. The faster the pace of reform, and the more conducive the environment, the faster progress we will make.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.5/2">However, we are not providing poverty reduction budget support to the Kenyan Government, since we are not convinced that the Government is seriously committed to fighting corruption and making good progress on its overall reform programme.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.5/3">Nonetheless, we believe that we can make progress on the Millennium Development Goals by supporting specific sectors and projects. For example there are opportunities for constructive engagement in, and support to, the education and justice, law and order sectors. In these we have pooled our funding with other donors to support the Government of Kenya's own strategies such as free primary education, without putting our money directly into their systems. Under these arrangements, we helped the Government to set up reliable school management systems to attract large support for learning materials for primary schools. All 18,000 primary schools in Kenya now have textbooks.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.5/4">In addition, there are opportunities even in sectors that have less well-established strategies by the Government of Kenya. In health for example, DFID is funding the social marketing of insecticide treated bed nets that is expected to reduce the rate of under five mortality by 14 per cent. (68,000 lives saved).</p>

	<p pid=".386W.2/1">Progress on governance by the Kenyan Government has generally been disappointing. However, there have been a few exceptions. The Government established a governance, justice, law and order reform programme with support from 16 donors, including support for anti-corruption institutions, police training, and judicial reform. In addition, the investigations into the Goldenberg scandal have continued credibly; all public servants (including the president) have declared their assets; land policy has been formulated and land laws are being reviewed; and there have been wider governance achievements around improved national budgetary processes and primary school management. Progress is being made in the implementation of the national integrated Monitoring and Evaluation system at both central and devolved level, and this will be fully rolled out during 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".386W.2/2">However, progress on dealing with corruption, especially on prosecutions, remains too slow. The biggest blow came last week with the resignation of the Permanent Secretary in the Office of President in charge of Public Ethics and Governance. The Public Procurement Bill has still not been passed. The continuing failure to bring the Constitutional Review process to a satisfactory conclusion has impeded progress towards the Government's objective of decentralisation and empowerment of local communities.</p>

	<p pid=".388W.8/1">Tobacco contributes 60 per cent. of Malawi's export earnings. It is produced increasingly by smallholders who make up 80 per cent. of the population. Furthermore, Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world and the Government of Malawi is naturally cautious about the risks of premature diversification out of tobacco. DFID knows of no evidence to suggest that there are alternative crops that are high value and low volume and therefore appropriate for export from a landlocked country and whose production could be scaled up rapidly under present circumstances in Malawi to replace tobacco in the short to medium term.</p>
	<p pid=".388W.8/2">However, if the Malawi Government's policies for promoting economic growth are successful, we expect agriculture to contribute significantly less to national income in the longer term and more emphasis to be placed in agriculture on the regional trade in food staples. Changes in international trade policies could facilitate this diversification.</p>

	<p pid=".392W.3/1">The Government of South Africa recognises the scale of their HIV/AIDS epidemic and, since 2000, has increased seven-fold, the amount allocated through the budget to HIV/AIDS programmes. South Africa launched its &quot;operational plan&quot; for comprehensive HIV and AIDS care, management and treatment in November 2003. During 2004, more than half a million people undertook voluntary counselling and testing, and more than 50,000 started anti-retroviral treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".392W.3/2">DFID supports South African efforts to combat HIV and AIDS through a number of programmes. A &pound;30 million multisectoral HIV/AIDS programme, approved in 2003, provides technical support and advice to Government at national and provincial levels to implement its plans. The programme also provides support to non-government organisations and works with the private sector to disseminate best practice.</p>
	<p pid=".392W.3/3">DFID and British high commission staff in Pretoria regularly discuss both the scale of the epidemic, and the Government of South Africa's response, with their South African Government counterparts.</p>

	<p pid=".394W.3/1">The UK is the second largest bilateral donor to the Darfur crisis, having committed &pound;62.5 million since September 2003. The UK also contributes around 18 per cent. of the European Commission's &euro;152 million contribution to the crisis. This year the UK will provide &pound;70 million in humanitarian assistance across Sudan. This includes &pound;20 million for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working in a wide range of sectors, including food, shelter, sanitation, and healthcare; &pound;5 million for the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) 2005 Sudan Appeal; &pound;5 million for the UN consolidated Appeal for Eastern Chad; and an un-earmarked &pound;40 million contribution for the UN Workplan for Sudan, which will allow the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Khartoum to target funding where it is needed most. When making funding allocations, DFID co-ordinates closely with other major donors, particularly the US and EC. The large majority of DFID interventions are jointly funded by other donors.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.3/2">The UK remains gravely concerned about the security situation in Darfur, and we are pressing all sides to stop fighting and adhere to the Abuja protocols on providing unimpeded and unrestricted humanitarian access and refraining from all hostilities and military actions in the region. The UK has provided some &pound;14 million to the Africa Union monitoring mission in Darfur, including the provision of 143 vehicles; 470 more vehicles are on their way. DFID also funds NGOs and international organisations providing protection to the Sudanese population. One such example is, the ICRC 2005 Appeal, to which DFID will contribute &pound;5 million this year, this includes dialogue with all parties, and interventions to minimise violence due to competition for resources between internally displaced peoples (IDPs), nomads and farmers.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.2/1">UN social indicators for Sudan are among the lowest in the world. Infant mortality is 106&ndash;111 per 1,000 live births and in large areas of the country people continue to rely on humanitarian assistance to survive. Needs are huge&mdash;the UN Workplan for Sudan requires $1.48 billion for development and humanitarian assistance in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/2">The recently ended conflict in southern Sudan is estimated to have displaced four million people. Food insecurity is critical and there is little primary health care except that provided by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). However the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed in January this year, now holds out the prospect of peace throughout Sudan. Ensuring a stable, sustainable environment for the return of the displaced population will be a critical challenge.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/3">In Darfur the humanitarian situation remains precarious. There are over 1.8 million internally displaced people (IDPs), and a further 200,000 have fled to eastern Chad. The total population affected by the crisis in Darfur is estimated at 2.4 million. Despite limitations due to increasing insecurity, the humanitarian response continues to improve. In January 2005 food distribution reached 1.48 million people, some 140,000 more than the previous month. Shelter and non-food items have been provided to 73 per cent. of the IDP population while 56 per cent. were covered by sanitation activities. Of the total affected population, 49 per cent. had access to clean water, 62 per cent. to primary health facilities and 54 per cent. to secondary health facilities. Of major concern, is the observation of the first signs of food shortages among the general population, expected after the failure of the 2004 harvest season.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/4">Other areas of concern in Sudan include the Northern Red Sea State, which has suffered persistent drought and repeated crop failures since 1988, resulting in high food insecurity for the 700,000 population. Agricultural production for 2004 was better than the previous few years, but a large proportion of the population is likely to remain without sufficient food, and will require nutritional assistance for some time to come.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/5">The UK is the second largest bilateral donor to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, having allocated &pound;62.5 million since September 2003. This year the UK will provide &pound;70 million for humanitarian assistance across Sudan.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.5/1">DFID has made no formal assessment of the likely impact of the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in Malawi or other countries. However, the WHO envisages that reducing tobacco consumption will take several decades. In the more immediate term, it is likely that national and regional policy factors such as domestic trade reform in China; energy, transport and land tenure crises in Zimbabwe; and the prospects of losing market share to expanding producers like Brazil are more pressing constraints for poor tobacco-dependent economies.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.5/2">We are very sensitive to the serious adverse consequences of tobacco on public health, in particular the growing burden of tobacco-related disease in developing countries, and we recognise the importance of the FCTC. DFID funds are not used identifiably to support the tobacco sector, but it is consistent with our Millennium Development Goal mandate to provide advice to tobacco-dependent poor countries on constraints to their economic development and the livelihoods of their citizens. This may include measures to assist farmers dependent on tobacco crops to diversify into alternative activities.</p>

	<p pid=".396W.2/1">Uganda's Poverty Eradication Action Plan emphasises the need to improve the ability of individuals to plan the size of their families as a way of contributing to the reduction of poverty. The Government's family planning policy seeks to increase access to high quality, affordable family planning services for those that require contraceptives and to promote integrated family planning information and services. These objectives are set out in the Ministry of Health's draft Health Sector Strategic Plan for 2005&ndash;10. Uganda faces a number of challenges in meeting these goals, including social misconceptions about family planning and a shortage of skilled staff and family planning commodities at the district level.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.2/2">DFID welcomes Uganda's prioritisation of family planning in its efforts to reduce poverty, and its inclusion in the Health Sector Strategic Plan. The latter will help ensure family planning is not an afterthought, but an integral part of the evolution of the health sector. We strongly support the focus on improving services at the district level. DFID also welcomes the Ugandan Government's development of a comprehensive advocacy strategy tackling a range of issues including education for young people in school and public leadership.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.2/3">The UK supports these efforts in a number of ways: through Poverty Reduction Budget Support and project assistance.</p>

	<p pid=".397W.0/1">The UK currently provides 60 per cent. of its assistance as Poverty Reduction Budget Support, as a direct contribution to the Government of Uganda's budget.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.0/2">Uganda has a well-developed and consultative budgetary process which allows donors to ensure that Uganda meets its commitment to prioritise poverty reduction. It provides an opportunity to endorse the budget at the annual Public Expenditure Review. Allocations to the Government's &quot;Poverty Action Fund&quot;, for example, have risen from less than 20 per cent. of the budget in 1997 to 38 per cent. in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.0/3">Budget execution is generally good and is closely monitored by Government and donors, including the International Financial Institutions. DFID's Poverty Reduction Budget Support, and that of other partners such as the World Bank, is conditional on endorsement of the budget and its subsequent execution. This ensures that allocations to the Poverty Action Fund are protected. Detailed half and full year budget execution reports are posted on the internet, and the Government continues to produce audited accounts within the statutory period of nine months. Uganda performs well in international comparative assessments of public financial management, including the World Bank/IMF expenditure tracking assessment conducted in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.0/4">In addition to DFID's contribution to Uganda's budget, the UK provides a significant amount of project assistance, including support for improving public financial management. These projects are managed in accordance with DFID procedures and are subject to regular reviews to ensure impact and financial propriety. The National Audit Office was satisfied with DFID systems in Uganda when it audited our programme in December 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".397W.3/1">The Government strongly supports the analysis in the report, which shows the Millennium Development Goals are off-track and demonstrates that aid works. We welcome the focus on Africa, and we agree that more countries can meet more of the 2015 targets if we act boldly now. Donors must commit more resources through traditional aid channels, enhanced debt relief, and the International Finance Facility. This will enable developing countries to develop and implement more ambitious poverty reduction strategies. On results-based management, we believe that aid should be provided to support country-led programmes with clear development outcomes and benchmarks.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.2/1">Recent assessments by NGOs working at community level in Zimbabwe suggest that malnutrition is not presently high by emergency standards, but that food availability and affordability are decreasing. The Government of Zimbabwe claimed last year that there had been a bumper crop and that it would not need international food aid during the period up to the next harvest (around April 2005). However, independent surveys suggest that the last harvest was much lower than the Zimbabwean Government claim. The Government cancelled the UN crop assessment and have not provided information to donors and UN agencies about their imports, stocks or their ability to sell or distribute grain. Even if the Government of Zimbabwe can import and distribute enough food, many vulnerable groups will not have resources to buy it. The World Food Programme continue to provide targeted feeding through their regional programme predominantly through institutions such as schools and clinics and some food supplements to Home Based Care programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.2/2">DFID Zimbabwe, in collaboration with other major donors and the UN system, will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe closely, while continuing to provide targeted food assistance and other humanitarian support to the most vulnerable sections of Zimbabwe society through NGO programmes which we are able to fund directly. At present DFID provides support to over 1.5 million of the poorest people with the goal to improve household food security through agricultural inputs and targeted food aid.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.5/1">The Government of Zimbabwe's decision not to renew their appeal to the United Nations for food aid is of concern to the humanitarian community. The absence of an appeal may restrict the World Food Programme's capacity to plan, seek funding for, and implement further emergency operations over the coming months. Many observers believe that the Government intends to control the supply and availability of food in the country over the coming months as a political tool to gain votes in the parliamentary elections, scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. Donor-funded relief programmes have remained generally free of political interference. But there has been some evidence that access to food distributed by the Zimbabwe Government is being politicised. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid=".402W.5/4" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus Customers' Charter explains the level of service our customers can expect from our network which includes the new style Jobcentre Plus offices, social security offices and Jobcentres.

	<p pid=".402W.5/7" class="indent">Where customers have literacy difficulties, we can help them or, if they prefer, we could refer them to a third party in their local area, where such arrangements are in place. For instance, if a customer had difficulties completing Jobseeker's Allowance claim forms, arrangements would be made for them to attend the office in advance of their interview to get help with completion.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.8/1">The EU legislation which includes the expression &quot;normal handling and use&quot; is applied in the United Kingdom through the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging Regulations 2002. These regulations formally refer to the Approved Classification and Labelling Guide, a practical document which contains the expression without specific advice on its application. This guide is based on the relevant EU directive and was prepared by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.8/2">We are aware that there is some concern that the present advice does not sufficiently explain the application of &quot;normal handling and use&quot;. The term is particularly important in EU negotiations when the dangerous properties of chemicals are discussed and agreed between member states. Clarification of the concept should be developed at European level and UK officials are actively pursuing this in the appropriate fora.</p>

Of these payments are being received on around 3,900 cases. The new computer system also contains around 3,500 cases where the calculation of maintenance is made under the 'old rules' and the non resident parent is categorised as self employed. Payments are being received on around 2,500 of these cases. Equivalent information for earlier years for 'old scheme' cases is as follows&mdash;the information relates to August in each year:</p>

	<p pid=".406W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mr. Simon Burns, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question concerning plans to close the Jobcentre Plus premises at Beeches Road, Chelmsford. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/4" class="indent">I wrote to you in March 2004 regarding our plans for this site. Since then, the future of our Beeches Road site has been still under review as part of a DWP wide exercise to review Estate holdings throughout Essex. I am aware that a somewhat misleading article was recently featured in the press relating to the closure of our site in Beeches Road.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/5" class="indent">It may be helpful if I briefly describe the changes we are currently planning.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/6" class="indent">With the Executive Board of Jobcentre Plus I have carefully considered how we can make benefit processing more efficient in the interests of all our customers. We have now concluded that we should consolidate this important area of our business into a smaller number of locations. Currently we carry out this work in several hundred sites and reducing this to around 77 Benefit Processing Centres by 2008 will enable us to deliver a faster, more efficient service using the improved information technology systems which are now starting to become available to us.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/7" class="indent">As you are already aware, the benefit processing work we currently carry out at Beeches Road, Chelmsford will be moving to one of our new processing centres. The announcement of our planned changes was obviously a sensitive issue for the staff who currently undertake this work in Chelmsford and a number of similar sites nationally. We considered it vitally important that our people should hear about the plans as soon as possible and that they should hear the news from Jobcentre Plus Managers.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/8" class="indent">We therefore planned and undertook an extensive programme of communications throughout our organisation, to MPs and to other people and organisations we work closely with. Even at this early stage, an essential part of our communications strategy was to set out the arrangements we are making to re-deploy employees who will be affected by the changes, including our commitment to avoid redundancies as far as possible. The timescale for the transfer of benefit processing work from sites such as Beeches Road has still to be determined, although our intention is that this will take place by 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/9" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus provides a telephone contact centre network where our customers are able to make enquiries without having to come into one of our offices. Our Beeches Road site currently houses a small part of this network. Our current plans involve this work being undertaken from another part of the network by our staff based in Derby, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-02">2 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/10" class="indent">Other face-to-face services will continue to be provided by staff at Beeches Road.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.5/11" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus keeps under constant review our Estates and operational delivery to customers. I hope it will reassure you to know that, at the present time, there are still no plans to close the Beeches Road premises.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Folkestone and Hythe will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 18 per cent. of adults and 5 per cent. of children in the South East are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>

	<p pid=".415W.5/1">The majority of tenders received are in response to low value, low risk procurements let locally under devolved budget arrangements. The Department does not collect information centrally about these tenders and to provide a complete answer to the question would incur disproportionate cost. However, information is collected centrally on high value, high risk procurements conducted by specialist procurement teams. In 2003&ndash;04 the Department let 440 contracts and framework agreements with values over the EU threshold level (about &pound;100,000). The total value of these over their full durations, which range between two and 18 years, is expected to be about &pound;2,012 million. The actual value will depend upon the volume of business we place and the quality of services delivered over the period.</p>

	<p pid=".416W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning how the employment advisers pledged in the Department's Five Year Strategy will be recruited: and if they will be exempt from the Department's proposed job cuts. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/4" class="indent">Whilst external recruitment may be required in some locations, many of the Personal Adviser posts, which will help Jobcentre Plus continue to deliver services to jobless customers, are already occupied by our skilled staff. In other cases, as an important element of the Department's approach to seek to avoid compulsory redundancies, vacant Adviser posts will be filled by re-trained, surplus staff from Jobcentre Plus, or from elsewhere within the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/5" class="indent">It is not possible to say that any individual staff member will be exempt from the staffing reductions which will be implemented. The particular circumstances of, for example, a voluntary early release scheme could lead to a current Personal Adviser deciding to leave Jobcentre Plus to be replaced by a surplus person. However, given Jobcentre Plus will increase the proportion of our staff in active roles which support customers into work, it is likely that this group of staff will be affected less than those providing support roles which do not involve contact with the public.</p>

	<p pid=".418W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/2">Since 2001, the Government has significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Huddersfield will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 25 per cent. of adults and 4 per cent. of children in the Yorkshire and Humber region are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/5">Information on the numbers of customers in Huddersfield who are in receipt of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA) is in the following table.</p>

	<p pid=".418W.2/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Huddersfield, the proportion in employment has risen to 70.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/21">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with 2,970 in Huddersfield alone.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18-years-old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 2,400 families in Huddersfield.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/24">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of December 2004, around 4,750 pensioners in Huddersfield are receiving pension credit, with an average award of 40.58 per week.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70 plus payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80 plus annual payment is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.2/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 15,000 pensioners in Huddersfield have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid=".430W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to national level which shows that 24 per cent. of adults and 5 per cent. of children in the North West are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>

	<p pid=".430W.2/19">DWP Information Centre. Figures are rounded to the nearest 100 and are from a 5 per cent. sample at <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August</phrase> each year.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; there are 40,000 people in work in Rochdale.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/21">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with over 2,900 in Rochdale alone.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18-years-old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 3,600 families in Rochdale.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/24">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of December 2004, around 5,485 pensioners in Rochdale are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;44.24 per week.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70+ payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80+ annual payment is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 14,500 pensioners in Rochdale have benefited from this increase.</p>

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".434W.8/4" class="indent">Legislation was changed in 2002 to allow crisis loan applications to be taken by telephone. Since then, a varying level of service has been offered in different parts of the country, due to factors such as the telephony equipment available in different areas. While the telephone service has generally proved popular and efficient, in the few areas where there have been problems dealing with the high volume of calls, urgent local management action has been taken to improve the service for customers. Irrespective of the level or adequacy of the telephone service, customers retain a right to apply for a loan in person at a Jobcentre Plus office.</p>

We are piloting the new model in two Welsh district offices and aim to roll it out nationally from April 2005 onwards. The model includes a standard telephone service for crisis loans, supported by the appropriate telephone technology. The increased size of the processing units will give much greater staffing flexibility and allow us to assign staff as necessary to meet fluctuating customer demand. Although the telephone will become the normal and preferred method of taking crisis loan applications, we will retain the option of face to face interviews for people who require them.</p>

	<p pid=".441W.2/2">My Department has issued guidelines for schools on the use of laminated glass or safety film to maintain the integrity of windows, and on the use of security patrols. We have also issued guidance on school security overall, and the Security Service has issued advice on protective security for organisations. The Government is always looking at ways of protecting people and works hard to strengthen our defences against terrorist attacks by having proportionate protective and preventative security in place. In schools, employers are responsible for security measures as part of their responsibility in law for health and safety at work.</p>

	<p pid=".441W.5/1">'Controlling our borders: Making migration work for Britain' is the product of a review of the whole immigration and asylum system, including appeal rights and the appeals system. The strategy sets out proposals to remove appeal rights for student and employment routes into the United Kingdom, but states that we will retain the right of appeal for family visitors because we recognise the importance of family life. We are, however, confronted with rising numbers of family visit applications and appeals. We recognise that family visit appeals need to be considered quickly, if they are to be of value to appellants. We also have a duty to ensure that the asylum and immigration appeals system as a whole is able to function effectively. We have decided, in order to make the best use of available resources, and to provide a fair and efficient appeals process for appellants, that family visit appeals should be dealt with on the papers only and to limit the right of appeal to close family members.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.8/1">The Government believe that prison should be reserved for serious, violent and seriously persistent offenders. For all other offenders, alternatives to prison can often be more effective in addressing offender behaviour than short custodial sentences. The new generic community sentence, provided by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, will be commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>. This will give the courts a flexible range of tough community punishments suitable for dealing with a wide range of offenders whose offence is too serious for them to be fined but who do not fall into the serious, violent or seriously persistent category.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.8/2">The Government recognise that there is a lack of public knowledge and understanding of community sentences.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.8/3">That is why the National Offender Management Service has launched a major communications campaign which aims to demonstrate that community sentences are both tough and demanding whilst providing the opportunity for offenders to give something back directly to the community. It will target national, regional and local media to secure the broadest public audience.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.8/4">There is a national visibility scheme in place to identify community work done by offenders. In the next few weeks a 'Clean Up' campaign will start in 10 regions, which will give local people the opportunity to have a say in the unpaid work to be done by offenders as part of their community punishment.</p>

	<p pid=".458W.14/1">Regulations 4 and 5 of the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2004 define the circumstances in which an officer may be suspended. The decision to suspend officers up to and including the rank of Chief Superintendent is taken by the chief officer of the force; for officers ranked higher than Chief Superintendent the decision lies with the police authority.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.14/2">Home Office guidance states that the decision to suspend should be taken only when the presence of an officer on duty may be detrimental to criminal or disciplinary investigations or proceedings, or when it is in the public interest to do so. This will normally apply only in cases where the complaint or allegation is of a serious nature likely to result in disciplinary or criminal conviction, and an officer is likely to be dismissed, required to resign or reduced in rank.</p>

Market testing is a delegated responsibility of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and can be applied to all prisons, whether publicly or privately managed. Under market testing the bids made in each competition are assessed by an evaluation panel which includes independent members. Performance testing and market testing processes are liable to be the subject of regular scrutiny by Parliament, the National Audit Office, and other independent bodies and there are no plans to establish any additional independent monitoring of these processes.</p>

	<p pid=".461W.8/1">Prison governors keep staffing levels under regular review. During the last two years, the public sector Prison Service has been successful in attracting new prison officer recruits. 2,420 new officers were recruited in 2003 (an increase of 50.5 per cent. on 2002), and 1,983 officers were recruited in 2004. Leaving rates are currently less than four per cent per year across the service. There are a range of reasons why vacancies may occur in individual prisons, including retirements, exits, promotions and transfers, and the time taken for the recruitment and training processes.</p>

However, at <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>, the difference between the total operational staffing availability in the public sector Prison Service (including officers working contract supplementary hours) and the operational staffing requirement for prison officers, senior officers, principal officers and operational managers was just one per cent (269 full-time equivalent officers against an operational staffing requirement of 25,704).

	<p pid=".464W.5/3">Working together with partners under each of these headings the NPS will continue work to improve child protection arrangements, enhance the service to victims, and develop a co-ordinated response to domestic abuse.

We have calculated the fees using the full cost recovery formula, which has been approved by HM Treasury.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.3/2">The basic fee represents the full administration costs of delivering the decision up to and including the appeals process and outstanding deficits for providing the service. All elements have associated overhead costs.</p>

	<p pid=".467W.0/34">Note:</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/35">The figures in brackets show the numbers of those (both male and female) that died in police cells. The Home Office records this information on a yearly basis; <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/36">Every death that occurs in prison or following contact with the police is a tragedy and is treated with the utmost seriousness by the Government, and the Prison and Police Services. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>, I announced the outline suicide prevention strategy for prisons that can be summarised as, 'Reducing distress and promoting the well-being of all who live and work in prisons.' This follows extensive consultations including those with the Howard League, Prison Reform Trust, Inquest, the Youth Justice Board, Prisons and Probations Ombudsman, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, Samaritans and the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/37">This builds on the three-year Safer Custody strategy that ran from April 2001, which was geared towards making progress in resettlement, detoxification, health, and purposeful activity, as well as staff outlooks, leadership and training. Key achievements were the placement of Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators (or equivalents) operating in all prisons, an investment of over &pound;21 million at six 'Safer Local' pilot sites, and the development of safer prison design, including 'safer cells.'</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/38">Police forces are also working hard to ensure that all possible measures are in place to minimise the risks relating to suicide and self-harm. The care, assessment and monitoring of detainees are a top priority, custody facilities have been made safer and training and CCTV monitoring has been improved.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/39">The Home Office, Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the National Centre for Policing Excellence (NCPE) have set up a Project Group to develop and disseminate policy and best practice on the safer handling of detainees in order to prevent deaths in custody. The Project Group hopes to publish this guidance in January 2006, following consultation with practitioners within the CJS and health/medical disciples.</p>
