	<p pid=".1W.6/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Maldon and East Chelmsford since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/2">In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. A school sport partnership involving four School Sport Co-ordinators and 23 primary Link teachers is based at great Baddow High School in Maldon and East Chelmsford. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Maldon and East Chelmsford have benefited from 13 Sport England lottery grants totalling &pound;3,018,773, including two awards worth &pound;504,000 in total from the &pound;108 million investment in innovative sports facilities through the Active England programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England East grants increased from &pound;4.7 million to &pound;7.7 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in the East of England will be &pound;8.3 million. Maldon and East Chelmsford has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including Aldeburgh productions and Essexdance.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/4">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Maldon and East Chelmsford will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/5">Maldon and East Chelmsford also benefits from museums initiatives such as Renaissance East of England whereby it's Hub partner Colchester Museums will provide expertise and fund 60 per cent. of a new initiative to improve access and build new local audiences.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/6">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/7">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in the Maldon and East Chelmsford area. The UK Film Council has supported a number of film-related enterprises in the Chelmsford area&mdash;including &pound;20,000 for a new feature film production set and filmed in Essex; &pound;8,000 funding to the Boreham Millennium Trust to support moving image education and &pound;2,859 to Chelmsford Film Club to enable local audiences to view a wider choice of films.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/8">The feature film 'The Lawless Heart' was set in and filmed in Maldon, directed by two local filmmakers. The film, which received &pound;200,000 from the UK Film Council's Interim Production Fund, was released in 2001 to international acclaim.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/9">Many other productions have been filmed in and around Maldon and East Chelmsford, such as the BBC's 'The Murder Game'; Granada's 'Medieval Monarchs' and the feature film 'Rules of the Game'.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/10">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Maldon and East Chelmsford with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 5,205.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/11">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/12">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Maldon and East Chelmsford, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/13">Tourism in Maldon and East Chelmsford has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including the East of England Development Agency. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Maldon and East Chelmsford.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/14">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;647,014 to buildings and organisations in Maldon and East Chelmsford since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including:</p>

	<p pid=".1W.6/30">In common with all of those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Maldon and East Chelmsford constituency are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million lottery grant. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/31">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community and informal learning value of public libraries. Essex county council has recognised this value and has undertaken various initiatives such as the ASK CHRIS project to encourage reading and lending across the county's public libraries. The project received a &pound;67,000 award from the DCMS/Wolfson Foundation Public Libraries Challenge Fund in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/32">Information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Maldon and East Chelmsford has benefited from 169 awards totalling over &pound;8.9 million. Of these, 21 awards worth over &pound;1.7 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

Music4U was set up in September 2001 and has so far been awarded three grants totalling over &pound;760,000. It has already reached over 15,000 children and young people, 85 per cent. of whom were first-time participants.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/5">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Haltemprice and Howden will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/6">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/7">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Haltemprice and Howden with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;4 was 5,615.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/8">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11pm on new year's eve to 11am on new rear's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/9">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Haltemprice and Howden, a greater say in regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/10">Tourism in Haltemprice and Howden has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including Yorkshire Forward. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Haltemprice and Howden.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/11">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;770,564 to seven projects in Haltemprice and Howden since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including St Michael's Church, Skidby; Sts Peter and Paul Church, Howden; and the Howden Historic Environment Regeneration Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/12">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Haltemprice and Howden constituency are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/13">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community and informal learning value of public libraries. East Riding of Yorkshire council has recognised this value and undertaken initiatives such as &quot;Word on the Street&quot; to initiate and develop positive attitudes to reading in young people aged between 11 and 16 and raise their awareness of the value and relevance of the modern library service. DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund 2000&ndash;01 awarded &pound;75,982 to this project. Of this money, &pound;25,000 funded a website geared to the needs of young people across East Yorkshire, including Haltemprice and Howden.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/14">Information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Haltemprice and Howden has benefited from over 190 awards totalling over &pound;4.1 million. Of these, 20 awards worth over &pound;1.7 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.2/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Tatton since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/2">In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. A school sport partnership involving four School Sport Co-ordinators and 25 Primary Link teachers is based at Wilmslow High School in Tatton. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Tatton have benefited from seven Sport England lottery grants totalling &pound;804,000.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England, North West grants increased from &pound;7.6 million to &pound;19.6 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in the North West will be &pound;28.4 million. Tatton has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including Cheshire Rural Touring Network and the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/4">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture.

	<p pid=".6W.2/5">Tatton also benefits from museums initiatives through the Cheshire Museums forum. Tatton Park, a National Trust property and registered Museum, was part of a successful bid from the Cheshire Museums forum to improve learning in Collections care. The forum also received &pound;11,900 from the Museums Development fund to support a series of workshops to develop staff skills.</p>

The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/7">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity within Cheshire. Two companies based in Knutsford have received lottery funding for development work.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/8">Since April 2002 the job of promoting local locations, crews and facilities to visiting production companies has been carried out by North West Vision. In particular Tatton Hall and Park has been used extensively as a location for films and television dramas such as Granada's 'The Forsyth Saga', 'Island at War' and 'Coronation Street'.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/9">Many other productions have been filmed in and around Knutsford such as Blue Blood (BBC3), Spine Chillers (BBC3) and the new feature film of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Local crew and facility companies are promoted through North West Vision's online production database and published production guide. 50 per cent. of Cheshire's freelancers live in the district of Macclesfield and over 25 per cent. of film facility companies are based in the borough.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/10">Since 2002 Cheshire has facilitated 78 productions generating 501 filming days.</p>

The project received an award for &pound;30,348 from the DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund in 2000&ndash;01.</p>

Of these, nine have been visited in accordance with Consular Prison visits Policy. The other three have declined consular assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.8/2">Consular staff in Spain aim to contact British Nationals within 24 hours of being informed of an arrest, and to make a visit within 48 hours. Unless prisoners have said that they do not wish to be visited, Consular staff at British posts should aim to visit all detainees whilst on remand at reasonable intervals as deemed necessary by the Consulate/Embassy. Thereafter, one visit is made after sentencing. Further visits are normally only made if a real need arises (family, health, social problems, etc).</p>

	<p pid=".21W.8/4">There is no requirement for consular staff to inform the Gibraltarian authorities about the arrest of British Nationals with connections to Gibraltar. However, Consular staff do normally inform the Gibraltarian authorities as a matter of courtesy. If the prisoner wishes, Consular staff will also keep family informed.</p>

	<p pid=".25W.6/1">Comprehensive sanctions against Iraq, as imposed by UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 661 (<phrase class="date" code="1990-08-06">6 August 1990</phrase>) and amended by subsequent relevant resolutions, were lifted by UNSCR 1483 (<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May 2003</phrase>). However, the Security Council has continued to judge the situation in Iraq a threat to international peace and security. UNSCR 1483, passed in 2003, retained an arms embargo, with certain exemptions; imposed a freeze on assets outside Iraq of the former Iraqi regime and certain associates, and an obligation on member states to transfer these funds to the Development Fund for Iraq; and prohibited trade in stolen Iraqi cultural property.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.5/1">Following Cyprus' accession to the EU, as a divided island, the application of the acquis was suspended in the north pending a settlement. Help in preparing for the application of the acquis in the north is therefore an important component in facilitating a settlement. The Government's ultimate objective remains a just, viable and lasting settlement for the benefit of all Cypriots.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.5/2">Since May last year, the European Commission has provided limited assistance to Turkish Cypriots through its Technical Assistance Exchange Office programme, which we welcome. The objective is to bring Turkish Cypriots closer to the European Union. We also support efforts in the EU to obtain agreement on the Commission's package of proposals for financial aid to and direct trade with the north of Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.5/3">The British Government are themselves funding a small number of projects in north Cyprus under the &quot;Re-uniting Europe&quot; programme within the Global Opportunities Fund. (More information on these can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website: fco.gov.uk&gt;Programmes&gt;Global Opportunities Fund). These projects are designed to help the Turkish Cypriot community to prepare for reunification and full participation in the EU. Our efforts are in line with EU commitments and will, we believe, help facilitate a future settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".29W.5/1">Reports by NGOs and in the media about prejudice and violence against minorities in Russia are concerning. These reports indicate that racially motivated crimes against black, Asian, Caucasian and Jewish people in Russia appear to be increasing. One report from the Sova human rights centre in Moscow suggests that the number of racially motivated deaths in Russia increased from around 15 in 2003 to at least 44 in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.5/2">The growth of extremist neo-Nazi and skinhead organisations is another concerning development. A report by the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights estimated that, at the end of 2003, there were 50,000 skinheads across Russia, mainly concentrated in the larger cities such as Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.5/3">While reports of growing anti-Semitism in Russia continue, Jewish groups agree that there is no state-sponsored anti-Semitism in Russia and President Vladimir Putin has demonstrated sympathy for Jewish interests. However, prejudice remains common and reports of sporadic attacks on Jewish buildings and individuals continue.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.5/4">The Government's position on such issues is well known: we condemn all forms of discrimination and are committed to countering intolerance at home and abroad as an integral part of protecting and promoting human rights.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.5/5">To help combat racism and xenophobia in Russia the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has funded a one-year project to assist NGOs representing ethnic minorities in the regions. We are also co-funding an ambitious project to bring ethnic minority NGOs and the police together in different regions to develop strategies for tackling racism and discrimination. A further project, started in 2003, provides legal support and takes on strategic litigation to protect the rights of the Roma community.</p>

The Government of Sudan have provided the location of their forces to the AU and are co-operating with the ongoing expansion of its mission. However neither the Government of Sudan nor the rebels have confined their troops to barracks. We welcome the improvement in humanitarian access from six months ago, as stated by the UN Secretary General in his latest report on Darfur. But it is still very poor, and we continue to be concerned that the security situation means that aid cannot be delivered to all that need it. We have made clear that security must improve and the ceasefire violations must stop. We are strongly pressing both sides to abide by the Abuja protocols.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.0/2">Section 36 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 already gives the court discretion to prevent cross-examination by a defendant in person in criminal proceedings, if it appears to the court that the quality of the evidence given by the witness is likely to be diminished by such examination. The wide discretion afforded judges in hearing family proceedings gives them sufficient powers to ensure that victims can be protected from intrusive and unfair questioning by the respondent in family proceedings. They can offer assistance in how questions are framed and evidence is presented. The judge also has an inherent power to refuse to admit evidence at a trial if he considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.5/1">We are aware that cattle to cattle spread of bovine TB has taken place as a result of restocking following foot and mouth disease and Defra is funding research, by Warwick University, that aims to (i) identify and estimate risk factors associated with the introduction of bovine TB in restocked farms and (ii) model transmission dynamics within cattle populations. The modelling work will take account of the exposure of cattle to badgers. The research project is due to end in 2006 and results will be published on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.5/2">While no specific assessment has been made of the possible impact that pre-movement testing would have had on bovine TB in herds restocked following FMD, Government recognises that pre-movement TB testing is important as a mechanism to help prevent further spread of the disease. Defra's advice to farmers, published in the booklet 'TB in Cattle&mdash;Reducing the Risk', has always been to consider private TB testing and isolation of any animals bought in to a herd. This advisory booklet has been available to farmers, free of charge, since 1999. Officials are currently working with stakeholders to develop detailed proposals to make pre-movement TB testing of cattle from the areas of the country most badly affected by bovine TB compulsory.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.6/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/2" class="italic">Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/3">The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food was launched in December 2002. It builds on the work of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food and is a comprehensive and long-term plan for the future development of the industry. It identifies how the Government will work with the whole of the food chain to secure a Sustainable future for English farming and food industries, as viable industries contributing to a better environment and healthy and prosperous communities.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/4">In practical terms the Strategy means:</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/5" class="indent">industry, government and consumers working together to secure a more positive future for the industry;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/6" class="indent">helping farmers add value by reconnecting with their customers;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/7" class="indent">providing good quality assured food that consumers want;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/8" class="indent">improving co-operation within the food chain and improving its performance across the board;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/9" class="indent">helping farmers secure the right training and advice to develop their businesses and spread best practice; and</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/10" class="indent">protecting the environment and rewarding farmers for providing environmental goods.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/11">Much progress has already been made in implementing the Strategy, most notably through:</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/12" class="indent">CAP Reform deal agreed in June 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/13" class="indent">Preparation for launch of a new agri-environment scheme, Environmental Stewardship in the spring this year. The scheme will include Entry Level Environmental Stewardship (ELS), which is open to all farmers. Higher Level Environmental Stewardship and Organic Entry Level Environmental Stewardship.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/14" class="indent">Launch of Pilot for Whole Farm Approach. The approach will deliver a range of benefits to both farmers and regulators. For the farmer it will reduce duplication and repeat requests for information, allow participants to understand how new standards and regulations may impact on their business as well as providing direct access to guidance and targeted information which will improve business performance.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/15" class="indent">Animal Health and Welfare Strategy, Implementation Plan and Evidence Base &amp; launched on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-24">24 June 2004</phrase>.

	<p pid=".52W.6/34" class="italic">ERDP</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/35">The England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) is principally aimed at the farming industry and provides a framework for the operation of 10 separate but integrated schemes which provide new opportunities to protect and improve the countryside, to develop sustainable enterprises and to help rural communities to thrive.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/36">The ERDP implements the European Rural Development Regulation&mdash;also known as the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy. A total of &pound;1.6 billion of EU and Government money is being made available under these schemes in England during the seven years (2000&ndash;06) of the Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/37">The ERDP aims to:</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/38" class="indent">significantly increase the area covered by schemes to conserve and improve the environment and maintain the sustainable management of the uplands through the following land-based schemes:</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/39" class="indent">Hill Farm Allowance</p>

	<p pid=".52W.6/47" class="indent">Rural Enterprise Scheme</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/48" class="indent">Processing and Marketing Grant</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/49" class="indent">Vocational Training Scheme</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/50" class="italic">The Objective 1 Programme</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/51">Complementing the ERDP is the Objective 1 programme, part of the European Structural Funds.

	<p pid=".52W.6/52">In England, three areas have been designated to receive funding under Objective 1: Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Merseyside and South Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/53">There are a number of European funds that can be drawn upon by those in Objective 1 areas and Defra, in collaboration with Government Offices is responsible for delivering the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. This fund has the following objectives:</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/54" class="indent">to help to preserve the link between agriculture and the land;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/55" class="indent">to improve and support the competitiveness of agriculture as a key activity in rural areas;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/56" class="indent">to ensure diversification of activities in rural areas;</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/57" class="indent">to help retain people in rural areas; and</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/58" class="indent">to preserve and improve the environment, the landscape and our rural heritage.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/59">Across the 3 Objective 1 areas, approximately &pound;133 million is available over the period 2000&ndash;06 for supporting projects which have similar aims to the three ERDP project-based schemes mentioned.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/60" class="italic">Farm Business Advice Service</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/61">The Farm Business Advice Service (FBAS) was launched in October 2000 aimed at improving farm business profitability and sustainability. The service has provided farmers in England with up to three days of free one-to-one on-farm advice. Since its launch, the Government have invested around &pound;28 million in FBAS helping over 18,000 farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/62">An enhanced 5-day form of the service was introduced between 2001 and 2003 as part of the recovery package announced for farmers who have had stock compulsorily slaughtered due to foot and mouth disease control measures.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/63">The service was initially launched as a four year service but it was extended for a further year through to March 2005 to help farmers consider the business implications of the impending changes introduced under CAP reform.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/64">New arrangements for the provision of specialist advice to assist farm businesses explore the implications of the introduction of the single payment will be made available in 2005&ndash;06 and we will be making an announcement on the detail as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/65" class="italic">RDS Farm Advice Unit</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/66">This new Unit has been set up to oversee delivery of technical and environmental advice to farmers, for example on minimising pollution or conservation to meet the requirements of cross-compliance. There is a Farm Advice Co-ordinator based in each region.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/67" class="italic">The Planning Consultancy Advice Scheme</p>
	<p pid=".52W.6/68">The Planning Consultancy Advice Scheme offered to cover the cost of one day's professional planning guidance for farmers considering diversifying their farm business and was implemented in September 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".56W.2/1">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, European Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country. At the time of the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal, we did not judge it necessary to take safeguard action since the South African authorities had prohibited the issue of export certificates for fresh meat from the area in which the outbreak had occurred. This meant that exports from South Africa could not take place.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/2">On 7&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2000-11-08">8 November 2000</phrase> the European Commission informed the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) (now known as the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) of the outcome of an inspection carried out in South Africa by Commission inspectors, and indicated that safeguard measures may be necessary because of some difficulties the South African authorities were experiencing in dealing with the outbreak. On <phrase class="date" code="">25 November</phrase> the Commission published legislation prohibiting imports into the Community of fresh meat from 16 districts in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The Government was satisfied that the action taken by the Commission and controls in place in South Africa were sufficient to prevent any risk of disease entering the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/3">By <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase> it was clear that the situation in South Africa had deteriorated. The Government reviewed the situation and a decision was taken to take safeguard action. This was delayed due to the Christmas period, and on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January</phrase> the Government issued a Declaration under Regulation 35 of the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996, prohibiting imports into England and Wales of meat from all of South Africa. Similar action was taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/4">The outbreak in Mpumalanga was confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>. The Commission took action in February 2001 to extend EU restrictions on imports of meat in respect of Mpumalanga. By that time, the UK had already banned imports of meat from the whole country, so no further action was necessary.</p>

Building on that, we will shortly publish a position statement, &quot;Defra and Social Enterprise&quot;, which will reflect the contribution of the sector to Defra's wider policy objectives, including sustainable development and environmental protection. The statement will reflect the contribution which social enterprises already make to delivering a range of environmental objectives, including those on waste management, renewable energy, and natural resource protection. It will also set out our plans to contribute to the continued growth of the sector. The position statement is the latest stage in a programme of work to embed support for social enterprise in the development of Defra's policies.</p>

Funding for the Government Offices are provided directly by Defra. The current Defra contribution of &pound;45.5 million to the RDA 'single pot', administered by DTI, is to enable RDAs to address rural productivity issues, which are a key factor in achieving the outcomes of the national Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy. In addition, Defra has made a further &pound;1.5 million available to the RDAs in the current financial year to assist with the implementation of regional delivery plans.</p>

	<p pid=".66W.5/1">'Promoting financial inclusion' announced a series of measures to increase the availability of affordable credit to those on the lowest incomes. These measures include the next steps in the reform of the Social Fund. The Government will abolish the 'double debt' rule for Budgeting Loans eligibility and will lower the highest loan repayment rates. These reforms will be implemented in April 2006 and amount to an increase in funding for the Social Fund loans scheme of &pound;210 million over the three years to 2008&ndash;09.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.5/2">'Promoting financial inclusion' also announced that the Government are considering arrangements whereby, in certain circumstances, private and third sector lenders&mdash;including existing credit unions&mdash;could apply for repayment to be made by deduction from benefit where normal repayment arrangements have broken down. The aim of this scheme would be to reduce some of the increased costs and risks of lending to vulnerable groups. The Government have been seeking responses from private and third sector lenders, on this scheme. However no final decisions have been made as to whether and how the scheme will operate.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.5/3">Subject to any necessary state aids clearance from the European Commission, the Government will also set up a growth fund for third sector lenders from within the Financial Inclusion Fund. This growth fund will be available to credit unions and community development finance institutions to boost the coverage, capacity and sustainability of the sector in providing a source of affordable credit for the financially excluded.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.0/1">The Home Office is satisfied that there is already sufficient independence in the immigration statistics, for which it is responsible. Immigration control and asylum statistics are part of National Statistics. They are produced by statisticians, whose independence is established under the National Statistics Code of Practice, and the statistics themselves are acknowledged as reliable. The National Audit Office's review in May last year found that &quot;the asylum data and statistics are in most respects reliable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.0/2">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is responsible for producing National Statistics on migrants entering or leaving the United Kingdom, and England and Wales. The ONS' estimates of migrants are compiled from a number of data sources, including the International Passenger Survey and date from the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.0/3">National Statistics are produced to high professional standards set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice. As such, they undergo quality assurance reviews and are produced free from any political interference.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.0/4">The Government's White Paper, 'Building trust in statistics', sets out the framework for assuring the quality of National Statistics. A key component of the framework is to conduct a programme of thorough reviews of key outputs, at least every five years. The National Statistics Quality Review of the International Migration was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-02">2 September 2003</phrase> and covered all forms of migration between the UK and the rest of the world, including statistics relating to all migrants and statistics relating to migrants subject to UK immigration control. The Home Office is about to embark on a National Statistics review of its publications relating to the control of immigration statistics, including the presentation of asylum statistics within these.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-21.215207.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-21.86W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/758" speakername="Des Browne" colnum="86W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050221/text/50221w23.htm#50221w23.html_spnew5">
	<p pid=".86W.3/1">The provisional budget for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the member states of the European Union was set out in the legislative financial statement annexed to the first version of the Agency Regulation (14766/03). The initial estimate for the years 2005&ndash;09 is as follows: 2005&mdash;&euro;6,157 million; 2006&mdash;&euro;9.754 million; 2007&mdash;&euro;15,754 million; 2008&mdash;&euro;15.754 million; and 2009&mdash;&euro;8.754 million. But the final figures are still being discussed as part of the negotiations on the new financial perspective which begins in 2007. As the UK has been excluded from participation in adoption of the Agency Regulation, we will not be making a financial contribution to the Agency through the EU budget&mdash;we receive an automatic rebate on measures in which we do not participate. UK contributions will only be made when we request to participate in specific activities undertaken by the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/2">The role of the Agency will be to provide effective co-ordination of member states joint actions at the EU external borders. Article 2 of the final version of the Agency Regulation (2007/2004) outlines the Agency's main tasks:</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/3" class="indent">&quot;1. The Agency shall perform the following tasks:</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/4" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> co-ordinate operational co-operation between member states in the field of management of external borders;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/5" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> assist member states on training of national border guards, including the establishment of common training standards;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/6" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> carry out risk analyses;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/7" class="indent"><i>(d)</i> follow up on the development of research relevant for the control and surveillance of external borders;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/8" class="indent"><i>(e)</i> assist member states in circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance at external borders;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/9" class="indent"><i>(f)</i> provide member states with the necessary support in organising joint return operations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/10">The UK fully supports the aims and objectives of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/11">The staffing levels of the Agency will be set once the Executive Director, Deputy Executive Director and the Management Board are in place&mdash;it will be their responsibility to decide what the staffing levels should be (within the limits of the provisional budget).</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/12">The Agency Regulation was adopted by the Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-26">26 October 2004</phrase>, was published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-25">25 November 2004</phrase> and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-26">26 November 2004</phrase>. The Agency itself should be operational by May 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/13">Parliament was kept fully informed of negotiations on the Border Agency Regulation through the usual European Parliamentary Scrutiny mechanisms. It cleared scrutiny in the European Scrutiny Committee <i>[Commons]</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase> and in the European Union Committee <i>[Lords]</i>on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-02">2 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/14">The Agency will operate under a joint legal treaty base&mdash;Articles 62(2)<i>(a)</i> and 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/15">No decision has yet been taken on where the Agency will be based. Five member states (Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and Malta) submitted bids to host the Agency. The UK supports the Polish bid. The Agency will still become operational by May 2005, even if no decision has been taken on its permanent location by then.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.3/16">Permanent staff of the Agency will have the same status as the staff of the other EU institutions (e.g. including the Commission). This is in accordance with the existing Staff Regulations and conditions of employment of officials of the European Communities, as set out in Article 17 of the Border Agency Regulation.</p>

	<p pid=".96W.2/1">Our first step towards eradicating child poverty as set out in our current Public Service Agreement target is to reduce the number of children in low-income households by a quarter by 2004&ndash;05. This is measured using the proportion of children in relative low income households. Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in 'Households Below Average Income 1994&ndash;95 to 2002&ndash;03'. Data is not available below the regional level and is only available as proportions at the regional level. It should be noted that the reporting of year on year changes in the regional low-income rates are not reliable.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.2/2">The threshold of below 60 per cent. contemporary median income is the most commonly used in reporting absolute and relative trends in low income.</p>

	<p pid=".100W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/2">Since 2001, the Government has significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Reading West will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 18 per cent. of adults and 5 per cent. of children in the south-east are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/5">Information on the numbers of customers in Reading West who are in receipt of disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) is in the following table.</p>

	<p pid=".100W.2/19">DWP Information Centre. Figures are rounded to the nearest 100 and are from a 5 per cent. sample at <phrase class="date" code="">31 August</phrase> each year.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Reading West, the proportion in employment has risen to 81.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/21">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with 970 in Reading West alone.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 1,400 families in Reading West.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/24">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of December 2004, around 3,050 pensioners in Reading West are receiving Pension credit, with an average award of &pound;39.12 per week.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70 plus payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80 plus annual payment is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 14,600 pensioners in Reading West have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid=".104W.0/1">The 52 week linking rule was introduced in 1998 to allow people moving off an incapacity benefit into work to re-access any higher rates of benefit that had been in payment if their job did not work out and they needed to re-claim. It was introduced as a result of research evidence which found that people feared moving off benefit in case their job did not last, leading to difficulties in requalifying for their old benefit. The importance of linking rules was confirmed in subsequent research. For example, an evaluation in 2003 of clients eligible for the new deal for disabled people identified the most important 'bridge to work' was the knowledge that they could return to their original benefit if needed.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/2">The Department of Social Security Research Report 141 incapacity benefits and work incentives included qualitative research into the operation of the 52 week linking rule. The conclusions of the researchers were that knowing about the linking rule could influence decisions to move into work; that it reduced some of the risks and anxieties about loss of income and security attached to moving into work and that it was generally appreciated by clients. There were also indications that lack of awareness of the rule reduced its incentive effect as did anxiety that the rule would be hard to access and there was evidence that this was the case. This has been borne out by recent research. The Department for Work and Pensions Research Report &quot;A Stepping Stone to Employment&quot; published last December noted the very low levels of awareness of the linking rules amongst clients on permitted work.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/3">The Department's five year strategy published earlier this month includes our commitment to review the operation of the linking rules to ensure that existing claimants' position is protected if they take a job and they then need to return to incapacity benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".107W.2/20">The figures are from the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and its predecessor the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), who collected information on pension charges and reported this using the Reduction in Yield (RIY) measurement. This is defined as the percentage point reduction in the gross return on a pension fund as a result of explicit charges and fees. Dealing costs and other implicit charges are not included.Until 2002, the figures were collected as part of the FSA and PIA annual disclosure surveys. However, they have been replaced by online comparative tables, which give present not historical data and so some figures are unavailable.</p>
	<p pid=".107W.2/21">The RIY on personal pensions has fallen significantly since the mid 1990's, from around 1.9 per cent. in 1995 to around 1.1 per cent. in 2002, where it has remained. This drop can largely be attributed to the introduction of the stakeholder pension charge cap, currently set at 1 per cent. and the FSA restrictions on advised sales of personal pensions with significantly higher charges than this.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.2/1">In the period between April 2001 and September 2004 over 40 pension providers have sold nearly 2.2 million Stakeholder Pensions, and the average charge on Personal Pensions has fallen from a 1.9 per cent. Reduction In Yield in 1996 to 1.1 per cent. in 2004, a fall the Pensions Commission attributes a significant part of to the Stakeholder Pension charge cap. This fall in charges has ensured more of peoples savings go towards their retirement, and less is consumed by charges.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.2/2">However the Government recognises that it has been difficult to ensure that the pensions industry can effectively market Stakeholder Pensions within the constraints of a 1 per cent. charge cap, and to increase the proportion of under-savers actively targeted by providers the Government have, after commissioning an independent review by Deloitte, announced a revised charge cap of 1.5 per cent. for new members joining on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> for the first 10 years of membership, reverting to 1 per cent. thereafter. These changes will increase the number of under-savers the pensions industry can cost effectively target, while still ensuring good value for the consumer.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.0/1">The 'Future Capabilities' White Paper published in July 2003 explains how we plan to make the armed forces more flexible and deployable. At sea, deployability has already been improved through six new Roll-On-Roll-Off ships. A robust and modern amphibious capability, based around two new ships, HMS Alibon and Bulwark, supported by the Bay Class landing ships, will provide a step change in our ability to launch and support forces ashore. For the Army, there will be a shift in emphasis towards light and medium weight forces. These will be supported by a number of new equipment programmes, including the Future Rapid Effects System family of vehicles and the Light Mobile Artillery Weapon System. In the air, as well as introducing 25 A400M aircraft from 2011, we now intend to buy our current fleet of four leased C-17 aircraft together with one additional aircraft, significantly increasing our strategic lift capability.</p>

	<p pid=".127W.5/1">The purpose of the Submarine Acquisition Modernisation (SAM) project is, through a coherent, long-term approach to the management of the nuclear submarine programme, to implement a more efficient, more effective and sustainable submarine enterprise through life, leading to a significant reduction in whole life costs and greater submarine availability.</p>
	<p pid=".127W.5/2">SAM is a joint project, with MOD and industry working in collaboration. It is led by a MOD team leader, with membership drawn from BAE Systems, Devonport Management Limited, Babcock Naval Services and Rolls Royce, together with key MOD project and change management teams. The aim is to reach agreement in principle on the future management arrangements during spring 2005. Subject to approval by Government and industry stakeholders, the long-term aim is to begin implementation by early 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".127W.5/3">The SAM project forms part of a wider strategy for optimising the UK industrial maritime base: other elements include the UK Naval Shipbuilding Industrial Strategy which is currently addressing future loading and skills retention within the surface shipbuilding industry, and the Surface Ship Support Study, which is addressing the in-service support strategy for surface ships.</p>

	<p pid=".139W.5/2">We do not routinely collect information about dentists' private practice. The great majority of dental practices treat both private and national health service patients. The Office of Fair Trading Report, &quot;The private dentistry market in the UK&quot;, published in March 2003, estimated that, out of 11,000 dental practices, about 210 are totally private. We are not aware of any dentists with personal dental service contracts who have sought to reduce the value of their contractual commitment to the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.3/1">In England, the Government are committed to reducing the number of delayed discharges from hospital. The launch of the &quot;Cash for Change&quot; programme in 2001 signalled the Government's determination to tackle the problem of delayed hospital discharges through a major cash investment of &pound;300 million over two years. By 2006, older people's services will receive an extra &pound;1 billion a year to expand home care services, extra care housing, community equipment, services for carers and intermediate care. The number of delayed discharges has fallen from 7,065 to 2,742 between September 2001 and June 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.3/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-05">5 January 2004</phrase>, if a patient remains in hospital because social services have not provided the assessments or services the patient or their carer needs to be safely discharged, the local authority is liable to pay the national health service a charge per day of delay. The charge has been set at a level higher than the cost of providing services to support discharge and will act as an incentive to councils to improve their assessment and service provision. It also acts as a stimulus to ensure prompt discharge.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.3/3">Hospitals are expected to take all practical measures to safeguard their patients from health care associated infections, as set out in the Chief Medical Officer's strategy &quot;Winning Ways&quot;, published in December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.3/4">It is for primary care trusts to manage their obligations effectively, within the total resources available to them. The position in Wales is a matter for the Welsh Assembly.</p>

In addition, an ad hoc expert working group on the directive met in September 2003 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-18">18 February 2004</phrase>. The UK expert's role was to provide an update on regulation of tobacco nationally and to provide an update on the implementation of the Directive in the UK. The UK Government's priorities for the work of the expert committee are to ensure that the Directive provisions are implemented effectively across the EU and that the Directive is strengthened in line with responses to the 2004 consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".155W.2/1">Information on the number of school nurses employed in the national health service was collected in the September 2004 non-medical workforce census. This data will be published shortly. In line with our policy of &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, it is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs), in conjunction with strategic health authorities, to ensure that services meet the needs of their local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.2/2">The Department recognises the important role that school nurses have to play in addressing health priorities, and this has been reinforced in the children's national service framework and the Chief Nursing Officer's review of the nursing, midwifery and health visiting contribution to vulnerable children and young people. We are providing new funding so that by 2010 every PCT, working with children's trusts and local authorities will be resourced to have at least one full-time, year-round qualified school nurse working with a group of primary schools and its related secondary school.</p>

	<p pid=".166W.2/3">Nightingale wards are not necessarily mixed-sex wards, but their old-fashioned layout offers patients little in the way of privacy.

	<p pid=".177W.2/3">However, this was qualified by the acknowledgement that there must be flexibility to reflect local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.2/4">These local circumstances include the advantages that coterminosity between PCTs and local authorities brings, as this facilitates joint-working by the national health service and social services. Geography is also important, as rural PCTs would need to cover a much larger geographical area to serve the same population as urban PCTs. Finally the configuration of hospitals and other health providers results in natural health communities which are not of equal size across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.2/5">The impact of these local circumstances on size is such that the Department has never given a figure for the optimum number of patients in a PCT. However, PCTs have tended to be larger than PCGs, as a result of their greater functions and the desire to achieve economies of scale.</p>

As outlined in the recent White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, these are aimed at increasing the availability of healthier food including reducing the levels of salt, added sugars and saturated fat in prepared and processed food and drink.</p>
	<p pid=".180W.6/3">At a stakeholder event on salt in November 2003, I called for industry to submit plans to reduce salt in processed food. To date, discussions have been held with and commitments received to reduce salt from over 60 organisations. Work is continuing with the industry to secure commitments to stepwise reductions, with the aim of reducing average intakes to six grams per person per day by 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.6/2" class="italic">Adverse effects of trees on air quality</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/3">Trees can have adverse effects on air quality. They can release biogenic emissions known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in combination with oxides of nitrogen (NOx), can contribute to the formation of other pollutants, especially ozone and particles. Ozone and particles are known to damage human health when in the lower atmosphere. In addition, trees release pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in sensitive people, and can be associated with hay fever and asthma.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/4" class="italic">Beneficial effects of trees on air quality</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/5">Trees deliver air quality benefits in two ways. Firstly, the cooling effect of their shade can directly reduce evaporative emissions from vehicles and other fuel storage, and by cooling homes and offices, power generation emissions are also lessened. Cooling also reduces the speed at which atmospheric chemical reactions occur.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/6">Secondly, trees can remove various pollutants from the atmosphere via deposition to their leaves and needles. Trees can remove pollutants typically associated with urban air pollution such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ammonia reducing atmospheric concentrations and improving air quality. The pollutants generally collect in the leaves or bark which are then shed as part of the tree's life cycle. Trees also reduce concentrations of harmful particulate matter when leaf surfaces collect airborne particles, that are subsequently washed to the ground when it rains. The trees most suited to removal of particles are those with large leaf areas, or sticky or hairy leaves. Studies indicate that the hairy leaves of lime trees can collect four times as many PM10 particles than plane trees.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/7">In addition, trees can have a positive benefit in terms of global warming by acting as a sink for carbon dioxide, which is the most common greenhouse gas. Trees remove carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen during photosynthesis. The carbon is stored in the tree and the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/8">A recent report entitled &quot;Trees and Sustainable Urban Air Quality&quot;, produced under the Natural Environment Research Council's Urban Regeneration and the Environment (URGENT) programme by the University of Lancaster and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Edinburgh, investigated the role of trees in reducing urban air pollution. The report concluded that trees that emit the least reactive VOCs and have large leaf surface areas have the best effect on air quality. Scots pine, common alder, larch, Norway maple, field maple, ash and silver birch were found to remove the most pollutants without contributing to the formation of new pollutants, whereas oaks, poplars and willows were found to have detrimental effects on air quality downwind.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.6/9">In general, the report concludes that the effects on air quality of large scale planting of most tree species in cities would be positive and for example, by doubling the number of trees in the West Midlands, the concentration of small particles could be reduced by 25 per cent., avoiding 140 deaths that are currently caused by airborne particles each year in the West Midlands.</p>

	<p pid=".204W.2/1">The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Witney constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road causalities in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 290,607 in 2003, and the number of children aged under 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 4,100 in 2003. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&ndash;97 to 40.9 billion in 2003&ndash;04, a rise of 27 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK's two main pollutants&mdash;nitrous oxides and particles&mdash;fell by 31 per cent. and 27 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.2/2">The funding provided directly to Oxfordshire county council since 1997 is shown in the following table <sup>1</sup> . It has been for Oxfordshire county council to determine how that allocation has spent, in line with their local transport plan and their priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".207W.5/1">Local authorities in England currently spend around &pound;500 million per year on concessionary fares schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.5/2">It is estimated that an extension of current concessionary fares schemes to provide free local public transport for people over 60 and disabled people within their local authority area would cost an additional &pound;200 million per year (approximately &pound;18 million for disabled people and &pound;182 million for the over 60s). This includes local bus journeys and, where the local authority chooses to fund wider concessions, journeys on trains, underground, light rail and ferries within the local areas. The additional cost would rise to around &pound;250 million per year (&pound;25 million for disabled people and &pound;225 million for the over 60s) if all local journeys on the national rail system were included.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.5/3">An England-wide scheme allowing free travel for all older and disabled people on all bus journeys would cost around &pound;260 million per year more than the current system (approximately &pound;24 million for disabled people and &pound;236 million for the over 60s). The additional cost would rise to &pound;500 million per year if all national rail journeys were included (&pound;50 million for disabled people and &pound;450 million for the over 60s). Breakdown by cost for each local authority or for rural and other areas is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.5/4">To provide free local bus travel for all under 19-year-olds would require additional funding of &pound;520 million per year. Extending this to an England-wide scheme allowing free bus travel would cost around &pound;580 million per year. Costs have not been estimated for free travel restricted to those in full-time education; however it is estimated that a free travel scheme applying to educational trips only would cost an additional &pound;290 million per year. No estimates have been made to include journeys on all forms of public transport. Breakdown by area is not available.</p>

	<p pid=".230W.5/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Blyth Valley since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/2">In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. A school sport partnership involving four Primary Link teachers is based at St. Benet Biscop in Blyth Valley. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Blyth Valley have benefited from six Sport England Lottery grants totalling &pound;493,758.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England, North East grants increased from &pound;5.7 million to &pound;12.2 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in regularly funded organisations in the North East will be &pound;11.3 million. Blyth Valley has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including the Northern Cultural Skills Partnership and the Northern Disability Arts Forum.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/4">From September 2005, schools in Blyth Valley will be included in the third phase of the Creative Partnerships programme which began in 2002. Creative Partnerships aims to give school children and their teachers the opportunity to explore their creativity by working on sustained projects with creative organisations and individuals, including artists, theatre companies, dance studios, museums, orchestras, film-makers and historic buildings. Funding of &pound;65 million was allocated for the period 2002&ndash;05 to develop Creative Partnerships, and the programme will receive at least a further &pound;86 million in 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/5">Young people in Blyth Valley have also benefited from the setting up of the Northumberland Youth Music Action Zone, known as CoMusica, in 2000. CoMusica has received a total of &pound;866,500 and 1,450 young people from across Northumberland have taken part in its local music projects and events.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/6">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Blyth Valley will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/7">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/8">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in Northumberland. The UK Film Council has, through Northern Film and Media, awarded &pound;45,000 to a number of projects by writers based in the Blyth Valley .</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/9">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Blyth Valley with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 4,135.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/10">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday/to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/11">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Blyth Valley, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/12">Tourism in Blyth Valley has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including One North East. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Blyth Valley.English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;147,940 to buildings or organisations in Blyth Valley since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including Seaton Delavel Hall.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/13">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Blyth Valley are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million Lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Blyth Valley has benefited from over 330 awards totalling over &pound;6.3 million. Of these, 22 awards worth over &pound;1.7 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

Since early January 2005, the website has also included a FOI &quot;Reading Room&quot;. This was specifically set up to publish information released in response to requests which is considered to be of wider public interest. We are keeping the Reading Room under review with the possibility of adding new Classes of Information to the Publication Scheme if appropriate.

	<p pid=".254W.2/1">Bulava is reported to be a new solid propellant submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) which has been under development in Russia for several years and has a reported maximum range of approx 8000km. When it enters service, probably in a new class of submarine, it will supplement and eventually replace older SLBMs, thus enabling Russia to maintain its sea based strategic nuclear capability. Although not expected to provide Russia with a greater capability in terms of range, Bulava is likely to incorporate more modern materials and technology than currently deployed systems.</p>

	<p pid=".257W.3/1">There is much effective practice in preventing and addressing bullying in many LEAs around the country and the 'Make The Difference' conference programme has allowed this work to be shared and celebrated. The conferences offered LEAs as well as schools an opportunity to learn at first hand from the very successful. Many LEAs were represented at the nine regional conferences, either as speakers, workshop leaders or delegates and evaluations tell us that attendees left feeling inspired and motivated.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.3/2">The Anti Bullying Alliance (ABA) has been funded to sustain the momentum created by those conferences and each of their regional leads is working with the LEAs in their region to promote best practice and develop innovative and practical approaches to tackle bullying at strategic level. Anti bullying work has a high profile within the Key Stage 3 behaviour and attendance (B and A) strand and within the primary behaviour and attendance pilot, and there are KS3 Behaviour and Attendance Consultants in every LEA working directly with schools to tackle a range of behaviour issues including bullying.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.3/3">Many LEAs provide guidance on anti bullying to their schools to supplement and localise the guidance issued by the DfES nationally, and advice to parents on what to do if they are worried their child is being bullied.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.3/4">We know that LEAs around the country are at various stages of addressing this agenda. A number are well advanced and have been successfully working in this area for a number of years and other LEAs have recently appointed dedicated anti bullying officers or are considering doing so, but some have yet to tackle the problem in a structured and systematic way. We will continue to work through the national strategies and the ABA to encourage these LEAs to move forward on this agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".260W.2/1">To ensure a shared approach across inspection, the Children Act 2004 allows for the creation of a Framework for the inspection of Children's Services and for inspectorates to carry out joint area reviews (JARs) of all children's services provided in an area.</p>
	<p pid=".260W.2/2">The new inspection arrangements will capture how well services are delivered and how well they work together to improve children and young people's wellbeing. Through the common approach provided by the Framework, joint area reviews will provide a picture of what it is to be a child in the local authority area being reviewed. JARs will replace a number of existing separate inspections for children and young people at local authority level, including LEA inspections, Connexions service inspections and inspections of children's social care. Together, inspectorates will judge the way in which all services for education, health, social care and youth justice, both individually and collectively contribute to improving outcomes.</p>

	<p pid=".274W.8/2">Like many public bodies, we have an obligation to publish a Race Equality Scheme every three years. This requires us to examine all our policies and functions to identify those that are most likely to adversely impact on black and minority ethnic people, prioritise their significance and develop action plans to address the problem.

	<p pid=".274W.8/3">We are currently working on the Department's new scheme, to be published by the end of May 2005, in accordance with the statutory requirements. In doing so, each programme in the Department has assessed its functions and policies framed around the Department's five year strategy, for their contribution to race equality. A full Department-wide examination of our policies will continue to be made every three years and the results will be published and available on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.8/4">In addition the Department is committed to the process of Race Impact Assessment, an example of which can be seen in our published assessments within the higher education sector.</p>

Accessibility by disabled pupils is already covered by the regulations; suitability is taken into account in design for build, rebuild or refurbishment of premises.</p>

	<p pid=".313W.5/18">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/19">1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant HAs, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts (PCTs). Figures are given in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/20">2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of HAs and PCTs.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/21">3. Figures for 1996&ndash;97 to 2001&ndash;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. This is to ensure consistency between years. Figures based on strategic health authority (SHA) areas have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure, which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/22">4. In many HAs, there are factors, which distort the expenditure. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/23">the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/24">asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/25">5. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies. For these reasons, expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/26">6. Expenditure on general dental services and pharmaceutical services accounted for by the Dental Practice Board and Prescription Pricing Authority, respectively, are excluded. This expenditure cannot be included within the figures for the individual health bodies as they are not included in commissioner accounts.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.5/1">Both the national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD) and the national service framework for diabetes have set out modern standards and service models for the national health service for the prevention and treatment of these conditions. Both frameworks highlight the need to pay close attention to the needs of groups, which are particularly vulnerable to CHD and diabetes including South Asians.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.5/2">To support this work, the Department produced a best practice guide for providing CHD services to South Asians last year. The guide includes a chapter on diabetes, which describes the NSF and provides some case studies of good practice. The guide aims to support service providers, including strategic health authorities (SHAs), primary care trusts (PCTs), hospitals and other organisations working with South Asian communities to deliver heart disease services to South Asian people.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.5/3">The toolkit is entitled, Heart Disease and South Asians, and was published by the South Asian Health Foundation in conjunction with the Department and the British Heart Foundation. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.5/4">In addition, the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC) has been asked to advise the Department by the end of 2005 on policy for screening for Type 2 diabetes. The NSC will advise on whether general population screening for diabetes is necessary, or alternatively that screening should be offered to specific sub-groups of the population who are at high risk for diabetes, such as some ethnic minority groups.</p>

	<p pid=".319W.2/1">I understand the questions relate to the report of the paediatric and congenital cardiac services review group, which considered health care services and treatment for children with congenital heart disease in the light of the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry. The group reported that all paediatric cardiac centres were providing high standards of care for children and made a number of recommendations to preserve these standards. This report and the Government's response was published in December 2003 and a copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.2/2">The Government accepted and commended these recommendations to national health service primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and the Healthcare Commission, apart from one recommendation, the effect of which would have been to immediately close centres providing a high level of service, but which were carrying out less than a minimum of 300 operations per year. There was no evidence within the report to support this measure, nor has there been any since. Responsibility for commissioning national clinical audit of paediatric cardiac surgery and congenital heart disease transferred to the Healthcare Commission, previously the Commission Healthcare Audit and Inspection in April 2003.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Health recently announced an allocation of &pound;135 billion to national health service primary care trusts for the next two financial years. Among other objectives, this will assist primary care trusts to invest more funding in preventative treatments including appropriate prophylactic treatment for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</p>

	<p pid=".321W.9/2">The Department regularly receives approaches about smoking cessation techniques and recognises that there are a number of methods that may help smokers to quit. The national policy focus is on those methods with accumulated independent evidence of efficacy. The Department, following guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, endorsed the use on the national health service of nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion (Zyban) as effective stop smoking aids. Used in conjunction with trained support through the NHS stop smoking service, smokers are up to four times more likely to quit successfully than using willpower alone.</p>

	<p pid=".330W.6/1">The regulatory circular &quot;Tenancy Management: Eligibility and Evictions&quot; issued by the Housing Corporation in July 2004 contains clear guidance about the corporation's expectations of registered social landlords (RSLs) (more commonly known as housing associations) in dealing with eviction and in particular housing benefit. The guidance states</p>
	<p pid=".330W.6/2" class="indent">'Possession proceedings for rent arrears should not be started against a tenant who can demonstrate that they have (1) a reasonable expectation of eligibility for housing benefit; (2) provided the local authority with all the evidence required to process a housing benefit claim; (3) paid required personal contributions towards the charges. Associations should make every effort to establish effective ongoing liaison with housing benefit departments and to make direct contact with them before taking enforcement action. A certificate should be obtained, if possible, to confirm that there are no outstanding benefit enquires, according to Department of Work and Pensions good practice guidance'.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.6/3">The Housing Corporation expects RSLs as a matter of course to make continued contact with local authority housing benefit departments before and during enforcement action. It is in an RSL's interest to collect the rent that is owed to it.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.6/4">The Civil Justice Council is working with the Department of Constitutional Affairs to issue a pre-action protocol for possessions cases. If introduced, then it would require social landlords to have carried out all the actions contained within before a court will hear a possessions case. In addition the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is leading on a cross-Whitehall group on possessions and evictions which includes the Housing Corporation. We are clear that possession should be a last resort and intend to issue good practice guidance later this year which will set out the steps we would expect landlords to take in order to avoid possession action wherever possible.</p>

However, they must ensure that their allocation scheme is framed so as to give reasonable preference to certain categories of persons.

Planning policies for the Green Belt set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2: &quot;Green Belts&quot;, which include the general presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt, will also apply in any case where development on Green Belt land is proposed.</p>
	<p pid=".336W.2/2">Much of the surplus public sector land that has been identified for affordable housing by the Government is brownfield.</p>

	<p pid=".337W.3/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not made any specific investments in or appraisals of local authority call centres. Many individual local authorities will, however, have invested their own resources in developing call centres where these demonstrate an effective way of meeting local priorities. This development will often have been supplemented with funds provided by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to support their overall e-government development programme. Local authorities recognise the contribution effective initial contact can make to efficient service delivery.</p>

Most recently this has included two five year plans: &quot;Sustainable Communities: Homes for All&quot; and &quot;Sustainable Communities: People, Places and Prosperity&quot;. Together these plans show how the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will take forward its agenda of creating Sustainable communities, first described in the 2003 &quot;Sustainable Communities Plan&quot;.

In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government has published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &pound;500 or more during each financial year. The list published in 1999 covers the period <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-31">31 March 1999</phrase>. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government has also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers' visits overseas.

	<p pid=".351W.2/1">The Government commissioned an Independent Review into the Supporting People programme following significant late growth in estimated costs from &pound;1.4 billion in December 2002 to &pound;1.8 billion by March 2003. The review reported in January 2004 that there are wide variations in unit costs between authorities and that &pound;1.8 billion was too much to pay for the services provided.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.2/2">Reductions in Supporting People programme grant reflect the findings of the Independent Review and subsequent work carried out on value for money including work commissioned into the efficient use of legacy funding and the results of Audit Commission inspections. These studies demonstrate that there is significant potential for making savings in the current pattern of service provision whilst safeguarding valuable services.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has taken no decisions about the longer term distribution. A formula for the distribution of Supporting People funding in the longer term is being developed. We are working with local authority representative bodies and will consult widely on a revised version later this year. The extent of the increases or reductions and the rate of which they are introduced are open to further consideration. We will include this issue in the consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".356W.0/1">There is no &quot;EU Intelligence Sharing and Co-ordination Service&quot;. The EU's Joint Situation Centre does not share or co-ordinate intelligence. The Situation Centre produces analyses and risk assessments, to help formulate EU policy, based on inputs from member states including nationally-assessed material. The Government's policy on release of material was set out in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-10">10 January 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-01-10.13W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 13W</phrase>: UK information is released to the Situation Centre on a strict need-to-know basis at classifications up to and including secret.</p>
	<p pid=".356W.0/2">It would not be appropriate for the Government to give details of the information which has been released to the centre. Parallel exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act would likely be section 23 (information supplied by, or related to, bodies dealing with security matters), section 24 (national security) and section 27 (international relations).</p>

	<p pid=".366W.5/1">Under the new multilateral debt relief initiative, the UK will pay 10 per cent. of the debt service owed to the International Development Association (IDA) and African Development Fund (AfDF) on behalf the world's poorest countries. This initiative will be funded through the additional resources allocated to DFID in the recent Spending Review, and is additional to the UK's commitments to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".366W.5/2">All low-income countries with a demonstrated commitment to poverty reduction are potentially eligible. These countries are those that have reached Completion Point under the HIPC Initiative, and all other IDA-only (i.e. eligible to borrow only from the most concessional lending arm of the World Bank) low-income countries (LICs) that have a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) approved by the World Bank. Sri Lanka has also been added in light of the impact of the South East Asia tsunami.</p>
	<p pid=".366W.5/3">The list of currently eligible countries comprises 15 post-Completion Point HIPCs, 4 IDA-only LICs with PRSCs, and Sri Lanka. The cost to the UK for these countries through to 2015 is estimated at up to around US $870 million. As more countries progress through the HIPC Initiative, or have PRSCs approved, the list of eligible countries will expand. The cost to the UK through to 2015 for all countries that could potentially qualify for this initiative is estimated at around US $1,931 million. A table listing the UK's share of (estimated) annual debt service to IDA and AfDF for each country in each year up to 2015 has been placed in the Library under the title &quot;UK's Annual Debt Service to IDA and AfDF to 2015&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".370W.3/1">DFID is already funding significant disaster risk reduction programmes in countries particularly susceptible to natural disasters, including India where we are providing over &pound;60 million on disaster preparedness and reconstruction in Orissa over six years. DFID is the leading donor to the UN's International Strategy for Disaster Reduction at &pound;1 million a year. We are also supporting other international organisations' efforts in this area including the International Federation of Red Cross and Crescent Societies and the Prevention Consortium Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.3/2">We aim to increase our spending on disaster risk reduction. Where practical, we will allocate up to 10 per cent. of each natural disaster response to mitigate the impact of future disasters. We also plan to develop a strategy to set out how we can best make further progress in this sector.</p>

	<p pid=".370W.3/4">The UK Delegation, led by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development discussed disaster risk reduction with a number of developing countries at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, including those most affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami. We stressed the importance of disaster risk reduction and encouraged the inclusion of disaster risk reduction measures, where appropriate, in countries' poverty reduction strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.2/1">Member state contributions to European Commission development programmes are an annual, legally-binding treaty obligation. There is no guarantee that in the event of repatriation, other member states and governments would maintain their previous level of development spend. Globally, the level of aid volumes could therefore fall.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/2">As important is that working with the EC is an effective way to leverage more resources for development. EC aid equals 10 per cent. of world overseas development assistance and the member states of the European Union and the EC together provide over half of global development assistance. This collective effort has given Europe the credibility to challenge its own member states and other Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors to increase ODA/gross national income targets and global development aid. EU co-ordination led in 2002 to a specific EU ODA/GNI volume target commitment of 0.39 per cent. by 2006 as an input to the Monterrey Financing for Development Conference. This has contributed to a considerable increase of aid resources by EU and non-EU donors in support of the Millennium Development Goals. Repatriating aid would reduce the UK's and EU's leverage to help secure such increases.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.5/1">Eritrea remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The humanitarian situation has been compounded by drought, four consecutive years of failed harvests and on-going conflict over its border with Ethiopia. The UN estimates that roughly two thirds of the population&mdash;2.2 million out of a population of 3.6 million&mdash;may need food aid assistance at some time during 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.5/2">The UN Consolidated Humanitarian Appeal (UN CAP) 2005 reports that global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates in 2004 peaked at 19 per cent. in Debub and 18.4 per cent. in Anseba. Although rates are lower at present. Maternal malnutrition rates are thought to be among the highest in the world. The UN CAP 2005 for Eritrea is for $158 million, ($144 million of which is specifically for food aid).</p>
	<p pid=".371W.5/3">Last year, DFID contributed &pound;1 million to the UN CAP 2004 through the World Food Programme (WFP) and currently supports two humanitarian supplementary feeding programmes with the Dutch Interchurch Aid and CAFOD. DFID also funds a water project with Oxfam. The humanitarian programme for 2005 will be &pound;3 million, an increase of &pound;1 million for this financial year. The increase reflects the need to ensure the most urgent humanitarian needs are met in Eritrea this year.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.0/1">The European Commission is responsible for EU member states' trade policies, including import policies. As part of this, the EU as a whole operates a series of preferential import arrangements with all developing country partners, either on a bilateral, regional or multilateral basis, including arrangements under the Cotonou Agreement, the Generalised System of Preferences, and the Everything But Arms Initiative. All of these have as part of their objectives the aim of improving the export competitiveness of developing countries and helping them take advantage of trading opportunities through privileged access to EU markets. In addition, the European Commission has recently launched an improved version of its &quot;Expanding Exports Helpdesk&quot;, aimed at boosting developing country exports to the EU by giving exporters in these countries all the practical information and advice they need.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/2">In addition, the UK and EU provide support through its Trade Related Capacity Building (TRCB) Programmes. The UK has committed a total of &pound;109 million since 1998 to building the skills and knowledge developing countries need to develop their trading capabilities, almost three quarters of which is aimed at helping small businesses export both regionally and internationally. The UK provides this support to increase the volume and value of developing country exports, including widening their range of exports and selling in a wider range of markets.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/3">For example, in Southern Africa, the UK is funding a &pound;12 million programme to boost export opportunities for small-scale farmers and traders by developing common standards across goods and services in the region and improving customs procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/4">We are also funding a &pound;2 million programme in Kenya, which is supporting the business and investment climate there, in order to strengthen Kenyan capacity to export goods to regional and international markets.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/5">The UK is also funding a &pound;17 million programme which will enable small enterprises from Nigeria to access new commodity and services markets&mdash;including international markets.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/6">Additionally, we contribute to European TRCB efforts, which have provided &pound;675 million to develop the exports of developing countries since 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".377W.0/1">Hurricane Ivan has been a catastrophe for Grenada. Two weeks after the hurricane hit the island, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) undertook a macro-socio-economic assessment of the damage caused. This assessed that 90 per cent. of housing stock was either destroyed or damaged, and around 30 per cent. of the population made homeless. The OECS/ECLAC assessment indicated that the damage to schools, hospitals, businesses and infrastructure was estimated to be in the region of &pound;500 million, or twice Grenada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/2">Grenada had been recording impressive growth rates in recent years and was expected to grow by 5.7 per cent. in 2004. With significant losses to the main productive sectors of agriculture and tourism caused by the hurricane, the economy is now expected to have contracted by 1.4 per cent. in 2004. Some 90 per cent. of hotel rooms on the island were affected by the hurricane. A staff mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide a further update on the post-Ivan macro-economic situation and the prospects for economic recovery at a donor briefing meeting in Barbados at the end of February 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/3">Unemployment has increased with an estimated 40,000 jobs directly affected by the hurricane. However, as the physical reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure gets under way, it is anticipated that unemployment levels will start to decline.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/4">The devastation to the agricultural sector caused by Hurricane Ivan was particularly severe: 95 per cent. of nutmeg trees&mdash;Grenada's principal export commodity&mdash;were uprooted. Regrowth and recovery of the nutmeg industry will take an estimated 7&ndash;10 years. Grenada can, however, continue to export its reserve stocks for the next three years. This should help to cushion the impact of the loss of the trees on the economy. Cocoa was also affected, albeit, to a much lesser extent. 30 per cent. of the crop will need to be replanted, and it is expected that 50&ndash;70 per cent. of the harvest for next year will be available.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/5">At the <phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase> donor conference on Grenada, the IMF announced that for the calendar year of 2004, donor contributions would fill the &pound;21 million gap in Grenada's finances. At that time, the IMF anticipated that a financing gap of &pound;4.2 million remained for 2005, which would widen in 2006 to &pound;19.2 million. The IMF currently has a team in Grenada to undertake a fuller assessment of financing needs in 2005 and 2006. The IMF team will brief DFID officials and other development partners on their findings at a meeting in Barbados on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-23">23 February 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/6">One of the key financial challenges for the Government of Grenada is a high debt burden. We are working with the United States Agency for International Development, to provide a team of debt advisers to help the Government of Grenada to restructure its total stock of debt.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/7">Despite the unprecedented scale of the damage to the agricultural sector, the Grenadian Government has identified significant potential to restructure and transform the sector with support from the private sector. DFID is currently funding an evaluation of the direct and indirect effects of Hurricane Ivan on the forestry sector in Grenada as the basis for determining the interventions needed to rehabilitate and reconstruct the forestry sector. The study will implement a detailed assessment of the key damage to forestation on the island, and prioritise activities to ensure that work is urgently undertaken to prevent landslides and provide protection to the water table.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/8">Under the United Nations Flash Appeal for Grenada, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, appealed for some &pound;2.2 <sup>1</sup> million to support agriculture. &pound;1.4 million has so far been committed and assistance has been provided to rehabilitate the cocoa crop and to assist the Government in its development of a strategy for nutmeg production.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/9">The Grenada Board of Tourism now reports 50 per cent. of hotel rooms on the island are back in operation, and predicts that the figure will be 80 per cent. by the end of December 2005. The rehabilitation has been mainly funded by private insurance and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/10">Reconstruction of the housing sector is a Government of Grenada priority, and is underway. Insurance payments are being made to those eligible, and the raw materials needed are being imported. For priority vulnerable and needy families, the Government of Grenada has committed itself to constructing 225 low-income homes between November 2004 and February 2005 at a cost of about &pound;8,000 per home, and providing material assistance for the repair of 1,125 roofs during the same period. The Government are also offering a Soft Loan Facility that provides a maximum loan amount of approximately &pound;8,000 for 10 years with a one year grace period, at an interest rate of 3 per cent. A training and a public information programme on construction tips are also on-going, with model houses displaying appropriate building techniques being driven around the island. Over a longer timeframe, the Government of Grenada has set a target to construct 10,000 low-income homes under a phased programme over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/11">In addition, the Venezuelan Government has committed to the construction of 130 homes in the Parish of St. David's; the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to constructing 200 houses and repairing a further 1,500 houses by the end of 2005; and the People's Republic of China has also undertaken to provide 2,000 low-cost homes. A number of NGOs are seeking to provide low-cost, quickly constructed homes.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.0/12">DFID's micro finance project in Grenada has developed a new facility for small housing loans. The European Commission are considering how their micro finance programme might provide similar support.</p>

	<p pid=".384W.2/1">The anti-corruption ticket, which swept the Kenyan Government into power in 2002, has been almost totally discredited. Though Transparency International records a slight reduction in the perception of petty corruption and bribery, grand corruption seems to have returned to pre-2002 levels and possibly higher. The resignation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase> of the Permanent Secretary in the Office of Governance and Ethics, John Githongo, was a particularly severe blow to the Government's anti-corruption credentials.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/2">In continued dialogue with the Government, the UK and other donors have made clear that allegations about unsatisfactory tendering and contracting procedures are serious and need to be fully investigated. We have remained categorical that firm action should be taken against those found to have acted corruptly. We have continued to press the Government to pass important legislation including the Public Procurement Bill, and the Public Financial Management Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/3">At the same time, we continue to encourage the Kenyan Government to give their full and undivided support to the country's anti-corruption institutions. The UK authorities have assisted the Kenyan authorities with their ongoing investigations. We will continue to give them co-operation and would consider further help with investigations into corrupt cases that are followed through with energy and probity. They should be followed through to their conclusion and those found responsible made to answer for their wrong doings, regardless of position or connections.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/4">To this end, DFID is supporting the central Government systems that are intended to ensure that public financial resources are monitored and used more effectively. DFID, alongside 16 other donors, is also supporting the Kenyan Governance, Justice, Law and Order sector. This programme is working to strengthen key institutions that are directly involved in fighting corruption. There is to be increased support to the Director of Public Prosecution, Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission and civil society organisations, such as Transparency International, that work to improve the transparency of public resources. The donors will take recent events into account when making their assessments and planning their joint ongoing support, and the emphasis must be on building the institutions over the medium term, but the Kenyan Government will have to demonstrate that they are serious about tackling corruption.</p>

	<p pid=".385W.5/1">Our Country Assistance Plan, launched with the Government of Kenya in June 2004, makes clear that we want to support the implementation of Kenya's Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS). Our CAP makes provision to increase our development assistance to &pound;50 million in 2005&ndash;06, but final decisions will depend on ERS progress, including tackling corruption. Our assistance is designed to support long term change in Kenya that will lead to improved governance, and to help Kenya to make sustainable progress towards the MDGs. The faster the pace of reform, and the more conducive the environment, the faster progress we will make.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.5/2">However, we are not providing poverty reduction budget support to the Kenyan Government, since we are not convinced that the Government is seriously committed to fighting corruption and making good progress on its overall reform programme.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.5/3">Nonetheless, we believe that we can make progress on the Millennium Development Goals by supporting specific sectors and projects. For example there are opportunities for constructive engagement in, and support to, the education and justice, law and order sectors. In these we have pooled our funding with other donors to support the Government of Kenya's own strategies such as free primary education, without putting our money directly into their systems. Under these arrangements, we helped the Government to set up reliable school management systems to attract large support for learning materials for primary schools. All 18,000 primary schools in Kenya now have textbooks.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.5/4">In addition, there are opportunities even in sectors that have less well-established strategies by the Government of Kenya. In health for example, DFID is funding the social marketing of insecticide treated bed nets that is expected to reduce the rate of under five mortality by 14 per cent. (68,000 lives saved).</p>

These figures take into account recent voluntary facilitated returns of nearly 7,000 refugees from neighbouring countries, but may not take into account unofficial spontaneous repatriation.

South Africa launched its &quot;operational plan&quot; for comprehensive HIV and AIDS care, management and treatment in November 2003.

	<p pid=".394W.3/1">The UK is the second largest bilateral donor to the Darfur crisis, having committed &pound;62.5 million since September 2003. The UK also contributes around 18 per cent. of the European Commission's &euro;152 million contribution to the crisis. This year the UK will provide &pound;70 million in humanitarian assistance across Sudan. This includes &pound;20 million for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working in a wide range of sectors, including food, shelter, sanitation, and healthcare; &pound;5 million for the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) 2005 Sudan Appeal; &pound;5 million for the UN consolidated Appeal for Eastern Chad; and an un-earmarked &pound;40 million contribution for the UN Workplan for Sudan, which will allow the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Khartoum to target funding where it is needed most. When making funding allocations, DFID co-ordinates closely with other major donors, particularly the US and EC. The large majority of DFID interventions are jointly funded by other donors.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.3/2">The UK remains gravely concerned about the security situation in Darfur, and we are pressing all sides to stop fighting and adhere to the Abuja protocols on providing unimpeded and unrestricted humanitarian access and refraining from all hostilities and military actions in the region. The UK has provided some &pound;14 million to the Africa Union monitoring mission in Darfur, including the provision of 143 vehicles; 470 more vehicles are on their way. DFID also funds NGOs and international organisations providing protection to the Sudanese population. One such example is, the ICRC 2005 Appeal, to which DFID will contribute &pound;5 million this year, this includes dialogue with all parties, and interventions to minimise violence due to competition for resources between internally displaced peoples (IDPs), nomads and farmers.</p>

	<p pid=".397W.0/1">The UK currently provides 60 per cent. of its assistance as Poverty Reduction Budget Support, as a direct contribution to the Government of Uganda's budget.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.0/2">Uganda has a well-developed and consultative budgetary process which allows donors to ensure that Uganda meets its commitment to prioritise poverty reduction. It provides an opportunity to endorse the budget at the annual Public Expenditure Review. Allocations to the Government's &quot;Poverty Action Fund&quot;, for example, have risen from less than 20 per cent. of the budget in 1997 to 38 per cent. in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.0/3">Budget execution is generally good and is closely monitored by Government and donors, including the International Financial Institutions. DFID's Poverty Reduction Budget Support, and that of other partners such as the World Bank, is conditional on endorsement of the budget and its subsequent execution. This ensures that allocations to the Poverty Action Fund are protected. Detailed half and full year budget execution reports are posted on the internet, and the Government continues to produce audited accounts within the statutory period of nine months. Uganda performs well in international comparative assessments of public financial management, including the World Bank/IMF expenditure tracking assessment conducted in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.0/4">In addition to DFID's contribution to Uganda's budget, the UK provides a significant amount of project assistance, including support for improving public financial management. These projects are managed in accordance with DFID procedures and are subject to regular reviews to ensure impact and financial propriety. The National Audit Office was satisfied with DFID systems in Uganda when it audited our programme in December 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.5/1">The Government of Zimbabwe's decision not to renew their appeal to the United Nations for food aid is of concern to the humanitarian community. The absence of an appeal may restrict the World Food Programme's capacity to plan, seek funding for, and implement further emergency operations over the coming months. Many observers believe that the Government intends to control the supply and availability of food in the country over the coming months as a political tool to gain votes in the parliamentary elections, scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. Donor-funded relief programmes have remained generally free of political interference. But there has been some evidence that access to food distributed by the Zimbabwe Government is being politicised. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.8/1">The EU legislation which includes the expression &quot;normal handling and use&quot; is applied in the United Kingdom through the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging Regulations 2002. These regulations formally refer to the Approved Classification and Labelling Guide, a practical document which contains the expression without specific advice on its application. This guide is based on the relevant EU directive and was prepared by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.8/2">We are aware that there is some concern that the present advice does not sufficiently explain the application of &quot;normal handling and use&quot;. The term is particularly important in EU negotiations when the dangerous properties of chemicals are discussed and agreed between member states. Clarification of the concept should be developed at European level and UK officials are actively pursuing this in the appropriate fora.</p>

The vast majority of the DWP Estate has been occupied under the terms of the PRIME PFI contract since April 1998.

	<p pid=".462W.8/1">Race equality is a core standard for the Prison Service that must permeate everything that it does. The Service works hard to ensure that all aspects of current and future policy, functions and activities take full account of race equality issues and promote good race relations, adopting a zero tolerance approach of anyone who holds racist views. The Service has dismissed a number of staff for their actions and was the first public sector employer to prevent staff being members of racist organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.8/2">The joint CRE/Prison Service Action Plan &quot;Implementing Race Equality in Prisons: A shared agenda for change&quot; represents a milestone for race relations in the Service. It specifically focuses on the key areas of work identified by the Commission for Racial Equality in its formal investigation, and sets out the work which the Service will undertake to meet its commitment to race equality by making race equality an integral part of all that the Service does.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.8/3">The Prison Service is currently reviewing its Race Equality Scheme for 2002&ndash;05, and is drawing up plans to deliver race equality in 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.8/4">The Prison Service has a responsibility to keep prisoners and staff safe. A Service-wide Violence Reduction Strategy has been developed through the work of the Safer Custody Group. Prison Service Order 2,750 directs every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.8/5">Each establishment is required to undertake regular analysis of the problem areas and provide an action plan to improve personal safety.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.8/6">An intranet toolkit supports the violence reduction PSO and guides establishments to develop practical solutions, including environmental and physical measures as well as alternatives for behaviour management. Specific issues such as racism, are covered with good practice examples.</p>

	<p pid=".465W.5/2">This information is not currently held centrally. However, under the requirements of the best value performance indicator (BVPI) 2B for local government, all fire and rescue authorities are in the process of providing the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with information relevant to their compliance with their statutory responsibilities under the Race Relations (Amendment ) Act (RR(A)A) 2000. This information will be reported in our publication &quot;The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Best Value Performance Indicators 2003&ndash;04&quot; which will be available this spring. This report will be published on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website and copies will be available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid=".465W.5/3">Additionally the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is gathering more in-depth information on the service's compliance with the requirements of the RR(A)A 2000, in particular with regard to action planning and impact assessment. The results of this exercise will be reported to the Fire and Rescue Service Practitioners' Forum in June.</p>

	<p pid=".467W.0/34">Note:</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/35">The figures in brackets show the numbers of those (both male and female) that died in police cells. The Home Office records this information on a yearly basis; <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/36">Every death that occurs in prison or following contact with the police is a tragedy and is treated with the utmost seriousness by the Government, and the Prison and Police Services. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>, I announced the outline suicide prevention strategy for prisons that can be summarised as, 'Reducing distress and promoting the well-being of all who live and work in prisons.' This follows extensive consultations including those with the Howard League, Prison Reform Trust, Inquest, the Youth Justice Board, Prisons and Probations Ombudsman, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, Samaritans and the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/37">This builds on the three-year Safer Custody strategy that ran from April 2001, which was geared towards making progress in resettlement, detoxification, health, and purposeful activity, as well as staff outlooks, leadership and training. Key achievements were the placement of Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators (or equivalents) operating in all prisons, an investment of over &pound;21 million at six 'Safer Local' pilot sites, and the development of safer prison design, including 'safer cells.'</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/38">Police forces are also working hard to ensure that all possible measures are in place to minimise the risks relating to suicide and self-harm. The care, assessment and monitoring of detainees are a top priority, custody facilities have been made safer and training and CCTV monitoring has been improved.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.0/39">The Home Office, Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the National Centre for Policing Excellence (NCPE) have set up a Project Group to develop and disseminate policy and best practice on the safer handling of detainees in order to prevent deaths in custody. The Project Group hopes to publish this guidance in January 2006, following consultation with practitioners within the CJS and health/medical disciples.</p>
