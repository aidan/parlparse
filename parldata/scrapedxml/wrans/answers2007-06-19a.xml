An exercise is under way to assess the technical facilities and procedures needed to create and deliver video effectively, and the use of BSL videos will be considered as part of this work. DFID aims to make its website as accessible as possible, and an independent review of the site recently gave it a high rating for accessibility.

	<p pid="a.1595W.2/1">DFID's primary involvement with fossil fuel extraction projects in developing countries is an indirect one, as a &quot;shareholder&quot; in multilateral financial institutions, such as the World Bank group and the Regional Development Banks, which invest in projects in this sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.2/2">However, DFID reviews how the effects of fossil fuels extraction are managed as part of a commitment to sustainable development and attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.2/3">DFID has supported non-governmental organisations in the analysis of the impacts of extractive industries, including fossil fuels. For example, work on the Democratic Republic of Congo looked at natural resource governance. DFID also takes note of the many studies about opportunities and effects of extractive industries, including work by Transparency International, the &quot;Publish What You Pay&quot; campaign and the Resource Endowment Study of the International Council on Mining and Metals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.2/4">DFID was actively engaged in the Extractive Industries Review and the International Finance Corporation's review of its environmental and social safeguards policies and procedures. These safeguards are a key tool to ensure the prudent management of the exploitation of natural resources in developing countries. This includes the impact on welfare of people in those developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.2/5">DFID has provided support to countries wishing to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). This initiative supports improved governance in resource-rich countries through full publication of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas, and mining. EITI enables non-governmental organisations to participate in the process and work with government and companies to ensure that revenues from extractive industries are fully disclosed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1595W.5/1">DFID is committed to increasing access to reliable and affordable energy to reduce poverty and increase economic growth in developing countries. Renewable energy has an increasingly important role to play in helping developing countries make progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.5/2">In terms of future aid allocations, we expect deployment of clean energy investment to happen not through DFID's bilateral aid allocations, but through a big change in the way the multilateral agencies engage in the energy sector. We are encouraging the World Bank and regional development banks to give renewable energy greater attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.5/3">For example, the World Bank has scaled up its financial support for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. In August 2006, it announced a rise to $680 million in commitments in the year to June 2006, an increase of 48 per cent. compared to the previous year. This figure excludes large hydropower projects and covers solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and small (less than 10 MW) hydropower technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.5/4">We very much welcome this increased investment by the World Bank on clean energy. We now think that the bank needs to set out a high level of ambition for funds flowing through the Clean Energy Investment Framework over the coming years. At the recent spring meetings of the World Bank the UK called on the bank to set a range of new investment and outcome targets, including a higher target for renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.5/5">As announced in the 2007 Budget Statement, a new &pound;800 million Environmental Transformation Fund will finance environmental projects, including clean energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.5/6">DFID has supported the creation of a new &euro;220 million EU African, Caribbean and Pacific Energy Facility, which will start funding projects this year from the European Development Fund. This facility aims to improve access to energy, especially in rural areas of Africa, and has encouraged viable renewable energy proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.5/7">Finally, DFID is increasing research funding for the energy sector to reflect the growing interest in clean energy for development. This year DFID launched a new five year, &pound;3.75 million energy research programme on renewable energy and is currently scoping areas for further work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1596W.2/1">The 2006 DFID White Paper recognises that climate change poses the most serious long-term threat to development and poverty reduction. We are working to implement our White Paper commitments on three main fronts: work for a global agreement, including helping developing countries prepare for international negotiations; assisting developing countries to adopt clean energy technologies; and helping developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1596W.2/2">We assess how well these policies are being implemented through our standard organisational systems. For example, the Department's internal Development Committee regularly assesses how well the Department's policies are being rolled out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1596W.2/3">We are considering the changes that will be necessary to how we deliver programmes as a result of climate change. For example we are planning to have procedures in place by 2008 to identify and manage risks associated with climate variability. We have also committed to mainstreaming climate into DFID development activities in climate sensitive sectors, such as agriculture, water, health infrastructure and energy, by 2008, to help developing countries adopt low carbon energy and adapt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1596W.2/4">As part of our support to the Clean Energy Investment Framework, we have called for the World Bank and the other multilateral development banks to set out a set of specific targets to cover investments in areas such as renewables and energy efficiency. For example, last year the World Bank committed $860 million in these areas, but it needs to do more. The banks also need to look at their entire investment portfolios including lending for fossil fuels and help Governments make the right choices about their energy mix to underpin sustainable growth and poverty reduction. We expect this analysis to contribute to a better understanding of how to minimise the impact of development investments on carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1596W.2/5">Our Evaluation Department is currently considering establishing a baseline of data on climate change related indicators to help us better measure the Department's contribution to helping developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.1597W.2/1">During the last five years the World Bank (International Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) provided around $1.2 billion (&pound;609 million) in financing for activities in fossil fuels. Around one-third of this is for policy work and mine closure programmes. Of the remaining two-thirds, around 80 per cent. is for investment in gas projects, including infrastructure investment such as storage and distribution. Loans for fossil fuel extraction from the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development amounted to $350 million (&pound;178 million) and &euro;768 million (&pound;518 million) respectively. The International Monetary Fund, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank did not fund any fossil fuel extraction projects during this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597W.2/2">In financial years 2001-02 to 2005-06 the UK provided &pound;2.42 billion for the World Bank's IDA, the African Development Fund (ADF) of the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Fund (AsDF), the Caribbean Development Bank Special Fund, the IMF, Regional Development Bank Capital Subscriptions including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and other IFI programmes. Details can be found in DFID's Annual Report 2007, copies of which are in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597W.2/3">Contributions from the UK and other shareholders are one source of finance drawn upon by the international financial institutions to provide loans and grants to developing countries. The banks also draw on other sources such as repayments and investment earnings. Lending on more commercial terms&mdash;to more developed countries&mdash;is usually financed from the banks' own resources. Assistance to poorer countries, on much more concessional terms, is financed by a combination of the banks' and donor resources. Therefore it is not possible to say what proportion of the UK's contributions was spent on fossil fuel extraction projects.</p>

Therefore, we have repeatedly stressed to the TFG that it should reach out to all Somalis who reject violence, regardless of clan and that the National Reconciliation Congress, now scheduled to start in mid July, represents an excellent opportunity to do this. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, made this point in person to President Yusuf when he visited the UK in February and to the Somali Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-07">7 June</phrase>.

The ICG called on the international community to do everything it could to prevent further acts of violence. We fully support these views.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611W.0/2">At the same time, the ICG has publicly stressed the need for the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to do all it can to make the National Reconciliation Congress as inclusive as possible so that there will be a broad clan-based acceptance of the TFG. We believe that this offers the best long-term way to increase political participation and stable government, as well as to reduce the scope for violence.</p>

These include reducing the fuel consumption and hence carbon emissions by 50 per cent., relative to new aircraft in the year 2000, with 20-25 per cent. savings from airframe developments, 15-20 per cent. from the engines and 5-10 per cent. from improved air traffic management.</p>

	<p pid="a.1617W.3/1">The UK was a strong advocate of the establishment of baseline security requirements across the European Union, and supports the principle of harmonisation for the benefits it can bring for travellers and industry. It is important however that member states are able to require additional aviation security measures in their own territory, where they judge this necessary for the proper protection of aviation interests and passengers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1618W.2/1">As announced in the 2006 Budget the national bus concession will be introduced in April next year (the exact date will be decided in due course). Eligibility on age or disability will be the same as for the current statutory concession&mdash;people aged 60 and over, or who come under one of the seven categories of disability listed in the Transport Act 2000, will qualify.</p>
	<p pid="a.1618W.2/2">Guidance to local authorities on eligibility for disabled people was published in 2001 and updated in 2005, (copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House). The Department is looking to re-issue this guidance later in the year following consultation with its Concessionary Fares Working Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1618W.2/3">An eligible person, on the presentation of a pass, will be entitled to travel for free on any local bus service in England from 9.30am to 11pm on weekdays and at any time at weekends and Bank Holidays.</p>
	<p pid="a.1618W.2/4">The responsibilities for administering the concession&mdash;assessing eligibility, issuing passes, reimbursing the bus operators and enforcement&mdash;will rest with the existing travel concession authorities (TCAs). These are shire districts, unitary authorities, the Passenger Transport Executives in the metropolitan areas, and the London boroughs (we expect the London councils to administer the concession on behalf of the boroughs). The Concessionary Travel Bill currently before Parliament includes an order making power to change the tier of local government at which the concessionary fares is administered in the future, for example from shire districts to county councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1618W.2/5">TCAs can voluntarily enter into joint arrangements with other authorities e.g. a county council could administer the scheme on behalf of its districts. The Department is keen to see such arrangements, due to the administrative efficiencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1618W.2/6">The Concessionary Travel Bill will require the TCA to issue passes to those people that qualify, on age or disability grounds, who appear to have their 'sole and principal' residence in the TCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1618W.2/7">The extra funding (up to &pound;250 million per year) will either be distributed via the formula grant system (as is the case for current funding of mandatory concession) or specific grant. A decision on the funding route will be made in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1619W.5/1">Cycling England, the Government's advisory body on cycling, is tasked with getting more people cycling, more safely, more often. It is working with local authorities and others to promote cycling, focusing on the journey to work and to school. We doubled Cycling England's budget to &pound;10 million last year and launched &quot;Bikeability&quot; cycle training earlier this year. The six cycling demonstration towns with whom Cycling England is working have increased cycle trips by around 30 per cent. in just one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1619W.5/2">Furthermore, the Finance Act 1999 and the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 provided a tax exemption for employers to purchase cycles for their employees to commute to work. In June 2005 the Department issued guidance and assisted in the establishment of a group consumer credit licence for all UK businesses to allow them to implement the scheme up to a value of &pound;1,000 per cycle. We understand from the scheme providers that approximately 70,000 people have benefited from the scheme to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.1619W.5/3">Since 1999, we have also sought to mainstream the use of workplace travel, planning to reduce car use and increase sustainable travel such as cycling through guidance and pump priming funding for local authority employed travel plan officers. In February 2007 we set up the National Business Travel Network to enable businesses to share their experiences of travel planning with a view to promoting wider take-up of sustainable workplace travel.</p>

	<p pid="a.1625W.3/1">Local transport plans (LTP) are the mechanism by which local authorities undertake transport improvements at the local level. The objectives of the East Sussex LTP include the reduction of congestion to improve the efficiency of the transport network, the protection of the environment and the improvement of access to services. east Sussex county council received over &pound;10 million from Government to implement its LTP in 2007-08. In Eastbourne the plan's objectives will be delivered via the Eastbourne local area transport strategy which is aimed at addressing local needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1625W.3/2">In addition a number of improvements to the trunk road network in east Sussex have been prioritised by the south east region for funding from the regional funding allocation for major transport schemes. The A27 Southerham-Beddingham improvement (&pound;32 million) is currently under construction and, subject to successful completion of statutory procedures, the Bexhill-Hastings Link Road (&pound;47 million) and the A21 Baldslow junction improvement (&pound;18 million), have both been prioritised for funding by the region over the next five years to 2010-11. East Sussex county council have reported that the Bexhill to Hastings Link Road estimated cost has increased to around &pound;89 million and the region are currently considering whether it is still a priority at the higher cost. In addition, &pound;15 million worth of congestion relief improvements on the A27 at Wilmington have also been prioritised by the region for 2015-16.</p>
	<p pid="a.1625W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase> we published a consultation document 'Strengthening Local Delivery' accompanied by a draft Local Transport Bill. The draft Bill would ensure that local authorities have the right mix of powers to improve their local bus services, following on from the proposals in 'Putting Passengers First'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1625W.3/4">The Concessionary Bus Travel Bill, currently before Parliament, provides for a national bus travel concession for older and disabled people in England. The Bill extends the existing statutory concession of free off-peak local bus travel within an eligible person's local authority area, introduced in 2006, to free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England, widening access to services and opportunities for a significant Eastbourne and east Sussex residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1625W.3/5">With regard to Rail investment, figures are not available specifically for east Sussex but the county will benefit from a number of recent improvements. All older 'slam-door' rolling stock south of the Thames has been removed from the network. The electric multiple units now used by southern TOCs are less than three years old, and are more reliable, and faster than their predecessors. With the accompanying power supply upgrade of recent years, passengers on Southern, Southeastern and South West Trains have also benefited from &pound;2.7 billion worth of investment since 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.1627W.5/1">Bidders for the franchises that are out to tender currently (East Midlands, West Midlands, New Cross Country and InterCity East Coast) are required to consider bike-rail integration and facilities at stations in their bid submissions. The Government's aspiration is to see 95 per cent. of journeys originating from stations with adequate cycle parking facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1627W.5/2">Last year the Government asked Cycling England, our advisory group on cycling, to look into how we might better encourage bike and rail journeys. Cycling England has accepted this remit and is now looking to see where progress can best be made further to improve bike and rail integration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1627W.5/3">Also, we will continue to encourage Train Operating Companies (TOCs) to carry bikes on trains where possible. This is in line with the Cycling Policy document first published by the former Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) in 2004 and recently adopted by the Department. The Cycling Policy document advises TOCs to facilitate the carriages of cycles on off-peak services and encourages the carriage of folding cycles at all times. However, I accept that during the peak hours, where capacity is under pressure, there will be occasions where it is in the interests of the majority of passengers not to permit non-folding cycles on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1627W.5/4">It is right that TOCs are given a steer by Government as to how they should ensure they are fully maximising the potential of bike and rail to help reduce car use. However, TOCs are best placed to know where and when pressure on services exists and they must be free to impose restrictions accordingly. Although I hope that such restrictions are carefully considered and kept to a minimum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1628W.5/1">The decision to repeal section 75(1)(b) of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1975, known as the &quot;contract exemption&quot;, was motivated by the paramount need to ensure the safety of those being carried under contracts for the hire of a Private Hire Vehicle (PHV).</p>
	<p pid="a.1628W.5/2">PHV licence fees are set by local licensing authorities and vary widely from area to area. Making reasonable assumptions about the numbers of drivers, vehicles and operators likely to be involved in total across all sectors, and about average licence fees, we estimate that the total cost will be about &pound;1 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1628W.5/3">No specific estimate of the costs for those involved in transport to and from special schools has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1628W.5/4">It should be borne in mind that many contracts will already be carried out by drives, vehicles and operators that are already licensed or to whom the contact exemption did not apply. Furthermore, the proportion of licensing cost which will be passed on to those awarding contracts will depend on contracts terms in each case.</p>

One of the planned improvements is to use the Labour Force Survey to distribute IPS estimates of international migration into the UK between the constituent countries of the UK, and between government office regions within England. Information on this is available at the following page of the National Statistics website: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14834">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14834</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1649W.8/2">Decisions on the level of contracted-out national insurance rebates are a matter for the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. The current contracted-out rebate rates were set out in the Secretary of State's report laid before each House of Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March 2006</phrase> and reflected in the rebate Order made on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>. This report gave due consideration to the report of the Government Actuary and to other considerations such as the fiscal conditions which prevailed at the time. As with all decisions which have a major impact on public expenditure, including previous rebate reviews, the recommended rates were agreed with HM Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.1649W.8/3">The Secretary of State has departed from the rebate rates recommended by the Government Actuary on two occasions in the period covered by the question, in addition to the one where the Government Actuary's recommendation for rebate rates from 2007 was not fully implemented. The two occasions were the application of a 9.0 per cent. cap on age-related percentages for contracted-out DC schemes for the period 1999-2000 to 2001-02 tax year, and the application of a 10.5 per cent. cap from 2002-03 to 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="a.1652W.2/1">The exact number of cetaceans killed or injured at sea every year is unknown, as it is not feasible to monitor all cetacean deaths. As such, I am unable to estimate the proportion of cetaceans killed or injured at sea that are washed ashore. In any event, this will be influenced by several factors, including distance from shore and the prevailing weather and sea conditions over a period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652W.2/2">For nearly 15 years the Government have funded studies by the Natural History Museum and the Institute of Zoology (IoZ) on causes of death and trends in numbers of stranded cetaceans around the UK coastline. Post-mortems are carried out on a selected number of the stranded carcases each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652W.2/3">The two species that are more commonly reported as stranded along the UK coastline are the harbour porpoise and the common dolphin. The annual proportion of UK-stranded harbour porpoises diagnosed as by-catches varied between 11 per cent. and 25 per cent. in the 2002-06 period. The proportion of UK-stranded common dolphins diagnosed as by-catch varied between 57-77 per cent. for the same period. The majority of these by-catches (for both species) occurred in SW England during the winter months. Although the annual numbers of harbour porpoises and common dolphin strandings reported in SW England has increased since the 1990s, a number of factors (particularly increased observer effort and possible changes in abundance and distribution of these species) are suspected to have played a role in this increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.1652W.5/2">Results for the 2004-05 pair trawl fishery for bass show a marked decrease from the preceding year for the total numbers of dolphins observed as by-catch and the number of dolphins stranding in the south west coast has similarly decreased this year. It is, however, too early, on the basis of one year's data alone, to link these reductions to the 12 mile ban. Further analysis of the effectiveness of the 12 mile ban on sea bass pair trawling will be undertaken as more data becomes available. The funding for cetacean by-catch and strandings monitoring has been extended to 2010. 2005-06 survey data are being analysed and the results will be published in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1653W.2/3" class="indent">These can be used at the request of a Member State where there is a serious threat to the conservation of stocks or the marine environment from the impact of fishing requiring immediate action.

Member states have a right to submit written comments on the request to the Commission. The Commission must decide upon the Member State's request for action within 15 days of receipt.

	<p pid="a.1657W.0/1">Local authorities are required to report quarterly data on municipal waste (encompassing household waste) to WasteDataFlow. When reporting data, authorities should specify the amount of waste collected for recycling that is subsequently rejected, at the point of collection, at a Materials Recycling Facility (MRF), or at the gate of the reprocessor. The data reported to WasteDataFlow are used by the Environment Agency (EA) and Defra to monitor the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657W.0/2">The EA has also carried out a survey on Household Waste Materials Reclamation Facilities in England and Wales. The EA identified and visited about 80 candidate sites to ascertain recovery and reject levels at each site, verifying this information via a visual inspection of bale quality and the overall state of each facility. The overall typical spread of reject rates for MRFs was from 5 per cent. to 25 per cent., with 10 to 15 per cent. being an average. Around one million tonnes of municipal waste were reported to WasteDataFlow as being processed by an MRF.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657W.0/3">Analysis by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, based on a range of data sources, suggests that a conservative estimate of the amount of household waste collected for recycling which is not recycled, is around 5 to 10 per cent. In 2005-06, a total of 6.87 million tonnes of waste from household sources was collected for recycling.</p>

In practice, local authorities considering alternate weekly collection of household waste are expected to take into account factors such as the type of housing stock in the local area, as well as processing facilities available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1658W.6/1">No specific guidance has been issued either by my Department or its agencies on inspecting the contents of household rubbish bins. Section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act (ERA) empowers local authorities to specify the conditions of their waste collection service and places a duty on them to inform householders of those conditions. This usually takes the form of a section 46 notice. Under these powers, local authorities can specify the number, size, construction and maintenance of receptacles, what can be placed in each, and where and when they are to be placed for collection. Authorities can also require household waste to be treated prior to placing it in a receptacle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1658W.6/2">Any person found in breach of the conditions set in a section 46 notice can be prosecuted and, if convicted, is liable to a fine of up to &pound;1,000. The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 also gives local authorities the power to issue fixed penalty notices to those breaching a section 46 notice, as an alternative to prosecution under section 46(6) of the EPA.</p>

	<p pid="a.1661W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June</phrase> at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council European Ministers accepted unanimously a recovery plan for the European eel. This plan has been in development since 2003 and its agreement at Council was vital if we are to see a recovery of a stock that has seen recruitment drop to 1-5 per cent. of historic level (pre-1980s).</p>
	<p pid="a.1661W.5/2">Under the recovery plan member states must, in the long term, achieve 40 per cent. escapement of silver eel from each river basin district (or as an average across the member state) compared to the level before man's intervention. They must also cut fishing effort/catches in Community maritime waters by 50 per cent. and reserve, over time, 60 per cent. of glass (juvenile) eel for restocking in European waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1661W.5/3">Fishing for eel can continue if a member state can reliably demonstrate that the rivers within its river basin district allow&mdash;or a recovery plan is in place to allow&mdash;the management target to be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1661W.5/4">Member states must submit an eel management plan for each eel river basin to the European Commission by <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2008</phrase>, then have them approved by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, and implemented by <phrase class="date" code="">1 July 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1666W.5/2">Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations, implemented in England by The Welfare of Animals (Transport) (England) Order 2006, requires all transporters of livestock to avoid animals suffering from extremes of temperature. For journeys of more than eight hours, vehicles must be designed to maintain temperatures of between 5&deg;C and 30&deg;C (+/- 5&deg;C). However, for journeys solely within the UK, we have a derogation from the lower end of the scale until the time the vehicle is first moved and during any loading/unloading at intermediate points. This is because livestock often housed outdoors are accustomed to cold weather and the animals' body heat quickly raises the temperature above 0&deg;C.</p>

	<p pid="a.1668W.5/1">I have regular discussions with European Union (EU) ministers on a range of issues, including animal welfare. DEFRA would prefer to avoid the close confinement of all sows, but there are currently no free-farrowing systems suitable for widespread commercial adoption. Farrowing crates protect piglets from being crushed by the sow&mdash;one of the largest causes of pig mortality. It is equally important to maintain the welfare of the piglet as that of the sow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1668W.5/2">There is a time limit on how long sows may be kept in farrowing crates: from seven days before the predicted day of farrowing until the piglets are weaned. After this period sows in the UK must be moved back to loose housing accommodation in which they are free to turn around easily.</p>
	<p pid="a.1668W.5/3">We have funded research to test and develop commercially viable farrowing systems that provide adequate protection to piglets but do not closely confine the sow. As yet, the risk of piglet mortality in alternative systems remains unacceptably high. Our research will contribute to the European Food Safety Authority's examination of a range of issues, including farrowing systems, leading up to the next review of the EU Directive on pig welfare.</p>

Both were ad-hoc groups charged with developing criteria for inclusion in the forthcoming Managing Radioactive Waste Safely consultation document. CPG, led by Professor Peter Styles of Keele university, developed draft criteria. Its proposals were independently reviewed by CRP, led by Professor Howard Wheater of Imperial college, London. Selection of members of the groups was made on the basis of the need to involve high calibre expertise across the range of earth science and related disciplines. Members of the two groups were paid a daily rate for their work. The cost of the work is currently estimated to be of the order of &pound;40,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.1673W.9/2">The Hampshire coast is covered by two Shoreline Management Plans. Once reviewed, these plans will provide a large-scale assessment of the risks associated with coastal processes taking account of climate change and other factors. They will also provide a policy framework to manage risks in a sustainable manner, looking ahead over the next 100 years and based on up to date guidance. The reviews will include full consultation with those likely to be affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1673W.9/3">DEFRA published revised guidance for operating authorities on future rates of sea level rise in November 2006. This recommended the following allowances for the east and south east of England, including the effects of vertical land movement:</p>
	<p pid="a.1673W.9/4" class="indent">4.0 mm rise per year from the baseline of nominal 1990 levels to 2025</p>
	<p pid="a.1673W.9/5" class="indent">8.5 mm from 2025 to 2055</p>
	<p pid="a.1673W.9/6" class="indent">12.0 mm from 2055 to 2085</p>
	<p pid="a.1673W.9/7" class="indent">15.0 mm from 2085 to 2115.</p>
	<p pid="a.1673W.9/8">Estimates of future sea level rise vary. The aforementioned guidance has been published solely for the purpose of informing flood and coastal erosion risk management decisions and is kept under review. The assumptions and qualifications on which the recommendations are based are included in the guidance which is published on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1673W.9/9">DEFRA policy has been guided by the Government's 2004 Foresight Report which presented possible future flood and coastal erosion risk scenarios. DEFRA, the UK Climate Impacts Programme and Met Office Hadley Centre will publish updated climate change scenarios for the UK in 2008 which should improve understanding of how climate change may affect sea level rise and storm surge over the next 100 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1692W.2/1">In March 2007 the Government published 'Heritage Protection for the 21st Century', which sets out proposals to strengthen and clarify protection for world heritage sites. These measures include a commitment to produce a planning circular which will clarify policy on world heritage sites including the use of buffer zones. This will be published for consultation later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692W.2/2">It is for each world heritage site steering group, in consultation with the relevant local authorities, to decide how best to protect the setting and outstanding universal value of the site in question. In some cases, a comprehensive visual study may be appropriate as a tool for achieving this. In some cases, also, buffer zones are one of the approaches which can be used for protecting the setting but they may not be appropriate for all world heritage sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.1692W.6/3">Local public service agreements are based entirely around reward targets. They have now been largely merged into local area agreements, which contain non-reward and reward targets, and typically run for three years. No local authority has a reward target specifically on adoptions which is dependent on performance in either 2006-07 or 2007-08. There is no detailed central record of non-reward targets in local area agreements, although the agreements themselves are available on the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) website.</p>

As reported in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-26">26 March 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1272W, this can record all of the individual learning aims that an Apprentice is undertaking as part of the framework, including those identified as separate technical certificates. However, although in principle it is possible to identify those learners who have achieved both the full framework and a technical certificate, the required information is not contained on the framework record which is used to calculate success rates. The analysis would require the creation of a new methodology for bringing the information on technical certificates forward from the raw data to the framework record. The undertaking of this work would require a significant resource in terms of analyst time and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Additionally it is not possible to identify those learners who have already obtained the technical certificate through prior learning.</p>

	<p pid="a.1700W.2/1">Both fostering service providers and the providers of children's homes are already required to notify the Secretary of State of particular events, including the death of a looked after child in their care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.2/2">However, in order to monitor and investigate child deaths more effectively, the Government are putting in place new child death review processes which will be the responsibility of Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). Reviewing deaths will become mandatory in April 2008 though LSCBs have been able to do this since 2006. These arrangements include children in foster care and residential care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.2/3">There are two elements to the child death review process: firstly, a rapid response by a group of professionals who are responsible for inquiring into and evaluating each unexpected death of a child; secondly, the review of deaths of all children in the local authority area through Child Death Overview Panels (CDOPs). CDOPs will identify any trends or patterns in these deaths. This information will be used by LSCBs to prevent or avoid such deaths in the future. It will inform local strategic planning for children's services and policy at a local and national level. Detailed guidance on how these procedures work is set out in 'Working Together to Safeguard Children' (2006).</p>

	<p pid="a.1702W.2/3">Support staff, including teaching assistants, play an important role in schools, often working closely with pupils with SEN and disabilities. In recognition of this, the Training and Development Agency for Schools, which now has responsibility for support staff training and development, has developed national occupational standards for teachers/classroom assistants to cover roles that support teaching and learning in schools. The revised standards have been strengthened to reflect the role of teaching assistants working with pupils with additional needs, including those with sensory impairment. Induction training material on SEN for teaching assistants working in both primary and secondary schools is also available, as is introductory training for other support staff, which contains a discrete module covering SEN and disabilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1713W.0/1">Data on re-offending committed by offenders wearing electronic tags, is only collated centrally for those offenders released on to the Home Detention Curfew Scheme. However, this data is not broken down by the offender's original offence or by the local government area in which any subsequent offence was committed. To provide such information would involve a manual trawl of the data and would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1713W.0/2">Serious violent offenders and all sexual offenders are either statutorily excluded or are presumed unsuitable for release on HDC. In addition, prisoners convicted of other serious offences considered to be of particular concern to the public are also presumed unsuitable for release on HDC unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.1715W.5/1">Under the Mental Health Act 1983 the courts have powers to assess mentally disordered offenders before sentencing and to divert them to receive specialist treatment in hospital rather than punishment. The police also have the power under the Act to remove a person who appears to be suffering from mental disorder to a place of safety. The Government plan to publish guidance this year to the NHS and partner agencies which supports the development of local diversion services by building on current best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715W.5/2">The prison population has a disproportionately high prevalence of mental illness, and so it has been the policy of the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and Department of Health to improve the provision of mental health services in our prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715W.5/3">Beginning in 2003, and completing in April 2006, the national health service took over the commissioning responsibility for all prison health services in public sector prisons. This was previously the responsibility of the Prison Service. One of the main reasons this transfer has made was to help ensure that prisoners had better access to mainstream health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715W.5/4">All prisoners, both new prisoners and those transferred in from one prison to another, benefit from a new health screening process, introduced across the prison estate in 2004, that is designed to detect physical and mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715W.5/5">Prisoners who are identified as needing further help can be referred to a mental health in-reach team, who will arrange further assessment and follow up referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715W.5/6">Investment in prison mental health in-reach services has been steadily increasing, with nearly &pound;20 million invested in these services each year since 2004-05, and 360 whole time equivalent staff employed, more than the initial commitment in the NHS Plan to create 300 posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715W.5/7">People who are mentally too ill to remain in prison should be transferred to hospital. We have introduced tighter monitoring to identify prisoners waiting an unacceptably long period for transfer to hospital, and a protocol was issued to prisons and primary care trusts in October 2005 setting out what must be done when a prisoner has been waiting for a hospital place for more than three months following acceptance by the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715W.5/8">These measures have helped bring about positive results. In 2006, 33 per cent. more prisoners, with mental illness too severe for prison, were transferred to hospital than in 2002&mdash;up to 961 from 723. There has been a significant decrease in the number of people waiting over 12 weeks for a transfer&mdash;in the quarter ending March 2007, 40 prisoners were waiting, down from 51 in the same quarter in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715W.5/9">The healthcare screening process also inquires about drug and alcohol use, and looks for evidence of dependence in those who report current or recent use. Reception screening should be focused to ensure that appropriate prescribed clinical management is undertaken by a doctor soon after reception. Clinical drug testing is used to establish the level of opiate dependence before clinical management begins. The new Integrated Drug Treatment System is introducing National Treatment Agency models of care to 49 prisons.</p>

	<p pid="a.1731W.6/1">The following tables show the available figures for reoffending rates for adult and juvenile offenders who started their community penalty in England and Wales in the first quarter of each year. Reoffending rates for adults are calculated over a two-year period and for juveniles over a one-year period. Community orders were introduced in 2005 and therefore data are not yet available for this type of disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1731W.6/2">The relationship between disposal and reoffending is complex; the disposal given depends on the characteristics of the offender, which will also affect their chances of reoffending. Further information is available in the most recent Statistical Bulletins on adult and juvenile re-offending which can be found at the following addresses:</p>

	<p pid="a.1732W.2/1">Information on reoffending rates from ISSP is not available in this form. ISSP tackles the most persistent offenders who are often damaged and deprived, and who suffer from mental health problems. This is, therefore an exceptionally difficult group of offenders who present a major challenge to ISSP teams. Nevertheless, despite the report showing 91 per cent. of young people given an ISSP were reconvicted at least once in the two years starting the programmes, it also showed that young offenders on ISSP committed 39 per cent. fewer crimes in the two years after starting the programme and that the seriousness of those crimes reduced by 13 per cent.</p>

My Department has, however, conducted a series of surveys to monitor how employers and service providers are responding to their duties to make reasonable adjustments under the Disability Discrimination Act. The findings of the most recent research<sup>(1)</sup> show that levels of physical adjustments for disabled people are increasing. Among employers, there has been a slight increase in those having made adjustments since 2003 (from 42 per cent. to 45 per cent. for adapting the work environment). There has been a larger increase in changes made to physical accessibility by those providing goods, facilities and services (from 47 per cent. to 61 per cent.). Not all disabled people will require physical adjustments to be made to the workplace, or to the premises of a service provider, nor will it always be reasonable for an employer or service provider to make a physical adjustment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1735W.0/3" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what assessment he has made of the likely effect of the removal of 180 posts at the Carers' Allowance Unit in Preston on services provided by the unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1735W.0/4" class="indent">The Minister for Disabled People, Anne McGuire MP, promised you a substantive reply from the Chief Executive of the Disability and Carers Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1735W.0/5" class="indent">As you will be aware, as part of the Efficiency Challenge all government departments have imposed headcount targets for the period ending March 2008. The headcount target for the Disability and Carers Service for 2007/08 is 5063. The headcount allocation for the Carers Allowance Unit (CAU) for 2007/08 is 723. This represents a reduction of 180 on current headcount.</p>
	<p pid="a.1735W.0/6" class="indent">Along with all government departments, we are modernising our service delivery and we have specific targets to improve efficiency and reduce the number of people we employ. We are well on the way to meeting both these objectives and, in the CAU, we are doing so by comprehensively reviewing our organisational structure, workflow processes and our handling of customer enquiries. Additionally, we believe we can make further improvements to our productivity and the quality of the work that we do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1735W.0/7" class="indent">In support of this stretching agenda, we have employed lean' techniques. These have been used in recent years in HMRC, where they have supported a successful efficiency programme. Early trials in the CAU this year have been successful and we have decided that we will now roll out the lean' approach right across the unit. The approach includes additional checking to ensure right first time quality, thus preventing rework, and improving service to customers. Although there may be short-term disruption as staff are trained and adapt to new ways of working, we expect to standardise and improve the service, rather than allow any deterioration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1735W.0/8" class="indent">We are an agency that continues to focus on delivering improved services to disabled people and carers, and we will ensure that any such short-term disruption to service as a result of headcount reductions is kept to a minimum through constant monitoring of the situation and acting upon what our customers tell us.</p>

	<p pid="a.1738W.8/1">The Department utilises OGC Buying Solutions frameworks for the provision of these services and pays travel agencies' fees for air, rail and ferry bookings. However the information requested is not available centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate costs. The Department obtains a discount from every business travel booking made through the contracted agents which would not be available should we book directly with the operators. All bookings will attract a commission for the agent from the operator which will be returned to us, the customer, by way of a discount and the discounts negotiated are in excess of the fees charged. These discounts appear on invoices having had any fees deducted, therefore, the fee element is not identifiable from invoices. To identify the fees individually would require an extensive clerical exercise involving officials and the suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1741W.8/1">Decisions on the level of contracted-out national insurance rebates are a matter for the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. The current contracted-out rebate rates were set out in the Secretary of State's report laid before each House of Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March 2006</phrase> and reflected in the rebate Order made on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>. This report gave due consideration to the report of the Government Actuary and to other considerations such as the fiscal conditions which prevailed at the time. As with all decisions which have a major impact on public expenditure, including previous rebate reviews, the recommended rates were agreed with HM Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.8/2">The Secretary of State has departed from the rebate rates recommended by the Government Actuary on two occasions in the period covered by the question, in addition to the one where the Government Actuary's recommendation for rebate rates from 2007 was not fully implemented. The two occasions were the application of a 9.0 per cent. cap on age-related percentages for contracted-out DC schemes for the period 1999-2000 to 2001-02 tax year, and the application of a 10.5 per cent. cap from 2002-03 to 2006-07.</p>

A number of revisions to standard operating processes were introduced between October 2003 and March 2004 to ensure applications were dealt with effectively during the initial take on period.

	<p pid="a.1747W.6/1">There would be no impact on the number of employees who would be eligible for the proposed personal accounts savings scheme if the upper earnings limit for contributions were increased to &pound;43,000. This is because in companies that opt for personal accounts all employees earning above the lower limit are automatically enrolled into the scheme. Changing the upper limit only changes the earnings on which contributions would be paid not eligibility for automatic enrolment.</p>

The &pound;3,600 limit will be based on 2005 earnings levels, and will be uprated with earnings from 2005 to implementation in 2012 and beyond.</p>

	<p pid="a.1752W.0/1">During the operational period from January 2003 to December 2006, 2,333 mobilised British military personnel (regular and reservists) who deployed to Iraq under Operation TELIC were assessed by, and received treatment from, the Defence Medical Services for mental health conditions thought to be related to their deployment. This represents around 2 per cent. of personnel deployed to Op TELIC over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.0/2">Of this number, 363 servicemen fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post traumatic stress disorder. This represents around 0.3 per cent. of personnel deployed to Op TELIC over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.0/3">Information on the Service of each individual is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.0/4">Since 2003 we have collated figures on the incidence of mental health diagnoses for Service personnel returning from Iraq. However, at a time when a growing number of personnel have been deployed to other operational theatres in addition to Iraq, it has become increasingly clear that it is difficult to attribute a subsequent mental health condition (which in many cases may not present itself until months or even years later) to Service on a specific deployment. We are currently, therefore, reviewing our methods of collating figures on Service personnel who are diagnosed with a mental health condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.0/5">We aim to provide first-class medical care on deployed operations in the most challenging of circumstances and surroundings. Commanders and their medical staff can call upon mental health professionals who can provide assessment and care. Operational Theatres are regularly visited by consultant psychiatrists who audit the service provided by the in-theatre mental health professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.0/6">There are 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.0/7">The DCMH mental health teams comprise psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. The aim is to see referred individuals at their unit medical centre and, with the patient's permission, to engage with general practitioners and their chain of command to help manage mental health problems identified in personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.0/8">A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available (including psychological therapies, environmental adjustment and medication) where appropriate. The Defence Mental Health Services have particular expertise in psychological treatments for mental health problems in general, and psychological injury in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.0/9">The &quot;King's Centre for Military Health Research: Ten Year Report,&quot; published by Kings College, University of London on a decade's worth of research concerning the health of UK veterans, stated that:</p>

These are listed in an extensive table which I have placed in the Library of the House.

I am withholding the precise value of individual contracts and the total cost to the public purse as its release would, or would be likely to, prejudice commercial interests. The scale of total payments made to major BAE Systems divisions over the past five financial years on all direct contracts, as published by the Defence Analytical Services Agency, is shown in the table.</p>

The creation of a small number of the new units that have been planned under future army structures (Territorial Army) and the recruitment of a small number of non-regular permanent staff for new support roles within TA units will be delayed. There will also be a number of reductions in TA activities not directly related to the delivery of operational capability, including a reduction in the number and frequency of TA competitions, a reduction in TA support to employers' events and the cancellation of annual TA conferences.</p>

	<p pid="a.1772W.8/1">The Government are currently taking forward a wide range of work which will continue to reduce violent crime. We have, for example, recently passed the Violent Crime Reduction Act, which gives the police and local communities the powers they need to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1772W.8/2">There are currently a number of violent crime operations being taken forward in Sussex, including: Operation Jardon, tackling football-related crime, and based on experience from the 2004 Euro Championship&mdash;penalties are used for anyone drunk and behaving in an antisocial manner, and for licensees serving alcohol to drunk and underage customers; and Operation Columbus, designed to ensure the safety and wellbeing of visiting international language students. Across East and West Sussex, a range of activities have been implemented in support of District Plans, such as CCTV in taxis in Eastbourne. Specifically in Brighton, a number of successful projects, including the Safe Haven project, have been taken forward in conjunction with the Centre for Public Innovation. Brighton hopes to repeat this particular experience this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1772W.8/3">Domestic violence is also a priority. The WORTH project provides immediate support to people experiencing domestic violence. Hospital staff in A&amp;E and midwifery are fully trained, and a team of fully trained caseworkers respond immediately to victims needing help. An Individual Support Programme for children (WISP) has also been successfully introduced. A pilot project is also under way, introducing a &quot;routine enquiry&quot; process about DV to GP surgeries and sexual health clinics. Work to introduce specialist domestic violence courts in Sussex continues. And Sussex police are currently seeking to bring the National Centre for Domestic Violence charity to Sussex. This charity works to deliver, on a next-day basis, the protection of civil orders to victims of domestic violence without any charge to the service or the victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1772W.8/4">Sussex police have been engaging with other partner agencies in introducing updated child protection and safeguarding procedures for Sussex. They are working with the East Sussex, West Sussex and Brighton and Hove city council local Safeguarding Children Boards, which provide information, advice and guidance for all professionals working in child protection. East Sussex is also one of the eight pilot counties for the development of Child Death Review Panels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1772W.8/5">Neighbourhood policing across Sussex is continuing to develop, and practitioners are working up increasingly sophisticated strategies to engage with, and meet the needs of, local communities. Problem-solving with partners is becoming further established, with good use being made of analytical products to identify crime and incident hotspots. And improving community consultation is enabling neighbourhood specialist teams to tackle the problems of most concern to communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1773W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1773W.2/2">The Government are currently taking forward a wide range of work which will continue to reduce violent crime. We have, for example, recently passed the Violent Crime Reduction Act, which gives the police and local communities the powers they need to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1773W.2/3">Domestic violence is a particular priority. In December 2006, it was announced that Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell (Warley and West Bromwich magistrates courts), Solihull and Walsall (Walsall and Aldridge magistrates courts) had been selected as Specialist Domestic Violence Court areas. These specialist courts promote a joint approach to tackling domestic violence, with the police, crown prosecutors, magistrates, courts and the probation service working together with specialist support services for victims. Agencies collectively identify, track and risk assess domestic violence cases, and better share information so that more offenders are brought to justice, victims are protected and better supported, and further violence is prevented.</p>
	<p pid="a.1773W.2/4">The Government, through the Government office for the west midlands, supports key partners in the statutory and voluntary sector in tackling gun crime and gang-related violence. For example, Birmingham Reducing Gang Violence has continued to be a focal point for activities and partnership work to reduce gun crime. It is chaired by the West Midlands police, and supported by a range of agencies and voluntary sector groups, including Birmingham city council, West Midlands Probation, Victim Support, Increase the Peace UK, Mothers in Pain and Street Pastors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1773W.2/5">The West Midlands is also well represented in the Tackling Violent Crime Programme, through which the Home Office works intensively with practitioners in local areas with high levels of more serious violent crime, to support their efforts to reduce, in particular, alcohol-related crime and domestic violence, to improve police and other agencies' performance and partnership working, and to improve local strategies. Currently four West Midlands police basic command units are funded to utilise a variety of interventions, including the greater use of fixed penalty notices for alcohol-related offences, routine visits to &quot;hotspot&quot; licensed premises, and the use of bus and taxi marshals at peak times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1773W.2/6">West Midlands police have also been particularly active over the past 12 months in addressing robbery. Three of the 28 areas nationally which became subject to special focus during the recent Robbery Initiative are in the West Midlands (Solihull, Wolverhampton and Coventry). These areas were required to produce an action plan, which would produce long-term, sustainable interventions and not rely purely on short-term police activity to yield short-term results.</p>
