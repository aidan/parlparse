	<p pid="a.978W.5/1">As set out in the document Decent Homes to Sustainable Communities there are a range of costs for introducing a &quot;fourth option&quot; depending on how many councils took it up as the approach would have to be fair for all councils. The factors taken into account when estimating the &pound;12 billion were: the extra average investment per dwelling required to give local authorities the same level of investment per dwelling as under stock transfer, and the number of local authority dwellings in 2004-05 that would need this extra investment (number of dwellings sourced from the Business Plan Statistical Appendix 2005).</p>

	<p pid="a.991W.6/1">In the preparation of the interim Thames Gateway Strategic Framework, officials did discuss with stakeholders whether the framework should express a preference for one of the five bids in the Thames Gateway if two or more candidates were shortlisted. No firm conclusion was reached and there was no discussion about supporting a particular bid. After consulting DCMS officials, DCLG officials decided not to take any action to accord priority to the Thames Gateway or a location within it. DCLG Ministers were not involved in any of this process. Greenwich was subsequently selected as the only shortlisted candidate for a regional casino in the Thames Gateway by the Independent Advisory Panel.</p>

	<p pid="a.995W.2/1">Digital Challenge bids were shortlisted according to a number of criteria, including a focus on &quot;socially excluded&quot; groups. In evaluating bids, a focus on ethnic minority groups was not included as a specific criterion, as the effective use of ICT and benefits of digital inclusion cut across the sub-divisions of socially excluded populations including ethnic minority groups. Further information on the 79 proposals received and an analysis is available on the Digital Challenge website:</p>

	<p pid="a.995W.2/3">The Digital Challenge Outline Prospectus made it clear to all bidders submitting proposals that bids should be inclusive and representative of their local communities. We have created an opportunity for organisations, including those representing ethnic minorities, to become engaged in the Digital Challenge process through the Digital Challenge Community Network (DCCN), an interdependent network for public, private, voluntary and academe to rise to the challenge of using ICT and Innovation as enablers of digital and social inclusion. Further information on the network and the original prospectus are published on the Digital Challenge website.</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.2/4">It is not possible to definitively state the number of ethnic minority organisations involved in the Digital Challenge process. However, each of the remaining 10 bidders are actively engaging and working with ethnic minority organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1003W.9/17">Prior to September 2004, a member of the Firefighters Pension Scheme 1992 was entitled to an ill-health retirement pension if permanently disabled from engaging in firefighting. Thereafter, the scheme was amended to limit the entitlement to a person who is permanently unfit for engaging in firefighting or performing other duties appropriate to his role as a firefighter, other than or in addition to engaging in firefighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.9/18">The 1992 Pension Scheme was further amended in July 2006 to introduce two tier ill-health retirement arrangements. A person is entitled to an upper tier award if incapable of undertaking regular work. Regular employment is defined as meaning employment for 30 hours a week on average over a period of not less than 12 consecutive months. The accrued pension is enhanced. The pension of a person with a lower tier award is not enhanced.</p>

	<p pid="a.1009W.2/1">The Department's Gypsy and Traveller Unit has extensive contact with local authorities and others who are responsible for socially rented Gypsy and Traveller caravan sites. They report many examples of well managed and maintained sites where the residents live alongside the settled community with no reported tensions. There are numerous examples of site residents becoming involved in local events and, for example, participating in neighbourhood watch schemes. Where tensions with the settled community do occur in particular cases, the Government has provided strong powers for local authorities to address unauthorised camping and antisocial behaviour. It would be wrong to allow a few high profile cases to distort the overall picture.</p>

	<p pid="a.1018W.0/14">The Government do not produce a forecast for average earnings growth to 2012-13, so for this analysis we have assumed earnings growth in line with the estimated trend growth in labour productivity. See &quot;Budget 2006&quot;, Table B2. We have further assumed growth of retail prices in line with the projections published in &quot;Budget 2006&quot;, Table C3.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.0/15">Uprating child benefit by earnings for a period of six years would amount to a cumulative increase of around 12 per cent. compared with uprating by prices. Based on a 60 per cent. contemporary median income threshold, it is estimated that a similar real terms increase implemented today could lower child poverty by between 130,000 and 160,000, depending on the choice of equivalisation scale for household incomes.</p>

The increase in the cost of these three projects was due to unforeseen increases in complexity and scope of the projects being undertaken. 10 of the projects were completed to their original deadlines and of the six projects completed after their deadline, three were completed within weeks of their intended deadline and the extra time taken for one project resulted in cost savings.</p>

It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

	<p pid="a.1043W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1043W.6/2">The increase in the tax credits income disregard is part of a package of measures announced in the 2005 Pre-Budget Report. The Government have always been more confident about the overall cost of the PBR package which is based on the total level of overpayments. The estimates were based on data from the first year of the system and provisional information from the second year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043W.6/3">The Exchequer effect of the changes to the tax credit system depend crucially on the source of overpayments. At that stage there was only limited information available on the sources of overpayments as HMRC only had complete data on 2003-04 overpayments, which were not representative of the system in steady state. This difficulty in accessing good quality data in the past made costing the individual elements of the package difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043W.6/4">However following publication of the 2004-05 overpayment statistics in May 2006, HMRC now has two years of overpayment statistics to inform this costing. And crucially, unlike in 2003-04, awards in 2004-05 were based on the previous years income making them much more representative of future years awards. In addition the first stage of the finalisation process for 2005-06 was completed in August 2006, adding to this body of knowledge. This additional information has not led the Government to change the costing of the disregard&mdash;or the package as a whole&mdash;however it has allowed it to feel more confident in the costing of the individual elements of the package.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043W.6/5">There are still some uncertainties surrounding the costing. In particular it remains the case while the overall cost of the package is not affected by the order with which the changes are modelled, these interactions mean that the costs of the individual elements of the package are affected by the assumed order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043W.6/6">Subject to these uncertainties, the costing of the &pound;25,000 disregard, over the period 2006-07 to 2010-11 is provided as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.1043W.6/9"> <td><i> Exchequer effect (&pound; million)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1043W.6/10"> <td></td> <td><i> Income disregard of &pound;25,000</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1043W.6/11"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>-50</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1043W.6/12"> <td>2007-08</td> <td>-100</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1043W.6/13"> <td>2008-09</td> <td>-150</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1043W.6/14"> <td>2009-10</td> <td>-250</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1043W.6/15"> <td>2000-11</td> <td>-300</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.1043W.6/18">One needs to carefully distinguish between the change in claimants' entitlement from the change in the disregard and the cost to the Exchequer. The cost of the disregard is not the change in entitlement, but the forgone recovery of overpayments. The basic principle is that when money is paid out to tax credit claimants, it scores as a cost to the Exchequer. On the other hand, when any overpaid tax credits are recovered, there is a yield. The higher disregard does not necessarily affect the amount of money paid out to claimants in any one year. But by reducing the amount of overpayments, the higher disregard will mean there is less money to be recovered in future years. Hence the profile of costs shown above.</p>

All other offences committed by motorcyclists cannot be identified from the data held centrally either because the offence as defined in legislation is not specific to any type of motor vehicle (e.g. driving on a footpath or vehicle not taxed or insured against third party risks) or because it is not identified separately, and grouped together with other miscellaneous motoring offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.2/1">The Education Act 1996 places a duty on local education authorities (LEAs) to make arrangements for transport where it is necessary to ensure a child's attendance at school. LEAs have wide discretion in deciding whether transport is necessary, but case law requires them to provide free home to school transport for pupils of compulsory school age who are attending their nearest suitable school, provided that the school is beyond 'statutory walking distance'. In addition, many LEAs use their discretionary powers to provide transport to school in circumstances where they are under no legal obligation to do so. The law requires LEAs to publish their transport policies covering support provided under their statutory duties and discretionary powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/2">Where LEAs make arrangements using their discretionary powers, they are free to consult on and change those policies. While there is no legislation governing the conduct of such consultations, good practice suggests that consultations should involve all interested parties, with consultations taking place during term time. Guidance issued by the Department of Education and Skills states that good practice suggests that any changes should be brought in at the end of the school year, and that they should be phased in as pupils change or leave schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/3">The position is however different if a school bus service is a local service receiving a subsidy from the local transport authority. The Transport Act 1985 requires local transport authorities, when considering policies on subsidised bus services, to consult other authorities who may be affected by those policies and bus operators in their area. There are no specific requirements as to how they should do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/4">In developing their bus strategies and accessibility strategies, local authorities also need to consider the passenger transport needs in their areas and consultation with various stakeholders can play a part in this.</p>

	<p pid="a.1067W.0/1">The Government have consulted closely with the Chairman and chief executive of British Waterways (BW) on the financial pressures facing the Department and what these mean for its sponsored bodies. The Secretary of State and I met recently with the chief executive of BW to listen to his concerns. A further meeting between the Chairman, chief executive and myself is planned for later this month. This will look further at the implications for the adjustments in subsidy and how BW can continue to contribute towards Government and DEFRA priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1067W.0/2">In order to accommodate budgetary pressures, all areas of the Department's spend have been subject to rigorous scrutiny as part of a budget review. The review was comprehensive in nature and has ensured that DEFRA's funding for the current year is placed where it can have the greatest impact. As a matter of good financial management, DEFRA keeps its budgets and spending under regular review and challenge and adjusts them as new pressures and demands arise. The overall budget for the Department remains unchanged and will be subject to the normal Parliamentary approval and scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.1067W.0/3">Grant allocation for 2006-07 for BW was originally confirmed as &pound;59.429 million and they were notified of this in April 2006. However, the July in-year review of budgets brought a further cut of approximately 7 per cent. Final grant allocation for 2006/07 will therefore be &pound;55.497 million. Allocations for 2007-08 will be issued shortly, following further engagement between the Secretary of State and the Chairs of our key delivery partners, including BW.</p>
	<p pid="a.1067W.0/4">The taxpayer would not expect DEFRA to consult Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) every time there were financial pressures. We seek to manage the pressures that inevitably arise from time to time from within the annual budget voted by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1067W.0/5">Allocations beyond 2008 to 2011 are dependent on the outcome of the current comprehensive spending review (CSR) which is scheduled to conclude by summer of 2007. Consultation will take place with HMT as dictated by the CSR timetable. However, officials are in discussion with BW about the potential for a long term contract within the context of the CSR period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1069W.0/1">The Government are fully committed to raising product standards and encouraging consumers to use the most energy efficient domestic appliances. Progress is being made by a combination of policy measures including product information (energy labels), minimum standards, and the promotion of best practice. The Market Transformation Programme (MTP), which supports the development and implementation of UK Government policy on sustainable products, is in the process of applying detailed policy action plans for each sector. They will set out an innovation roadmap by which the Government and industry can work together to deliver more sustainable products. Further information on the MTP's work on domestic appliances is available at: <a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.0/2">In June, Defra hosted the 2006 Energy Efficiency in Domestic Appliances and Lighting Conference (EEDAL 06) to advance international co-operation and new initiatives on energy efficient domestic appliances. Further details on the EEDAL 06 can be found at: <a href="http://www.livegroup.co.uk/EEDAL">http://www.livegroup.co.uk/EEDAL</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.0/3">A major revision of the Building Regulations in April 2006 raised overall energy efficiency standards and changed the method of showing compliance to align with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This new approach and associated calculation tools encourage the use of low carbon technologies such as solar panels and wind generators. However, because Building Regulations are written in terms of functional requirements, individual technologies are not specified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.0/4">The Building Regulations set minimum standards for new construction but the Government are encouraging builders to do more. The Code for Sustainable Homes will set standards for new developments above those currently prescribed by the Building Regulations. The code will not be mandatory across all housing sectors, although all new publicly-funded development will need to meet code level 3. In order to further promote on-site energy generation, new homes that use renewable technology will gain extra points in the code.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.0/5">We are also reviewing the planning rules with a view to reducing the restrictions for small scale renewable systems. The Government also fund a grant scheme, run by the Energy Savings Trust, to encourage the voluntary take-up of renewable energy. This will provide industry with manufacturing, supply and installation experience, increase public awareness and drive down the market cost of renewables.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.0/6">Since 2001, the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) has funded a number of research projects under both its former Partners in Innovation Construction Research Programme, and more latterly under the DTI Technology Programme, aiming to assist the construction sector in its transition to the use of technologies to minimise the impact of climate change on buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.1070W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.9/2">I have assumed that the references to regulations relate to the food hygiene legislation applicable to milk and dairy products establishments. Beyond hygiene, milk and dairy products are, as with other foods, required to be compliant with general food law and legislation including labelling, contaminants, additives and composition. Information relating to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is a matter for the devolved administrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.9/3">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that between 1997 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase> the hygiene legislation under which milk and dairy products establishments were regulated in England was the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 (as amended) and the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations 1959 (as amended). On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>, new and directly applicable EC food hygiene legislation came into effect which superseded this legislation (Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 and Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004).</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.9/4">The Dairy Hygiene Inspectorate (DHI) is part of the State Veterinary Service (an executive agency of Defra) and acts on behalf of the agency in administering and enforcing the hygiene legislation at registered milk production holdings prior to processing such as pasteurisation, bottling or the manufacture of dairy products. Local authorities enforce the regulations in establishments undertaking activities in relation to milk beyond the remit of the DHI and the remainder of the dairy industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.9/5">The Agency has obtained information from the DHI relating to inspections of registered milk production holdings carried out in England during the period requested which is set out in the table. I am advised that information is not collected in such a way that allows it to be presented by region.</p>

	<p pid="a.1070W.9/24">Information on local authority food law enforcement, including breaches resulting in formal enforcement action, is collected by the agency under monitoring arrangements to satisfy European requirements.

	<p pid="a.1072W.8/1">The main threats facing rhinoceros are loss of habitat and illegal poaching for their horn which is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. To address the threat to the species from international, commercial trade, the black rhino has been listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) since 1977. The UK has consequently banned all trade in rhinoceros products.</p>

We have also funded recent research into plant alternatives to traditional Chinese medicine ingredients like rhinoceros horn and tiger bone (&pound;67,500).

	<p pid="a.1074W.2/1">The Environment Agency (EA) first produced an indicative floodplain map for the whole of England and Wales in 1999. This indicated that about 1.8 million properties were at risk from flooding from rivers and the sea. The EA has continued to improve its maps, and in October 2004 published a new Flood Map on the internet, which included the flood zones defined in the Department for Communities and Local Government's land use planning policy. Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 defines the &quot;high risk&quot; flood zone as having an annual probability of flooding of 1.0 per cent. (or 1 in 100 in any one year) or greater for river flooding and 0.5 per cent. (or 1 in 200 for any one year) or greater for tidal and coastal flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1074W.2/2">There are estimated to be about 1.83 million properties across England and Wales within this definition of a &quot;high risk&quot; flood zone, which equates to approximately 3.5 million people. This figure has not changed significantly over the last 10 years; changes in the figure arise from improvements in the EA's flood mapping and changes in the land use in these areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1074W.8/2">Work undertaken by the Building Research Establishment for the Department indicates that putting clocks in the UK back one hour (to match Central European time) would lead to an net increase in carbon dioxide emissions from lighting, space heating and cooling energy consumption in UK buildings corresponding to around 1 per cent. of total UK emissions of carbon dioxide. The study also shows that a switch to British summertime all the year round would increase emissions by just under 0.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1076W.8/1">Licensing decisions on the commercial use of genetically modified (GM) products are taken at EU level. A type of GM oilseed rape known as GT73 received a favourable authorisation decision in August 2005 for import and processing within the EU, although not cultivation. This was under the procedures covered by Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1076W.8/2">In addition, other EU consents have in the past been issued for the use of GM oilseed rape under the regulations governing the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to the environment. However, in these instances the varieties of GM oilseed rape in question are no longer being marketed in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.1076W.8/3">Vegetable oil and other materials derived from certain lines of GM oilseed rape are authorised for use in food and animal feed, under regulation (EC) 1829/2003 on GM food and feed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1077W.2/1">No specific assessment has been made. However, a report from the DEFRA-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme states that recycling in the UK saves 10 to 15 million tonnes of greenhouse gases a year. This is equivalent to taking 3.5 million cars off the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/2">In July 2005, DEFRA published the document, 'Changes to Waste Management Decision Making Principles in Waste Strategy 2000', which put forward a number of principles on which waste decision making should be based:</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/3" class="indent">(i) Individuals communities and organisations should take responsibility for their waste;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) In taking decisions there should be consideration of alternative options in a systematic way;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) Effective community engagement should be an important and integral part of the decision making process;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/6" class="indent">(iv) The environmental impacts for possible options should be assessed looking at both the long and short term.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/7">These considerations are reflected in Planning Policy Statement 10 (PPS 10), published by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Guidance on PPS10 was published in June this year following a series of seminars with interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.2/8">The Government also encourage all local authorities to have in place a fit for purpose and up-to-date municipal waste management strategy to assist their waste management planning. DEFRA has produced guidance on how to prepare a waste management strategy, which is available from the DEFRA website:</p>

	<p pid="a.1084W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1084W.5/2">I understand from the Food Standards Agency that operators of abattoirs pay charges for meat hygiene official controls either on the basis of standard European Community fees for animal throughput, or on the basis of the cost of the controls if this would provide a lower charge. In 2005-06, about 95 per cent. of operators of abattoirs paid charges for hygiene controls based on European Community fees for animal throughput. These fees have not been increased since they were introduced in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.1084W.5/3">The other 5 per cent. of abattoir operators, mainly of the largest abattoirs, pay charges based on the cost of the meat hygiene official controls that are carried out. These charges include an element for veterinary costs in addition to the costs of other classes of official control staff and overheads. The veterinary cost element of the charge in Great Britain comprises the cost of veterinarians employed by the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) or the cost of veterinary services provided under contracts that are let competitively by the MHS and are individual to each abattoir. The veterinary cost element of meat hygiene charges for services provided by veterinarians employed by the MHS increased by approximately 24 per cent. from 2002-03 to 2006-07. The change in the average cost of contract veterinarians in the last five years could not be obtained without disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1085W.0/3">The target of the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) Real Nappy programme target was to convert an additional 155,000 households to real nappy use by April 2006, and in the process divert 35,000 tonnes per annum of disposable nappy waste from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/4">The rest of the answer remains correct and is detailed as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/5">WRAP reports annually on its overall progress in meeting targets, including work under the Real Nappy Programme. It is scheduled to report on its achievements for the business plan period up to 2006 soon. At the outset of the programme, 91 per cent. of expectant parents said they intended to use disposable nappies. Work done for the Environment Agency suggested the figure may be higher at 94 per cent. WRAP intends to survey parents again at the end of the programme and to establish the change in intended behaviour. An estimate of the diversion will be made and published by WRAP at that time taking account of the survey and other quantitative evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1086W.5/1">As the previous answer indicated, central Government will not be providing on-going support to Citizens Advice Bureaux in the UK and has therefore not carried out an assessment of support options for the bureaux. Approximately half the current support comes from local authorities that offer time-limited support agreements with possibility of renewal (but no guarantees).</p>
	<p pid="a.1086W.5/2">A recent review of the Department's funding of Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland concluded that there were advantages in having a mix of core funding and short-term project support. This can provide stability with the ability to be innovative and flexible to meet changing needs. I will be considering the report's recommendations as part of our Comprehensive Spending Review planning process.

	<p pid="a.1087W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-07">7 September 2006</phrase> the Department announced the Government's response to a report on doorstep selling published by the Office of Fair Trading in May 2004, in the light of a public consultation between July and November 2004 and further consultations with interested parties in 2005 and 2006. The response says that the Government will:</p>

	<p pid="a.1087W.8/3" class="indent">(b) require cancellation notices to be provided within contracts; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1087W.8/4" class="indent">(c) encourage greater transparency on prices and greater willingness to provide written quotes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1087W.8/5">The first measure (a) will require primary legislation, which the Government will bring forward at the earliest opportunity. We will then implement both options (a) and (b) by bringing forward revised Regulations in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1090W.8/1">The Department explains that it pays solicitors' fees and that it does not expect claimants to have to make additional payments. The Law Society have advised that, unless full information was given to the miner at the start of the case that most firms of solicitors did not make additional charges in these cases, any charges the solicitor makes to the claimant is likely to give rise to a finding of inadequate professional service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.8/2">Claimants are also advised that the Law Society has a Helpline (0845 608 6565) which claimants may contact with any complaints about individual firms of solicitors. The Department has been active in encouraging claimants to contact the Law Society in this respect and included this information in its most recent Compensation for Miners newsletter.</p>

	<p pid="a.1094W.2/1">Currently section 137 and 138 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 regulate extortionate credit bargains. These ensure that where bargains are extortionate, the courts may reopen the credit agreement and set aside the whole or part of any obligation on the debtor, require the creditor to repay the whole or part of the sums paid, to return surety or alter the terms of the agreement. These provisions will be replaced by a test of whether a credit relationship is unfair when the Consumer Credit Act 2006 comes into force. This will enable the courts to take into account all the circumstances of the relationship between the borrower and lender, not just the terms of the agreement when it was made. The new Act will also strengthen the test of fitness to hold a consumer credit licence and provide the Office of Fair Trading with greater powers to take action against lenders who do not behave in a fit and proper manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.2/2">In addition, we have already introduced new legislation to ensure that consumers are more aware of the terms and conditions associated with any credit agreement before they sign. This increase in transparency will enable consumers to shop around with confidence, choosing the right product to suit their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.2/3">The Government will continue to monitor the impact of these measures.</p>

The ODA has appointed consultants who, in consultation with Olympic stakeholders, sporting bodies and the local community, are scoping the different possible legacy uses for the stadium with a view to drawing up a business plan for future use of the stadium.

Examples of this can be seen across the country, such as the Lowry in Salford, the Sage in Newcastle-Gateshead and the Bellenden Renewal area in Peckham, South London. My Department's publication &quot;Culture at the Heart of Regeneration&quot; highlighted how culture can drive regeneration by reviving town centres, drawing communities together and promoting economic development. The role of culture in regeneration has been strengthened by a Joint Agreement on Sustainable Communities, signed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, my Department and a number of its key non-departmental public bodies in July this year.</p>

Our support to the education sector has been channelled through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). This plays a big part in meeting the recurrent costs such as wages and salaries of teachers and school materials. ARTF resources cover over 90 per cent. of the Ministry of Education's wage bill and teachers' salaries represent almost 40 per cent. of ARTF recurrent expenditures.

	<p pid="a.1106W.5/1">DFID and a number of other donors are contributing to the Public Sector Capacity Building Programme in Ethiopia, which aims to improve the Government's capacity to implement its policies and deliver effective services to the poor. DFID's contribution is &pound;25 million over five years. An important part of this programme is designed to deliver more effective and efficient public financial management, including procurement, audit, transparency and accountability mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/2">The Protection of Basic Services grant, which DFID helped to design and through which we began channelling assistance earlier this year, supports new initiatives for improving the accountability of Government and local officials to local communities for the delivery of basic services and to improve Public Financial Management.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/3">DFID also made a commitment in our White Paper, published in July this year, to conduct quality of governance assessments in partner countries, and we intend to do so in Ethiopia. The assessment will help us to identify how our programmes for promoting better governance might be strengthened.</p>

	<p pid="a.1110W.3/1">The information requested on total administrative costs is not available in the format requested. The Department has recently commenced the implementation of a new Resource Management System, which when fully commissioned is intended to produce this type of information. DWP has developed an interim solution to provide operational unit costs by benefit for 2004-05, however the administration costs on which the unit costs are based exclude non-recurrent costs, other DWP activities, policy and other central costs. Consequently analysis of total administration costs broken down by benefit is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110W.3/2">The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 from the Department of Social Security and parts of the former Department for Education and Employment including the Employment Service. Therefore data is not available prior to that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110W.3/3">In the meantime, the latest available data on total administrative costs, taken from the 2004-05 published accounts of each agency (net of income) is as noted in the following table. Figures for 2005-06 are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1117W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1117W.5/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1117W.5/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, in what proportion of Child Support Agency cases non-resident parents who owe maintenance have (a) made no payments in the last six months, and (b) never made any payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1117W.5/6" class="indent">In the six months to June 2006, 69% of cases where maintenance was due had either received a payment via the collection service or had a Maintenance Direct arrangement in place. 31% of cases had received no payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1117W.5/7" class="indent">Unfortunately it is not possible to provide information for part (b) for the Old Scheme as the data only goes back to August 1995 and is therefore incomplete. However, in the month ending June 2006, the Agency had received payments from 74 per cent of cases on the new scheme where maintenance payments were due, via the collection service, or cases had Maintenance Direct arrangement in place. 26 per cent of current new scheme cases have never received any payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1121W.6/19" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus actively encourages an innovative and competitive marketplace and works with larger providers to ensure that they understand the need to achieve diversity in the service delivery for all of our provision, including Programme Centres. To ensure that optimum use is made of the specialist services offered by smaller providers we facilitate the interface between contractors and sub-contractors through a variety of means, including discussions with trade associations, and notices placed on the Jobcentre Plus website <a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk">www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk</a> (Partners page).</p>
	<p pid="a.1121W.6/20" class="indent">As part of the tender evaluation process, we ask bidders to tell us how they will fully meet the varied needs of all customers; it is generally unlikely that any one provider could adequately demonstrate their ability to meet all of these needs without some specialist support. We also ask providers to give details of all their sub-contractors in their tenders and we take into account the skills and experience of the sub-contractors during the tender assessment process.</p>

	<p pid="a.1122W.2/1">Specific information regarding low income for Great Britain is available in 'Households Below Average Income 1994-95-2004-05'. The survey from which estimates are provided started in 1994-95. There are no suitable data source for years prior to 1994-95.</p>
	<p pid="a.1122W.2/2">Deciles are income values which divide households, when ranked by income, into ten equal-sized groups. No matter what the shape of the income distribution, or how well off or poor people are, there will always be 10 per cent. of the whole population in the bottom decile, just as there will always be 10 per cent. of the whole population in the top decile; and this will be the case in every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1122W.2/3">The low income threshold is 60 per cent. of median income (Before Housing Costs). This particular threshold is an internationally accepted measure and in Great Britain is almost always in the 2nd decile. Therefore children can be moved above the low income threshold, but still remain in the 2nd decile, and so there will be no change in the figures showing decile distributions from year to year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1122W.2/4">Estimates of the proportion of children living in families in each income decile in each year 1994-95 to 2004-05, are in the following tables. Figures are shown Before and After Housing Costs.</p>

The trends in local rent levels up to the point of national roll-out are currently hard to predict and local housing allowance rates will vary across local private rent sector markets and different sizes of property.</p>

	<p pid="a.1127W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie:</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/3" class="indent">You recently tabled the following Parliamentary Question:</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/4" class="indent">To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, when his Department will process the mortgage interest relief benefit claim which Mr Thompson of Great Headline Crescent Paignton submitted in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/5" class="indent">The Secretary of State asked me to reply to your question and, in that reply, I promised to write to you directly concerning your constituent Mr Thompson of Headline Crescent, Paignton.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/6" class="indent">I should begin by explaining that mortgage interest relief benefit is not a stand-alone benefit, but forms part of a customer's entitlement to Income Support (IS). In cases where a customer's mortgage was taken out after October 1995, they would not ordinarily qualify for assistance with their mortgage interest payments for the first 39 weeks of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/7" class="indent">Mr Thompson claimed IS on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase>. When his claim was assessed we decided that he was not entitled to IS at this time as without his mortgage interest payments being taken into account his household income exceeded his IS entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/8" class="indent">Following your enquiry we reviewed Mr Thompson's claim and found that we had overlooked the fact that he had a current claim for Incapacity Benefit dating from <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-08">8 May 2005</phrase> for which he was receiving National Insurance credits. The effect of this claim was that his mortgage interest payments should have been taken into account from the start of the claim to IS he made on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase>. I have asked for Mr Thompson's entitlement to be reviewed to establish if he now qualifies for IS or mortgage interest relief from this date, and I am sorry for any inconvenience or distress Mr Thompson has been caused.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/9" class="indent">When Mr Thompson submitted his claim for IS on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase> he requested that we consider backdating this to <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-09">9 May 2005</phrase>. We wrote to Mr Thompson on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-27">27 July 2006</phrase> requesting further information to enable us to consider this request. However, we did not receive the information requested. We therefore asked him again to supply this information on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November</phrase>. When we receive the necessary information we will consider Mr Thompson's claim with the utmost priority and notify him accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.5/10" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1133W.14/2">Due to the measures we have taken since 1997, including the introduction of pension credit, pensioner poverty rates in Great Britain are currently at historically low levels, even while the country has been enjoying economic prosperity which traditionally benefits working age incomes relative to pensioner incomes. The effects of our proposed pension reforms are set out in the White Paper: &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot; (Cm 6841). This includes securing the gains we have made against pensioner poverty into the future, through our commitment to continue uprating the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit with earnings into the long term.</p>

	<p pid="a.1134W.2/1">The Government have introduced a suite of measures since 1997 to help older people enjoy a better standard of living, most notably the introduction of the minimum income guarantee and then pension credit; the creation of a dedicated Pension Service to improve service delivery and actively promote take-up of entitlements, above-inflation increases in the basic state pension, winter fuel payments for people over 60 and free television licences for people over 75. The value of the safetynet we provide for the poorest pensioners has increased by a third in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134W.2/2">Between 1996-97 and 2004-05 the number of pensioners in Great Britain in relative low income, after housing costs, has fallen by over a third, from 2.8 million to 1.8 million. Once housing costs are accounted for, a pensioner today is now less likely to be in low income than any one else in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134W.2/3">The White Paper &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot; (Cm 6841) announced our commitment to secure these gains into the future by uprating both the basic state pension and the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit in line with earnings over the long term.</p>

	<p pid="a.1137W.2/1">The White Paper &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot; states that the earnings link will be restored to the basic state pension. This will be done, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, in 2012 but in any event at the latest by the end of the next Parliament. The restoration of the earnings link together with other state pension reforms will help provide a firm state underpin for the introduction of personal accounts in 2012, which will make it easier for more people to save more for their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.2/2">Assumptions on earnings growth used in the White Paper are in line with economic assumptions described in the Budget 2006 Financial Statement and Budget Report, where earnings are assumed to increase in real terms at a rate of two per cent. per year in the longer term. The Government currently use the calculation of average earnings indices from the Office for National Statistics to uprate social security benefits such as the pension credit standard minimum guarantee. We expect to use average earnings as the index for uprating the basic state pension but will keep the exact measure to be used under review. We will set out our proposals on personal accounts later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1137W.5/1">Under our reforms, more people will be receiving state pensions based on their national insurance records, and there will be a more generous basic state pension due to the restoration of the earnings link. This will provide a solid foundation for private saving. The guarantee credit will continue to provide a safety net and reforms to the savings credit will reduce the spread of means testing and support the savings incentives, which are integral to the reform package.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/2">For the median earner illustrated in figure 8, and in today's earnings terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/3" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Under current policies, total contributory state pension (basic state pension and state second pension) would be around &pound;100 a week at state pension age, before any deductions for tax. Under a system with an earnings uprated guarantee credit from 2008, a non-saver would also be entitled to claim pension credit worth about &pound;49 a week, while a saver would be entitled to claim pension credit worth about &pound;36 a week, on top of their &pound;34 a week private pension savings. A saver would have a total state and private income, net of pension credit, of around &pound;170 a week at state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/4" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Under White Paper reforms, total contributory state pension (basic state pension and state second pension) would be around &pound;139 a week at state pension age (before any deductions for tax). Whether they were a non-saver or a saver their income would be above the qualifying threshold for pension credit, so they would not see any reduction in the net value of state payments if they chose to make private pension savings. Under current assumptions, their private pension savings would be worth &pound;80 a week, giving a saver total state and private income, net of pension credit, of around &pound;219 a week at state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/5" class="indentitalic"> Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/6" class="indent">1. Values are forecasts only. They are dependent upon future assumptions of price and earnings growth, and consequently are subject to revision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/7" class="indent">2. Numbers are shown in 2005-06 earnings terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/8" class="indent">3. Private pension outcomes are forecast using the assumption is made that under current policy, individuals save using a stakeholder pension at the rate of 3.9 per cent. (the average amount saved currently) and the annual management charge is 1.5 per cent. Under White Paper reforms savings rates are 7 per cent. with a management charge of just 0.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/9" class="indent">4. Projections under current policies assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; continued price uprating of the savings credit threshold; and continued price uprating of the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.5/10" class="indent">5. The White Paper reform projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the maximum savings credit from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper and measures to simplify state second pension from 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.1139W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking if he will cease the practice of jobcentres writing their client's name and national insurance number on warrants issued to them for travel in order to reduce opportunities for identity theft.

	<p pid="a.1139W.5/4" class="indent">Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. Jobcentre Plus's preferred method of dealing with payment of travel expenses is reimbursement of the travel expenses by either cash or cheque, but where the customer is unable to meet the initial travelling expense a travel warrant can be issued in advance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.5/5" class="indent">When issuing travel warrants, we are not required to enter a National Insurance number and, as an interim measure, a communication will be issued to all staff reminding them to use the customer's name only.</p>

	<p pid="a.1141W.6/2">There are approximately 430 coroners officers in England and Wales. Around 90 per cent. are employed by police forces with the remaining 10 per cent. employed by local authorities. I am not aware of any officers employed directly by the coroner, although some coroners directly employ other support staff. The draft Bill should not directly impact on the number of coroners' officers. Providing the coroner service is currently being resourced locally, there should be no requirement arising from the draft Bill to increase the number of coroners' officers in a particular area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1141W.9/2">The draft Coroner Bill regulatory impact assessment (RIA) published in June this year assessed the costs and benefits of a unified national coroner service consisting of coroners, coroners' officers and other support staff. The RIA estimated the total cost of the unified national service as requiring an additional &pound;17 million per year in annual costs and &pound;31 million in set-up costs. Having assessed the costs and benefits carefully, the Government take the view that the benefits of a unified national coroner service do not justify the costs, and the proposals outlined in the current draft Bill provide better value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.1142W.5/1">We have no plans to amend the Data Protection Act 1998, as it does not prevent the lawful sharing of personal data. As we made clear in the Information-sharing Vision Statement, published in September, Government are committed to greater data sharing&mdash;where it is lawful and in the public interest&mdash;while ensuring suitable safeguards are in place to protect personal information. The safeguards are provided by the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act, which balance individuals' privacy rights with the need for organisations to use personal data for legitimate purposes. However, we wish to ensure that, as more data are shared, the level of protection reflects the potential risks. We have been consulting on a possible amendment to the Data Protection Act to strengthen the penalties for those who deliberately or recklessly obtain or disclose personal data. The consultation finished on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October</phrase> and we intend to publish the outcome later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1147W.5/1">Applicants for legal aid in civil cases can obtain funding for legal advice and information, investigative help, or legal representation, if they pass the standard tests of financial eligibility and if their case meets the criteria for the grant of funding, as set out in the funding code. These criteria include the prospects of success, and the likely costs of the action when compared with its likely benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1147W.5/2">The release of detailed information about the granting of funding to Mr. Sutradhar is prohibited by statute. However, this particular case, as a 'multi-party action', would have been subject to detailed case management by the Legal Services Commission (LSC).</p>

	<p pid="a.1147W.8/2">The hourly rates applied to this action, as set out under the Multi Party Action Arrangements 1999 and contracted at 'risk rates', were &pound;70 per hour for solicitors and &pound;90 per hour for barristers.

	<p pid="a.1148W.2/1">The operating surplus reported in the Legal Services Commission's Annual Report 2005-06 arose largely from the release of provision on dormant cases&mdash;see notes 4 and 13 to the accounts. The LSC set up a project to investigate and close such cases, and as a result it now has better data to estimate provision more accurately. This resulted in a reduction in the financial liability. This does not represent an underspend and has never existed as available cash.</p>

'The Good Practice Guidance on ASDs', which my Department and the Department of Health published in 2002, includes pointers to good practice on addressing these children's behavioural needs. The Government's response to the Education and Skills Committee's report on special educational needs includes a commitment to develop a pack for teachers, working with the Department's Autism Working Group, on making effective provision for children with ASDs.

	<p pid="a.1159W.2/1">The Department does not have a specific policy on the display or wearing of religious artefacts, nor has there been a single disciplinary case related to this issue. There is a comprehensive dispute resolution process which is used for matters of misconduct.</p>
	<p pid="a.1159W.2/2">The Department's policy is to raise awareness of equality and diversity through its diversity delivery plan and also through a number of other measures. We have had in place since 1999 prayer rooms for Muslim staff and with the introduction of the 'Religion and Belief' legislation in 2003; we have arranged for the provision of quiet rooms for prayer and contemplation across all our sites. In addition, to support managers in the Department, we published guidance on major festivals for example, Ramandan, Yom Kippur and Diwali&mdash;which supports one of our objectives of raising awareness amongst all staff and ensuring that we create an inclusive culture.</p>

	<p pid="a.1161W.3/1">No information is collected centrally which would enable the Government to make an estimate of the number of children with dyslexia at West Somerset county college. However, since 2004, the Department for Education and Skills have collected data on pupils by type of SEN as part of the annual school census. Dyslexia is included within specific learning difficulties (SpLD) - which also covers dyscalculia and dyspraxia. We have data on pupils with SEN at School Action Plus and with a statement of SEN where SpLD is recorded as their primary need. The number of pupils with specific learning difficulties at West Somerset county college in 2006 is in the table below. We do not have data on pupils whose needs are met at 'School Action'.</p>

In addition, the Department collects information on planned expenditure by local authorities on SEN.</p>

Ofsted's more recent report Inclusion: &quot;does it matter where pupils are taught?&quot; (July 2006) found that: &quot;there was little difference in the quality of provision and outcomes for pupils across primary, secondary and special schools. However, mainstream schools with additionally resourced provision were particularly successful in achieving high outcomes for pupils academically, socially and personally.

The Government's response to the Education and Skills Committee's report on SEN announced that Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools has been asked to review progress in implementing the SEN strategy in 2009/10 and that the Government would consider whether any changes were needed to the SEN framework in the light of the chief inspector's findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.1168W.3/1">The collection of data on the users of tribunals is a matter for the Tribunals Service. The Department will discuss with the Department for Constitutional Affairs issues concerning the background of those who use the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.3/2">Although there are no data on the socio-economic backgrounds of parents appealing to SENDIST, its annual report includes a breakdown of appeals by local authority. There does not appear to be any clear link to economic circumstance between the local authorities with relatively high and relatively low levels of appeals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.3/3">Parents and guardians of children with special educational needs have equal access to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal (SENDIST). There are no direct costs in appealing to the Tribunal. The service is free and the Tribunal reimburses parents and their witnesses for travel expenses. Witnesses can also receive a standard allowance towards loss of earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.3/4">SENDIST aims to provide an accessible, supportive and helpful service to parents of children with special educational needs and to avoid formality in its proceedings as much as possible. Many parents do need help making and pursuing an appeal to SENDIST and the Tribunal provides details of some organisations that can help parents in their appeal booklet. It also provides information in a range of accessible formats, including Braille and large print, tape and video.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.3/5">Foster carers can appeal to SENDIST on behalf of children in their care and they would be expected to do so where this is appropriate. The local authority, as the corporate parent for these children, has a duty to promote their educational achievement and should always ensure that children in its care receive excellent support to meet their needs, including any special educational needs. The recent Green Paper &quot;Care Matters&quot; sets out proposals for a new independent advocate role to support children in care, alongside a national framework of skills and qualifications for carers. The present consultation will explore how these and other proposals in the Green Paper might be used to ensure children in care with special educational needs receive the right support for them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1169W.2/2">The Child Protection Database, maintained by the Commission for Social Care Inspection, provides the following data on the numbers of confirmed Serious Case Reviews (SCRs), following the death of a child, in each local authority since 2000. Accurate data prior to 2000 are not available. We do not hold information on dates of publication. The following table includes only those authorities where a child death has led to a confirmed SCR and provides an overall total for between 2000-05. SCRs were commissioned by Area Child Protection Committees (ACPCs) throughout the period covered by the table. ACPCs were nearly all based on local authority boundaries but there were a few areas in England where an ACPC covered two or more local authorities with social services functions. In order to maintain the confidentiality of individual children who were the subject of a SCR, x denotes fewer than three SCRs. The data for 2006 is not yet complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.1177W.2/16">The costs shown include all expenditure on staff training incurred by the Cabinet Office and the National School of Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1177W.2/17">Costs incurred on training and development in 2006-2007 will only be available when the Department's resource accounts are fully audited and laid before Parliament. This is expected to be before the 2007 summer recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.1177W.2/18">The rise in expenditure on training since 1997-98 can be explained by the increase in the number of staff working in the Department. In addition, training costs have increased as a result of the Cabinet Office's 'Investors in People' accreditation. 'Investors in People' is the National Standard, which sets a level of good practice for an organisation's performance through its people.</p>

These targets required Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) employers to reduce ill-health retirement rates, by 2005, to no more than 3.72 per 1,000 staff; a higher rate of 4.84 per 1,000 staff was set for the Prison Services. Active management by employers resulted in the target being met and, for the year to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">Friday 31 March 2006</phrase>, the overall ill-health retirement rate for employers generally was 1.76 per 1,000 staff and the rate for the Prison Services was 3.40 per 1,000 staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180W.8/2">The PCSPS provides ill-health pensions to members who are assessed by the scheme's independent medical adviser as being permanently incapable, by reason of ill-health, from carrying out their job. Qualifying members receive their accrued pension benefits paid immediately on an unreduced basis. Additionally, depending on the section of the scheme the member belongs to, the individual's length of service and the severity of their incapacity, reckonable service may be enhanced. The introduction of new pension terms for new entrants from October 2000 provided an opportunity to differentiate between those whose breakdown in health renders them incapable of any gainful employment and those who are incapable of carrying out their own job.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180W.8/3">Most civil servants joining the civil service on or after <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-01">1 October 2002</phrase> can, as an alternative to joining the PCSPS, opt for a partnership pension account which is a stakeholder arrangement with an employer contribution. The conditions for ill-health retirement are as for members of the PCSPS but the member receives a lump sum of 20 per cent. of pay per year of service rather than an ongoing annual pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180W.8/4">Information about the number of members who retire early on the grounds of ill health as a percentage of all retirements for the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme for the period from October 2002 onwards is shown in the following table.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.1180W.8/7"> <td><i> Period</i></td> <td><i> Ill health retirements as a percentage of total retirements</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1180W.8/8"> <td>October 2002-March 2003</td> <td>12.6</td> </tr>
