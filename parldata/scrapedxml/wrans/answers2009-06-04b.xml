	<p pid="b.614W.6/1">I recognise the benefits of well run local food hubs in helping to make it easier for local food producers to access markets, including public sector customers. Under the Regional Food Strategy both DEFRA and the regional development agencies have provided support for a number of initiatives, including food hubs, aimed at facilitating access to market for local food producers.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/2">Funding to encourage the development of local food hubs in England has come from a number of sources:</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/3" class="indent">The additional &pound;5 million over five years (2003-04 to 2007-08) which DEFRA made available to Food from Britain (FFB) to support the quality regional food sector;</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/4" class="indent">The regional development agencies' (RDA) single pot funding;</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/5" class="indent">The Rural Development Programme; and</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/6" class="indent">The private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/7">Examples of food hub-related activities which have received public funding include:</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/8" class="indent">Under the previous England Rural Development Programme a 50 per cent. Rural Enterprise Scheme grant of &pound;228,500 which helped fund the conversion of existing traditional buildings into Plumgarths Farm Shop and Lakelands Food Park in Cumbria;</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/9" class="indent">The Ludlow Food Centre which has received funding (&pound;159,000) from the West Midlands RDA; and</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/10" class="indent">A study being funded by the South East of England, East of England and London RDAs examining the feasibility of using food hubs to serve London with local and regional produce.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/11">In addition to the above, other examples of food hub facilities can be found in Bedfordshire (Woburn Country Foods), Essex (Ashlyns Organics); Shropshire (Weston Park); Nottinghamshire (Southglade Food Park) and Cumbria (Redhills near Penrith). In the south-west, the development of food distribution hubs is being driven by local demand through the supermarkets and food manufacturers without the need for public sector intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/12">Finally, DEFRA has also helped fund, via FFB, the research by Westley Consulting Ltd. and John Geldard (Plumgarths Farm) which led to the 'Supplying Local Food to Mainstream Customers' report published in August 2008. A copy of this report, which recognised the role that well run food hubs could play but was cautious about recommending public investment in establishing more hubs, can be found at the Westley Consulting website.</p>

	<p pid="b.621W.5/6" class="indent">By way of example, there are approximately 50 individual Job Role descriptors for a Jobcentre, which all Jobcentres would cover. Many Jobcentres therefore will have less than 50 employees and instead will establish posts (or jobs) that cover a range of these roles and responsibilities in a variety of permutations. Each manager will in turn set an individual set of objectives for each job holder. Similarly, non operational jobholders within functions such as Projects, Finance and Planning cover roles that are also not standard. Many of these jobholders will necessarily have individual descriptions. This variety and volume of jobs means that a description of every job in every grade is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.621W.5/7" class="indent">Instead, we have established over 200 Job Role descriptors covering operational roles, broken down by grade. I have listed these in Annex 1. The descriptors will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.621W.8/2">The cost of calling 0845 numbers remains lower than many alternatives and, where it is possible, using BT landlines to call 0845 numbers is usually the lowest cost option. Research was carried out in 2008 to estimate the additional telephony charges DWP would incur by switching all existing 0845 services to 0800. We do not have a precise amount, but it is estimated that the switch would cost &pound;10 million a year. In addition, there would be one-off transition costs of changing literature and raising awareness with staff, estimated at &pound;1 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.621W.8/3">BT account for two-thirds of landline provision and our recent research shows that over 80 per cent. of our customers contact us using landlines. We believe that 0845 numbers offer the best solution for the majority of our customers, including those wishing to apply for jobs with Jobseeker Direct. We understand that not everyone has access to a BT landline and if that is the case, we will always call back if asked to do so, so that we absorb the cost of the call.</p>
	<p pid="b.621W.8/4">If customers are unable to call Jobseeker Direct on the 0845 number, Jobcentre Plus offices have touch screen Jobpoint terminals installed for customers to use to access the same full range of vacancies available through Jobseeker Direct. In addition, all vacancies can be accessed online via the Directgov Jobseekers website and there are normally places available locally, such as libraries, which offer free internet access to jobseekers who are unable to get to a jobcentre or unable to access the internet in any other way.</p>

Member for Coventry South of 13 May 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, column 865, on Rover Group: pensions, what estimate his Department made of the extra costs which would be imposed consequent on the changes to the operation of the Pension Protection Fund in respect of people who took early retirement before the relevant scheme entered that fund; and what assessment he made of the capacity of the Pension Protection Fund levy to meet those extra costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.623W.2/1">As at April 2008, the estimated cost of removing the 90 per cent. compensation limit and the compensation cap for the people who had taken early retirement before April 2005 in a scheme that had already been admitted into the Pension Protection Fund was around &pound;4 million. That figure is based on the number of individuals affected at that time and does not reflect the costs in relation to early retirees in schemes which entered the PPF after April 2008 or those which may do so in the future as such information is not readily available. The pension protection levy is a matter for the board of the Pension Protection Fund, but any extra costs would be borne by levy payers.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.2/2">The estimated costs are one factor in the Government's decision not to change the way in which the Pension Protection Fund treats early retirees. The second is equality of treatment between those people who receive PPF compensation. Removing the compensation limit and the cap for some individuals who were under scheme pension age at the time their pension scheme entered the Pension Protection Fund would introduce inequalities in treatment of individuals under normal pension age and lead to a two tier system. The 90 per cent. limit and the cap ensure consistent treatment based on the individual's age at the time their pension scheme enters the PPF. They ensure that people who are able to take early retirement are not placed in a more beneficial position than those who stay in employment.</p>

	<p pid="b.624W.9/1">It is not currently possible to provide estimates of the potential costs and savings arising from MOD climate change adaptation measures over the next three years. It has, however, been shown in the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change that timely and well-targeted climate adaptation measures will yield benefits in excess of their costs. Some of these benefits will accrue to Departments as cost-savings over the next three years, and in future years. The main rationale for MOD investment is to address climate risk and contribute to reduction of the UK's vulnerability to longer-term climate change impacts.</p>

	<p pid="b.636W.5/2">The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) requires all data controllers, including internet services providers, to comply with the DPA and the data protection principles, when processing personal data. Personal data must not be processed unless, amongst other things, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 to the DPA is met. In the case of sensitive personal data, a condition in Schedule 3 must also be met. Consent is one condition for processing personal data, but it is not the only one, and whether consent is required for certain processing to take place will depend upon the particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.636W.5/3">Additionally the Internet Advertising Bureau has recently launched a code of practice which focuses on free and informed consent. Many internet services providers and key players have signed up to this, including Phorm, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL.</p>

	<p pid="b.637W.9/1">The following table gives figures for attempted frauds detected in passport applications for each of the last five financial years.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.9/2">The measurement of fraud is a complex issue. Historically IPS has counted as fraudulent only those cases which it has been possible to confirm absolutely as fraud. In recent years IPS has been engaged in a programme of work to better understand the nature and level of fraud within the passport application process and the success of existing measures in preventing fraud. This work has established that there were a significant number of cases in which IPS routinely prevents the issue of passports to fraudsters without actually recording those cases as fraudulent.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.9/3">As a result, processes to provide a more accurate measure of IPS performance in countering fraud have been developed and refined. This is the reason for the significant step change in success that IPS is now able to report. IPS currently uses a tiered approach to recording fraudulent applications based on the level of likelihood of fraud. Fraud is now categorised as confirmed fraud, probable fraud and possible fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.9/4">IPS continues to undertake analysis to better understand the fraud perpetrated against it and to more accurately measure and record its performance in this complex but important area.</p>

	<p pid="b.657W.2/1">Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs) were used extensively as building materials in Great Britain and the majority of schools are likely to contain them as are many other buildings both domestic and non-domestic. It has been estimated that more than 500,000 non-domestic premises, including schools, still contain ACMs.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/2">Many maintained schools built or refurbished between 1945 and the early 1980s have asbestos in the fabric of the school building because in that period ACMs were extensively used as building materials in new and refurbished schools, although asbestos removal has taken place in some of them since. In particular, pre-fabricated schools&mdash;so called system-built schools&mdash;of the CLASP, SCOLA and Hills types commonly used ACMs. The HSE records over 1,400 CLASP schools in the UK, and it has been estimated there are 13,000 system built schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/3">Major refurbishments normally include removal of all asbestos in areas in which work is undertaken and when new schools replace old ones the demolition includes the safe disposal of all ACMs.</p>

Risk assessment is a continual process and the &quot;responsible person&quot; for the school must ensure that it is updated as and when necessary. The Fire and Rescue Services are the enforcing authorities for the RRO and can inspect any premises at any time. There is no frequency given for such inspections but they are likely to be more frequent for high risk premises.</p>

	<p pid="b.678W.6/1">English Partnerships made no payments for public affairs work in the years 2005-06, 2006-07 or 2007-08. It is possible that some spend in relation to community consultation and engagement on specific projects may have involved public affairs firms, but it is not possible to separately identify these other than at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.6/2">The only public affairs firm used by the Housing Corporation was APCO. The Housing Corporation made no payments for public affairs work in the years 2005-06 or 2006-07. In 2007-08 payments totalling &pound;7,801 were made to APCO for the purposes of an article written by the then Chairman of the Housing Corporation, and for consultancy work associated with transition.</p>
