I have interpreted this question to refer to the subsequent decision which I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2011-06-17.87"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 87-88WS</phrase>, to further rationalise DSTL&#8217;s footprint and relocate staff from Fort Halstead to Porton Down and Portsdown West. The following factors informed that decision:</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/2" class="italic">Capability</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/3">The majority of the capabilities based at Fort Halstead will benefit from relocation because of potential synergies of skills and facilities with capabilities already based at the other DSTL sites. No capabilities will be disadvantaged by such a move.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/4" class="italic">Flexibility</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/5">Focusing on a smaller number of sites will increase DSTL&#8217;s ability to flex resources between capabilities in response to changing customer demand and priorities&#8212;including any potential future draw-down.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/6" class="italic">Career development</p>

	<p pid="a.428W.2/10" class="italic">Sustainability</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/11">Much of the building stock and infrastructure at Fort Halstead is old and not carbon efficient. The move will enable DSTL to significantly improve its performance against its sustainability targets.</p>

Key players, as represented by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' Electric Vehicle Group, the Plugged-In Places and the Institution of Engineering and Technology's Electric Vehicle Group, favour moving to a dedicated plug-in vehicle recharging connector (the IEC62196-2 Type 2) to allow faster recharging rates (up to 32A) than are possible with a three-pin plug. Given this clear direction of travel from industry, the Plugged-In Places will start to install public infrastructure with Type 2 connectors. We will continue to monitor the emergence of standards with industry and internationally.</p>

This will be supported by recharging at workplaces and public infrastructure targeted at those places where they are most likely to be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.8/2">This approach is supported by the findings of the Technology Strategy Board's Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator programme, one of the largest trials of plug-in vehicles in the world, the Energy Technology Institute's Plug-In Vehicle Economics and Infrastructure programme, Element Energy's work for the Committee on Climate Change and WWFs recent report &#8220;Electric Avenues&#8221;. These show that recharging at home, at night, is how drivers prefer to recharge. This type of recharging also maximises the environmental benefits of plug-in vehicles by using low carbon night-time generation and is economically preferable, as it allows consumers to take advantage of cheaper off-peak tariffs.</p>

	<p pid="a.437W.0/4">Transparency is central to our efforts to restore public confidence in the manner in which MPs are reimbursed for expenses and business costs. The lack of transparency under the former regime governing MPs' expenses was one of the factors that brought it into disrepute.</p>
	<p pid="a.437W.0/5">A recent survey commissioned by the National Audit Office found that public confidence is increasing: 55% of the general public thought that the situation with respect of MPs' expenses had improved in the last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.437W.0/6">IPSA's view is that our approach to publication needs to strike a balance between cost effectiveness on one hand and public confidence on the other. The evolution is clear&#8212;from the declining number of hits with every publication&#8212;that everybody is becoming used to bi-monthly publication as a regular feature of our transparency regime. We see no reasons to undertake further research on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.439W.6/1">Under the Health and Social Care Act 2008, all providers of regulated activities as defined in regulations made under the Act, regardless of how the activity is funded, must be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and meet and continue to meet 16 essential requirements of safety and quality. Personal care provided by a family member or friend, with no commercial consideration, does not require registration with the CQC.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.6/2">Where the care is arranged and directed by the person receiving the care, without the involvement of an agency, the provider is not required to register with the CQC. This allows the individual to use the personal budget flexibly and choose whatever arrangements suit them best.

	<p pid="a.439W.6/5">In both cases, the council should still inform the direct payment recipient that, while a CRB check is not mandatory, they may still wish to consider obtaining one as part of their overall risk management plan. However, it is ultimately a matter for the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.6/6">In the case of a suitable person managing a direct payment on behalf of someone lacking capacity who is not a close relative, regulations do require a CRB check for anyone providing care via a direct payment.</p>

In line with the recommendations of the Future Forum on education and training, strategic health authorities are working with stakeholders and their local healthcare providers to develop employer-led partnerships to plan and develop their local work force, including planning for relevant clinical post-graduate programmes, when the strategic health authorities close in April 2013.</p>

	<p pid="a.453W.11/1">The Legal Services Commission has been working closely with Immigration Advisory Service (IAS) for some time now following an audit which raised concerns around the company's financial management and claims irregularities and as such, the Trustees of the IAS decided that the organisation had to enter into administration on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-08">8 July 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.11/2">The IAS's current position reflects the company's past financial management and claims irregularities and is not a direct consequence of the proposed legal aid reforms, not least because these reforms have yet to be implemented. It is the current and historic financial management failures, that have resulted in significant liabilities which IAS has found itself unable to meet.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.11/3">During recent negotiations with the Legal Services Commission, the IAS confirmed that they had plans in place to continue to operate after proposed legal aid reforms were implemented and would be in a position to return a surplus of around &#163;500,000 per annum. As such, this makes it clear that it is the debt owed to the LSC that has placed the IAS into administration, not the as yet unimplemented reforms.</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.3/1">It is not possible to accurately quantify the number of overstayers in the UK as some deliberately evade immigration control in order to remain in the country illegally.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.3/2">The e-Borders system enables checks to be made on individuals arriving or exiting the country at a majority of the points of entry to the UK, but it is not yet fully rolled out. E-Borders is currently tracking around 55% of inbound and 60% of outbound passenger movements to and from the UK. This equates to approximately 126 million passengers a year on over 2,800 routes, and includes over 90% of non-EU aviation passengers. The Government are committed to increasing the number of UK ports undertaking exit checks to ensure that a more complete passenger travel history is recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.3/3">This will enable provision of the information requested to be developed as e-Borders is progressively rolled out.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.3/4">We are however able to provide the number of identified overstayers and of those how many have been subsequently removed, between January 2011 and June 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.461W.3/3">However, both child benefit and the child tax credit are &#8220;family benefits&#8221; under the European Community (EC) social security co-ordinating regulations (EC Regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009, previously EC Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72), which the United Kingdom has administered since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973. Under these EC regulations, nationals of other member states who are employed or self-employed in the United Kingdom and are paying compulsory national insurance contributions are entitled to claim child benefit and the child tax credit in respect of children resident in other member states. United Kingdom nationals who work and are compulsorily insured in another member state have reciprocal entitlement to family benefits in that other state by virtue of the same EC regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.461W.3/4">The value of family benefits paid by the United Kingdom under the EC regulations is only available at disproportionate costs. This is because not all such awards in respect of children resident in other member states are made at the full United Kingdom rate of benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.463W.0/1">In recent years, the Department has not published assessments of future trends in pensioner poverty. Currently, macroeconomic uncertainty and the Department's significant programme of welfare and pension reform mean that it is not possible to produce any reliable estimate of future trends in pensioner poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/2">Estimates of pensioner poverty are published in the Households Below Average Incomes series. The most commonly used measure of pensioner poverty relates to those people with income below 60% of contemporary median household income, after housing costs. This is often referred to as relative poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/3">The latest data available from the Households Below Average Incomes for 2009-10, show that in England, after housing costs, the proportion of pensioners in relative poverty is 16% in rural areas compared to 16% in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/4">For Wales, the latest data available from the Households Below Average Incomes for 2007-08 to 2009-10, shows that, after housing costs, the proportion of pensioners in relative poverty is 17% in rural areas compared to 17% in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/5">In England and Wales, the corresponding figures based on 2009-10 data are 16% in rural areas compared to 16% in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/6">In Scotland, the corresponding figures based on 2007-08 to 2009-10 data are 14% in rural areas compared to 13% cent in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/7" class="italic">Notes</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/8">1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the 2009-10 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/9">2. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/10">3. Figures have been presented on an after housing costs basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/11">4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/12">5. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/13">6. Proportions of pensioners in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/14">7. Three survey years have been combined for Scotland and Wales because single year estimates are not considered to be sufficiently reliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/15">8. Due to different definitions of rurality in Scotland compared to England and Wales, and the fact that no information is collected on the Family Resources Survey covering rurality in Northern Ireland, it has not been possible to present figures for the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.6/2">DCLG makes a distinction between under-performance and poor-performance. Under-performance occurs where the job holder contributes notably less than can be reasonable expected of the grade, while poor-performance is defined as a consistent or repeated failure by a member of staff to carry out effectively the requirement of their job.</p>

The average retirement age in the main public service schemes are presented in column 3 of Table B1 of the IPSPC's interim report.</p>

The design and distribution of this increase is being considered in discussion with trade unions and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.5/3">On retirement ages, one of Lord Hutton's recommendations was that the normal pension age for public servants, except for the police, firefighters and armed forces, should be linked to the state pension age.

	<p pid="a.488W.3/1">The Prime Minister pledged to make this the greenest Government ever and recently announced that carbon emissions from Government HQs and offices have been cut by nearly 14% in just one year. Following this, he committed the Government to go further by reducing emissions by 25% by 2015. We are also supporting greater energy efficiency across the economy by introducing the Green Deal, leading technological development with support for the world's first commercial scale CCS demonstration, and rolling-out smart meters and a smart grid will build on this progress. Moreover, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">12 July 2011</phrase> the Government published &#8216;Planning our electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity&#8217;. The White Paper sets out key reforms to the electricity market to attract investment, reduce the impact on consumer bills, and create a secure mix of low-carbon electricity sources including renewables, new nuclear and carbon capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.3/2">Emissions projections, published in May 2011, show that the UK is on track, on central forecasts, to meet our first three carbon budgets and our 2020 target to reduce emissions by at least 34% against the 1990 baseline. Emissions have already been reduced by over 26%, taking into account the effects of emissions trading.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.3/3">We also recently set in legislation the level of the fourth carbon budget for the 2023&#8211;27 period which equates to a 50% reduction in emissions. This autumn Government will be publishing a comprehensive strategy which will set out how the fourth carbon budget might be met, pathways to our 2050 target as well as a live Carbon Plan which will set out shorter-term actions the Government commits to undertake, and key milestones to keep us on track to delivering our ambitious climate change goals.</p>

	<p pid="a.489W.5/1">Energy suppliers are now required by law to provide support with energy costs to more of their most low income and vulnerable consumers through the Warm Home Discount scheme. Over the next four years they will provide support worth up to &#163;1.1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.5/2">Under arrangements designed to provide a smooth transition from the previous voluntary agreement, which ended in March 2011, suppliers are able to continue offering social and discounted tariffs as part of the Warm Home Discount scheme. How these tariffs are made available to vulnerable consumers is a matter for the energy suppliers and will be monitored by Ofgem.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.5/3">The majority of the new support available this year will be in the form of rebates to a core group of older poor pensioners&#8212;who will be identified to energy suppliers by Government through a data matching and sweep-up process using benefit information. We estimate (based on current casework figures) that about 600,000 of these pensioners will receive a rebate worth &#163;120 in winter 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="a.491W.6/1">At this stage communications technology solutions have not been selected for the smart metering system. Both wired and wireless technologies exist that could be used, and for practical and technical reasons, both will need to be utilised by installers during the rollout.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.6/2">Where wireless technologies are used they will have to comply with relevant regulations, best practice and international standards as set out by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. Compliance with these standards will be a requirement for the smart metering equipment. Suppliers will have a licence obligation to install smart metering equipment that meets the requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.6/3">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) is responsible for providing advice on standards of protection for exposure to non-ionising radiation, including the radio frequency electromagnetic fields (radio waves) associated with smart metering technologies. The programme will continue to engage with the Department of Health, HPA and our full range of other stakeholders on all relevant practical issues as work progresses on communications for smart metering.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.6/4">We estimate that over the next 20 years, the rollout of smart meters will deliver &#163;7.3 billion net benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and networks. A large proportion of the benefits of smart metering are underpinned by the ability to access the meter remotely and to provide customers with real time data on their gas and electricity consumption.</p>

	<p pid="a.495W.5/1">Apprenticeships provide substantial economic benefit both to employers and to their workers. It is therefore crucial that smaller employers, who form the backbone of our economy, have the opportunity to reap the benefits that apprenticeships offer. We are working to ensure that the process all employers go through to recruit an apprentice is as straightforward as possible. This includes creating a new on-line toolkit, taking employers through the 'end to end' journey from initial interest to actual recruitment, and developing new delivery standards enabling employers to fully understand the level of service they can expect from the National Apprenticeship Service and the apprenticeship provider.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/2">We are also working with employer representative bodies (such as the Federation of Small Business and the British Chamber of Commerce) as well as employers from small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) to identify the barriers these firms may face in recruiting an apprentice. We will come forward in the autumn with proposals to facilitate greater SME engagement with apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="a.498W.14/2">For-profit higher education institutions that want their students to access student support funding would have to comply with requirements on quality, dispute resolution, information, access (if charging over the basic tuition charge), financial sustainability, any reformed student number controls and tuition charge caps. As now, HEFCE would sit within a framework of &quot;arm's length&quot; principles precluding it from any role in admissions. This framework, on which we will consult, provides the necessary safeguards for students in respect of quality and information; protects the autonomy of institutions; and ensures government is able to maintain control of its financial exposure.</p>

	<p pid="a.503W.0/2">There are very few licences issued that specifically relate to permitting a vessel to fish with hand lines. Instead, licences are structured primarily to control what species a fisherman can target. For example, a category A licence allows a fisherman to target any species subject to UK quotas. Within this, they can use a range of gears, depending on any EU or national technical conservation measures in place&#8212;for example, there are restrictions on the use of beam trawl gears based on historic activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.503W.0/3">There were 1,386 category A licences issued in 2010 to vessels spread around the UK, all of which could have potentially used hand line gears. Of these, for example, only 345 vessels actually fished for mackerel with hand lines in 2010 in the South West, i.e. ICES areas 7e to 7h. This does not necessarily mean that the other vessels were inactive as they may have fished with other gears.</p>

	<p pid="a.505W.3/1">DEFRA and the devolved Administrations work closely with the European Commission to ensure that we comply with EU legislation and that they understand the bovine TB situation in the UK. The Commission has supported our approach, approving the UK Bovine TB Eradication Plan for 2011, which includes controls to prevent the spread of bovine TB within the UK and to other countries. On that basis the current risk of EU sanctions is low. However, cattle can only be exported if they are individually certificated, come from officially tuberculosis free herds and if over 42 days of age have passed a pre-export tuberculin skin test within the previous 30 days. This is in accordance with Community law.</p>

	<p pid="a.512W.5/1">Ongoing surveillance of wild foxes has demonstrated that the fox population in the UK remains free of echinococcus multilocularis. Similarly, no domestic cases of human infection by the tapeworm E. multilocularis have been found. The UK's geographic separation from continental Europe essentially eliminates the risk of the introduction of E. multilocularis through the cross-border movement of wild animals to a negligible level.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.5/2">A qualitative assessment of the risk of importing the tapeworm E. multilocularis via the movement of pet animals to the UK has been carried out by DEFRA. Exposure of a pet to infection depends on the country visited and whether the pet has ingested any infected rodents. Alveolar echinococcosis is restricted to the northern hemisphere and has become more of a problem in some urban fox populations. The risk is currently mitigated by a requirement to treat all cats and dogs with Praziquantel (certified by a vet in the pet passport or third country official veterinary certificate) before entering the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.5/3">We recognise that without our current treatment regime there would be an increased risk of disease introduction and the disease could become established in the UK rodent or fox population. The European Commission has given a strong indication that it will shortly come forward with proposals that would enable the UK and other tapeworm free countries to retain tapeworm controls with a treatment window of one-five days.</p>

	<p pid="a.514W.0/3">The MCZ site recommendations, the formal advice from the Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies, and the impact assessments will be sent to Ministers in January 2012. We will give these and the scientific and economic evidence and stakeholders' views careful consideration, before making a decision on sites to take forward to public consultation in early summer 2012 with a view to designation by end the end of 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.0/4">The Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies' Ecological Network Guidance to the regional projects describes the requirements for an ecologically coherent network, including those habitats and species of conservation importance considered to be most appropriately protected using MCZs. The guidance is available on Natural England's website. For habitats and species requiring the requiring the establishment of European sites (Special Areas of Conservation and/or Special Protection Areas (SPAs)) in accordance with the EC habitats and birds directives, it is considered that these European sites will provide the requisite contribution to the network.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.0/5">MCZs should only be proposed for habitats and species that are protected under the EC habitats and wild birds directives in exceptional circumstances, and where they are essential to meet the ecological coherence objectives of the wider MPA network, as our guidance makes clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.0/6">When selecting MCZs for habitats and species of conservation importance, particular attention is given to areas of additional ecological importance. These include areas that support particular ecological processes, are important for particular life stages or behaviours of any species, are highly productive or support high biodiversity. Spatial protection mechanisms are not, in isolation, the most effective way of protecting highly mobile species. Protecting some habitats important to mobile species can aid their conservation, as part of wider protection measures that can be applied across their range. We will continue to develop bespoke management measures for vulnerable mobile species, such as acoustic deterrents to reduce dolphin bycatch and fisheries protection for endangered sharks. For birds the SPAs, combined with other sector-wide initiatives (for example under the EU Seabird Plan of Action), will be the primary methods for protection. If areas important to habitats or species not specified in the Ecological Network Guidance are identified, the evidence should be provided and we will consider their protection through MCZs.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.0/7">The regional projects are working with stakeholders to identify possible management measures, such as byelaws or voluntary agreements that may be needed. Their likely social and economic effects will be assessed in an impact assessment. This will include the potential resources required for management provisions: for example the potential cost to the Marine Management Organisation and Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities of putting byelaws in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.530W.0/1">Our top priorities in Gaza are to ensure that aid reaches those who need it, and, that, homes, schools, hospitals and other essential buildings are rebuilt. All parties to the conflict need to respect international humanitarian law and allow full and unhindered access for humanitarian aid and aid workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.0/2">Israel's decision to move from a list of 120 permitted goods to a list of specific prohibited items was a positive step. However there has been no fundamental change in the crossings regime and economic stagnation and de-development in Gaza remain the norm. We are clear that more needs to be done, particularly to enable exports, accelerate key imports for reconstruction and ensure free movement of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.0/3">The UK continues to press the Israeli Government, bilaterally and by working with others such as the EU, on the issue. We will be working alongside our EU partners with Israel to achieve the real changes on the ground that we are looking for. Without economic growth in Gaza, there is a risk of fostering a more broadly radicalised environment. An improved economy and a resurgence of Gaza's pragmatic business community are not only essential for the people of Gaza, but are also firmly in Israel's security interests.</p>

	<p pid="a.530W.3/1">The UK Government remain extremely concerned about the situation in Yemen. Following the attack on President Saleh's mosque on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-03">3 June</phrase> the President is currently receiving medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. Since President Saleh left Yemen on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-04">4 June</phrase>, the capital has experienced a welcome lull in the fierce inter-factional fighting seen in previous months. But the situation elsewhere in Yemen remains tense. The Yemeni cities of Taiz and Aden have seen continuing fierce fighting. The Yemeni Government admit that they have lost security control over five governorates. Yemeni security forces are fighting to contain attempts by Islamic militants and others to control the towns of Zinjibar and Ja'ar in Abyan governorate. Continuing conflict is exacerbating the serious humanitarian crisis that Yemen already faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.3/2">Nonetheless, we continue to work with the Vice President and other key players in the Government and opposition to secure the political change that Yemen so badly needs. We continue to urge Vice President Hadi to engage with all sides to begin a peaceful political transition on the basis of the Gulf Co-operation Council agreement. We encourage all sides to participate in an inclusive dialogue as a way forward and to refrain from further violent clashes.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.3/3">Given the unstable security environment we advise against all travel to Yemen at this time and strongly urge all British nationals to leave the country now while commercial carriers are still flying.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.3/4">There is ongoing serious violence, dangerous levels of criminal activity and general internal insecurity in the southern and central regions of Somalia, and there are regular outbreaks of inter-clan violence and a high threat from terrorism throughout Somalia. We advise against all travel to Somalia, including Somaliland.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.3/5">However, African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has made good progress in recent months to secure Mogadishu. At present, AMISOM controls roughly 60% of Mogadishu's territory, home to around 80% of its population. I commend the bravery of AMISOM troops, and am encouraging the Transitional Federal Government to ensure that they build on these security gains to promote further stability in Mogadishu. Security and governance is also improving in Somaliland, as demonstrated by its recent successful and peaceful presidential elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.2/1">Our overall objective is securing a more peaceful and stable Yemen, which presents a reduced risk to UK interests at home and in the region. Our work focuses on achieving a peaceful settlement to the current political stalemate; halting the country's decline into state failure; and working with the Yemeni authorities and others to disrupt Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's activities and operations. This is proving extremely difficult in the current volatile security climate in Yemen. Given our serious concerns about the security situation, we have drawn down our embassy to a small core team. That said, we continue to work with the Vice President and other key players in the Government and opposition to secure the political change that Yemen so badly needs. We continue to urge Vice President Hadi to engage with all sides to begin a peaceful political transition on the basis of the Gulf Co-operation Council agreement. We encourage all sides to participate in an inclusive dialogue as a way forward and to refrain from further violent clashes.</p>
