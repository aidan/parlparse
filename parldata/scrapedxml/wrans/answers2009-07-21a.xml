	<p pid="a.1146W.0/2">Other factors taken into consideration when deciding whether to accept a case are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.1146W.0/4" class="indent">If the case has a significant international dimension;</p>

	<p pid="a.1157W.8/1">Plea bargaining is not a term recognised by the criminal law of England and Wales. The decision of a prosecutor to accept guilty pleas to offences other than those charged, or on a different factual basis, is governed by section 10 of the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the Attorney-General's guidelines on the acceptance of pleas and the Prosecutor's role in the sentencing exercise.</p>

	<p pid="a.1162W.0/1">The Treasury Solicitor's Department takes its understanding of the concept of &quot;conflict of interest&quot; from the Law Society's Solicitors' Code of Conduct.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162W.0/2">When the Treasury Solicitor, or counsel instructed by the Treasury Solicitor, acts for a Secretary of State, a Minister or a Government Department or agency, the client is the Crown itself (which is to say, the Crown in right of the Executive). There can be no conflict of interest in the legal professional sense in acting for a single client in more than one manifestation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162W.0/3">Occasionally, while acting for the Crown, the Treasury Solicitor is requested to act on behalf of bodies or persons who are not the Crown. These may be non-departmental public departments or, very occasionally, individual Crown servants having a personal legal interest in a matter or claim. In such cases, where there is a possibility of conflict of interest, the Treasury Solicitor's Department operates under procedures that have been designed to be compliant with Lexcel, which is the Law Society's practice management standard. That standard embraces policy and practice in relation to conflict of interests. In pursuit of accreditation, the Department has prepared guidance for all its staff which explains the requirements of the Code and details procedures for identifying and handling potential conflicts of interest. Both the policy and the procedures are kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162W.0/4">The procedures have been designed to ensure that conflicts of interest are swiftly identified, the clients are informed and appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests of the parties concerned. Such steps may, where the interests of all parties cannot be properly safeguarded, involve the Department's declining to act for the non-Crown party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162W.0/5">In any case where the question of conflict of interest has arisen, the case work file will contain a record of the consideration and the outcome.</p>

The data is provided by region to a scale of 25km grid squares in 30 year overlapping time slices, starting from the 30 year average between 2010-39. This data is freely available to all to make their own assessments of the likely effects of climate change. The Government have set the framework to allow local authorities to undertake their own assessments of the risks and effects from climate change into the future by including a new performance indicator (National Indicator 188 Planning to Adapt to Climate Change) in the local government performance framework. Under the Climate Change Act 2008 the Government are required to undertake a risk assessment of the impacts of climate change on the UK. The results of this risk assessment will include an assessment by region and is expected to be published in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.1169W.6/1">To ensure the budget available to England under the Rural Development Programme achieves the best possible value for money, it was decided not to implement measures within the Rural Development Regulation that provide assistance to farmers to adapt to standards based on Community legislation. To provide assistance to farmers that would only implement obligations under the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008 would offer no additionality&mdash;an important consideration in spending any taxpayers' money.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.6/2">No new central Government money will be made available for assisting farmers with the costs of meeting the manure storage capacity requirements established by the Nitrates Regulations. Capital grants could simply increase storage tank supply prices and merely postpone the impact of market forces. Providing grants would also contravene the 'polluter pays' principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.6/3">However, there are ways in which farmers can minimise the need for extra storage, through simple actions such as diverting rainwater away from slurry stores and covering storage tanks. We are providing advice and guidance on these actions and have provided a three-year implementation period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.6/4">Slurry storage facilities may also be considered as plant and machinery and therefore eligible for plant and machinery allowances such as the new annual investment allowance, capped at &pound;50,000 per year.

	<p pid="a.1179W.6/1">In 2003, following a review of the various options, Ofwat recommended that charging in relation to site area is the fairest approach to charging for surface water drainage. The larger the site area, the more surface water is likely to drain from it. Charging by site area therefore better reflects the actual costs imposed on the system by customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.6/2">Charging by site area is also considered to be the most environmentally responsible approach in that it provides a financial incentive for site owners to reduce the amount of water that is directed into the public sewerage system. Options for achieving reductions include such things as: replacing an asphalt or concrete car parking area with a gravel one, and the installation of soakaways. This will reduce the likelihood of flooding from overloaded sewers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.6/3">Surface water drainage needs to be managed more sustainably, by allowing for the increased capture and reuse of water, slow absorption through the ground, and more above-ground storage and routing of surface water separate from the foul sewer, where it is appropriate to do so. Water should increasingly be managed on the surface, rather than relying on the wholesale upgrade of the sewer system which would be a costly and lengthy process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.6/4">The Environment Agency has estimated that around two-thirds of the flooding in summer 2007 was due to surface water. Surface water flooding is extremely difficult to predict as it is often a result of sudden localised rainfall events, and very small variations in the built environment can have significant effects on the way the water flows.</p>

	<p pid="a.1181W.2/3" class="indent">My predecessor undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question of the <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-13">13 May 2009</phrase> (Official Report, column 762W) about the number of airbridge aircraft delayed in each year since 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.2/4" class="indent">Delay statistics are routinely collected for the passenger airbridge only. The passenger airbridge has provided a consistent and reliable service over the period, moving large numbers of personnel into sometimes hostile environments and under difficult conditions. Every effort is made to minimise delays and over 92% of airbridge flights arrive within six hours of their scheduled time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.2/5" class="indent">No airbridge tasks to Op Telic or Op Herrick have been cancelled since 2007. Delays may occur for a number of reasons. The location and reason for each delay is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. Individual tasks could be delayed for more than one reason. Examples include: Air Traffic Control and airspace restrictions, missing imposed theatre arrival slot times, technical and equipment failures, diplomatic clearance, weather, crew duty hours, passenger and ground handling issues, fuelling, and holding aircraft to facilitate deployment of priority aeromedical teams to theatre.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.2/6" class="indent">Information on delays to civil aircraft chartered by the MOD to operate the passenger airbridge, is given in the following tables. For 2007 delays were measured against the scheduled time of departure. Since January 2008 delays have been measured against scheduled time of arrival. It is not possible to distinguish between outbound and inbound charter flights. The data is held by calendar year and percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>

In a relatively small number of cases, their injury or condition may mean that they become permanently unable to deploy. Reasons for this are various, but might include a serious permanent injury (physical or mental) or because during service they develop a medical condition that is incompatible with front line duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.5/3">The majority of those personnel who fall into the category of medically &quot;not fully fit&quot; remain fit enough to work in some capacity and therefore continue to make a contribution to operational effectiveness, often within theatres of operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.5/4">Service personnel with medical conditions or fitness issues which affect their ability to perform their duties will generally be referred to a medical board for a medical examination and review of their medical grading. In clear-cut cases where the individual's fitness falls below the service employment and retention standards, the board will recommend a medical discharge without further delay. In many cases however, the patient will first be downgraded, to allow for treatment, recovery and rehabilitation. For personnel who do not make a total recovery, the board may recommend the patient is retained as permanently downgraded with limited duties, or they may recommend a medical discharge. The numbers of service personnel medically discharged during the period 1997 to 2008 are shown in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.1185W.0/3">In the case of the Royal Navy and the Army, these courses are followed by assignments to ships, Royal Marine commando units, medical regiments, Field Army units or medical centres.

	<p pid="a.1189W.2/1">Diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders in the armed forces is performed by fully trained and accredited mental health personnel, and measures are in place to increase awareness at all levels and to mitigate the development of operational stresses. In Afghanistan, we deploy uniformed mental health nurses to provide the necessary in-theatre care and treatment for our personnel. If personnel need to leave the operational environment, then their care continues either on an out or in-patient basis in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1189W.2/2">In the UK, our mental health services are configured to provide community-based mental health care, primarily through our 15 military departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental health care. The DCMH mental health teams comprise psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available (including psychological therapies, environmental adjustment and medication) where appropriate. The Defence Mental Health Services have particular expertise in treatments for psychological injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.1189W.2/3">For the relatively small number of patients who need it, in-patient care is currently provided by a group of seven NHS trusts located throughout England and Scotland, led by South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust (SSSFT) through a central MOD contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.1189W.2/4">The organisational structure of the Defence Medical Services means that comprehensive figures for mental health care expenditure cannot be provided without disproportionate cost as the sums involved are disaggregated and embedded in the budgets of individual military units and overall operational budgets. Under the contract with SSSFT, payment for in-patient care is made on a case-by-case basis; as a point of comparison, payments totalling &pound;3.3 million were made for in-patient care in 2008-09; most of this was paid to the previous in-patient provider.</p>
	<p pid="a.1189W.2/5">Since July 2007 the Defence Analytical Services and Advice (DASA) organisation has reported on the Psychiatric Morbidity of the UK Armed Forces. Quarterly reports for 2007 and 2008 are available in the Library of the House and on the DASA website found at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.1190W.0/2">All three Defence Medical Services have processes for inspecting DCMHs, utilising a Common Healthcare Assurance Framework which is based on the Department of Health's &quot;Standards for Better Health&quot;.

In addition, the post of inspector-general has been established recently within the Surgeon General's Department and his team will visit units as part of his clinical audit and assurance activities.</p>

Some personnel will have their conditions managed wholly by primary care staff, who also have the capability to downgrade medically personnel if required; to treat and refer on personnel to military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs); or to liaise with DCMH staff if advice is required, including cases where direct referral to an in-patient facility might be appropriate.</p>

This usually takes the form of a one-to-one interview, although further reports (for example, from medical providers or from the chain of command) may be requested and psychometric questionnaires might be used where appropriate. The initial DCMH assessment will focus not just on the problem that led to referral but will take a holistic approach to the difficulties that an individual might be experiencing at the time of referral.</p>

	<p pid="a.1198W.6/1">The primary production facility for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) has been established at Lockheed Martin's plant in Fort Worth, Texas, building on the huge investment already made in the development phase of JSF, 90 per cent. of which has been funded by the US. All nine JSF partner nations that have signed the JSF Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development (PSFD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2006, including the UK, are committed to funding an equitable share of this production facility, which will eventually produce in excess of 3,000 JSF aircraft. It is our intention to use this best value solution for the build of all UK JSF aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.6/2">UK industry has benefited within the development programme to date and is well placed to continue through production. We estimate UK industry will provide in excess of 10 per cent. of the JSF production programme as we progress through the PSFD phase.</p>

	<p pid="a.1199W.2/2">The required and actual crew number for each aircraft type in the armed forces as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-09">9 July 2009</phrase> is given in the following table. Air crew numbers fluctuate on a day-by-day basis as individuals are re-assigned, medically down graded or leave the service. The variations in the required and actual crew numbers are principally due to an increased requirement to support new and increased aircraft types, such as the Typhoon, where it takes time to train aircrew to meet the associated manpower requirement. Similarly, aircraft types such as the Hercules C130K and Tornado F3, are in the process of drawing down and crew numbers are temporarily in excess of requirement. These changes are reflected in the figures however, action is taken to ensure that current operations are not affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.1200W.5/110">It is normal for there to be considerable variation between monthly &quot;Planned&quot; and &quot;Actual&quot; flying hours. &quot;Planned&quot; hours are based on the total amount of flying that could be supported by the Platform Project Teams for a given aircraft type and are not broken down by individual airframe. There is no requirement to hold data on average flying hours. The figures are agreed in Joint Business Agreements (JBAs) between Front Line Commands (FLCs) and the Defence Equipment and Support organisation, and are forecast up to a year ahead. The month by month Profile is to enable forward resource planning within the overall total for the year, not a definitive prediction of requirements, which will vary during the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1200W.5/111">&quot;Actual&quot; hours are the total of all hours flown for training and on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1200W.5/112">The reasons why actual hours may be less than planned include aircraft unavailability through routine maintenance, running repairs, essential upgrades and modification programmes; air crew unavailability through recuperation, absence on training courses, and leave; changes in training schedules; adverse weather; or cancellation of tasking. Taskings on operations clearly depend on mission requirements at any given time, which are difficult to predict several months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.1200W.5/113">Flying hours required for training are managed within this framework by the FLCs but priority is given to operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1200W.5/114">&quot;Planned&quot; flying hours not consumed may be carried forward into subsequent months. Hours flown on operations in excess of the year's JBA total flying hours may be funded by the reserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.1205W.2/3" class="indent">In my predecessor's written answer, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-12">12 May 2009</phrase>, (Official Report, column 753w), it was undertaken to write to you regarding your request for a list of the drug seizures made by Royal Naval vessels since 1997; where the seizures took place; and what the value of each seizure was. In the course of this research, US officials have been consulted, who have kindly shared information from their own very detailed records.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.2/4" class="indent">As you will recognize, disrupting illegal trafficking of weapons and narcotics is among the many important tasks we ask our Armed Forces to conduct. The Royal Navy conducts Flag State Verification procedures on Gulf Region Shipping and has also provided significant support to US counter narcotics operations in the Caribbean. Further disruption operations are conducted whenever opportunities arise during the Royal Navy's standing patrol tasks, including within UK territorial waters, in support of operations led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. These operations have contributed to the seizure of large quantities of illegal narcotics which otherwise might have ended up on UK, US and European streets. A comprehensive list of seizures since 1997 is set out below. This information updates previous estimates and draws on additional information provided by US law enforcement officials.</p>

	<p pid="a.1205W.2/80" class="indent">The results from forensic analysis of the many seizures in the Caribbean, provided to us by the American Joint Inter-Agency Task Force (South), have enabled us to update many of our previous estimates of the size of these seizures. Our previous answers were drawn from figures often estimated by the UK vessel at the time of the interdiction; subsequent investigations by law enforcement officials would usually have been completed after the UK vessel had left the vicinity and thus not reflected in the initial UK estimate. For interdictions when cargoes were jettisoned by the traffickers we have continued to provide the sizes assessed by the UK crew before the contraband was lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.2/81" class="indent">The table also includes a small number of additional interdictions that have not previously been reported. In some cases these omissions are due to different approaches by individual UK ships in recording an incident as a 'seizure' or as an 'interdiction' (which may have resulted in a jettison). In others cases the reliance upon disparate ships' records may have resulted in a small number of accidental omissions as our historic responses were consolidated. The positive outcome is that the Royal Navy has had an even greater impact on narcotics trafficking than previously reported.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.2/82" class="indent">It is very difficult to estimate street value of the illegal drugs seized or destroyed in these operations. The price varies greatly depending on a number of factors including supply and demand, the intended destination of the product as well as the purity of the drugs themselves when they reach their market. Not all of the seized drugs would have been intended for the UK, however for simplicity the estimated values in the table are based on the assumption that the product would have reached the UK with street values of &pound;40,000 per kilogram of cocaine, of &pound;45,000 per kilogram of heroin and of &pound;2,880 per kilogram of cannabis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.2/83" class="indent">In agreement with the Serious Organised Crime Agency these valuations have been applied retrospectively across the entire historical record; thus detailing estimated values of seizures as if they had reached UK streets in 2009. We have done this because there is no reliable record of street values year on year since 1997, particularly prior to the Agency's creation in 2006. Where only the number and not size of bales seized were recorded, we have not attempted to assign a street value.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.2/84" class="indent">The successes of these counter narcotics operations are considerable and to ensure that a full and accurate picture is maintained in future, I have put in place revised record-keeping policies and established a more centralised reporting mechanism which will be updated where possible with US post-forensic results.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.2/85" class="indent">I hope you will find this information useful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1227W.5/2">The Department for Transport uses valuations to assess changes: either to the costs of congestion over time, or for particular interventions. Valuations are therefore in terms of comparisons with a base year or with regard to a scenario without a scheme or proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/3">The Eddington Study, published in 2006, made use of analysis from the Department's National Transport Model. This looked at the costs of additional road congestion as it is predicted to increase over time, rather than the absolute costs of congestion. It estimated that the increase in time lost in England due to road congestion between 2003 and 2025 for all travellers including business and freight would be worth &pound;23 to &pound;24 billion by 2025 in 2002 prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/4">Because the impacts of pollution are often locally specific, an assessment of pollution resulting from the whole motorway network would be very complex and so is not undertaken. When individual proposals are assessed, detailed analysis is undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/5">With regard to CO2 produced in the motorway network, changes to CO2 emissions over time, and as a result of schemes are produced as set out in the Department's Road Transport Forecasts 2008, and the Active Traffic Management study. Some of this evidence will include valuations of the CO2 changes.</p>

The network is maintained by applying whole life cost principles, and takes account of the fact that it is not practical or sustainable to maintain the whole network in an as new condition. The condition of the strategic road network is monitored on a regular basis and an annual performance target is set in the Highways Agency Business Plan. This target has been met since it was introduced in 2004-05 in the Highways Agency's Business Plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.1240W.0/1">Journey time is only one of the factors that people consider when they are making a choice about how to travel. Other factors include reliability, frequency and price. The Department for Transport has not carried out a detailed assessment of comparative journey times by rail and air, however the evidence does point to passengers making rail their first choice when it can provide a fast and convenient service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.0/2">For example passengers on short-haul trips to European destinations are already increasingly turning to rail where that is an attractive option. Flights to Paris have fallen by over 20 per cent. since 2000, and flights to Brussels by over one third. Increasing the speed of trains within the UK can also have benefits. The journey time between Manchester and London has decreased from nearly three hours in 2007 to around two hours now. The number of rail passengers between Manchester and London increased by 64 per cent. between 2003 and 2008 from 2.1 million to 3.3 million per annum and over the same time period the number of air passengers has decreased from 1.9 million to 1.4 million, a 30 per cent. decrease.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-15">15 January 2009</phrase> the Government announced that it was setting up a company, High Speed 2, to consider the case for new high speed rail services from London to Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.1245W.8/1">'UKaid' was developed through a process of research and testing with the UK public. From this research a range of designs were tested, of which 'UKaid' was the preferred option. It would be inappropriate to make public copies of unsuccessful designs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1245W.8/2">We anticipate spending approximately &pound;130,000 on re-branding our overseas aid, which will come from DFID's central communications budget. Of this, just over &pound;98,000 was spent on developing, designing and testing the logo to ensure that it was meaningful to the UK public. It was commissioned via the Government's Central Office of Information (COI), following best practice and ensuring optimal value for money. As COI are the Government's procurement specialists no design contract was required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1245W.8/3">In order to minimise the additional costs, and to ensure that the logo is introduced sensitively and appropriately, 'UKaid' will be phased in both in the UK and in the countries where we work. Within the UK the 'UKaid' logo will be used on a range of public communications, as well as DFID's website. Electronic templates will be updated at no extra cost; the logo will be incorporated into products as they are due to be replaced or replenished.</p>

	<p pid="a.1246W.8/1">The Department for International Development has received regular representations from members of the public and non-governmental organisations on the harmful impacts of 'vulture funds'. These representations usually stress that 'vulture funds' divert much-needed resources away from developing countries and exploit debt relief that was provided with the aim of relieving poverty. They also express concern at the use of UK courts to pursue legal claims. A survey by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 2008 reported that 10 businesses based in the UK and UK overseas territories had brought legal action on debts owed by heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), although creditors may litigate for a variety of reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.8/2">The UK Government have already taken a range of actions to reduce the extent of the problem of 'vulture funds'. In addition, I am pleased that today my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury has launched a consultation on legislation that would restrict the proportion of past HIPC debts that a creditor could reclaim under UK laws. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available on the Treasury's website:</p>

	<p pid="a.1252W.6/2">The promotion of Locate is a feature of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Know Before You Go public information campaign aimed at helping British travellers to stay safe and healthy abroad. It is impossible to calculate the exact spend on advertising Locate because the campaign combines a number of different travel safety messages, and local promotion initiatives have been funded from Posts' devolved budgets. However, we are able to specify that in 2008 the FCO paid &pound;25,000 for Locate's media launch in the UK, and &pound;24,300 for artwork and the development/printing of Locate leaflets and posters, mainly for use by our Posts abroad.</p>

The available information on the number of directors, senior managers, specialist, delivery managers, executive support and administration people is set out in the attached Table 1. The information provided includes some elements of estimation due to the significant organisational changes since 2005, and in particular within the past year meaning that it is difficult to make like for like comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.2/7" class="indent">Over the period from 2004 to 2009, two separate Department for Work and Pensions schemes for payment of bonuses have operated within the Child Support Agency; a modest special bonus scheme and an individual performance bonus scheme. The guidelines, policy funding and framework for these schemes were set by the Department. Individual performance bonuses are based on annual appraisal markings and are awarded at the end of the operational year. Additional special bonuses can be awarded to an individual outside the annual appraisal system, to recognise and reward an exceptional personal or team achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.2/8" class="indent">Table 2 shows the total amount paid to Agency employees as individual performance bonuses for the years 2007-08 and 2008-09 only. For the period 2004-05 to 2006-07, we are unable to analyse the total spend by job role and have therefore given information on the total spend in each year. Information on special bonus payments broken down by job role is also not available. The total spend is therefore shown for all employees for all years requested.</p>

	<p pid="a.1269W.2/5" class="indent">Collection of maintenance, including arrears, remains a priority for the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission. In March 2009 alone, the Commission collected and arranged over &pound;100 million in maintenance, almost &pound;14 million of which was arrears, and collected a total of &pound;158 million in child maintenance arrears in the year to the end of March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.2/6" class="indent">The current amount of arrears owed by non-resident parents is the cumulative total of sixteen years of maintenance owed.

	<p pid="a.1269W.5/5" class="indent">The Commission publishes a quarterly Summary of Statistics which contains a full range of statistical information assessing the impact of the Child Support Agency on the recovery of child maintenance.

	<p pid="a.1269W.5/7" class="indent">In addition, in 2007 the Child Support Agency commissioned research to better understand the client experience, and the issues and service that clients believe need to be improved. This research was published in February 2008 as the DWP Research Report: No 471 CSA Client Insight Research 2007. The Agency also commissioned two reports on the use of deduction from earnings orders in the collection of child maintenance; DWP Research Reports 520 and 530.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.5/8" class="indent">The Department for Work and Pensions commissioned the Relationship and Separation survey in 2008, DWP Research Report 503, to inform the changes to the system of child maintenance which led to the introduction of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission. This report focuses on the number and form of child maintenance arrangements in place, demographic information about the child maintenance population, past and future use of information and support, views on the changes to the child support system and likely behaviour as a result of these.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.5/9" class="indent">There have also been extensive reports conducted by DWP in the past on compliance levels, the effects of maintenance direct and international perspectives on child support.</p>

	<p pid="a.1270W.2/5" class="indent">The lack of a permanent address is not necessarily a barrier to the assessment and collection of child maintenance. If a non-resident parent can be contacted by telephone the information needed to carry out a maintenance calculation will be gathered by telephone and a contact address is not needed. If the non-resident parent has an employer correspondence can be sent via the employer. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has several means which it can use to trace those non-resident parents who are evading their financial responsibilities, including contacting the DVLA, the Prison Location Service and credit reference agencies. The small numbers of cases where the non-resident parent can not be traced are kept under review and the child maintenance liability does not come to an end.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270W.2/6" class="indent">The lack of a permanent address is also not a barrier to the collection of child maintenance in many cases. Where the non-resident parent is in receipt of benefit, a contribution to maintenance can be taken from the benefit without a permanent contact address. Similarly if a non resident parent is in employment, maintenance can be deducted direct from wages. Maintenance can also be paid by direct debit or standing order as well as by cheque or cash.</p>

	<p pid="a.1271W.2/5" class="indent">Tax Credits will no longer be taken into account in the calculation of non-resident parent's income from 2011 as a consequence of the move from net income to gross income.</p>
	<p pid="a.1271W.2/6" class="indent">The White Paper proposed that tax credits should no longer be included in the calculation of a non-resident parent's gross weekly income. It stated (at paragraph 4.17) &quot;It would not be appropriate for a liability to be based on a combination of tax credits that are currently being received and income from a previous period. Including tax credits from the previous year would complicate, rather than simplify, the way in which maintenance is assessed. Accordingly, and to reduce the complexity of administrative arrangements, we have concluded that tax credits should no longer be included as income.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1271W.2/7" class="indent">The Government has committed to move to using information supplied by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which will make maintenance calculations in the future scheme faster, more accurate and enable a more transparent process. HMRC taxable income information supplied to the Commission will largely derive from employers' end of year PAYE returns and from individual taxpayers' self-assessment returns. Neither data source will include tax credits as they do not form part of taxable income.</p>
	<p pid="a.1271W.2/8" class="indent">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is continuing to work with HMRC to decide how to make best use of this information and the outcome of this work will be reflected in a detailed definition of the income measure to be used in the maintenance calculation. This will be included in a set of affirmative regulations, which will be introduced for parliamentary scrutiny in advance of the planned start date of 2011 for the future scheme.</p>

The Strategy has objectives to make it easier for suppliers to compete for contracts and to encourage a diverse supply base, it also commits to monitor the use of these enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/2">The lead on most of the 12 recommendations of the Glover report is with the Office of Government Commerce (OGC). The Department fully supports all the recommendations and is actively engaged with OGC to facilitate development and adoption of the new procedures and tools required by Glover. The Department's progress in implementing each of the Glover recommendations is that DWP:</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/3" class="indent"><i> (i)</i> advertises key contracts via electronic media and publishes key contract awards electronically, it is on course to do both these things for all contracts via an OGC public sector online portal by 2010 - addressing Glover recommendations 1,2 and 3;</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/4" class="indent"><i> (ii)</i> already flags tendering opportunities thought especially suitable for SMEs during the advertising process - meeting Glover recommendation 4;</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/5" class="indent"><i> (iii)</i> has adopted standard pre-qualification questionnaires&mdash;meeting Glover recommendation 5;</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/6" class="indent"><i> (iv)</i> adopts a principle of competitive neutrality so all relevant experience of all bidders is taken into account when selecting tenderers&mdash;meeting Glover recommendation 6;</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/7" class="indent"><i> (v)</i> takes a flexible approach to supplier accreditation, where appropriate allowing businesses to refer to other accreditations they already hold&mdash;meeting Glover recommendation 7;</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/8" class="indent"><i> (vi)</i> published its Innovation Procurement Plan on 19th May 2009 which meets the requirements of Glover recommendation 8;</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/9" class="indent"><i> (vii)</i> adopts outcome based specifications requiring continuous improvement as a means of driving innovation&mdash;meeting Glover recommendation 9;</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/10" class="indent"><i> (viii)</i> will expect prime contractors to make their sub-contracting opportunities accessible through an on-line portal, when made available by OGC, and that they use contract conditions for their contractors in DWP supply chains that are no worse than those DWP has with the prime contractor&mdash;addressing Glover recommendations 10 and 11;</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/11" class="indent"><i> (ix)</i> has, since 2002, reported annually the value of DWP contract spend with SMEs&mdash;meeting Glover recommendation 12. The value of DWP contracts with SMEs in 2008/9 was &pound;252 million, about 7 per cent. of total commercial spend in that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.6/12">In summary the department has made good progress in implementing the Glover recommendations. Its action to date means it has already met seven of the recommendations and, working with OGC, is on course to meet the remaining five recommendations to the set timetable.</p>

	<p pid="a.1277W.5/1">In 2009 Directgov conducted a baseline exercise to benchmark the quality of the website and have put in place a plan for improvement, which is now being implemented as part of the overall web rationalisation and convergence programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.5/2">Directgov is in the process of designing a further continuous user improvement programme for the Directgov website which will start in 2009. The programme of user testing will involve both citizen and expert reviews. Each wave of research will review a number of different user journeys across the site to identify any usability issues. This is an on-going project. Each wave will test different journeys with different user groups in order to continually improve the customer experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.5/3">Strategies are being put in place to monitor search engine optimisation, metrics and customer comments to improve the Directgov service by making it easier for people to find what they want.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.5/4">Directgov recently improved the design of their Homepage based on feedback from a representative sample of customers. The new Homepage design is structured in a way that allows customers to quickly find essential government information on topical issues such as Swine Flu, and allows customers to easily distinguish main navigation links from secondary and peripheral content.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.5/5">Directgov has also commissioned a project that looks at the future shape of the website. The project is following a user-centred design approach with frequent rounds of user testing to ensure optimal findability and usability of content.</p>

People who are unemployed and on jobseeker's allowance can undertake part-time education or training at any point in their claim providing it is for less than 16 hours per week.

	<p pid="a.1282W.5/4">In addition, young people in England who are under the notice of redundancy are now eligible for the additional training support available through the Response to Redundancy programme, funded by the European Social Fund and Train to Gain.

	<p pid="a.1289W.0/3">From October 2010 we shall be providing existing incapacity benefit claimants aged 25 to 49 with three Work-focused interviews as they migrate to Employment and Support Allowance. Those aged over 50 will receive one work-focused interview, also on migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1289W.0/4">New customers to Employment and Support Allowance from October 2010 will receive quarterly work-focused interviews as well as the six monthly work-focused interviews that current Employment and Support Allowance customers receive.</p>

	<p pid="a.1292W.8/5" class="indent">We have embarked on a programme of converting or extending our existing buildings where necessary. In addition, we aim to make our services more accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on partners' premises. We are supplementing these measures by operating extended opening hours in some locations where the need for this is identified locally. This includes some offices opening to the public on Saturday. We will only acquire new space where all other measures are insufficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292W.8/6" class="indent">This programme is primarily focused on those buildings where we provide a face to face service for members of the public but we are also implementing solutions across our network of Benefit Delivery Centres and Contact Centres to ensure they are equipped to meet any capacity challenge.</p>

	<p pid="a.1296W.3/4" class="indent">All Jobcentre Plus staff are extensively trained to provide accurate advice to customers. If customers in receipt of benefits administered by Jobcentre Plus have an enquiry about their benefit, they are asked to contact either the Benefit Enquiry Line, the Benefit Delivery Centre handling their claim or their local Jobcentre Plus office. Customers in receipt of work-focussed benefits have regular and close contact with Jobcentre Plus to ensure their benefits are, and continue to be, paid accurately and that they are aware and reminded of their responsibilities during the lifetime of their claim. For example, customers who want to claim Jobseeker's Allowance will discuss and agree with a personal adviser realistic and achievable job goals and appropriate steps to offer the best chance of finding work.

It sets out the standards and skills individuals are expected to demonstrate when dealing with customers and explains the procedures to follow to achieve them. The Quality Assurance Framework is supplemented by a rigorous monitoring and checking regime which scrutinises the accuracy of a sample of claims on a monthly basis.</p>

Everyone making a claim for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) has this one-to-one interview with a personal adviser to assess their circumstances, discuss and set in place a jobseeker's agreement and make sure they have information about and access to the help they need. The interview may be shorter if, for example, some of the information is already held.</p>
	<p pid="a.1300W.11/3">Following the initial interview, jobseekers are normally then asked to attend the local office fortnightly for a jobsearch review. The average time allocation for these contacts is 7.5 minutes, but the actual time taken will vary depending upon customer needs. For those people who do not find work quickly, a review is undertaken at or around 13 weeks. The average length of this review is 20 minutes, but the method of delivery and duration of contact will vary, depending upon individual needs. Further interviews take place if the claim lasts longer and interviews taking place at key points such as six months would be of a longer duration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1300W.11/4">Detailed guidance has been issued to Jobcentre Plus staff, particularly in view of the introduction of new services in April. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.1304W.2/4" class="indent">Our position on this issue was set out for the Work and Pensions Select Committee in Neil Couling's letter to Terry Rooney dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-09">9 July 2008</phrase>. A copy of that letter is attached.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/5" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/6" class="italic"> Letter from Neil Couling:</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/7" class="indent">Early in the New Year, I wrote to you outlining a pilot we were running to allow vulnerable customers to make applications for Social Fund Crisis Loans (SFCLs) using Customer Access Points (CAPs or 'warm phones') in Jobcentres. This follows the Committee's recommendation in its 2006-07 report. We worked with the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union to agree these arrangements. The small pilot ran from <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-07">7 January</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-28">28 March</phrase> this year and we have now completed the evaluation, which I have attached.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/8" class="indent">Our current procedures mean that, customers cannot use warm phones to make SFCL applications. This is because a customer could receive an adverse decision in an unscreened area and so, if aggrieved, could pose a risk to themselves, staff or other customers. This control measure is a key part of our agreement with the PCS on working in unscreened offices. The result is that, at present, some vulnerable customers&mdash;who use a face-to-face procedure instead of our normal channel of making a telephone claim from home&mdash;are referred to a screened office to receive their decision (be that favourable or adverse).</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/9" class="indent">The main replacement control measures for the pilot, agreed with the PCS, meant that Floor Managers and Customer Care Officers were always aware of calls of this type, and&mdash;crucially&mdash;that the Decision Maker in the Benefit Delivery Centre would contact the Jobcentre on a dedicated telephone line if the application was about to be refused. This allows the Floor Manager and Customer Care Officers to be in place to offer any further assistance to the customer on receipt of an adverse decision. Given the potential risks, and PCS concerns to such an approach, we agreed to a small pilot which ran in five offices in Northumbria.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/10" class="indent">During the three month pilot seven customers used the service, compared to two using the existing face-to-face service in the preceding 14 months in the whole Northumbria District. Four were awarded a Crisis Loan and there were no incidents of unacceptable customer behaviour linked to any of these customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/11" class="indent">The qualitative evaluation revealed that Jobcentre staff locally were confident that this service was restricted to appropriately vulnerable customers; that they enjoyed the discretion and flexibility this service provided; and, that it was an improvement in access for those customers who are currently turned away or sent to a screened office for a face-to-face decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/12" class="indent">Whilst this pilot has been encouraging, we do not feel that it provides sufficiently strong evidence to roll out nationally&mdash;volumes were low and, as the evaluation report reveals, the effectiveness of the alternative control measures was not properly tested. To ensure that this is a safe and effective approach we intend to pilot the scheme again in London, with the option to roll out nationally if it is successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/13" class="indent">We will consult the Public and Commercial Services Union on this basis. We also need to develop the approach along side Accessing Jobcentre Customer Services (AJCS), which seeks to enhance services for vulnerable customers, and any changes to the Social Fund. Given these factors, and the full change agenda facing Jobcentre Plus&mdash;including the rollout of the Employment and Support Allowance&mdash;we are looking to run this large scale pilot as early as is practicable 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/14" class="indent">I hope this is helpful and that you are encouraged, as we are, by these early findings. I will update you as the pilot progresses and am happy to answer any question that you or the Committee have in the meantime.</p>

	<p pid="a.1308W.8/1">The Government first announced their intention to introduce the Flexible New Deal in the July 2007 Green Paper 'In work, better off: next steps to full employment' [Cm 7130]. Following a period of consultation, the different stages of the Jobseeker's Regime were set out in the December 2007 DWP publication 'Ready for work: full employment in our generation' [Cm 7290].</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.8/2">The Social Security (Flexible New Deal) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009 No. 480) were laid in March 2009 and the new regime was launched in phase 1 areas from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1308W.8/5">On the same day, the Department introduced an offer of extra support for customers who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for six months (Stage 3 of the Jobseeker's Regime). This includes access to recruitment subsidies, work-focused training, help to become self-employed and volunteering opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.8/6">The Government also recently announced a Young Person's Guarantee: a guaranteed offer of a job, work-focused training or work experience placement for young jobseekers.

	<p pid="a.1311W.2/1">It is correct that the number of HSE nuclear inspectors per nuclear installation is less than most other countries with active nuclear programmes. This is not a recent development and is a consequence of the goal setting nature of the UK regulatory system with its emphasis on ensuring that nuclear operators understand the hazards of their activities and how to control them, and take full responsibility for nuclear safety on their sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.2/2">Unlike many foreign regulatory authorities referred to in the Nuclear Energy Agency reference, HSE's nuclear inspector resources are not used to develop detailed regulations that prescribe how the nuclear operators should carry out their business. The nuclear installations inspectorate (NII) sets safety goals that are embodied in the licence conditions for each nuclear licensed site and require the operators to make and implement arrangements to meet these goals. UK law holds the nuclear operators responsible for safety. The NII's role is to ensure that they meet this obligation. The law, however, gives the NII the powers to intervene when and where appropriate, and seek further improvements in nuclear safety where reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.2/3">The system requires highly experienced and technically qualified nuclear inspectors to operate efficiently and effectively. Government have agreed with HSE interim measures to ensure that the NII has the resources needed to continue to effectively meet current and future regulatory challenges. Furthermore, the Government are proposing, in their recent consultation document on the Restructuring of the Heath and Safety Executive's Nuclear Directorate, further measures to sustain this capability into the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1324W.2/1">The self-employment element of the six month offer was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase> and provides substantial advice and support to enable people to move into self-employment or to start their own business. There is an active programme of intensive support delivered by Business Link in England by Flexible Support for Business in Wales and by Business Gateway and Training for Work in Scotland. Those moving into self-employment will be entitled to a self-employment credit made up of 16 weekly payments of &pound;50 to help with the transition into work and to underpin finances for the first few months of the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1324W.2/2">There is no new deal for the self-employed although both the new deal for young people and the new deal 25-plus include options offering self-employment support. Under flexible new deal providers will also be able to provide self employment support. The new deal and six month offer routes into self employment are broadly similar. Both offer intensive support and advice to those who need it. To ease the transition into sustainable self-employment the new deals give customers an opportunity to undertake a period of test-trading for up to 26 weeks. Test trading enables the customer to begin work while remaining on benefits, whereas under the six month offer the self-employment credit is payable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1324W.2/3">We have anticipated the six month offer providing 500,000 opportunities for jobseekers and have made an investment in the offer of &pound;0.5 billion. On current estimates we expect to be able to provide self employment support to 135,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1324W.2/4">The offers are voluntary and are therefore demand led. The overall package is designed to be flexible and respond to customer needs. It is also possible that for any individual customer, a mix of offers may be appropriate.</p>

To do this we will use information from the Single Housing Benefit Extract, the Department's principal source of data for housing benefit and council tax benefit administration. In addition, two further methods will be used to inform a review of the policy at the end of 2009. First, the last half-yearly Omnibus Survey of local authorities contained questions which specifically asked them about the impact of these changes. Second, a survey has been running on the DWP website since <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March</phrase>, inviting stakeholders such as welfare rights agencies, local authority associations and housing organisations to submit their assessment of the effect of the new rules. This survey, which was devised with the assistance of key stakeholders and ends on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-31">31 July</phrase>, also includes a case study section so that respondents can contribute detailed information about the impact on individual cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.1329W.3/1">The welfare reform programme will allow us to bring about the most radical reform of the welfare state for generations. We remain committed to further reform to reduce welfare dependency and support more people into work, provide greater support and control for disabled people and strengthen parental responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.3/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Tamworth will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled three and four year old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, whilst older and less well-off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the national carers strategy. The Welfare Reform Bill currently before Parliament contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.3/3">There are over 10 million people with a limiting long-term illness, impairment or disability in Great Britain making up 18 per cent. of the population. (Family resources survey 2007-08). The prevalence of disability rises with age; around one in 20 children are disabled, compared to around one in seven working age adults and almost one in two people over state pension age. All of these people would meet the definition of disability in the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). The figures can be disaggregated to a regional level which shows that 23 per cent. of adults and 7 per cent. of children in the west midlands are disabled. (Family resources survey 2007-08).</p>

Since 1997, although the number of people claiming as unemployed in Tamworth has increased by 58 per cent., the number of long-term unemployed has decreased by 62 per cent.

	<p pid="a.1331W.3/1">The number of people claiming incapacity benefit has fallen in recent years. The number of people claiming for physical conditions has fallen significantly as a result of Government programmes to get more people who are able to work back into suitable employment. The number of people claiming incapacity benefit for mental health conditions has remained broadly unchanged over the last few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.3/2">The Government are developing more action to help those with mental health conditions get back into work including a new Mental Health and Employment strategy due to be published in the autumn and the Perkins review on how we help people with mental health conditions back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.3/3">We have replaced the old system of incapacity benefits with the more work-focused employment and support allowance to engage with people more actively and to ensure they are aware of opportunities available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1331W.3/25">There is no clear evidence for the increase in mental illness as the main disabling condition. Informed suggestions for the increase are multi-factorial and include:</p>

	<p pid="a.1331W.3/31">We have successfully introduced the more work-focused employment and support allowance for new customers, engaging with people more actively and ensuring they are aware of support and opportunities available. Pathways to Work, including the condition management programme, is available to everyone receiving incapacity benefits and employment and support allowance in Great Britain. Evidence on its effectiveness for customers with mental health conditions is mainly positive. A study of existing customers found that the employment impact for customers with mental health conditions was higher than for those without.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.3/32">We have also committed to ensuring that the personalised support delivered through Pathways to Work is as co-ordinated as possible with the increase in mental health treatment provision delivered through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme in England, and similar programmes in Scotland and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331W.3/33">From December, we will pilot an occupational health helpline for employers, especially small and micro businesses, to help them to manage and support people who have mental health conditions to remain in or return to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1337W.5/1">A customer claiming jobseeker's allowance is normally expected to attend (sign) each fortnight on their benefit week ending date, which is determined by their national insurance number. In circumstances where a customer cannot attend on their normal benefit week ending date, Jobcentres already have the discretion to allocate a different attendance day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.5/2">Where a person in receipt of jobseeker's allowance wants to undertake an internship and continue to receive jobseeker's allowance, they must comply with the conditions of entitlement. These conditions require the jobseeker not to be in remunerative work, and to be actively seeking and available for work of at least 40 hours per week. Jobseekers engaged in full-time work experience/internships will not usually be able to satisfy these conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.5/3">Additionally, jobseekers may be considered to be in remunerative work if the activities they do are for, on average, 16 hours or more per week and equivalent to that being undertaken by a paid employee. In such cases, regardless of whether they receive pay for the work they are doing, they would have no entitlement to jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.5/4">Changes are underway that will see graduates who have left university this year and are still unemployed after six months, being able to undertake an internship for up to 13 weeks and remain on benefits.

	<p pid="a.1350W.8/2"><i> </i>The purpose of the Food Quality Standards published by the OGC is to provide guidance for suppliers on the general quality of products sought in food procurements undertaken by all public sector authorities. In the Standards, matters relating to food policy have been provided by DEFRA, those related to food safety provided by the Food Standards Agency. The Standards are not to be considered as a series of product specifications but as a guide to the minimum quality criteria that authorities may include in their specifications and will expect the contractor to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/3">Mandatory requirements, for example around food safety, are contained in legislation rather than in the Standards. There are no mandatory requirements around quality assurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/4">The Standards state, however, that contractors should ensure that wherever possible the supply of all raw food should originate from sources participating in recognised national or international assurance schemes or equivalent standards where such schemes exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/5">For raw food products (other than fish) contractors should supply to the authority unprocessed commodities, lightly processed foods and drinks, and composite products, produced in accordance with one or more of four categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/6">Category 1 denotes food produced in accordance with relevant parts of Standards such as Red Tractor, Food Assurance Scheme or equivalent Standard or, in the case of eggs in their shells, the Lion Quality Mark or equivalent. The procurement of food using alternative schemes shall be subject to prior approval by the authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.8/7">The Standards do not contain specific guidance on Halal foods other than to state that ethnic food products must be sourced, prepared, processed and packed in accordance with the specific requirements of the religious law, where these apply eg Halal or Kosher foods. The assurance schemes in category 1 can be applied to Halal meat as to other products.</p>

However, there has been extensive public interest in the case. In these circumstances, I can inform the hon. Gentleman of the following:</p>

	<p pid="a.1368W.2/3" class="indent">Following his release from the sentence imposed by Preston Crown Court in October 2008, the Oasys categorisation for Patrick Smith was 'medium' risk of re-offending and medium risk of serious harm to children and the public. (The risk of serious harm classification was subsequently raised to 'high' when further information about the offender came to light.)</p>
	<p pid="a.1368W.2/4" class="italic"> Breach of terms of licence:</p>
	<p pid="a.1368W.2/5" class="indent">In November 2008, the Probation Area then supervising Mr. Smith decided to issue a written warning to him following a breach of the rules of residence in the approved premises in which he was required to reside as a condition of licence. (There were no other breaches of licence prior to his recall to prison following his arrest for the serious further offence.)</p>
	<p pid="a.1368W.2/6" class="italic"> Serious further offence review:</p>
	<p pid="a.1368W.2/7" class="indent">A serious further offence review has been undertaken on this case, in line with the requirements of Probation Circular 22/2008. It was completed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-01">1 July 2009</phrase> and has been quality assured by the Public Protection Unit (PPU) in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). The Probation Areas involved in the management of the offender will be reporting to the PPU on progress in addressing the learning points from the review by <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-18">18 December 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1374W.3/1">In October 2008, the Ministry of Justice announced controls on recruitment to enable the Department to drive out inefficiencies and look strategically at where we have skills gaps and how to manage our people more effectively across the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1374W.3/2">We estimate a reduction of 1,135 in the Full Time Equivalent (FTE) headcount between March 2009 and 2010. This estimate does not include information relating to the Land Registry, National Archives, Scotland Office, Wales Office or National Probation Service, where responsibility for staffing lies with each individual body.</p>
	<p pid="a.1374W.3/3">The table breaks down the changes in Full Time Equivalent headcount by agency. The figures include employees and agency/interim staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.1382W.2/94">Press monitoring services include clippings of newspaper articles, compiled on a daily basis, that are relevant to the Department. The Government's Central Office of Information's Media Monitoring Unit provides a press summary service for the Department, but also includes broadcast coverage in these summaries. It is not possible to breakdown the cost of MMU summaries between press monitoring and monitoring of other media. It is important to monitor the climate of opinion and the evolving views of commentators and the media to ensure that policy development takes place in the fullest context and the Department is well placed to respond to events. Press and media monitoring is one way to do this and also provides useful instant feedback on announcements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1389W.2/1">Section 35(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, in conjunction with the Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1998, provides for the Secretary of State to determine whether prisoners serving a determinate sentence of 15 years or more, and who are subject to the release provisions of that Act, should be released on parole, subject to a positive recommendation for early release from the Parole Board. The factors considered when deciding whether or not to accept a recommendation from the Board are set out in directions given by the Secretary of State to the Board. The primary factor is the risk to the public of a further offence being committed at a time when the prisoner would otherwise be in prison and whether any such risk is acceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.1392W.2/1">Any death in prison custody is a tragic event. The Government, Ministry of Justice and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is committed to learning from such events and reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in prison custody. NOMS has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. ACCT is the prisoner-centred flexible care-planning system introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.1392W.2/2">Indeterminate sentences for public protection (IPP) were introduced in 2005. Prisoners serving such sentences account for 6 per cent. of all prisoners. There have been a total of 12 self-inflicted deaths involving prisoners with IPP status. These numbers are detailed in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.1401W.2/1">There have been two reviews relating to the murder of Zuzanna Zommer by Michael Clark, who was subject to the sex offender notification requirements but not subject to statutory probation supervision at the time of the murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401W.2/2">The first was a non-statutory review commissioned by the strategic management board (SMB) for West Yorkshire multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA). No summary has been prepared for publication, but the SMB is prepared and has offered to share the findings of the review with the family of Zuzanna Zommer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401W.2/3">In December 2008, the National Offender Management Service and the association of chief police officers introduced a requirement for MAPPA serious case reviews to be completed where an offender managed at level 2 or 3 of MAPPA is charged with murder, rape, manslaughter, attempted murder or attempted rape. Where MAPPA serious case reviews are undertaken, it is a requirement of the process that SMBs produce an overview report, summarising the review, to be shared with the victim or the victim's family.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401W.2/4">The second review has been commissioned by Leeds Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) and is yet to report. In line with usual practice with such statutory reviews, an executive summary of this review will be published once completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1402W.5/1">In the three years to 2010-11, we are investing &pound;21.9 billion in our schools estate: a record amount and seven times the rate in 1997.

In addition, schools and local authorities can invest their own funding to improve schools; secondary schools across the country share over &pound;350 million of devolved formula capital grant in 2009-10. We are currently collecting information on the impact of our investment across the school estate and will publish our findings in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1406W.2/1">The Government do not allocate discrete funding for this purpose on an area basis and it is not possible to provide an answer in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/2">Encouraging all children and young people to adopt a more active lifestyle is a priority for this Government. Our strategic approach to this is set out in 'Be Active, Be Healthy', 'Healthy lives, brighter futures: the strategy for children and young people's Health' and 'Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: a Cross-Government Strategy for England'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/3">These strategies support the Chief Medical Officer's recommendation that children and young people should achieve a total of at least 60 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity each day, and at least twice a week this should include activities to improve bone health, muscle strength and flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/4">Individuals can achieve this level of activity through a variety of routes, including everyday activity, such as walking or cycling, active recreation, such as play, dance, or swimming, and through sport, both for competition and for individual exercise. The role of parents and carers in influencing children's activity levels is crucial, so the Government support initiatives to improve family based activity as well as a range of initiatives in children's settings, all of which are available to children and young people in Castle Point and Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/5">Initiatives which focus on supporting children and their families to be physically active include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/6" class="indent">the Change4Life social marketing campaign, backed by &pound;75 million of funding over three years to 2011, promotes an 'eat well, move more, live longer' message to families with children aged five to 11. Since its launch in January 2009, over 255,000 families have contacted Change4Life and received tailored materials on physical activity and healthy eating as a result;</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/7" class="indent">Sure Start Children's Centres, which should engage parents to promote a whole-family approach to eating well and keeping active, and organise and promote physical activities;</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/8" class="indent">the universal, NHS-delivered Healthy Child Programme for ages 0 to five supports parents in keeping their children healthy, and focuses on developing and maintaining healthy nutritional and lifestyle habits from a very early age;</p>

Details of funding for play schemes in Essex and Castle Point were given in answer to a previous question (Commons written question 282065);</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/10" class="indent">nearly 60 per cent. of local authorities have promised to provide free swimming for the under 16s and have opted-in to the Free Swimming Programme which the Government are supporting with &pound;140 million over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/11">Initiatives which are delivered through early years settings, schools and colleges include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/12" class="indent">the PE and School Sport for Young People strategy, through which 90 per cent. of pupils aged five to 16 now participate in at least two hours a week of high quality PE and school sport. The strategy also aims to ensure that all five to 19-year-olds have the opportunity for an additional three hours of sport a week outside the school day;</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/13" class="indent">the National Healthy Schools Programme: almost every school in the country has achieved, or is working towards, Healthy School status, which sets national standards for health and well-being around four core themes, including physical activity;</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/14" class="indent">schools offering access to Extended Services offer access to a wide range of services from 8 am to 6 pm, 48 weeks a year. The services include play, recreation and sports, and community access to facilities including adult learning and sports facilities;</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/15" class="indent">the &pound;140 million joint DCSF and DFT Travel to School Initiative promotes walking and cycling: 17,392 (69 per cent.) of schools have active travel plans worth around &pound;5,000 for a typical primary and around &pound;10,000 for a typical secondary school;</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/16" class="indent">the Bikeability scheme aims to train 500,000 children to level 2 by 2010. Over 146,000 have already received training;</p>

	<p pid="a.1408W.5/1">There is already a process for investigating such deaths or serious injury. Where a death in custody engages the investigative requirement in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the requirement would normally be met by means of an inquest or a combination of the inquest, criminal proceedings and serious case review. In addition, any death in custody will be the subject of an investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. In the case of a death or serious injury of a child who is looked after by a local authority, and where abuse or neglect is known or suspected to be a factor, the Local Safeguarding Children Board will consider whether a Serious Case Review (SCR) should be undertaken, as they would following the death of any child in those circumstances. Executive Summaries of SCRs are made publicly available.</p>

It has made clear its determination to do everything possible to make sure that all child protection services meet the needs of the vulnerable children they serve, and that child protection arrangements are effective everywhere.

	<p pid="a.1426W.8/1">Apart from the statutory elements of Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) that are included in National Curriculum Science, schools currently have flexibility to decide the content of SRE provided within Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). DCSF has provided a non-statutory programme of study indicating what it believes it is appropriate to include within PSHE which&mdash;in Key Stage 4 (age 14 to 16)&mdash;includes 'informing pupils about where they can go to obtain health information'. This would include information, advice and treatment on contraception and sexual health issues. Subject to public consultation, the Government intend to make PSHE (and the programme of study that underpins it) statutory. First and foremost, however, the principal aim of SRE is to encourage young people to delay early sexual activity. Within secondary schools pupils are taught the skills to enable them to avoid being pressurised into unwanted or unprotected sex, and given factual information to enable them to negotiate safer sex when they do become sexually active. However, we make it clear in our &quot;Sex and Relationship Education Guidance&quot; (July 2000) to schools that any programme of study must be tailored to the age and the physical and emotional maturity of the children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.8/2">As part of the Children's Plan we gave a commitment to review best practice in effective sex and relationship education (SRE) and how it is delivered in schools. Importantly, we involved young people fully in the review, many of whom told us that they did not have the knowledge they needed to make safe and responsible choices about relationships and sexual health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.8/3">International evidence, as well as evidence from local areas that have made most progress in reducing under-18 conception rates since the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was launched, shows that comprehensive, age-appropriate SRE, alongside easy access to contraceptive and sexual health services, brings down rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.8/4">In response to the review recommendations, we announced our intention, subject to public consultation, to make SRE compulsory as part of statutory Personal Social Health and Economic (PSHE) education. This will ensure that as well as receiving factual information, children and young people will have the opportunities to develop the skills they need to deal with the real life situations they face.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.8/5">We asked Sir Alasdair Macdonald to conduct an independent review of how the principle that PSHE should have statutory status can be translated into a practicable way forward. Following the publication of Sir Alasdair's review in April there is now a full public consultation on his recommendations, including the programmes of study to be included within statutory PSHE. This is scheduled to be completed by the end of the summer term, following which the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority will analyse the results and report to Ministers.</p>

STEMNET (the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network) has been tasked with preparing a set of six product based case studies, which will be resources for teachers, to demonstrate the breadth of careers within the manufacturing sector. The products have been carefully selected as being of genuine interest to young people, particularly teenagers. STEMNET began this work in January 2009, and will complete it in July 2009, with the expectation that the resources will be posted to every UK secondary school during September 2009. A total of &pound;54,000 has been allocated to this particular project. This will pay for six individual products to be featured, each of which contains a number of 'real-life' examples of the people who have used STEM and related skills in their manufacture.</p>

	<p pid="a.1428W.5/1">In November 2006 the Department launched the Learning Outside the Classroom Manifesto with the aim that every young person should experience the world beyond the classroom as an essential part of learning and personal development, whatever their age, ability or circumstances. The Manifesto partnership is steered by a National Advisory Group (NAG) made up from representatives from each of the eight Manifesto sectors, specialist advisers, and user representatives. Adventurous Activities are included as one of the eight sector partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.1428W.5/2">Since its launch, and with the help of the Manifesto partnership, the Department has:</p>

	<p pid="a.1429W.2/1">Funding for the provision of school meals, including free school meals is given to all local authorities via their Standards Fund allocation. It is for individual local authorities to decide how much funding to allocate to school meal provision. Where a primary school chooses to manage its own budget for school meals, it is also responsible for deciding how much to allocate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1429W.2/2">Schools must provide free school meals to pupils from families that meet the national eligibility criteria and who have registered to receive them. In addition, local authorities may choose to provide free meals for all pupils or a particular phase of pupils such as primary pupils, if they choose to do so. This department and the Department of Health are jointly funding pilots with three local authorities to evaluate the benefits of extending eligibility to free school meals within England.</p>

	<p pid="a.1431W.5/2">The Becta guidance also makes it clear that schools must follow the Data Protection Act in regards to the retention and storage of personal data. In accordance with the Act, schools must ensure all personal data is processed fairly and lawfully, for limited purposes, in line with individuals' rights and not held for longer than necessary. Additionally, schools need to issue a fair processing notice (FPN) to parents summarising the information held about their child or children, why it is held, and the third parties to whom it may be passed on.</p>

	<p pid="a.1434W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-14">14 July 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1434W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1434W.5/4" class="indent">In response to parliamentary question 278406, I provided information on the gross cost of the inspection of schools. This information was derived from a detailed analysis of Ofsted's 2008-09 and prior year financial accounts. At the end of each year, we undertake a retrospective analysis of our costs. It is not possible to produce such a projected analysis of similarly specific costs because of the scale of change in place in Ofsted; several major changes to Ofsted's organisational structure and operations will be implemented at the same time as the introduction of the new school inspection regime. We are also currently planning to outsource significant aspects of our early years work and this will impact on support costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1434W.5/5" class="indent">Consequently, we cannot provide meaningful projections of the future gross cost of the inspection of schools, which are comparable with the costs included in our previous response. This information will not be available until spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1434W.5/6" class="indent">However, I am able to provide details of the estimated savings in the direct costs of the schools' inspection activity, excluding the indirect and overhead costs that were included in the figures provided in our previous response. This covers those inspections affected by the introduction of the new inspection regime, including those carried out under Section 5 of the Education Act 2005 (the routine programme of inspections of maintained schools) and those carried out under Section 8 of the Education Act 2005 (additional monitoring visits for maintained schools judged to be in a category of concern or judged to be satisfactory). Currently, the annual saving as a result of the introduction of the new inspection regime is projected to be &pound;3.9m. This represents a 7.8% savings on the direct cost of the inspection of schools in 2008-09. These savings are based on a range of assumptions, for example, the number of active schools in the future and the proportion of schools judged good or better.</p>

There is a total of &pound;468 million funding over the CSR period: &pound;15 million to support 36,000 children in year 5 and year 6 in 2008/09; &pound;138 million to support 3.5 per cent. of the Key Stage 2, Key Stage 3 (and in National Challenge schools Key Stage 4) cohort in each of English and maths in 2009/10; and &pound;315 million to support 300,000 pupils in English and 300,000 children in mathematics in 2010/11. The funding is sufficient to support the guarantee of one-to-one tuition in English and mathematics for pupils falling behind in Key Stage 2 from September 2010. This funding is also sufficient to cover the one-to-one element of the guarantee for catch-up support for pupils who enter Year 7 behind expectations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1447W.5/1">The Geography, Science, Citizenship and History programmes of study within the new secondary curriculum provide opportunities for teachers to educate their pupils in issues related to international poverty, sustainable development, and cultural diversity. The secondary curriculum allows teachers the flexibility to personalise their offer to meet individual needs and engage all of their learners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/2">Support for implementing the new curriculum is provided through the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency's secondary curriculum website. This website offers guidance, resources and case studies to support teachers planning cross-curriculum dimensions, including &quot;Global dimension and sustainable development&quot; and &quot;Identity and cultural diversity&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/3">Environmental education is one of the key concepts for the study of geography in the new secondary curriculum and the Action Plan for Geography supports this by providing professional development opportunities for teachers in the regions to help them embed sustainable development and environmental education in their classroom practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/4">The Citizenship programmes of study ensure young people develop a historical understanding of issues that have shaped contemporary life in the UK and the values we share, and allow for joint working on issues such as diversity and ethnicity. There are strong links between Citizenship Education and the teaching of history with guidance available to teachers showing how cultural and ethnic diversity can be taught through history.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/5">The Department has also produced a Community Cohesion Resource Pack on TeacherNet to help schools and head teachers meet their duty to promote community cohesion. It has also developed the School Linking Network which helps schools establish links with other schools so that pupils from different backgrounds can mix and interact.</p>

	<p pid="a.1450W.0/1">For more than a decade we have worked with the Teacher Training Agency, now the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), and training providers to secure the continuous quality improvement of Initial Teacher Training (ITT).</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/2">The standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) were revised in 1998, 2002 and 2007 setting out progressively more demanding expectations of beginner teachers. Statutory requirements apply to all accredited providers of ITT to ensure training is designed to make sure new teachers have met all of the standards. The TDA uses quality categories derived from Ofsted inspections when allocating ITT places and funding to higher education institutions and school-based providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/3">In the 10 years that this allocation approach has been used in full, the percentage of undergraduate and Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) ITT places allocated to high quality ITT providers has increased from 68 to 96 per cent. This approach has helped secure positive results from the TDA's annual survey of newly qualified teachers. Currently 85 per cent. of primary newly qualified teachers and 86 per cent. of secondary newly qualified teachers rate their training as good or very good.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/4">The outcomes of the first full inspections by Ofsted of the Graduate Teacher Programme will be available in the autumn of 2009 which will assess quality of training through that route. Since 2003 Teach First has brought into teaching many high quality graduates who would otherwise not have considered the profession. Ofsted said that some of their trainees were the best it had ever seen. Currently around half of teachers trained on this route remain in the profession at the end of their induction year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/5">The agency's special educational needs (SEN) and disability programme of work has been developed within the context of the Government's long-term strategy: &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; (2004), the &quot;Children's Plan&quot; (December 2007) and other evidence. Resources have been put in place to ensure that all trainees are well-prepared to teach children and young people with SEN and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/6">Since 2000 the agency has invested nearly &pound;20 million of its funding from the Department to support Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in initial teacher training alongside the Government's investment in ICT in schools. The aim is to ensure that all NQTs have strong skills in using ICT to support teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/7">TDA have worked with schools and ITT providers to ensure that ITT is up-to-date, responds rapidly to changes in the schools' curriculum, that ITT partnerships are secure and that every trainee has effective school based training.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/8">The SEN modules on dyslexia, autism and other frequently encountered special needs that were developed for primary ITT, were launched in June 2008 and have been well-received. Similar modules for secondary training were launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-25">25 June 2009</phrase>. PGCE materials are due to be launched later in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/9">Evaluation shows that the great majority of trainee teachers have access to a personal laptop and have opportunities to use ICT to support teaching and learning while on school experience. Research indicates that trainees and ITT providers have integrated the effective use of ICT in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/10">&quot;The Teacher Training Resource Bank&quot; (<a href="http://www.ttrb.ac.uk">www.ttrb.ac.uk</a>) provides access to up-to-date materials and relevant research to support ITT. Over 5,000 articles are viewed daily and the site has 18,000 registered users. Evaluation shows that the resources support quality improvement by giving trainers access to key materials cost-effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/11">In 1997 there were approximately 27,000 trainees requiring schools experience as part of their ITT programme. Currently the figure is approximately 38,000. Ofsted indicates that this expansion has been achieved effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/12">DCSF and TDA monitor and support training providers to implement the approach to the teaching of early reading recommended by Sir Jim Rose based on the teaching of phonics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/13">TDA has a range of programmes t o improve the recruitment of mathematics and science teachers by means of a targeted campaign. The target for the training of primary teachers of modern languages with 900 new teachers having an enhanced experience in teaching French, German or Spanish in 2008/09 has been met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/14">The TDA have boosted the numbers of trainees who report having had a 'very good' or 'good' grounding in phonics from 35 per cent. in 2006 to 49 per cent. in the 2008 cohort. TDA have ambitious targets for further progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1450W.0/15">The diversity of routes to teaching and programmes such as Transition to Teaching has boosted the supply of new science and maths teachers. The agency works to help provide additional training both pre-service and in-service to develop the subject knowledge of specialist teachers in science and mathematics.</p>

	<p pid="a.1452W.3/15" class="indent">Please note that these data do not enable us to estimate how many classes in England are set by ability. Since the introduction of the current school inspection framework in September 2005 (commonly known as section 5), the recording of how lessons are organised has been based on discussions with the headteacher or teacher during the inspection, or by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may not, therefore, represent the way pupils are grouped in the school as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.1452W.3/16" class="indent">For clarity, setting is the term used to describe the organisation of pupils in classes on the basis of their prior attainment in the particular subject being taught. The term banding, which is similar to streaming, is used when the decision as to which pupils are included in a class is based on the prior attainment in a range of subjects. Ofsted does not currently differentiate between setting, streaming and banding in the data collected during lesson observations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1452W.3/17" class="indent">It is of some concern to me that we do not have ready access to a comprehensive data set about pupil groupings. As a consequence, from September, headteachers have been asked to record the detail of the pupil groupings in use in their schools in their Self-Evaluation Forms.</p>
