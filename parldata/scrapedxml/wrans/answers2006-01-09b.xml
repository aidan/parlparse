	<p pid="b.2W.3/1">To date, 30 areas are operating under statutory charging. The remaining 12 areas have been operating shadow charging schemes since 2003, whereby charging is operating on a non-mandatory basis, which mirrors as closely as possible statutory charging arrangements between 9 am and 5 pm Monday to Friday. These remaining areas are scheduled to move onto statutory charging by April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.2W.3/2">The expected benefits of the charging scheme are a reduction in the rate of discontinuance, an increase in the guilty plea rate, and a reduction in the rate of attrition.</p>

The Director kept the Attorney-General informed throughout this case and consulted the Attorney-General in respect of his decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.4W.2/3">In January 2005 an issue arose in the trial process, the Attorney-General carried out a Shawcross exercise by which he consulted ministerial colleagues as to whether they had information that might bear on the consideration of the public interest by the Director. In the event, having regard to ongoing developments in the trial process, no decision was required to be taken at that time and the information obtained formed no part of the Director's decision to discontinue the prosecution in December 2005. That decision was informed by facts and information provided by the chief constable in November 2005 following upon a further development in the trial process. No further ministerial consultation took place.</p>

	<p pid="b.8W.5/5">In particular disabled candidates are supported through the Two Ticks Scheme which ensures that all disabled applicants are interviewed for jobs, if they meet the minimum criteria for the post. In addition, the Department uses the Access to Work Scheme which independently assesses each disabled employee so reasonable adjustments can be made, where applicable, to enable them to develop and work to their full potential.</p>

	<p pid="b.25W.2/1">The current funding arrangement of the National Safety Camera Programme allows for revenue raised from safety cameras to be used only to fund the deployment of safety cameras.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/2">This is because the Safety Camera Programme has a specific purpose, provided for in the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001, section 38 'Unified power for the Secretary of State to fund speed cameras etc' whereby police forces and highway authorities are provided with extra resources to support the deployment and operation of safety cameras, from the fines for speeding and red light offences detected, over and above their main road safety funding. The resources provided through the programme cannot therefore be used for any other purposes, not provided for in the Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/3">Under this current arrangement any surplus fine revenue is paid to the Consolidated Fund at HM Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/4">The Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase> that this funding arrangement for safety cameras will end on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2007</phrase>. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> all future income from safety cameras in England and Wales will go to the Consolidated Fund in the same way as other fines.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/5">In England the Department for Transport will be enhancing the level of funding for road safety within the local transport planning process by &pound;440 million over the period 2007&ndash;08 to 2010&ndash;11. This new arrangement for funding road safety will give local road safety partnerships (local authorities, the police and other agencies who work with them) greater flexibility to implement the mix of road safety measures, including 20 mph zones around schools, that will make the greatest contribution to reducing road casualties in their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/6">On <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, responsibility for safety cameras in Wales will transfer to the National Assembly for Wales. I understand that the Welsh Assembly Government are considering future funding arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.39W.2/1">All Government Departments are committed to the broader vision of improving the life chances of disabled people through the delivery of services and the development of their policies. The Department for Work and Pension's Inter-Departmental Group on Disability is a forum for DCMS to take part in policy discussions on disability issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.2/2">DCMS has had no discussions with national gymnasium chains about accessibility but in August 2005 I wrote to all local authorities reminding them of their responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act in the context of leisure and tourism facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.2/3">Since 2001, Sport England (SE), working in partnership with the English Federation of Disability Sport ( EFDS), has invested &pound;6 million in the Inclusive Fitness Initiative (IFI). The investment has supported the development of 180 fully accessible local authority gyms which have a required minimum level of accessible gym equipment; suitably trained staff; marketing which is targeted at members of the disabled community; and strong links with other sporting opportunities for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.2/4">SE and the EFDS are also working with fitness gym providers such as Cannons and Fitness First to improve provision for disabled people in private sector facilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.40W.2/1">Under the old regime, it was legal for unsupervised children of any age to enter and remain in licensed premises so long as they did not enter the 'bar area'. Under the new regime, there are restrictions that prevent unaccompanied children under 16 being present in certain categories of premises that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises, including pubs and night clubs. In addition, where necessary and appropriate, conditions may be attached to premises licences or club premises certificates which prohibit or restrict the entry of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.40W.2/2">We estimate that there are around 190,000 premises licensed under the 2003 Act but information is not held centrally on how many have conditions attached to their licence which restrict entry to children. As 'licensed' premises include pubs, nightclubs, hotels, cinemas, theatres, restaurants and late night takeaways, it is likely that the vast majority serve food, including bar snacks.</p>

	<p pid="b.44W.2/1">Data has not been collated on the numbers of pools where an admissions policy has altered since my meeting on this subject in 2005. Information on admissions policies at individual pools in England is available through Sport England's &quot;Active Places&quot; website (<a href="http://www.ActivePlaces.com">www.ActivePlaces.com</a>). The Amateur Swimming Association has also compiled a comprehensive list of swimming pools through which similar information can be found. Both databases are maintained regularly.</p>
	<p pid="b.44W.2/2">It is for individual pool operators to determine appropriate measures to mitigate risks at their pools identified through a risk assessment. The Health and Safety Executive advocates that, as part of this process, pool operators should consider the number of children which can safely be accompanied by a single adult. Risk mitigation measures should be kept under review to ensure that they remain appropriate. It is also sensible for pool operators to take account of the guidance available in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.46W.8/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.46W.8/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many complaints have been received by the Child Support Agency in each year since 1997; how many went forward for adjudication; and how many have been <i>(a)</i> full and <i>(b)</i> partially upheld.</p>
	<p pid="b.46W.8/5" class="indent">I have provided tables below to show the number of complaints received by the Agency by clients, and by other bodies, for which information is available. It should be noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful comparisons over time due to changes in the way that information has been recorded. In particular, whilst the volume of Stage 1 complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002/3 and 2003/4, this is likely to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three tier complaints process during 2003/04.</p>
	<p pid="b.46W.8/6" class="indent">The three tier complaints process comprises of; Stage 1 complaints from clients which are dealt with by the Complaints Resolution Team located within each of the Agency's six business units. Stage 2 complaints which are an escalation to the relevant Area Director when the client is not satisfied with the outcome of stage 1, and stage 3 which is an escalation to the Chief Executive if the client remains dissatisfied.</p>
	<p pid="b.46W.8/7" class="indent">Complaints are also received into the Agency from MPs, or via MPs from a member of the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.46W.8/8" class="indent">The outcome of whether a complaint to the Agency is upheld is not recorded. However, as described above, clients are signposted to the next level of the process should they remain dissatisfied. The table below shows the volume of cases escalated to stages two and three, for which information is available. Once these internal avenues have been exhausted, the client may wish to contact the Independent Case Examiner (ICE), their MP or, via their MP, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

Our proposals for reform which we intend to publish in the spring, will be guided by the principle that the pension system should deliver fair outcomes for women and carers. A campaign to encourage carers to apply for home responsibility protection is being launched today.</p>

	<p pid="b.54W.5/1">In 2002, we put in place a comprehensive strategy for reform of housing benefit, with the first priority being to improve administration across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.54W.5/2">We have already made significant progress. The average time taken by local authorities to process new claims has shortened by two weeks. We have introduced a number of simplification measures to reduce complexity in the housing benefit rules. We have provided investment, to help authorities make improvements in the administration of housing benefit. We have reduced the losses due to fraud and error. We are piloting the new Local Housing Allowance in 18 local authorities, with a view to national implementation.</p>

For example, the introduction of Work Focused Interviews, although adding an extra stage to the claim process, has facilitated a pro-active rather than a passive approach to the search for work.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.2/45"><sup>(19)</sup> The 2004&ndash;05 DLA National Benefit Review identified cases where the change in customer's needs have been so gradual that it would be unreasonable to expect them to know at which point their entitlement to DLA might have changed. These cases do not result in a recoverable overpayment as we cannot quantify or define when the customer's change occurred. Because legislation requires the Secretary of State to prove that entitlement to DLA is incorrect, rather than requiring the customer to inform us that their needs have changed, cases in this subcategory are legally correct. The difference between what claimants in these cases are receiving in DLA and related premiums in other benefits and what they would receive if their benefit was reassessed is estimated to be around &pound;0.7 billion (+/- &pound;0.2 billion). This figure is not included in the total above, but a similar figure was included in the global fraud and error figure of &pound;3 billion reported in the resource account for 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.2/51">2. Although quoted to the nearest &pound;0.1 billion, there are considerable uncertainties around the total estimates (95 per cent. confidence intervals of between &plusmn;&pound;0.2 billion and &plusmn;&pound;0.3 billion).</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.2/52">3. Individual figures may not add across to total fraud and error figures due to rounding.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.2/53">The Department publishes National Statistics reports including estimates of overpayments through official error. Estimates for income support (IS), jobseeker's allowance (JSA), pension credit and housing benefit (HB) are published every year so these are the benefits where we have most information on changes over time.

	<p pid="b.64W.2/108">1. These figures will not include all overpayments in HB through official error. They were published in the latest National Statistics report for HB fraud and error, and only cover the 85 per cent. of HB expenditure that is within the scope of the HBR sample. In these reports, there was an extra category of error labelled &quot;non-residence&quot; error, an unknown amount of which will be due to mistakes made by officials&mdash;these overpayments are not included in the figures in this table.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.2/109">2. The Second National Housing Benefit Accuracy Review, in 1997&ndash;98 gave an estimate of &pound;60 million for official error, but was based on a different methodology, so the results are not considered comparable with more recent estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.2/110">The Department also publishes one-off snapshot reviews. The most recent report covered disability living allowance (DLA) and the official error figures from these are in the table.</p>

	<p pid="b.70W.2/1">In the National Strategy for Carers, 'Caring About Carers', published in February 1999, the Government set out its commitment to encourage and enable carers of working age to remain in work and to help those carers who are unable, or do not want, to combine paid work with caring to return to work when their caring responsibilities cease or diminish. Many people providing informal care already do paid work as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/2">From April 2004, Work Focussed Interviews (WFIs) have been introduced for partners of benefit customers in Jobcentre Plus areas. Although partners who are full-time carers with entitlement to carer's allowance are exempt from WFIs, they are however entitled to help and support, including through new deal for partners, on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/3">Carers who are in receipt of carer's allowance can work and earn up to &pound;82 per week. This amount is calculated net of expenses such as income tax, some national insurance contributions, and half of any contribution towards an occupational or personal pension. Help can also be given with the cost of care of the disabled person when the carer is at work, provided that the substitute carer is not a close relative of either the carer or the disabled person. The amount allowable is 50 per cent. of the net earnings after deduction of the other allowable expenses. Therefore, it is possible for a carer to earn well in excess of &pound;82 and still remain eligible for carer's allowance.</p>

	<p pid="b.80W.5/2">At the outset of a claim for benefit steps are taken to confirm that the address provided exists and is correct, this is done through matching the details provided with historical data held within my Department. Decision notices issued when entitlement is established and annual award notices issued when benefit rates change include written reminders of the need for customers to notify changes of address. In addition to this when it is known that an address is out of date various steps are taken depending upon the benefit in payment, for example in jobseekers allowance the customer is seen on a regular basis where correct address details are confirmed. Disability &amp; Carers Service would contact such people as carers, health care professionals involved in the case etc to confirm address details. In other areas checks would be made with local authorities where housing benefit and council tax benefit are in payment.</p>

Details of changes in addresses notified to one part of my Department are shared with other Agencies within the Department through cross-benefit computer systems. These systems also receive address data from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs where many customers who are in receipt of child benefit, child tax credits and new tax credits are also customers of my Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.89W.5/2">Sustainability for jobs gained through the new deal programme is measured in slightly different ways across the new deals. In the case of new deal for young people and new deal 25 plus, employment is regarded as sustained if a person gaining a job through these new deals does not claim jobseeker's allowance for at least 13 weeks after gaining employment. This measure has not changed since the programmes were introduced in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.5/3">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>, employment sustainability for those participating on new deal for lone parents has been measured through the Work and Pensions longitudinal study. If a job gained through the programme lasts at least 13 weeks, it is regarded as sustained. A measure of job sustainability was not available prior to October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.5/4">When a person gains a job through a new deal for disabled people (NDDP) job broker and remains in work for 13 weeks out of a 39 weeks period, that employment is regarded as sustained. This measure has not changed since the programme started in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.5/5">A measure of job sustainability for new deal 50 plus and new deal for partners is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.5/6">Employment gained through employment zones, which help people living in areas of persistently high unemployment into work, is defined as sustained if a person gaining a job through the programme does not return to claim jobseeker's allowance for at least 13 weeks. This measure has not changed since the programme was introduced in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.5/7">In the case of action teams, which help people in economically deprived areas into work, employment is regarded as sustained if the job lasts continuously for at least 11 weeks during the 13 week period after the person starts work, or if the person has two or more jobs which together add up to a total of at least 11 weeks during the 13 week period after they start work. This measure of sustainability has not changed since the programme was introduced in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.5/8">In April 2004, we introduced working neighbourhoods pilots to help people in deprived areas into work. Employment gained through the programme is regarded as sustained if a person moves off benefit and remains in work for a minimum of 13 weeks. This measure has not changed since the programme was introduced in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.5/9">Our ambition programme, which provides unemployed people with the skills and experience to work in specific employment sectors, defines employment as sustained if a person gaining a job through the ambition programmes is still working in that sector 26 weeks after gaining a job. This measure has not changed since ambition started in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.5/10">Finally, our progress2work and progress2work linkup programmes, which assist drug and alcohol misusers into work, as well as offenders and homeless people, define employment as sustained if a person, gaining employment through the programmes, does not return to claim jobseeker's allowance within 13 weeks. This measure has not changed since the programmes were introduced in 2002.</p>

	<p pid="b.91W.5/3">Jobcentre Plus district managers are also encouraged to work in close partnership with local organisations, making best use of non-contracted provision, often provided through the voluntary sector. For example, with new deal for lone parents, districts have agreements with intermediary organisations within both the voluntary and private sector to refer lone parents for training and other support. We have also procured European Social Fund contracts to provide training and job search support for new deal customers and these have been delivered by voluntary organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.96W.2/1">The responsibility for keeping members of final salary schemes informed and up to date about their scheme and its funding rests with the trustees of the scheme. Trustees can seek advice from their professional advisers; in addition, the pensions regulator produces a number of documents designed to help trustees in their work, including codes of practice. A code of practice on scheme funding is due to be published this month. The new funding provisions to replace the minimum funding requirement, due to come into force this month, promote greater transparency in scheme funding. Trustees of final salary schemes will be required to send regular statements of their scheme's funding position to all scheme members.</p>

	<p pid="b.100W.11/1">The Post Office card account is a simple account with very limited functions. It was specifically designed to receive payments of benefits and pensions administered by central government.</p>
	<p pid="b.100W.11/2">The Post Office card account does not have a facility for the account holder to make payments to a third party (i.e. their landlord) by standing order, so is not a suitable account to receive payments of housing benefit or the local housing allowance which is currently being piloted. Most housing benefit customers already have a suitable bank account that can be used to receive their payments from which they can make payments directly to their landlord.</p>
	<p pid="b.100W.11/3">The Post Office card account was introduced as a stepping stone for those who did not feel that they were yet ready to make use of even a basic bank account. Should someone feel that they now need an account with more facilities then they should consider moving to an account which better suits their needs. Customers who have opened and operated a card account have demonstrated that they are now capable of using a basic bank account. There are a large number of current and basic bank accounts which can be accessed at Post Offices, if this is important to housing benefit recipients.</p>
	<p pid="b.100W.11/4">DWP cheques are designed for those people who we cannot pay into an account. There is no need for a facility to pay DWP cheques into Post Office card accounts. If customers, including those receiving income support, want to put their money into a card account then we can do this directly for them without needing to issue a cheque.</p>

	<p pid="b.104W.2/1">It is a matter of record that the policy of both this and previous Governments has been to exclude most, but not all, full-time students from entitlement to housing benefit; since 1990 financial support for those students opting to study full-time has been seen as the responsibility of the education system, rather than the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.2/2">Those in full-time education are not supported through the benefits system once they reach the age of 19; the age at which child benefit ceases to be payable. Students in vulnerable groups, mainly those with a disability and those with dependent children retain eligibility for income related benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.2/3">People in full-time education are not entitled to receive jobseeker's allowance. Successive Governments have taken the view that full-time education is incompatible with the 'work first' nature of the jobseeker's allowance regime. It would be very difficult for someone in full-time education to fully meet the conditions for receipt of jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.2/4">Young people who are eligible to claim jobseekers allowance receive, like everyone else, help and support to find work. As unemployment lengthens and getting into work becomes more difficult the help provided becomes more intensive. As part of this, young people become eligible for the new deal after six months unemployment. The new deal provides intensive support through a personal adviser and includes, for those people who do not find work quickly, a number of options, including full-time education and training, to help improve their prospects of finding work. Young people participating in full time education and training as part of the new deal receive an allowance, which is equivalent to their jobseeker's allowance plus a top up of &pound;15.38 per week to cover additional costs incurred through participation. Individuals receiving housing benefit can currently study for qualifications below degree level, as long as it is for less than 16 guided learning hours a week. This is not always a significant barrier as many full time Learning and Skills Council courses are just over 12 guided learning hours a week.</p>

	<p pid="b.108W.5/1">The National Health Service Act 1977 places a duty on the Secretary of State to provide a range of facilities and services to such extent as she considers necessary to meet reasonable requirements. The Secretary of State discharges her duties through delegation to local primary care trusts who can contract with national health service trusts, NHS foundation trusts and other healthcare providers for those services. Should an NHS organisation wish to make a significant change or variation to a service then they are required to consult with local stakeholders including the overview and scrutiny committee before reaching a final decision. In addition, the core services of NHS foundation trusts are protected when they achieve foundation status and these services can only be changed if the regulator is satisfied that any changes are in the interests of the NHS. As medical knowledge advances and new ways of working are developed it is inevitable over time that there will be changes in the location of particular services in the interests of patients.</p>

We are also working on the wider international level through the international partnership on avian and pandemic influenza through such meetings that were co-hosted by WHO, Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the World Organisation for Animal Health in November.</p>

	<p pid="b.111W.6/1">It is important to be clear about the differences between seasonal flu, avian flu and pandemic flu. Avian influenza is a disease which mainly affects birds. Seasonal flu refers to the virus that circulates in the human population and causes widespread illness each winter. Pandemic flu will only occur after an avian virus has mutated into a novel strain which can spread easily between humans and to which they do not have immunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.6/2">Surrey and Sussex strategic health authority has advised that national health service organisations throughout Surrey and Sussex have robust plans in place to respond to any outbreak of infectious disease. These plans include a contingency response to any infectious pandemic, including avian flu should it ever transfer to human-to-human transmission.</p>

	<p pid="b.115W.2/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for local sexual health and HIV health promotion including the provision of free condoms. The NHS Logistics Authority purchases condoms centrally for distribution by the national health service, although PCTs also purchase them direct from condom suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="b.115W.2/2">To support PCTs the Department has produced best practice guidance on sexual health promotion which highlights the need to make condoms accessible to those who need them. The need to ensure people have access to free provision of all methods of contraception, including condoms, is also highlighted in &quot;Recommended Standards for Sexual Health Services&quot;, produced by the Department with the Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual Health.</p>

	<p pid="b.116W.2/1">Each primary care trust (PCT) has access to the services of a consultant in dental public health, who provides advice on local oral health and the geographical areas that should be a priority for action. The British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry surveys provide information on the numbers of decayed missing and filled teeth by PCT area.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.2/2">A PCT's ability to respond to local oral health needs will be substantially strengthened by the introduction of local commissioning of primary care dental services from April 2006. PCTs will hold a local budget for dental services. When a dentist leaves the area or reduces his or her national health service commitment, the resources return to the PCT. It is at their discretion to redeploy these resources locally and to agree where new practices are established. This gives the PCT the ability to reflect the oral health needs of their local population in the distribution of NHS primary care dental services.</p>

	<p pid="b.130W.0/2">Patients receiving specialist palliative care are excluded from the system of charging for delays in discharge. In addition, many patients who have rapidly deteriorating conditions or who do not have long to live will continue to be the national health service's responsibility and as such will not trigger any payment from social services. The NHS is responsible for ensuring the patient is safe to discharge, however, some patients will have a strong preference to return home to die. If they, or their carer, need a care package, including services from social services which is not in place by their discharge date, social services will be potentially liable for a charge.</p>

	<p pid="b.130W.6/1">The Department has, in consultation with the identity (ID) cards programme, developed its current best estimate of the cost of using the ID cards scheme to support the services which it oversees and these costs have been incorporated into the business case. The Department is represented on the Ministerial Committee on Identity Cards which oversees the work on benefits planning and realisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.130W.6/2">In deriving these estimates account has to be taken of the types of use required to support the particular services which the Department oversees. Not all services will require a high degree of integration between the ID cards scheme and other information technology (IT) systems. There are no plans to use ID cards to access the NHS Care Record Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.130W.6/3">We cannot release the detailed estimated costs for integrating IT systems and the on-going operation of the ID cards scheme within the Department and the services which it oversees at this stage as these elements may be acquired from the market. The estimates are therefore commercially sensitive and to release them may prejudice the procurement process and the Department's ability to obtain value for money from potential suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.131W.2/6">However, this data is not comparable with independent sector contracts as they have to cover a range of costs, which are not applicable to the NHS. NHS equivalent cost, which does take into account the range of additional costs incurred by independent sector providers, is used to provide a direct comparison between the services procured from the independent sector and the NHS. Details of equivalent cost by procedure cannot be disclosed as it would undermine future commercial negotiations. However, the overall cost for wave 1 schemes in 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 was less than the NHS equivalent.</p>

	<p pid="b.140W.2/1">In the statutory sector, NHS Direct provides a 24-hour, seven day a week telephone helpline service and its fully-trained staff respond to about 325,000 calls per year from people with mental health issues. NHS Direct works in close partnership with the member organisations of the Mental Health Helplines Partnership (MHHP).</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.2/2">The Department has committed funding of &pound;5 million during the period 2004&ndash;05 to 2006&ndash;07 on developing an infrastructure to facilitate voluntary and community sector mental health helpline providers in England working in partnership in order to achieve increased quality, efficiency, capacity, governance, choice and access in relation to the provision of mental health helpline services. The MHHP includes the majority of the major national and local voluntary and community sector mental health telephone helpline providers (around 50 plus) excluding membership organisations. MHHP member organisations jointly handle over 5 million telephone calls or contacts per year. MHHP member organisations jointly respond to 99 per cent. of all calls made to mental health helplines.</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.2/3">The MHHP is currently in the procurement stage of purchasing a telecommunications solutions package that will enable MHHP members to work more efficiently in terms of call-switching between MHHP members and to work towards overall 24-hour provision of MHHP helpline services and, therefore, improve the overall level of service provision to people with mental health issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.140W.5/1">We have consulted widely as part of the race equality impact assessment (REIA) on the Mental Health Bill in the past few months. Consultation events were held in Leeds, Birmingham and London in early November. Approximately 180 people attended these events, excluding organisers and speakers, and around a third of these were service users, mostly of a black and minority ethnic background (BME) background. Other attendees included BME carers, mental health professionals and voluntary organisations representing BME service users and carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/2">Other consultations included:</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/3" class="indent">establishing an advisory group of stakeholders and experts in the field, which has provided its own recommendations, based on existing consultation material on the Bill, and on the basis of a workshop with stakeholders that was held in July;</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/4" class="indent">interviews and focus groups with detained patients, of which around 80 per cent, were BME patients, conducted on behalf of the Department by the Mental Health Act Commission;</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/5" class="indent">written submissions from the Mental Health Act Commission's service user panel, which included BME and non-BME patients;</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/6" class="indent">a written consultation with professional groups who will be operating the Bill; and</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/7" class="indent">a web-based opportunity for people to submit their own comments and views on the issues that have arisen out of earlier consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/8">We have also taken account of the views expressed in previous consultation on the Bill, including evidence submitted to the pre-legislative scrutiny committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/9">We have, however, listened to stakeholders' views and agreed that there should be further consultation as part of the REIA on the Bill. We will be discussing with stakeholders what further consultation should be undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.5/10">The process we have followed in undertaking the REIA has had close regard to the Commission for Racial Equality's (CRE's) guidance. Officials and CRE staff met early in the process to discuss the guidance. We have also seconded, part-time, a former CRE employee who is familiar with the REIA guidance to work on the REIA, and we have also involved the Home Office race equality unit, which has the lead across Whitehall for REIA work. We will continue to take the CRE guidance into account in any further work on the REIA and we are confident that the REIA which we publish alongside the Bill, when this is introduced, will satisfy the guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.142W.17/5">The current payment by results programme takes account of the impact of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) technology appraisals when calculating an uplift on average reference costs for the national tariff. For example, the 2004&ndash;05 tariff included an uplift for the costs of implementing a NICE appraisal of drug eluting stents, which was published in October 2003. The combination of incentives under payment by results and patient choice will reward providers that attract people by responding to their needs and preferences.</p>

	<p pid="b.143W.2/3">Patient group directions may be used to supply and administer medicines to patients by certain registered health care professionals, for example, nurses, pharmacists or ambulance paramedics. They may be used in the NHS including those services which are funded by the NHS but provided by the private, voluntary or charitable sectors. They may also be used by independent hospitals, agencies and clinics registered under the Care Standards Act, prison health services, police services and the defence medical services.</p>

	<p pid="b.150W.2/1">We have made a commitment that all national health service trusts should be in a position to apply for national health service foundation trust (NHSFT) status by 2008. To assist in that process we are rolling out a national programme to assess the readiness of all acute trusts for NHSFT status, in the context of their wider health communities. This whole health community diagnostic project will see trusts developing action plans with their strategic health authorities which set out any challenges or performance issues they need to overcome to become authorised as an NHSFT, as well as an indication of when trusts might be ready to apply for foundation status. The project will be completed by summer 2006.</p>

The Department works with SHAs to support them in this task. As part of this support, I have recently announced the formation of finance turnaround teams. These teams will be initially working with 63 NHS organisations. The teams will work with the chief executives of the organisations in delivering the key targets and financial stability. The chief executives will remain responsible for delivery in their organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.151W.5/2">All national health service organisations have minimum standards of quality they must deliver, including meeting the targets for maximum waiting times. These are dramatically better than the standards of the NHS in the past and there can be no trade-off between these quality standards and removing deficits. All areas of the country have seen dramatic improvements in services, and all areas of the country will continue to see improvements as additional investment is made. Progress in a particular hospital or service has to be achieved within what is affordable, otherwise the local NHS would be spending other people's money to deliver an improved service which would be unfair to the other parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.152W.5/2">Osteoporosis can often be prevented by a healthy lifestyle including exercise and a balanced diet and, in people at particular risk, by drug therapy. Cases of established osteoporosis can be treated both to prevent further fractures and to improve an individual's quality of life. All treatment of osteoporosis can be regarded as secondary prevention. Much of this can be managed in primary care, even in cases of advanced disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.152W.5/3">The national service framework (NSF) for older people published in March 2001 required integrated falls services to be in place locally by April 2005. The NSF also provided a detailed description of what an integrated falls service should look like; the different elements and people required for integrated service planning and provision. In addition to this, to increase capacity in osteoporosis services in Dexa scanning for bone density as a guide to treatment, the Department has made &pound;20 million available for investment in Dexa scanning services and equipment to build capacity. In 2005&ndash;06, &pound;3 million has been allocated from a centrally held revenue budget for purchasing of additional scans, mainly from independent sector providers, in strategic health authorities where there are the most pressing shortfalls. Capital provision of &pound;17 million has been made available in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 to improve national health service capacity through investment in new Dexa scanning equipment.</p>

	<p pid="b.155W.2/1">The child health development programme, which provides for health and development checks for young children, is informed by professional guidelines, &quot;principally Health for all children&quot; edited by Professor David Hall and Dr. David Elliman. This includes guidance on detecting abnormalities in skull development.</p>
	<p pid="b.155W.2/2">Positional plagiocephaly is caused by allowing consistent pressure to be applied to one part of a baby's skull over a period of time. This is commonly remedied by enabling babies to experience a range of positions rather than remaining in one position. The Department's guidance to parents on the first five years of their child's life &quot;Birth to five&quot;, and on reducing the risk of cot death, advocates this procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.155W.2/3">Funding associated with avoiding positional plagiocephaly is not separable from the overall funding of child health in the community.</p>

	<p pid="b.155W.5/1">I have had no direct discussions with bottled water producers, but I am advised that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been in contact with producers regarding the recent press reports of taints of bottled waters stored near household chemicals. There have been some studies on the transfer of chemicals through food packaging, because of the possibility of taint. The thinner and more porous the packaging material, the greater the possibility of taint. The FSA advises that food is not stored near cleaning products or other strongly smelling chemicals.</p>
	<p pid="b.155W.5/2">The FSA is responsible for food labelling, including the requirements that apply to bottled waters. Local authorities are responsible for enforcing food legislation and for investigating any complaints from the public about possible contamination of bottled water both before and after purchase.</p>

	<p pid="b.158W.5/15">The great majority of national health service private finance initiative schemes are regarded under accounting standards as being off balance sheet which means that the facilities built by the private sector are off the national health service's balance sheet. There may be deferred assets and liabilities in the accounts of the individual bodies arising from these transactions, but these are not separately identifiable from the accounts.</p>

	<p pid="b.160W.2/1">The dossier provided by the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) in November of 2004, included 18 letters from their members, of which only two related to clinical governance or quality assurance issues for national health service patients treated within independent sector treatment centre (ISTC) programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.160W.2/2">The two letters from the BOA that referred to clinical governance issues related to results obtained by overseas surgeons operating on NHS patients at the Nuffield Hospitals in Derby and Cambridge, respectively. In both circumstances, local clinical governance arrangements had rapidly ensured that the surgeons discontinued working, and formal service investigations were performed at both sites. Learning points from these investigations were used to inform on-going governance arrangements in this sector, and were outlined to the BOA in May of this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.160W.2/3">The remaining 16 letters from November 2004 comprised a diverse group of issues not directly relating to clinical governance issues in this sector, referring instead to issues of local capacity planning, waiting list issues and discontent over broader policy matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.160W.2/4">In September of this year, 11 further letters were sent to the Department by the BOA. Five of these letters relate to the ISTC programme, and all clinical incidents were already known to the Department, and have been or are being reported on. A response is being issued to the BOA and further information will be shared as it becomes available.</p>

This states that restraint by physical means should take place only as a last resort and never as a matter of course. In addition the guidance states that any restraint used should be reasonable in the circumstance; apply the minimum force necessary to prevent harm to the patient or others; be used for only as long as is necessary; and be sensitive to gender and race issues. The advice applies in all healthcare settings and to all age ranges. Trusts should regularly audit their physical restraint procedures consistent with the framework of clinical governance and safeguarding children arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.169W.0/1">Data on the number of people with sleep apnoea is not available centrally but the British Snoring and Sleep Apnoea Association estimates that 4 per cent. of men and 2 per cent. of women are affected by the condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.0/2">Hospital episode statistics (HES) contains details of patients admitted to and treated in national health statistics hospitals in England. In 2003&ndash;04, there were 12,162 finished consultant episodes in NHS hospitals in England for people with a primary diagnosis of sleep apnoea. HES data does not reflect the number of patients with a particular condition as a person may have more than one finished consultant episode (FCE) in the year. A FCE is defined as the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.0/3">The national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions is a 10-year programme intended to stimulate long term and sustained improvement in services principally for people with neurological conditions. It is for the NHS locally to set their own pace of change. Through the regular review and inspection processes the NHS and local authorities will need to demonstrate that they are making progress in planning and developing the level of service quality described in the NSF.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.0/4">Information on waiting times for inpatient and outpatient treatment in England is collected by consultant speciality rather than for specific conditions. Depending on the clinical needs of the patient, a range of consultants can undertake the treatment of sleep disorders, including neurological and respiratory specialists. As specialty level data for relevant specialties would include data for a number of conditions it is not possible to determine what proportion of suspected obstructive sleep apnoea patients wait for longer than one month to see a specialist.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.0/5">By the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for first outpatient appointment with a consultant will fall to 13 weeks and the maximum waiting time for inpatient treatment will fall to six months. By 2008, patients will be admitted for treatment within a maximum of 18 weeks from referral by their general practitioner, and those with urgent conditions will be treated much faster.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.0/6">Information on the percentage of NHS trusts commissioning specialist services for diagnosing and treating sleep disorders is not available centrally. It is for health professionals in primary care organisations, in consultation with other stakeholders, to determine which services their populations need and to ensure the appropriate level of provision. In terms of sleep disorders, this would include, where appropriate, the provision of continuous positive airway pressure equipment as well as other treatments and interventions such as advice to promote weight loss. It is for health professionals to decide what treatment to offer patients, in consultation with the patient and informed by the patient's medical history. The Department does not collect information on the number of sleep apnoea patients with access to continuous airway pressure treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.0/7">The Department has not undertaken any research into the medical status of individuals involved in sleep-related accidents. In 2002, the Department for Transport held an expert workshop into the medical causes of daytime sleepiness in respect of driving and, as a result, strengthened the advice it provides to doctors.</p>

	<p pid="b.172W.0/1">The Department collects expenditure information on non national health service staff for local NHS organisations including strategic health authorities (SHAs). Non-NHS staff expenditure figures include all agency staff and any other staff not directly employed by these bodies.

We have serious concerns about reports of extra-judicial killings and torture by the Rapid Action Battalion and the civilian police. The persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, including the Ahmadiyyas, Hindus and Christians and indigenous groups is also a serious issue.

	<p pid="b.184W.2/1">The Government regularly raises with the Brazilian Government, bilaterally and with our European partners, the importance we attach to human rights, including police reform and tackling extra-judicial killings. My hon. Friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State responsible for relations with Latin America (Bill Rammell) raised human rights issues with the Brazilian Government at the UK-Brazil High Level Political talks in February 2005 and our ambassador in Brasilia discussed these issues with senior members of the Brazilian judiciary and Ministry of Justice at a seminar in Brasilia funded by the British Government in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.2/2">Although serious abuses of human rights continue to take place in Brazil, we believe that the Brazilian authorities recognise the scale of the problem. Combating extra-judicial killings by law enforcement officials is a priority for Brazil's Sub-Secretariat for Human Rights. In addition, the Government support various projects with Brazilian partners to combat torture and improve the police and penal system. Our work enjoys the full support of the authorities both at local and federal level. We will continue to work with the Brazilian authorities and with Brazilian civil society to help address the various root causes of these problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.192W.3/1">People who wanted to come to the UK to work in the restaurant trade had to acquire an immigration employment document (a form of work permit) under the Sectors Based Scheme (SBS). The SBS allowed workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to take up low skill jobs within certain industry sectors for up to 12 months in the UK. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-31">31 July 2005</phrase>, the Home Office announced the closure of the hospitality sector of the scheme, which encompasses the restaurant trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.3/2">All work permit schemes are administered by Work Permits UK (WP (UK)), a division of the Home Office, and they decide all work permit applications by assessing the application against certain criteria of the labour market. For example, WP (UK) will check that the job exists, has been adequately advertised locally and within the EEA and that the proposed job complies with UK labour law and the national minimum wage. As the SBS is for low skill jobs, there is no requirement to employ people with extensive knowledge of a trade. An employer needs only to be aware that a potential employee has a basic understanding of the job they have been offered.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.3/3">Once an immigration employment document has been issued under the SBS, the holder should apply for entry clearance. An Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) at one of our visa sections must assess this application against the requirements of paragraph 135 (I) of the Immigration Rules, which are available at <a href="http://www.indhomeoffice.gov.uk">www.indhomeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.3/4">ECOs are not asked to assess an applicant's job skills, although they should defer an application and consult WP (UK) if there are obvious doubts about the applicant's physical and/or professional ability to undertake the employment specified and the applicant is unable to give a satisfactory explanation.</p>

	<p pid="b.197W.2/1">Assisting in the resolution of the conflict in Northern Uganda, and addressing its humanitarian impact, are priorities for the Government. During the UK's presidency of the United Nations (UN) Security Council in December 2005, we invited Jan Egeland, the UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, to provide a briefing on humanitarian issues in Africa. This took place on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase> and included the situation in Northern Uganda. A group of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have written to my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary advocating a UN Security Council Resolution. This has since been supplemented to date by correspondence from about 1,000 members of the public. We are currently considering their ideas and how we can most effectively continue to address the situation in Northern Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.2/2">In our discussions with the Ugandan Government, we emphasise the need to bring peace to Northern Uganda, provide adequate protection for the people of the North and those NGOs and aid agencies working there, and encourage those Lord's Resistance Army members not indicted by the International Criminal Court to seek amnesty and reintegration into their communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.2/3">The UK has also provided support for specific peace initiatives, including the recent mediation effort led by Betty Bigombe, a former Ugandan Minister. We provide practical help to the Ugandan Amnesty Commission, which is helping to reintegrate former combatants, and have also helped establish a local radio station, MEGA FM, which, through its programming, helps promote peace.</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.0/1">We welcome the recent agreement in the US to incorporate language into the Defence Appropriations Bill explicitly prohibiting the use of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by US personnel anywhere in the world. This sends a positive message that the US is committed to fighting terrorism while reaffirming its adherence to the rule of law and its respect for human rights. All forms of torture are of course strictly prohibited under US law and, as Secretary Rice and President Bush both recently clarified, this applies to all US personnel around the world.</p>

For instance, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Non-Governmental Organisations Forum estimates that there were 43 cases of assault in October 2005, most by the army or police. On <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights adopted a resolution expressing concern about the human rights situation in Zimbabwe.

	<p pid="b.199W.2/2">Years of conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), exacerbated by corruption, illegal exploitation of resources and the collapse of the state, have led to human rights abuses and a high level of crime. Security Sector Reform is one of the primary aims of the EU's support to the DRC transitional government. We hope that the political transition in the DRC will culminate in the election of a democratic government by mid-2006, which should provide the framework for sustained improvements in the security and human rights situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.202W.6/1">In support of partnerships to strengthen African Parliaments, DFID has recently provided &pound;282,000 to the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank (PNoWB) to support the establishment of three new African 'Chapters' (or regional networks). The PNoWB will help build the capacity of parliamentarians in Africa to be more effective advocates for national policies and plans focused on tackling poverty. This will be achieved through enhancing their role as legislators, and strengthening their capacity to hold their Governments to account and scrutinise the role of donors. Our support will also help build links with developed country Parliaments and development partners, the Pan-African Parliament (PAP), the African Union (AU) and the African Union-New Partnership for Africa's Development (AU/NEPAD), and other parliamentary organisations in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.6/2">The PAP receives its core funding from the AU's regular budget. It held its first inaugural session in March 2004, and as a young organisation is still primarily focused on adopting its rules and procedures. DFID has not, as yet received any request for funds for support to the PAP, but would be happy to consider such a request in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.203W.0/1">The most recent bilateral project supported by DFID on coca production in the Andes region was in the Lower Huallaga Valley of Peru, which aimed to promote economic and institutional development and increase rural incomes in order to reduce the illegal cultivation of coca. This six year project with a commitment of &pound;3.2 million ended in December 2004. Assistance in the Andes region is now part of DFID's Regional Assistance Plan for Latin America, working closely with International Finance Institutions (particularly the World Bank and Inter American Development Bank) to improve the poverty impact of their programmes in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.203W.0/2">Programmes to develop sustainable alternatives to coca production are an important element of the European Union's assistance to the region, which DFID supports through its 18 per cent. contribution. The EU has Country Assistance Strategies with each Andean region country that are consistent with EU policies and those of country governments. The fight against drugs takes a special place in the EU's relationship with the Andean region, with a unique EU-Andean region High Level Specialised Dialogue on Drugs. The EU has welcomed the recent Comprehensive Andean Strategy on Alternative Development.</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.3/1">The UN released the report of its second mortality survey in Darfur in October 2005. The overall findings, which cover the period from November 2004 to May 2005, are that mortality rates are below crisis levels, but still elevated. The only exception is in South Darfur, where under-five mortality was above crisis levels. When compared to the previous survey in August 2004, it can be concluded that the international humanitarian response has had a significant impact in saving lives. However the situation remains precarious.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.3/2">Estimates of deaths in Darfur vary from 70,000 to 400,000. Accurate figures are not available. The two mortality surveys, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) co-ordinated, only provide a snapshot of the situation and we are unlikely ever to get a full picture of deaths from this conflict. The undertaking of mortality surveys has proved difficult in Darfur due to the security situation. While not comprehensive, these WHO surveys do provide a useful understanding of the situation and how it is changing.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.3/3">DFID contributed to the funding of this last survey as these offer a means to gauge the effectiveness of the relief operation and, specifically, to improve the healthcare response. The UN has indicated it would be desirable to do further surveys in Darfur in the future. DFID will continue to support the UN to undertake these.</p>

	<p pid="b.209W.5/1">Our approach to GM crops and their potential impact on developing countries very seriously. Our approach is based on the principle that the health of people and of the environment is of primary concern. We recognise that GM technology in itself will not solve the problem of world hunger. Our assessment of the impact of GM crops is that they can however be used safely and effectively to promote development and reduce poverty, if managed responsibly and applied to those crops on which the poor rely.</p>
	<p pid="b.209W.5/2">DFID does not actively promote or not promote the use of GM technologies in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.209W.5/3">Recognising that there are both potential benefits and risks associated with GM crops, developing countries should be able to make their own informed choices about whether to adopt GM technologies. To this end, DFID has helped fund research into Genetically Modified crops and their potential use in developing countries. The proportion of DFID's research spent on GM crops research has been 0.37 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04 and 0.35 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05 and is predicted to be 0.23 per cent. for 2005&ndash;06. This research has not involved assessing either <i>(a)</i> least developed countries or <i>(b)</i> middle income countries as a whole; projects have looked at more specific issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.209W.5/4">DFID also worked with the Department for the Environment, Food and Agriculture (DEFRA) and other Government Departments to support international negotiations to establish the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, under the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Protocol will work to ensure that countries are provided with the information necessary to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of genetically modified organisms. It will also facilitate the exchange of information on living modified organisms even if there is a lack of scientific certainty on the extent of such potential adverse effects.</p>

	<p pid="b.210W.2/4">Progress has been made since Gleneagles. The universal access commitment was also agreed by members states at the Millennium Summit in September. Building on these commitments, the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have set up a Global Steering Committee (GSC), co-chaired by the UK and UNAIDS. The focus of the GSC will be to clarify and prioritise the major obstacles that impede scale-up of prevention, treatment, care and support services in individual countries and communities and to identify appropriate solutions and actions. The GSC will meet for the first time in Washington DC on 9&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January 2006</phrase> and is expected to provide a progress report to the High Level UN General Assembly Special Session in mid 2006.</p>

We have also pledged &pound;40 million to the reformed Central Emergency Response Fund that was launched at the United Nations Millennium Review summit, as a way of promoting faster response and greater equity in humanitarian funding.

	<p pid="b.211W.5/1">DFID assistance to Africa will be over &pound;1 billion in 2005&ndash;06 rising to at least &pound;1.25 billion in 2007&ndash;08, targeted on the Millennium Development Goals. The G8 agreed at the Gleneagles summit to double aid to Africa by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/2">In addition, boosting economic growth is fundamental to making progress with eradicating extreme poverty and hunger (Millennium Development Goal 1). This requires more private sector investment, better roads to link producers to markets, and increasing the benefit Africa receives from regional and global trade. These are all areas in which DFID is actively engaged. For example, DFID will provide &pound;21 million to the African Union&mdash;New Partnership for Africa's Development (AU-NEPAD) Investment Climate Facility which will help improve the environment for the private sector. DFID also acts to help ensure growth benefits the poorest&mdash;such as helping to increase the productivity of agriculture and creating jobs in non-agricultural labour markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/3">DFID is also working to halve the number of people facing hunger in Africa by 2015. This often means providing humanitarian support for the effects of drought. During 2005 for example, DFID provided &pound;64 million humanitarian relief to southern Africa alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/4">While continuing to respond promptly to crises, we are working to tackle chronic hunger more effectively. Poverty is an important factor. When large numbers of people live below the poverty line, even the smallest of shocks can lead to destitution and hunger. DFID is aiming to help countries that suffer from chronic hunger to establish safety nets to protect the most vulnerable from hunger (such as the elderly or orphans) and stop others falling into destitution as a result of shocks like drought or illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/5">For example, in Ethiopia we are giving &pound;70 million over three years to support a programme which aims to provide people with predictable and regular transfers of cash and food. This helps meet food gaps while also allowing households to invest in health, education or increase their farm production. In this way, safety nets can also serve as a springboard for poor households which can otherwise struggle to participate in economic growth. We aim to scale up this approach in Zambia, Kenya, Malawi and Lesotho over 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.214W.2/1">The UN has gradually reduced its staff in West Darfur in the last quarter of 2005 due to the deteriorating security situation. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-05">5 January</phrase>, the UN also raised their security levels to Phase IV in some parts of West Darfur. An estimated 450,000 people are thought to be affected in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.2/2">This change instigates the move for the UN to emergency operations and life-saving humanitarian relief activities only. The change requires humanitarian agencies to reduce the number of staff in the area, and limit movement areas into designated as insecure. Non-essential staff will be redeployed within the Darfur region to continue operations in key locations. Many UN agencies have already substantially reduced non-essential staff, so further reductions due to the rise in the security level are likely to be limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.2/3">The UN is continuing to make every effort to provide life-saving assistance, including emergency food and health services, as well as the provision of water and shelter to people in camps and other affected populations throughout Darfur. The current insecurity will, however, inevitably have an impact on their capacity to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.214W.5/1">Despite the modest progress made at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks in Hong Kong, it is not possible at this stage to give any meaningful estimate of the numbers of people that could be lifted out of poverty as a result for two broad reasons. First, the nature of the agreement reached in Hong Kong, and second because the ministerial conference was just a staging post along the way to conclusion of the Doha Round of talks as a whole. For example, although Ministers agreed that developed countries would give duty and quota free access to their markets for the least developed countries (LDC), there is some flexibility to exclude 3 per cent. of tariff lines during a transition period of indeterminate length. The risk is that developed countries will apply them to precisely those products where the poorest countries have the best chance to export.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.5/2">On cotton, although agreement was reached on granting duty and quota free access to LDC cotton producers, the bigger problem of tackling US domestic support has not yet been resolved. Although there was agreement on ending agricultural export subsidies and other equivalent measures, this will not be complete until 2013, it is not clear precisely how the phasing out will be achieved, and the more critical issue of agricultural market access for developing countries has also not been resolved, yet despite these uncertainties, the WTO director general, Pascal Lamy, has judged that we are now more than half way to the final deal, and it has set out a potential route-agreement of the final architecture of a deal in agriculture and industrial goods by the end of April 2006; and the substantive conclusion of the round by the end of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence is supportive of all staff with mental ill health. The support provided varies dependent upon whether the individual is a member of the armed forces or a civil servant.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/2">The Department has over the last three years operated a stress policy laid down in Joint Service Publication 375. This publication can be found on the internet, (<a href="http://www.mod.uk/dsc/ohs/jsp375.htm">www.mod.uk/dsc/ohs/jsp375.htm</a>). This policy is supplemented by procedures that were designed to assist with mental ill health and stress reduction when identified in an individual. The Department also has policies to support individuals with alcohol and drug dependencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/3">The MOD has particular responsibility for the mental health of members of the armed forces (including reservists on deployment) and specific measures are in place to prevent and treat stress-related disorders among service personnel, as well as civilians deployed in support of operations. These include pre and post-deployment briefings and access to trained mental health staff both during and after deployments.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/4">Service personnel, both regular and reservist, returning from operational deployment are offered a 2&ndash;3 day period of 'normalisation' during which they receive a post-deployment briefing pack. This includes two leaflets and a presentation, covering post-traumatic stress reactions and the problems that may be encountered on returning home to families. Returning personnel also receive guidance on whom to consult if they experience post deployment problems, including their commanders, padres, social workers and health care staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/5">Out-patient mental health treatment for the armed forces takes place at 13 MOD Departments of community mental health located throughout the UK and three satellite centres in Cyprus, Germany and Gibraltar. In-patient treatment, when required, has been provided by The Priory Group since April 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/6">For civilian staff, medical advice on the specific condition must be a personal responsibility available through the individual's GP and the NHS. The Department provides occupational health (OH) advice and support through its OH advisers, Capita Health Solutions. In addition the Department provides:</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/7" class="indent">Confidential advice from a member of the Occupational Welfare Service</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/8" class="indent">Time off for medical appointments and treatment</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/9" class="indent">Reasonable adjustments to hours of work and the nature of their duties</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/10" class="indent">Gradual rehabilitation including reduced hours and duties</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/11" class="indent">A comprehensive suite of Work/Life policies</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/12">Veterans can seek assistance through the Veterans Agency's helpline on 0800 169 2277, and the War Pensioners Welfare Service provides advice and guidance to those veterans who are applying for or who have been awarded a war pension or gratuity. We also paid around &pound;2 million to the Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society (Combat Stress) in the last financial year in order to fund remedial treatment for war pensioners.</p>

For reasons of operational security, however, we do not comment further on specific equipment capabilities or numbers. Infantry, Royal Armoured Corps and Artillery units and sub-units undertake theatre-specific public order training as part of their operational training package, although the ultimate choice of vehicle or equipment used in any given situation will be dependent on the commander's assessment of the task in hand and the nature of the current threat.
