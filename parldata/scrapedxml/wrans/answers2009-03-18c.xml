Since June 2008 The Ministry of Defence has significantly enhanced its training and awareness programmes for security and data handling, building on a broader security awareness programme launched in early 2008. The Department has worked closely with the Cabinet Office and other Departments to implement a core Computer Based Training (CBT) package to provide awareness of individuals' responsibilities in handling data, particularly personal data. Data handling training is mandated for all staff, either through the CBT package or, for military staff below the rank of Sergeant/Petty Officer by means either of the CBT or a group briefing.</p>

	<p pid="c.1143W.0/2">A number of respondents to the consultation on the UK implementation of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, conducted between July and October 2008, agreed with the Ofcom estimate.

The variation in the estimates made by respondents to the consultation indicates that there is a lack of clear evidence about the potential value of product placement and that there is no consensus on the potential size of the UK product placement market.</p>

It prohibits television product placement in general, but excludes from that prohibition the inclusion of products and services in a programme acquired from outside the UK and in films made for cinema provided that no broadcaster regulated by Ofcom and involved in the broadcast of that programme or film directly benefits from the arrangement.

	<p pid="c.1144W.11/1">Section 10 of Ofcom's Broadcasting Code includes rules governing the inclusion of products and services in television programmes. It prohibits television product placement in general, but excludes from that prohibition the inclusion of products and services in a programme acquired from outside the UK and in films made for cinema, provided that no broadcaster regulated by Ofcom and involved in the broadcast of that programme or film directly benefits from the arrangement. It also requires that no undue prominence may be given to a product or service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1147W.8/1">The Allocation of Road Track Costs report was discontinued because the costs of vehicles using the road extended beyond the costs that were included in the report. For example, the report took account of the cash costs of capital expenditure on construction, and of current expenditure on maintenance, but made no allowance for a return on capital.</p>

	<p pid="c.1147W.11/1">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) requires suppliers of fossil fuel to ensure a proportion of the fuel they supply is renewable. UK suppliers are mostly using biodiesel to meet their obligation and some smaller quantities of bioethanol. There will be distribution difficulties transporting bioethanol from the refinery at Grangemouth to remote areas such as the Highlands and Islands as these areas are currently supplied with fossil petrol by ship. However, shipping is not suitable for transporting petrol blended with bioethanol due to its water attracting properties. This issue has not resulted in an immediate risk of petrol supply but in the future it is possible that bioethanol will need to be transported from Grangemouth to these regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1147W.11/2">In response to last year's consultation about future obligation levels under the RTFO the Department for Transport received a number of representations from: the Highlands and Islands Council; The Highlands and Islands Transport Partnership (HITRANS) and the fuel supplier Ineos. All raised concerns about the practicality and cost implications of distributing and storing bioethanol to these regions. The Department for Transport and the Scottish Executive are considering possible solutions. We shall examine how a future consultation on the implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive and an impact assessment might consider this issue and possible options to overcome these problems. As part of this process we shall continue to engage with those organisations that have raised concerns.</p>

Following this announcement the Government have provided funding for a series of measures to work with police and enforcement agencies to support the policing of illegal cannabis production and use. These measures include working jointly with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) on a UK Baseline Assessment; a National Problem Profile of commercial cannabis cultivation for the first time; the appointment of a national cannabis co-ordinator and the funding of NPIA practice guidance on tackling commercial cannabis cultivation and head shops.</p>

For neighbourhood policing teams an essential element of developing partnerships with their local communities is to consider how to engage effectively with young people. For example, each borough in Surrey has a youth intervention team that engages with young people in schools and the wider community, while Essex police make use of the county council's youth buses to engage with hard to reach communities. We also recently published our Youth Crime Action Plan (YCAP) which highlights the need to improve the communication and relationships between young people and the police.</p>

For example, of arrestees who reported taking heroin and/or crack cocaine (HC) at least once a week, 54 per cent. reported shoplifting in the four weeks prior to arrest compared to 10 per cent. for those arrestees who did not take HC at least once per week.</p>

	<p pid="c.1160W.2/2">The most recent estimates made by the Department of the costs of drug-related retail crime provide figures for the victim costs of shoplifting as well as robbery associated with class A drug use (note that robbery covers both commercial and personal robbery). Estimates are also provided for the total social and economic costs of these crimes associated with class A drug use.</p>
	<p pid="c.1160W.2/3" class="indent">Recent estimates suggest that shoplifting accounts for 12 per cent. of the total social and economic costs of class A drug use. Victim costs for shoplifting are made up of the value of the property stolen and were estimated at &pound;1,533 million in 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="c.1160W.2/4" class="indent">Robbery is estimated to account for 16 per cent. of total social and economic costs of class A drug use (although note that this does not distinguish between personal and commercial robbery). Victim costs for robbery are made up of the value of property stolen as well as the cost of violence experienced by the victim and were estimated at &pound;1,583 million in 2003-04.</p>

	<p pid="c.1177W.2/1">We are committed to the delivery of affordable housing, and are investing over &pound;8 billion in affordable housing over the three years, 2008-11&mdash;a 50 per cent. increase on the previous three years. This investment is being made through the Homes and Communities Agency. Our aspiration is to reach 70,000 new affordable homes a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/2">The September housing market package of measures was aimed at increasing confidence, stability and fairness in the housing market. This offered up to 10,000 first-time buyers currently frozen out of the mortgage market the chance to get onto the property ladder through a new shared equity scheme, Homebuy Direct; Support for up to 6,000 of the most vulnerable homeowners facing repossession to remain in their home through a mortgage rescue scheme; Improving the support offered through the benefit system to homeowners with mortgages who lose their jobs, at a cost of &pound;100 million over the next two years; working with regional development agencies to support the most critical regeneration schemes with the greatest potential to transform their communities and specifically on social rent, bringing forward &pound;400 million in order to deliver up to 5,500 new social homes over the next 18 months on top of current assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/3">The pre-Budget announced &pound;775 million of housing and regeneration investment brought forward to help offset the impact of economic shocks on priority programmes and provide additional fiscal stimulus. This included &pound;250 million on Decent Homes programmes to fund improvements and improve energy efficiency in 25,000 council homes; a further &pound;150 million on social rented housing to bring forward delivery of up to 2,000 more social rented homes; &pound;175 million for major repairs to council housing stock, and &pound;100 million to support key regeneration and housing infrastructure projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/4">Additionally, the RDAs will consider the scope for bringing forward up to &pound;100 million nationally to provide a stimulus to regional and national economic development. The Government also extended the Mortgage Rescue scheme to include cover for second charge lending and the Support for Mortgage Interest scheme for homeowners who lose their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/5">These announcements build on those previously made in May and July 2008. We are continuing to work closely with the Homes and Communities Agency in order to secure continued delivery of affordable housing.</p>

	<p pid="c.1178W.8/1">The Audit Commission report, &quot;Crunch Time?&quot; found that councils are generally prepared for the impact of the economic downturn and the consequent loss of fees and interest, and increased demand for services. The Government have continued to invest in local services with an extra &pound;8.9 billion as part of the first-ever three-year settlement giving councils the stability and flexibility they need to manage their budgets effectively. Delivering continued efficiency gains is key to enabling authorities to manage the pressures they face which will generate a further &pound;4.9 billion over the CSR07 period. We know that some councils are coming up with innovative ways to save money. We believe that councils are therefore well placed to manage their way through this economic climate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1186W.6/1">The UK is not making any territorial claims as such. In relation to the continental shelf, where as a coastal state the UK would have limited rights to explore and exploit the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil, the UK has, to date, made two submissions to the UN Commission on the limits of the continental shelf. These relate to the continental shelf beyond 200nm in the Bay of Biscay (jointly with France, Ireland and Spain), and around Ascension Island. This has been done in accordance with Article 76 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>

	<p pid="c.1195W.3/1">It is a key principle of Government funding of adult learning that there is a shared responsibility on the part of learners, employers and the Government to contribute towards the cost of learning. The Skills Strategy White Paper &quot;21<sup>(st)</sup> Century Skills: Realising our Potential&quot; (published in July 2003) set out our intention that employers and learners should contribute towards the cost of their course, in light of the returns they derive from learning. &quot;Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances&quot; (March 2006) confirmed our intention to increase learner and/or employer fee contributions to 50 per cent. by 2010/11 for those not eligible for free provision. Lord Leitch's Review of Skills (December 2006) reaffirmed the importance for a shared responsibility to invest in skills with employers and learners asked to contribute most where they see the greatest private returns. We are therefore increasing private fee contributions for both employers and learners from 42.5 per cent. in 2008/09, to 47.5 per cent. for 2009/10 and 50 per cent. for 2010/11.</p>
	<p pid="c.1195W.3/2">Apprenticeship funding rates for adults therefore are lower than rates for young people aged 16-18, with employers expected to contribute to the total cost of an adult apprenticeship framework.</p>
	<p pid="c.1195W.3/3">Employer contributions to the cost of adult apprenticeships may be in cash to the training provider or in kind through supporting the delivery of the training activity.</p>

	<p pid="c.1197W.0/1">With regard to colleges the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) provides funding for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) to Further Education colleges as part of their overall allocation for adult learning. 297 colleges received funding to deliver courses in ESOL in 2008/09, spread across all nine regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.0/2">Colleges funded by the LSC to deliver ESOL courses are selected by the same process as other FE provision. The process for agreeing allocations to colleges begins with the LSC's annual Statement of Priorities document which sets out the key policy and investment priorities for the FE sector. Each LSC region produces a Regional Commissioning Statement which sets out the totality of provision to be secured in each region for the next academic year and which sets national priorities in a regional context.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.0/3">On the basis of the priorities and investment set out in these documents, the LSC then enters a commissioning process with its current college base to secure provision for the next academic year. In some regions, where there has been a strategic need to meet gaps in provision or to improve quality, ESOL provision has been tendered. The LSC commissions with colleges in light of their performance, the quality of their delivery, their capacity and capability, including their financial health. Allocations and contracts are then agreed with colleges based on a planning assumption of the volumes the college will deliver.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.0/4">Contracts are monitored regularly and robustly for all provision and increases or decreases applied to delivery volumes where appropriate. Other providers including local authorities and private training providers may also receive funds for ESOL provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.0/5">In regard to schools they must ensure that all their pupils develop as competent and confident speakers and writers of English.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.0/6">Local authorities receive funding through the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG) to provide support for minority ethnic pupils and pupils with English as an Additional Language, who are at risk of underachieving. EMAG is a ring-fenced grant which is distributed to authorities on a formula basis. While local authorities might retain 15 per cent. of their allocation to support central services, they may devolve the remaining 85 per cent. to schools. The grant is around &pound;187 million in 2008-09 and will continue to rise to &pound;207 million by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.0/7">Schools, through discussion with their community, can offer a range of services which members of the community may choose to take part in, one of those may be the offer of ESOL-type learning. However, it would not be possible to quantify the extent or take up of that offer.</p>

This decision was announced at the Joint Education Taskforce meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-26">26 February</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.1207W.0/2">Jobcentre Plus's social fund work status reports are an internal management tool. They are produced weekly and are a snap shot of how much work is outstanding in order to help manage the business.</p>
	<p pid="c.1207W.0/3">Work status reports are clerical statistics and are collated weekly at national level to provide management with information on the current levels of work in benefit delivery centres. This enables Jobcentre Plus to promptly move work around the network if needed rather than waiting for the monthly computer produced figures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1207W.0/4">Outstanding cases in each benefit delivery centre are clerically counted, collated at regional level and regional returns are then turned into the national picture. These are not robust enough to use as official data. It is therefore not appropriate for a copy of the work status report to be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1207W.0/5">Verified data are published in the annual report by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the Social Fund 2007-08, a copy of which is in the Library. It is also available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1208W.3/1">While the Department is responsible for housing benefit (HB) and council tax benefit (CTB) legislation, both benefits are administered by local authorities. There are no formulae, but the assessment processes are set out in the Housing Benefit Regulations and the Council Tax Benefit Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/2">The calculation of entitlement to HB looks at how much a person should pay towards their rent, assessed against their income and circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/3">The maximum HB that can be paid is the full amount of the customer's &quot;eligible rent&quot;. This is the amount of the rent which the legislation says can be covered by housing benefit, and may not be the same as the full rent charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/4">From April 2008 local housing allowance (LHA) has been rolled out nationally in the private rented sector. LHA has changed the way HB is calculated, so it is not just based on the rent, but on a flat rate amount which is determined by factors such as the area someone lives in and the household size.</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/5">For private tenants not yet on LHA, the local authority has to decide the &quot;eligible rent&quot;. To do this, they have to look at whether:</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/6" class="indent">the amount of rent is reasonable for that particular property;</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/7" class="indent">the property is a reasonable size for the customer and their family;</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/8" class="indent">the amount of rent is reasonable for the area the property is in;</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/9" class="indent">the rent includes any charges which cannot be covered by HB.</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/10">In a similar way, the calculation of CTB will depend upon the liability for council tax as well as individuals' personal circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/11">For these reasons, it is not possible to provide formulae in the way envisaged in the question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/12">People receiving the guarantee credit element of pension credit, income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance or income-related employment and support allowance are deemed to have no income or capital and they receive maximum HB band/or CTB (subject to any standard deductions for any non-dependant household member).</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/13">People not receiving the income-related benefits listed above will have their HB and CTB assessed on the basis of an &quot;applicable amount&quot;. The amount is made up of personal allowances and premiums. The personal allowances vary according to age and whether a person is single or one of a married or unmarried couple. The premiums are awarded to those groups identified as having extra needs, for example, long term sick or disabled people and elderly people. The applicable amounts are uprated every April and the current rates are in The Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/632).</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/14">If net income is equal to or is less than the applicable amount, the customer will receive an amount equal to 100 per cent. of their eligible rent and/or council tax liability less any non-dependant deductions. If net income is more than the applicable amount, the customer will get less HB/CTB. For each pound of extra income over the applicable amount, an adjustment of 65 pence will be made in HB and 20 pence will be made in CTB (these are the HB and CTB tapers).</p>
	<p pid="c.1208W.3/15">In addition, anyone with savings, investments and other capital valued at more than &pound;16,000 will not normally qualify for HB or CTB. Capital of &pound;6,000 or less is ignored. Capital of between &pound;6,000 and &pound;16,000 will be deemed to provide a weekly income of &pound;1 for every &pound;250 (or part thereof) if the person is aged less than 60, or &pound;1 for every &pound;500 (or part thereof) if they are 60 or over.</p>

	<p pid="c.1210W.6/1">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 has provided sentencers with a flexible community order for adult offenders that can deliver a tough and effective alternative to custody. In addition, the Government have: (i) invested since March 2008 in seven intensive alternative to custody demonstrator projects to run for three years and provide courts with enhanced community sentencing options; and (ii) announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-13">13 February 2009</phrase> investment of &pound;15.6 million over two years to divert vulnerable women, who are not serious or dangerous offenders, from custody.</p>
	<p pid="c.1210W.6/2">For young offenders, the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) caters for serious and persistent young offenders who might otherwise be sent to prison, and the Intensive Fostering Programme is a specialised, highly intensive alternative to custody for serious and persistent young offenders whose offending behaviour is directly affected by their home surroundings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1210W.6/3">Adult offenders sentenced to Community Payback have, since <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase>, been required to wear distinctive high visibility clothing to ensure that members of the public are aware when Community Payback by offenders is taking place. Intensive Community Payback of a minimum of 18 hours per week over three days is now available in all probation areas for offenders convicted of knife crime offences.</p>

	<p pid="c.1211W.8/1">The policy requiring offenders sentenced to Community Payback to wear distinctive high visibility vests was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December</phrase>. The vests are worn when work is taking place in the potential view of members of the public. The purpose of the vests is to inform people where Community Payback is taking place. Where beneficiaries request in writing that offenders do not wear high visibility vests, exemptions may be granted by the probation area only where convincing evidence is provided on the basis of health and safety concerns, business risk to the beneficiary or suitability of the placement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1211W.8/2">Probation areas are actively, engaging with beneficiaries with a view to increasing the number of work projects in which distinctive clothing is used. Distinctive clothing is also not used if a risk assessment, endorsed by a senior manager, determines that distinctive clothing would potentially place the public, supervisory staff or offenders at risk. During January almost 70 per cent. of the hours worked by offenders on sites within the scope of the policy were undertaken using distinctive high visibility clothing.</p>
	<p pid="c.1211W.8/3">The actual number of offenders who are required to wear high visibility clothing is not monitored and the cost of obtaining this information would be disproportionate. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the total number of offenders who will be required to wear distinctive clothing during the next 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.1214W.2/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has in place a comprehensive framework of interventions addressing drug misuse among offenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.2/2">In prisons, drug treatment funding has increased year on year since 1996-97&mdash;up 1.184 per cent. to its current level of &pound;92 million, with record numbers engaging in treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.2/3">NOMS, in partnership with Department of Health, has made steps to increase the volume and quality of treatment available to prisoners through introduction of the Integrated Drug Treatment System (IDTS).</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.2/4">Implementation of IDTS is progressing well, with all 53 first and second waves of IDTS prisons having an operational service providing all key elements of IDTS clinical services. In 2008-09 a further 38 prison/PCT partnerships have received funding for enhanced clinical drug treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.2/5">The Prison Drug Treatment Strategy Review Group, announced last year, has been established to consider recommendations made by PricewaterhouseCoopers in a 2007 report on prison drug treatment. The group, chaired by Professor Lord Kamlesh Patel, sets out to agree a single set of priorities and compile national guidance around the streamlining of the commissioning, delivery, funding and performance management of drug treatment for offenders. Work on the review started in September 2008 and is expected to take two years to complete.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.2/6">In the community, Drug Rehabilitation Requirements &mdash;or DRRs&mdash;increasingly have been used as part of community sentences. The Government committed to delivering an additional 1,000 DRRs in 2008-09 compared to 2007-08 targets. NOMS is set to meet this commitment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.2/7">Drug System Change pilots are planned to start in April 2009. These two-year pilots aim to test innovative approaches to delivering improved end-to-end management of drug users, including more effective use of pooled funding and individual budgets, with a sharper focus on achieving positive outcomes for drug users, their families and their communities.</p>

We have made a very substantial commitment to IAPT, which will provide patients with a real choice of prescribed anti-depressants or therapy or both. By 2010-11, annual funding for IAPT will rise to &pound;173 million, to train 3,600 extra therapists and treat 900,000 more people in those three years.</p>

The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1240W.9/1">It is not our policy to bring forward Building Schools for the Future (BSF) investment to act as a fiscal stimulus because of the strategic planning that underpins BSF. BSF typically involves the building of entire new schools; so design and planning need care and time. Accelerating the construction would curtail this planning and would thereby jeopardise the quality and transformational nature of the programme. We are however working with Partnerships for Schools to simplify procedures and accelerate delivery, and the procurement process has already been accelerated and costs reduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.1240W.9/2">BSF investment already announced and in the pipeline provides substantial underpinning to the construction industry. It is now building momentum so that by 2011, over 200 revamped or rebuilt schools will be being opened. Over 1,000 BSF schools across 80 local authorities already engaged in the programme. This includes two major school investment projects in Castle Point which are proceeding on schedule for delivery in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.1240W.9/3">In December 2008, we offered local authorities the opportunity to bring forward schools capital allocations from 2010-11 into 2009-10 where they could accelerate projects to provide a fiscal stimulus and give pupils and teachers the benefit of early investment. Essex authority asked for a &pound;13.2 million advance from a possible maximum of &pound;30.2 million. In addition to meeting this request, we have advanced to its schools &pound;10 million of devolved formula capital, so that they can bring investment benefits early for their pupils and staff.</p>

While it is likely that the cost shown excludes VAT, it has not been possible to confirm this without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1247W.8/1">While a family's initial involvement in a Family Intervention Project is voluntary, the projects draw on the range of sanctions that a family or family members may already be facing. These include seeking possession of a family's tenancy, a parenting order, antisocial behaviour order, proceedings to take children into care and juvenile specific orders. Once families have agreed to take part, a contract is drawn up with the family setting out the changes that are expected, support that will be provided and sanctions that may be used if changes are not made. Early evaluation of Family Intervention Projects has shown that they are helping to reduce antisocial behaviour and prevent homelessness.</p>

	<p pid="c.1248W.6/1">The purpose of the review of sex and relationships education (SRE) in schools was not to decide the precise content of schools' SRE programmes. Rather, its purpose was to consider what action is needed to improve SRE delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.6/2">As a result of the review, we have announced our intention to make PSHE statutory and to develop a statutory programme of study, which sets out&mdash;in high-level terms&mdash;a common core of knowledge and skills that all young people should be taught. We will, however, retain the flexibility for individual school governing bodies to determine how material should be presented and what teaching resources schools use to support delivery of their SRE programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.6/3">The Government's response to the SRE review also committed us to develop updated SRE guidance for schools. Both the PSHE programmes of study and new SRE guidance will be subject to a full public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.6/4">To inform its decisions, the SRE steering group commissioned a review of the existing evidence on parents' views on SRE. This evidence&mdash;along with evidence on Ofsted, teachers' and young people's views on SRE, as well as a literature review of international evidence&mdash;were considered by the steering group when deciding what recommendations to make to Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.6/5">We agree with the SRE review steering group that the provision of SRE should be a partnership between parents and schools. Parents should lead on instilling values in their children, but schools have a clear role in giving young people accurate information and helping them to develop the skills they need to make safe and responsible choices.</p>

The Department has also secured unpaid celebrity support, including actors, musicians and performers for some of our campaigns, most notably the National Year of Reading TV filler. Given the wide range of audiences and the challenging nature of some of our priority advertising and publicity messages the use of big voices, advocates and high profile celebrities (where the selected 'voice' has a resonance or a known link to the message or there is a strong argument that the individual or individuals have a high level of influence within a particular audience group) this is one way we would look to deliver and influence to our markets.</p>

	<p pid="c.1251W.5/1">The under-18 conception rate in Rotherham fell by 10.5 per cent. between 1998 (the baseline year for the Teenage Pregnancy strategy) and 2007 (the latest year for which data are available). This is in line with reductions in Yorkshire and Humber region (-10.3 per cent.) and England as a whole (-10.7 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="c.1251W.5/2">The Department of Health's teenage pregnancy national support team (NST) will be visiting Rotherham in April 2009 to offer support designed to accelerate progress towards the local area's under-18 conception rate reduction target, based on lessons learnt from local areas where teenage pregnancy rates have fallen fastest. Support from the NST supplements the routine support and challenge provided by the regional government office.</p>

	<p pid="c.1252W.2/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families does not fund any pathfinder projects that solely focus on parents of children and young people at risk of offending. Since 2006, DCSF has been running the Parenting Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which aims to increase support for the parents of children and young people at risk of negative outcomes. Findings from an independent evaluation of the 18 PEIP pilots by Warwick university (2006-08) found that the programme attracted over 3,500 parents in need of support to manage their children's behavioural difficulties. The evaluation found that the pathfinder was successful in rolling out three evidence-based parenting programmes with high levels of positive gains for parents and their children. The final PEIP evaluation report was published in July 2008 and can be found on the DCSF website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1252W.2/3">By the end of 2008-09, up to &pound;16 million will be spent on the PEIP. Up to a further &pound;54 million will be spent on the programme over 2009-11 as it is extended to every local authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.1254W.8/2">Reports indicate high numbers of civilian casualties, including many women and children. The International Committee of the Red Cross has made efforts to evacuate more than 2,000 wounded by sea but this is currently blocked by the Sri Lankan Government. There remains an acute need for food and medical supplies and for agencies to be allowed access to the area to deliver desperately needed humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1254W.8/3">We are also concerned about 40,000 IDPs who have escaped and are now subject to heavy control in camps in Vavunia, Mannar and Jaffna districts, where access for agencies to deliver supplies and observe screening processes is also heavily restricted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1254W.8/4">As well as exerting pressure on the Sri Lankan Government to improve access, we have allocated an extra &pound;2.5 million of humanitarian assistance to agencies working in Sri Lanka, bringing the total to &pound;5 million this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1255W.2/1">The World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that there are now around 90,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe with over 4,000 deaths. The figures suggest that the number of new cases is starting to decline and better care at health institutions means that the death rate is also coming down. However, with continuing rains and the fragile state of water and health systems, WHO estimates that the total number of cases may well exceed 100,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.2/2">Recent nutritional assessments have highlighted the seriousness of the food situation and the clear need for ongoing aid. The proportion of children under age five who are underweight was estimated at 17 per cent., a rate that has not changed since 2003 while chronic malnutrition has slightly declined by 2 per cent. to 27 per cent. The number of acutely malnourished children is increasing but at 4.8 per cent. remains below internationally recognised emergency levels (10 per cent.) across the country. UN figures suggest that seven million people will have received food aid in Zimbabwe by February 2009. The next harvest will partly alleviate the situation but early projections suggest a similar scale of food insecurity in 2009-10, with a peak before next year's harvest.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.2/3">Economic stabilisation in Zimbabwe will be tough due to the low starting point. GDP has shrunk by 50 per cent. in a decade with all economic sectors suffering from a failure of Government policy. In addition, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has printed the Zimbabwe dollar out of existence so the economy is rapidly dollarising. The IMF and other major financial institutions are currently undertaking missions to Zimbabwe and it is hoped that this will give the international community a clearer picture of the extent of the problem and how best to rectify it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1261W.0/1">The UK sees diversity of sources of imported gas as vital for the EU's security of energy supply. Recent events have underlined the importance to the EU of being supplied with gas from a wide range of countries. The development of a southern corridor, with the aim of bringing gas to the EU from the Caspian region through Turkey or directly across the Black Sea, and in the longer term from the Middle East, is crucial to that end. The UK therefore strongly supports the efforts of the European Commission and fellow EU Member States to develop a southern corridor and this Department is actively engaged in these efforts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/2">The Commission's second Strategic Energy Review (SEER2) of November 2008 affirmed the importance of a southern corridor as one of the EU's highest energy priorities and the importance, to that end, of increasing high level political engagement with potential gas supplier countries, such as Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iraq. The European Commission and current Czech presidency of the EU have made this a priority for 2009 and we are working closely with them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/3">The UK also sees it as important for there to be a diverse selection of routes for gas to enter the EU and for this reason we support the building of new pipelines, under market conditions, to bring gas from established suppliers to the EU such as Norway, Russia and Algeria. In addition to pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), imported by tanker from countries such as Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, Algeria and Nigeria, also plays an important role in diversifying gas supply to the UK and other EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/4">The UK's own security of gas supply has been improved in recent years by new import infrastructure projects such as the BBL (Netherlands-UK) and Langeled (from Norway) pipelines, expansion of the (Belgium-UK) IUK pipeline and the new LNG import terminal at the Isle of Grain.

The process to appoint a new chief executive is ongoing and the NDA hopes to conclude the process in the near future.

	<p pid="c.1262W.9/2">The regulations do not explicitly prescribe any criteria to be applied by the Justifying Authority when considering whether to hold an inquiry or other hearing. Rather, the Justifying Authority will need to consider what is reasonable in the circumstances of a particular case. This approach is entirely sensible given that the justification regulations apply to a very wide range of classes or types of practice and any decision whether to hold an inquiry in a particular case will necessarily depend on the particular circumstances of each individual case. This might for instance include consideration of the extent to which the public have an opportunity to engage in the process.</p>

DECC officials are also engaging with the Commission and other EU member states on proposals to develop solar and wind power in desert regions in North Africa and the Middle East as a means to provide clean energy for these countries and for Europe. We are in contact with the French Government which has been seeking to give impetus to these ideas.</p>
