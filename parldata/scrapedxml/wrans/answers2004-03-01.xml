	<p pid=".617W.3/1">The management agreement will be a five-year commercial contract between CDC Group plc and Actis. The contract will set out the amounts that CDC shall commit to each of Actis's regional and sectoral funds, the minimum service levels that Actis shall provide (for example in terms of overseas office coverage), the management fees to be charged and all the detailed provisions necessary to this complex transaction.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.3/2">Actis's management fees will be determined as a percentage of the capital committed to each of the new funds that it is establishing. The percentages will vary from fund to fund, depending on the management services to be provided and the market norms (where these exist). The total sum of the management fees has been calculated to equate to the anticipated total operating costs of Actis on an approximately break-even basis over the first five years. The CDC Board has taken independent expert advice on the fee levels appropriate in the circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".617W.6/1">Actis will be a limited liability partnership between its management and staff, and the Government. Management and staff will have a 60 per cent. controlling interest, providing independence of ownership and investment decision taking. However, under &quot;clawback&quot; arrangements, over the first 10 years 80 per cent. of any profits and proceeds from a sale of Actis would accrue to the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.6/2">The board of CDC Group plc has an obligation to obtain full value for the sale of any part of CDC. The Independent Committee of the CDC board instructed KPMG to value the new company, as well as the interest to be acquired by management and staff.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.6/3">Taking into account the clawback arrangements and other obligations to Government, KPMG's opinion was that the market value of the 60 per cent. interest in Actis to be sold to management and staff was some &pound;338,000 to &pound;408,000. The Independent Committee recommended that management and staff should pay &pound;373,000, the mid-point figure, which I have accepted. The Shareholder Executive and our financial advisers have endorsed the valuation process and the NAO has been kept informed about this and other aspects of the CDC reorganisation.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.6/4">Actis will have a supervisory board, and the Government will retain the right to veto on the choice of chairman and two non-executive directors. Corporate governance arrangements will be in accordance with best practice for a public limited company. The other details of the organisation of Actis will be set down in the Partnership Agreement.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.5/1">The Government have been actively involved in the Extractive Industries Review (EIR).</p>
	<p pid=".619W.5/2">We support the main conclusion of the review that the World Bank Group should remain involved with the extractive sector. We agree that it is important that social and environmental safeguards are rigorously applied, that human rights are respected, and that efforts are made to improve the governance and transparency of revenue flows from the sector.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.5/3">In light of the World Bank's existing and planned work to deal with these issues, we believe that the EIR's recommendation to end investments in the oil sector by 2008 is premature. We also believe that the primary responsibility to address climate change should rest with developed countries, and that it would not be appropriate to deny the potential economic benefits of extractive industries to developing countries.</p>

	<p pid=".624W.2/1">I have asked officials to work up a pilot scheme to provide a dedicated rest area for lorry drivers away from the motorway network. This is in response to concerns raised by the haulage industry, and others, about the lack of such facilities. These proposals are still at an early stage, although it is envisaged that any such scheme should be a joint initiative involving the Highways Agency, the haulage industry, and the ultimate operator of the facility. Much of the work to date has concentrated on identifying a suitable site and undertaking discussions with relevant local planning authorities, the haulage industry and potential operators.</p>

	<p pid=".626W.8/1">The Driving Standards Agency has a national target for the average annual waiting time for a practical car driving test of six weeks. The current national average waiting time for a test is 10 weeks. The current waiting time for a test at the Jupiter Road test centre in Norwich is 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.8/2">Demand for driving tests rose sharply in 2002&ndash;03, with demand for car tests 20 per cent. higher than forecast. In response, 235 driving examiners were recruited and a further 85 examiners will be recruited by the end of the financial year. The recruitment of another 140 examiners is planned for next financial year. By November 2003, the national average waiting time for a car test was down to 8.7 weeks. However, waiting times rose in December, mainly as a result of the holiday period. In January, bad weather resulted in some tests being cancelled nationally, with certain parts of the country more badly affected than others. Some 120 tests were cancelled at the Jupiter Road centre. Bad weather has resulted in some 30 tests being cancelled in February. Industrial action by driving examiners on 17 February resulted in around 30 tests being cancelled. A continued work to rule is likely to result in more tests being cancelled, further adversely affecting waiting times.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.5/3">Section 170 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 imposes a duty on drivers to stop and report accidents in which personal injury or damage to other vehicles is caused. Failing to summon assistance is not an offence. Failure to comply with any of the requirements of section 170 is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding &pound;5,000, or both.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.5/4">We are currently reviewing road traffic offences involving bad driving and intend to issue a consultation paper on this shortly. Failing to stop and report an accident falls outside the scope of the review (although if the accident were itself caused by bad driving this would be covered). Nevertheless we will of course look carefully at any representations made during the consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".630W.7/2">Employment rights legislation is extensive and contains detailed definitions of those to whom it does and does not apply. To give only two examples, the unfair dismissal legislation generally applies to employees who have completed one year's qualifying service with their employer, but this qualifying period is waived if a dismissal is for one of a number of specified reasons; while the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 and the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 contain provisions (similar to those in other anti-discrimination legislation) which permit differences of treatment on grounds of sexual orientation or religion or belief respectively in certain limited circumstances where a particular sexual orientation or religion or belief is a genuine occupational requirement for the particular post, as allowed by the Employment Directive 2000/78/EC which they transpose. If the hon Member would like to provide more specific information about his concerns, I shall be happy to try to address them.</p>

Users want practical advice and guidance on what they should actually do in respect of employment issues. Acas, who provide advice and guidance to employers and employees, are usually better placed to provide user focussed advice based on factual information supplied by the Department. Acas recently produced a series of booklets summarising individual rights. These can be obtained free of charge from the Acas distribution centre on 08702 429090. I understand that feedback on the publications has been generally very positive.</p>

The 2004 Information Security Breaches Survey will be launched on 27 April at the Infosecurity Europe exhibition. These surveys help to raise awareness of the need for good information security practice and help to inform our own activities. Recent surveys have identified a need for easy to understand security advice for small and medium-sized companies. In response to this need, our most recent initiative was the launch last year of an online source of information on e-security. This resource draws together a range of tools, advice and guidance on core areas of information security and is aimed particularly at smaller businesses. New content is currently being added to this site which can be found at <a href="http://www.ukonlineforbusiness.gov.uk/informationsecurity">www.ukonlineforbusiness.gov.uk/informationsecurity</a>. This will assist businesses in preventing and recovering from information security breaches.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.3/1">The Government believe that there are arguments that it is important for developed and developing countries alike to reduce bureaucracy on cross border trade (trade facilitation), to encourage a climate which facilitates foreign direct investment, to promote economic growth through fair competition and to encourage transparency in the procurement of public goods and services to help reduce corruption and increase good governance. However, we have made clear to our European Community partners that the UK prefers not to insist on including negotiations on investment and competition within the WTO Doha Development Agenda if doing so would jeopardise the DDA as a whole, given the benefits we believe a successful trade round could bring particularly to developing countries.</p>

	<p pid=".637W.2/1">The demountable flood defences form an integral part of the Shrewsbury Flood Alleviation Scheme. The February 2004 floods were the first time such barriers had been used in the UK and were a great success, holding back 1.9 metres of water at the peak. Seventy properties in Frankwell are now protected for the first time in their history. The performance of the barriers was assessed and recorded and operational matters are currently being reviewed by the Environment Agency and Bauer&mdash;IBS.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/2">The Environment Agency and Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council jointly purchased 1400m of Danish Mobile Dam at a cost of &pound;72,000 two years ago. A 90 metre length was used in Shrewsbury during the recent floods (pro rata cost of circa &pound;5,000) and together with associated pumps helped protect approximately 40 properties and kept the main road into Shrewsbury open.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/3">A comprehensive monitoring and survey programme of all the defences was carried out during the floods. Debrief meetings with professional partners are now scheduled to assess the overall response. However it is clear the defences and associated drainage pumping stations worked very successfully and Frankwell remained dry.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/4">The Environment Agency has undertaken a thorough assessment of the remaining flood risk areas of Shrewsbury. Further permanent defences are difficult to justify but the Environment Agency will continue to keep the possibilities for further protection under review.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/5">The Bellwin scheme is only operated in circumstances that are exceptional by local standards and unforeseeable. ODPM have not received any application from the relevant Councils.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/6">General advice about health hazards of flood waters was disseminated via local radio, leaflet circulation and on site manning. No specific signs were deployed.</p>

Decisions regarding which flood and coastal defence projects to promote, their timing and appropriate solutions are matters for the operating authorities the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and (in areas with special drainage needs) internal drainage boards.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.2/2">No central record is kept of estimated savings from flood defences during actual flood events but appraisal of proposed defences includes assessment of estimated costs and benefits to the national economy. The Department estimates that total benefits of approximately &pound;17 billion (in terms of flood damages avoided) were attributable to urban areas (at the time of project approval) for projects approved since 1997 over the lifetime of the defences.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.5/1">In April 2003 Regional Development Agencies took on formal strategic responsibility for promoting tourism within their regions. We are encouraging them to work towards enlarging the overall national market, in a manner consistent with the national marketing strategy. The North West Development Agency (NWDA) will receive Government funding of &pound;713,000 per annum over 2003&ndash;06 towards implementing their tourism strategy for the region. Part of this strategy includes the creation of five new Destination Management Organisations (DMOs). Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board will be the DMO for the Lancashire sub region and its board will represent the county's tourism interests. It is anticipated that the Ribble Valley will play a significant and supporting role in the establishment of the new tourism support structures. A bid is currently with NWDA for funding for the new DMO.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.5/2">In addition, the Ribble Valley is featured in VisitBritain's domestic Outdoor England campaign, launched in Autumn 2003, which encourages tourists to walk along the Ribble Way or cycle round the Lancashire Cycleway Northern Loop. A photograph of Ribble Valley is also featured prominently in the brochure. Details can be found on <a href="http://www.visitengland.com/outdoorengland">www.visitengland.com/outdoorengland</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.3/1">A key component of the Government's criminal justice reform is to transfer responsibility for determining the charge in criminal proceedings from the police to the Crown Prosecution Service. This change is embodied in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The early involvement of prosecutors will ensure that the right charge is put before the court and will help police officers to gather more quickly the evidence the prosecutor will need to prove the case.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.3/2">To fulfil this new role the CPS will make prosecutors available to provide early advice or charging decisions at any time of the day or night. Daytime cover will generally be provided by local prosecutors based in police stations, but this is not feasible or cost-effective throughout the night. The CPS will therefore provide cover during quieter periods by means of a national telephone-based service known as CPS Direct.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.3/3">In September 2003, the CPS Direct pilot was launched to provide out of hours cover for police stations in Humberside, parts of West Yorkshire and the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. The pilot uses sophisticated telephony and IT links to connect police officers to prosecutors and is currently staffed by 13 experienced prosecutors working from their homes. They provide cover from 5 pm to 9 am each weekday and for 24 hours a day at the weekend and on public holidays. As at 22 February 2004, the pilot scheme had provided the police with 6,866 written decisions or advices.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.3/4">Many CPS areas and police forces already have &quot;shadow&quot; arrangements in place ahead of the new statutory provisions and from 1 April 2004, there will be a phased migration to the full statutory scheme. As areas move to the statutory scheme CPS Direct will gradually expand to provide them with out of hours cover. Current forecasts indicate that CPS Direct will eventually require around 80 prosecutors.</p>

Schools in Excellence in Cities whole authority partnerships improved at more than twice the rate of schools elsewhere with average gains of 2.5 percentage points compared to 1.2 percentage points in non-EiC schools.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.2/30">There was also a significant impact on behaviour and attendance&mdash;with standards again improving fastest in EiC schools.</p>

	<p pid=".658W.0/1">The UK non-completion rate has stayed broadly the same at around 17&ndash;18 per cent. since 1991&ndash;92, and in the latest figures published in December 2003 by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) it fell to just over 16 per cent. This represents one of the highest completion rates in the OECD and we are determined to maintain this level of performance.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.0/2">We have asked HEFCE to bear down on non-completion and their national co-ordination team, Action on Access, is working with institutions to improve retention rates and to spread good practice from those institutions with low drop-out rates and good access figures. The &pound;255 million which HEFCE has allocated to institutions in 2003&ndash;04 for widening access and improving retention recognises some of the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds and those who are less well prepared for higher education.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.0/3">Research indicates that the reasons for non-completion are many and varied, but one factor is incompatibility between the student and their course or institution. It is vital that potential HE students have the right information on which to base sound decisions. We are working with the National Union of Students to develop a new guide to help students narrow down their choices and make decisions about what and where to study. The guide will be linked to the new Aimhigher portal that launched in September 2003. A new National Student Survey is planned to take place in January 2005, seeking the views of final year students on their learning experience. HEFCE will also ensure that there is a wide range of published information about the quality and standards of institutions' programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.0/4">Another factor which has been associated with non-completion is financial hardship. In addition to statutory student support, discretionary support is also available as a safety net for vulnerable students. For 2003&ndash;04, Hardship Loans are available for students who are in such serious financial difficulty that their access to, or continued attendance on a course may be at risk. Grants from the Hardship Fund are also available to help students access and remain in higher education.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.0/5">From the academic year 2004&ndash;05, the Hardship Loans budget will be amalgamated with the Hardship Fund into the new non-repayable, Access to Learning Fund. Students who would previously have been eligible for a Hardship Loan should be able to apply for a grant rather than a loan.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.0/6">From 2006&ndash;07, under proposals laid out in the Higher Education Bill, the poorest students entering higher education will receive up to &pound;2,700 in up-front support, and we are raising the levels of maintenance loan to meet the basic living costs of the mid-range student, in response to the recent Student Income and Expenditure Survey.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.0/7">Additionally, institutions will, under the terms of access agreements, be required to provide further financial help to poorer students in the form of bursaries.</p>

	<p pid=".659W.0/2">The information requested is not available centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.0/3">Borrowers enter repayment status in the April following graduation or otherwise leaving their course. There were 1,409,000 borrowers in the United Kingdom with income contingent student loan accounts at the end of the financial year 2002&ndash;03 of whom approximately 298,000 had accounts in repayment status. Borrowers can have accounts both in repayment status and not in repayment status if, for example, they have attended a second course of higher education.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.0/4">No repayments are due from borrowers who are not in repayment status, although just under 15,000 borrowers made early repayments voluntarily in 2002&ndash;03. No repayments are deducted from income-contingent borrowers in repayment status whose income falls below &pound;10,000 per annum. Repayments of income-contingent loans are, apart from a few exceptions, collected through the tax system. Most repayments are notified to the Student Loans Company more than one year after the end of the tax year, after which time has to be allowed for reconciliation with their records. Therefore the data on the number of borrowers with income-contingent loans where repayments are not being deducted because the borrower's income is below the repayment threshold, or for some other reason, are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid=".660W.7/1">As lead nation for counter-narcotics activity in Afghanistan, the UK supports the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, which was adopted by President Karzai in May 2003. The strategy proposes activities in four key areas: improved drugs law enforcement; alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers; capacity building for Afghan drugs institutions; and public awareness campaigns/treatment programmes to help reduce demand. The UK has committed &pound;70 million over three years and additional personnel for the British Embassy in Kabul to drive forward implementation of the strategy.</p>

The conference demonstrated the firm resolve of the Afghan Government and the international community to tackle the drugs problem in Afghanistan. It agreed action plans for future work in each of the key areas.</p>

	<p pid=".666W.2/1">We support the Sri Lankan peace process politically and practically and welcome the progress made since February 2002 when the ceasefire came into effect. The parliamentary election in Sri Lanka on 2 April comes at a crucial moment for the peace process. We urge all Sri Lanka's political leaders to ensure that their, and their supporters', actions and rhetoric during the election campaign do nothing to undermine the important gains made in the peace process or to make it more difficult to resume peace process talks after the election. It is also essential that the election is free of intimidation, fair and non-violent throughout Sri Lanka. We urge all political parties and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to commit themselves to supporting the early resumption of peace negotiations after the election so that they can move forward together in building a peaceful and prosperous country. We are working closely with international partners to reinforce these messages.</p>

Phase 2, or specialist training, is special to arm training to prepare soldiers for their first appointment in the Field Army.

	<p pid=".672W.14/1">It is not our practice or that of previous Governments to place copies of the reports from Service Board of Inquiry in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.14/2">A Service Board of Inquiry is an internal fact finding investigation undertaken by the Services for their own use, into the circumstances surrounding a particular accident or incident. There is a principle of confidentiality associated with BOI proceedings, which is intended to encourage the provision of forthright evidence. Accordingly, external distribution of BOI reports is usually limited to the next of kin of service personnel killed in in-service accidents, HM Coroners to assist in their preparations for Inquests, and other bodies with statutory duties to investigate incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.14/3">We will, when the investigation by the RN Flight Safety and Accident Investigation Centre is complete, place copies of the Military Aircraft Accident Summary in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.14/4">I shall place information on the implementation of the Board of Inquiry's recommendations in the Library of the House shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.8/1">The original project was a stand alone maternity hospital on the Royal Group of Hospitals site. Since the original announcement, in order to ensure the delivery of the best possible facilities, work has been undertaken to explore opportunities for the development of an integrated mother and child hospital with a single entrance. The development of this integrated model has resulted in an extension of the initial planning time required.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.8/2">The new regional maternity hospital remains to be completed by 2010. The delay in initiating construction is due to this additional planning, including the need for a complex series of construction, decant, and demolition projects across the entire strategic redevelopment programme which is designed to ensure that disruption to services across the Trust is kept to a minimum.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.3/3">The Relatives' Reference Group was established by the then Minister in March 2001 at the same time as the Human Organs Inquiry. Its Terms of Reference were reviewed in July 2002 and its life extended for two years to assist with the implementation of the recommendations of the Human Organs Inquiry. In order to ensure that this role, which includes support for relatives who use the Enquiry Line, is maintained, it is anticipated that the work of the Group will also conclude at the end of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.6/1">In May 2003 the Department's Chief Medical Officer issued guidance to all hospitals and universities on the use of human organs and tissue, which gave specific instructions about record keeping and archives. It has since been brought to the attention of the Department that the details of tissue blocks and slides relating to 310 cases at Queen's University and the Royal Hospitals had not been included on their main reference lists, although their existence had been disclosed. These lists are used to advise relatives whether any material has been retained from post mortem examinations.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.6/2">This matter has been investigated very thoroughly and it is clear that no whole organs are involved and that no new blocks and slides have come to light that were not known about before. The problem was due to administrative error rather than any attempt to conceal information.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.6/3">Details of the 310 cases have been checked against all inquiries received by both the institutions involved and the departmental telephone inquiry line. In only two cases did blocks and slides relate to families that had previously made inquiries. Both families have been advised of the additional information. The error is deeply regretted and both institutions have apologised to the families concerned for any distress caused.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.6/4">New procedures have been, and continue to be, developed and the Human Tissue Bill now before Parliament includes a rigorous system of inspection and regulation. It is considered that this is an isolated episode which should not recur, but the Department has written to all hospital trusts and universities to draw their attention to this matter.</p>

	<p pid=".696W.6/1">The Government are committed to tackling age discrimination in employment, extending opportunities for older workers and to introducing age discrimination legislation in 2006. The Government are assessing the responses to the consultation last year on proposals for the age legislation and will consult from this spring on draft age regulations covering employment and vocational training. The legislation will be in place, but not implemented, by the end of 2004, to give employers and individuals about two years to prepare before the legislation comes into force on 1 October 2006. Over the coming year, we will prepare further practical guidance for employers on adopting age positive practices and flexible approaches to retirement.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.6/2">In the meantime our Age Positive campaign is encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practices now. Through Age Positive, we are promoting the business benefits of an age diverse workforce by encouraging employers to adopt the voluntary Code of Practice: 'Age' Diversity at Work, A Practical Guide For Business, which was first developed in 1998 and updated in 2002. Over 750,000 copies of the Age Positive Code have been issued to employers and individuals and it is available on the Age Positive website <a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk">www.agepositive.gov.uk</a>, which has 75,000 visits per month.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.6/3">The Age Positive campaign is widely promoted to employers and individuals through advertising, the website and press features in national, local and specialist publications and at exhibitions and workshops for employers. Age Positive awards help to further publicise the achievements of businesses and individuals who conquer age prejudice.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.6/4">Age Positive also works closely with organisations such the Federation of Small Businesses, Employers Forum on Age, Institute of Directors, TUC, CBI and Age Concern.</p>

The subsequent BSACI handbook, &quot;National Health Service Allergy Clinics&quot;, published in 2001, lists 86 such clinics.

These are based in London (Guy's hospital, Royal Brompton hospital and St. Mary's hospital), Cambridge, Southampton and Leicester. These centres have expertise in all types of allergic disease, including the complex problems, and provide a comprehensive high-quality allergy service with a multidisciplinary approach.</p>

	<p pid=".709W.2/1">There are four main strands to the efforts nationally to reduce avoidable winter deaths:</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/2" class="indent">Immunisation of older people against influenza and pneumococcal disease</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/3" class="indent">Increasing awareness among older people of the risks of cold weather, and the benefits and other help available to keep homes warm</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/4" class="indent">The national Fuel Poverty Strategy</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/5" class="indent">Improving our ability to link the forecasting of cold weather with measures designed to prevent people from becoming ill, as well as to improve the ability of the health service to plan for surges in demand, especially for hospital admission.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/6">A target for flu vaccination in those aged 65 and over has been set since the change in policy in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/7">In 2000&ndash;01 the target was 60 per cent., in 2001&ndash;02 65 per cent, and in 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 70 per cent. Uptake achieved has been 65 per cent., 68 per cent., 69 per cent, and 71 per cent, respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/8">This year's result is an excellent achievement and exceeds our target of 70 per cent, set at the start of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/9">The number of people aged 65 and over receiving their flu immunisation this year was 5,781,440&mdash;over 295,000 more people than last year.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/10">The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended extending pneumococcal immunisation to all aged 65 years and over.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/11">The new policy is to offer immunisation with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to all people aged 65 years and over. However, we are introducing the policy in stages. To start with, people aged 80 and over, who are most at risk from pneumococcal disease, will be offered the vaccine in 2003&ndash;04. They will be followed by all those aged 75 and over in 2004&ndash;05. By 2005&ndash;06 all those aged 65 and over should routinely be offered pneumococcal vaccine.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/12">People under these ages who are at higher risk from pneumococcal disease are already recommended to receive the vaccine. This includes people who have a heart condition, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, a weakened immune system due to disease or treatment, a damaged spleen or no spleen.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/13">We will be collecting data on the number of people receiving their pneumococcal vaccination, but this will not be available until after April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/14">A Keep Warm, Keep Well campaign operates in England each winter. This provides free booklets for the public and special literature for health professionals; a telephone helpline, and advice on how those most in need may apply for grants (such as the Warm Front grant&mdash;a scheme providing grant for comprehensive packages of insulation and heating improvements for those on low incomes most vulnerable to cold-related ill health); advice on benefit payments; as well as the health benefits of keeping warm.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/15">The relationship between indoor temperatures and ill health is complex, with other factors such as outside exposure and behavioural factors involved. However, the likelihood of ill health is increased by cold damp homes. Illnesses such as influenza, heart disease and strokes are all exacerbated by the cold and older people are especially vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/16">The Department of Health is working together with other Government Departments to reduce the number of households in fuel poverty. Good progress has already been made with the number of fuel poor households falling from approximately 5.5 million in 1996 to about 3 million in 2001 with predictions of a further reduction of 0.5 million for 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/17">Health professionals within the National Health Service have been made fully aware of fuel poverty as a potential health determinant and widely encouraged to identify and advise patients for whom cold, damp home conditions might be a health risk.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/18">At the local level, fuel poverty is on the agenda of many health professionals in delivering fuel poverty initiatives and fuel poverty has been identified as a key priority within the Health Inequalities Programme for Action.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/19">Her Majesty's Treasury funding was made available up to April 2003 to allow some exploratory work, led by the Met Office, to develop models to forecast workload for primary and secondary care, built in part on weather forecasting. The evaluation of this exploratory work was inconclusive. Preliminary discussions are currently underway between the NHS, the Department and the Met Office to determine next steps, and in particular whether it is possible to</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/20" class="indent">refine the approaches taken to preventative interventions, targeted in time and place so as to gain maximum benefit for patients before they fall ill, and</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/21" class="indent">manage NHS workload more proactively than at present, so that services, including hospitals, are better placed to manage surges in demand, particularly for hospital admission.</p>

Any gift or promise of a gift of money, or any other 'Valuable consideration', to an elector is regarded under electoral legislation as a bribe even if the gift is made simply to encourage the elector to vote or refrain from voting. This is a basic feature of any democratic electoral system which purports to be open and fair to all electors. Paying electors or offering gifts to turn out to vote would be likely to increase the likelihood of electoral abuse and fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".715W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 26 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".715W.5/2">The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduces offences covering trafficking for sexual exploitation, and will come into force in May 2004. No resources are available explicitly to promote best practice in service provision for child victims of trafficking. However, the Home Office has published a best practice toolkit for those who deal with illegal immigrants and the victims of trafficking. The toolkit will help those who come into contact with victims of child trafficking to identify and deal with them appropriately. The Immigration Service is also starting specialist training for around 600 operational members of staff nation-wide, which will have a positive impact on their ability to identify and assist trafficked children.</p>

	<p pid=".719W.0/1">Assessing the reliability of evidence in whatever form is a matter for the courts. However, the Government are concerned that the public should have full confidence in the integrity of all evidence, including electronic evidence, and are determined to ensure that appropriate guidance and procedures are in place to support it. In March 2002, the Police Scientific Development Branch of the Home Office, in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), published the guidance document, Digital Imaging Procedure. This is now in use across the criminal justice system in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.0/2">The document sets out detailed guidance for operational, administrative, and judicial staff on the procedures that should be followed to ensure that digitally captured images can be accepted as evidence throughout the Criminal Justice System. Among other matters, the document includes guidance for audit trails to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the evidence, and how to protect the 'Master' image. The procedure does not rely on 'electronic' protection but neither does it preclude its use: as the guidance points out, there are several methods for 'electronically' authenticating an image file.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.0/3">However, in the case of digital images captured by unattended roadside traffic enforcement cameras, the use of electronic protection is made mandatory by non-statutory guidance in the form of a document issued by the Police Scientific Development Branch entitled &quot;The Speedmeter Handbook&quot;. This is because the image is the only evidence of an offence having taken place. The method of protection used is one that is based on techniques used to secure banking transactions.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.0/4">ACPO have also produced a good practice guide on electronic evidence to provide advice and principles for police forces in dealing with all electronic evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".722W.3/2">The Prison Service needs to be able to respond to and address a range of factors which contribute to offending behaviour, according to individual need. It therefore has no plans to introduce a compulsion for all prisoners to take part in learning activities. However, the majority of offenders have very poor skills which are a serious obstacle to their rehabilitation and chances of employment on release. Through increased investment, increased partnership working, and the appointment of new Heads of Learning and Skills across the prison estate, we are working towards a new service which will embed learning and skills across the range of prison activities, drive up quality and enhance continuity between opportunities in custodial and community settings.</p>

	<p pid=".723W.9/1">We want the most cost effective custodial and community sentences possible, no matter who delivers them. We also want to encourage partnerships between public and private sector providers and the voluntary and community sectors which can harness their respective strengths.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.9/2">An implementation team has been established to consider the specific details of how this will be realised. We are also seeking views on how to improve contestability and value for money within the new structure of the National Offender Management Service.</p>

	<p pid=".729W.2/1">Housing is the major resettlement priority for women leaving prison and considerable investment has been made in housing advice projects through the custody to work programme, Prison Service Plus and other funding streams. Much of the investment has gone into local prisons so that housing needs can be assessed and acted on when women first enter custody as well as prior to their release. In addition, the Home Office is leading cross-Government work on the Women's Offending Reduction Programme to address the complex criminogenic factors that affect women's offending. The Correctional Services are also jointly contributing to the development of a National Accommodation Strategy for all offenders as part of a wider rehabilitation strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".729W.5/1">The prison population contains a substantial number of people who have experienced negative life events, all of which are identified as significant risk factors for suicide and self-harm. These include family background and relationship problems, social disadvantage or isolation, previous sexual or physical abuse, and mental health problems. Self-harming and suicidal behaviour often pre-date custody, and may have started early in life. Studies show that 27 per cent. of men and 44 per cent. of women on remand report having attempted suicide in their lifetime; and that 90 per cent. of all prisoners have shown evidence of at least one of the following: personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, and alcohol misuse and drug dependence.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.5/2">Intervention strategies have been introduced for people who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice, and guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been circulated to establishments. A video is also being produced.</p>

These include Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), an innovative programme developed in the USA for women diagnosed with 'borderline personality disorder' (BPD) who also self-harm or who are suicidal. The Prison Service has introduced DBT to the women's estate, starting with an initial development programme at three sites: Durham, Bullwood Hall and Holloway.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.5/5" class="italic">(b) Counselling provision:</p>
	<p pid=".729W.5/6">A number of prison establishments have introduced counselling for vulnerable prisoners. At both Bullwood Hall and Holloway prisons, all prisoners who have been identified as at risk of suicide/self-harm are offered individual crisis counselling. If appropriate, they are also referred to other agencies such as the general counselling service or CRUSE, a charity working with people who are suffering from bereavement, or the prison's art therapist, Counselling, Assessment, Referral and Throughcare (CARAT) services or Chaplaincy.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.5/7" class="italic">(c) Support provision:</p>
	<p pid=".729W.5/8">The F2052SH self-harm warning system identifies and reviews the particular needs of prisoners experiencing periods of distress or crisis. The pilot of a replacement system began in January 2004 at five establishments. It aims to build on the successful aspects of the existing system, but build in a greater focus on care with teams of specially trained staff assessing the level of risk that at-risk prisoners present.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.5/9">Further avenues of support available across the prison estate include help with substance misuse issues, the input of healthcare professionals and/or mental health in-reach teams, helping maintain contact with family and friends, and the encouragement of self-help, for example, through education, IT or sport. There are numerous agencies and support mechanisms available to prisoners identified as at-risk, including Samaritans.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.5/10">Several prisons have set up support groups for prisoners who self-harm, or are at risk of self-harming. These are usually run by staff such as Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators or Occupational Therapists. These may either be informal 'drop-in' groups, that prisoners can choose to attend for as many or few sessions as they wish, or groups which run for a specific period of time with the same set of participants.</p>

Detoxification for alcohol is available on reception in all local and remand prisons; some prisons run alcohol awareness courses; Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) run services in around 50 per cent. of prisons and more intensive courses are run in nine prisons. Some offending behaviour programmes address the underlying criminogenic factors, which occur in alcohol related violent crime. Further expansion of interventions will depend on the availability of additional resources. There are no plans to introduce a target for alcohol reduction.</p>

A three-year strategy to develop policies and practices to prevent prisoner suicide and manage self-harm started in April 2001. This is currently under review, taking into account learning from the various projects initiated over the last three years, emerging research findings and a wide consultation process. The main principles of the strategy apply across all types of prisons and to all prisoners, regardless of nationality.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/18">All immigration removal centres are required to comply with an Operating Standard on suicide and self-harm prevention, and a range of measures is in place to address the issue. These measures include: suicide awareness and emergency first aid training for staff, active Suicide Prevention Committees operating in all centres, and systems for paying particular attention to detainees on their first night in detention or immediately prior to their removal.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.2/19">The police have also undertaken a number of initiatives to prevent self-inflicted deaths in their custody. These include: custody officer training in risk assessment and management, improvements in police practice in relation to the mentally ill, an increase in the range of custody healthcare professionals, improvements in procedures to assess and document specific risks presented by those coming into custody, the use of closed circuit television in cells, and the use in some forces of life signs monitoring systems.</p>

	<p pid=".736W.3/1">Section 95 Criminal Justice Act 1991 requires the Home Office to publish statistics annually to help those involved in the administration of justice avoid discrimination against any persons on the grounds of race or sex or any improper grounds. The first edition of what has become a series of publications on Race and the Criminal Justice System was published in 1992 including demographic data and prison statistics.</p>
	<p pid=".736W.3/2">The Home Office is monitoring sentences handed down by the Crown court in terms of the ethnicity of the person prosecuted. A similar programme of monitoring is being developed for magistrates courts. This data will be broken down into the 42 Local Criminal Justice areas (including London) and will also be available for England and Wales as a whole. It has already been published for a number of areas and will be published for other areas once it is of sufficient quality to be statistically acceptable as showing an accurate picture.</p>
	<p pid=".736W.3/3">The &quot;Ethnic Minorities in the Criminal Courts: Perceptions of Fairness and Equality of Treatment&quot; study published by the Department of Constitutional Affairs (Hood, Shute and Seemungal 2003) concludes that although perceptions have improved since previous studies, more work is needed to eliminate perceived discrimination. The report reveals that although there is no hard research to prove this one way or another, around two thirds of the complaints about racial bias concerned perceived inequitable sentencing, with Black and Minority Ethnic defendants believing they had received a harsher sentence than would have been handed down to a similarly placed white defendant&mdash;CJS professionals e.g. lawyers had a stronger perception still. This is likely to be a contributory factor to low BME confidence in respecting the rights of defendants.</p>
	<p pid=".736W.3/4">The CJS Race Unit will now work to establish whether there is any quantitative evidence of different sentencing between people in different BME and white populations while controlling for type of offence and other contributing or mitigating factors. If there is such evidence the Unit will consider actions to counter it, if not they will address the perception that there is differential sentencing. The Unit envisages awarding the research contract in April 2004. First results are then expected Spring 2005 with completion Spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".737W.5/2">Any form of violence is totally unacceptable and must be dealt with accordingly. I fully understand the detrimental and damaging effect that crime against business has on the community.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.5/3">My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary attended the &quot;National Respect for Shop Workers Day&quot; organised by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers' (USDAW) in September. The key aims were to demonstrate to the public that the Government, the retail industry and the retail trade union are campaigning together to tackle crime. The Government welcome the work USDAW has undertaken through its Freedom From Fear campaign to raise awareness of violence against shopworkers. The Government are tackling this issue, for example by:</p>
	<p pid=".737W.5/4" class="indent">Providing funding for training seminars for small retailers as part of the 15 million Small Retailers in Deprived Areas Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.5/5" class="indent">Holding a Business Crime forum for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SME's) which was well represented by retailers.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.5/6" class="indent">Encouraging employers to manage work-related violence in the same way as any health and safety issue. The Health and Safety Executive has published general guidance to help employers tackle work-related violence, including specific guidance for the retail sector. This can be accessed via their website <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk">www.hse.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.5/7">Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) can also be used to protect shopworkers from violence. The orders can prohibit persons entering specified areas such as shopping centres, or prohibit persons engaging in specified anti-social acts eg shoplifting, verbally abusing shopworkers, writing graffiti on a shop, or prohibit persons approaching specified persons. Breach of an ABSO is a criminal offence attracting a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.5/8">The number of people experiencing violence at work has actually fallen by 27 per cent. since 1999 according to the most recent British Crime Survey published on 27 January 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".739W.5/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/2" class="italic">Community Cohesion Pathfinders (CCPs)</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/3">The Community Cohesion Pathfinder areas (CCPs) are a joint initiative between the Home Office and the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/4">They are intended to pioneer programmes to break down barriers between the different community groups in given geographical areas. These groups may be arranged along social, ethnic, religious or even work-related lines.</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/5">CCPs are managed by the Home Office's Community Cohesion Unit. The programme is under way in the following 14 areas:</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/6" class="indent">1. Bury metropolitan borough council</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/7" class="indent">2. Charnwood borough council</p>

	<p pid=".739W.5/19" class="indent">14. West London Alliance (London boroughs of Brent, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Harrow, Hillingdon and Hounslow).</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/20">CCP funding runs from February 2003 to September 2004. The first 13 of the above areas receive &pound;285,000 over this 17-month period. The West London Alliance receives &pound;570,000, which reflects its coverage of a much larger area covered than any of the other Pathfinders.</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/21" class="italic">Community Chest (CC)</p>
	<p pid=".739W.5/22">Community Chest (CC) grants are intended to support projects that encourage greater community involvement in local activities within the 88 neighbourhood renewal areas of England. Locally appointed intermediary VCS bodies promote and deliver the programme at a local level.</p>

	<p pid=".745W.5/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is keen to improve fire safety by all reasonable means and sprinklers are part of a package of measures that can be used in buildings. Other measures include the installation of fire alarm and fire detection systems and the provision of compartmentation that restricts the spread of fire within buildings by means of sub-dividing it into compartments, separated from one another by walls and/or floors of fire resisting construction.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.5/2">In the case of places of assembly, which would include public leisure facilities, the guidance document that supports the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations, known as Approved Document B, already limits the size of fire compartments to a floor area no larger than 2,000 square metres in multi-storey buildings. These compartments can be increased to 4,000 square metres where sprinklers are provided.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.5/3">However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently commenced a review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations and we will be considering the role that sprinklers can play in all buildings, including places of assembly, and deciding whether the current thresholds in the guidance should be amended or indeed new ones introduced.</p>
