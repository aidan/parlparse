	<p pid="a.176W.5/1">UK fisheries laboratories send observers to sea to record the quantity of fish discarded and retained by fishing vessels. This sampling is intended to provide estimates of discards of the main commercial species, but at present is not representative of all UK fisheries. It is also only possible to sample a proportion of the vessels participating in any fishery. As a consequence, estimates of total discards are subject to uncertainty and the resolution of the data does not usually allow us to differentiate between the specific reasons for discards (e.g. over-quota, under legal minimum landing size or high-graded).</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.5/2">The analysis of 2009 discards data is not yet complete. We are therefore unable to provide an estimate of how many fish were discarded in pursuit of EU quotas in 2009. However, in 2008 around 440,000 tonnes of quota stocks were landed by UK vessels. These were caught in a wide range of different areas and fisheries, many of which were not sampled by scientific observers. Estimates of discards for 2008 are available for the following fisheries:</p>

	<p pid="a.182W.2/2"><i> </i>The Government provide a comprehensive programme of support for ex-service personnel. This includes: an excellent resettlement package for service personnel returning to civilian life; high quality pension and compensation schemes; measures to meet veterans' health and welfare needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.182W.2/3">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has recently put in place a number of initiatives to improve the support given to veterans, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.182W.2/4" class="indent">The launch of a national point of contact to ensure that service personnel, families and veterans are able to access the help and support available from the MOD, from statutory providers and from the voluntary and charitable sector facilitating the delivery of services across all sectors by raising awareness of entitlement at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.182W.2/5" class="indent">Working with the Department for Communities and Local Government and the devolved Administrations to improve the access of early service leavers (ie those that have served less than four years) to social housing and temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.182W.2/6" class="indent">Working with a range of partners across Government, the Prison Service, the devolved Administrations, and with voluntary and charitable sector organisations to better serve veterans in prison. The Ex-Service Offenders Working Group promotes the support available to veterans both before and after their release. MOD will continue to work with these agencies to help reduce the risk of re-offending amongst the ex-service community.</p>
	<p pid="a.182W.2/7" class="indent">Changes to the legislation governing the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) following the review led by Admiral the Lord Boyce and the setting up of an independent medical expert body to advise on compensation on particular illnesses and injuries are being implemented. All legislative changes will take place by February 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.182W.2/8" class="indent">The Prime Minister has asked Dr Andrew Murrison MP to conduct an independent study into the provision of MOD and NHS support and services to the armed forces and ex-service personnel and to make recommendations particularly in the area of mental health.</p>

	<p pid="a.184W.12/1">The Department for Transport has consulted on options for increasing the up-take of eco-driving training for large goods vehicle and passenger carrying vehicle drivers. One of the options was to make eco-driver training a mandatory part of the driver certificate of professional competence. The two other options were: (i) to keep the voluntary nature of eco-driving training; and (ii) to keep it voluntary and also increase promotion of the benefits of the training. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-30">30 June 2010</phrase> and the Government will publish their response following a full analysis of the consultation responses.</p>
	<p pid="a.184W.12/2">The definition of eco-driving training used in the consultation document is training that includes some or all of the following elements: how to improve aerodynamic performance; how to drive at efficient speeds; fuel efficiency and choice of gear; best practice for acceleration and braking; and anticipation of traffic and driving conditions. This definition was also subject to consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.184W.12/3">The Department's preliminary analysis showed that if 90% of large goods vehicle drivers were eco-driving trained and continued to drive in that manner, around 3 million tonnes of CO2 and &#163;300 million in fuel costs could be saved by the industry over a five year period. An initial impact assessment for each of the options was published with the consultation document and views invited. A further full assessment of the effectiveness of the option chosen and its cost to Government will be undertaken once the analysis of responses is complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.185W.5/2">In June this year the Government decided to maintain the current level of expenditure on rail and water freight operating grants for 2010-11 and 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="a.185W.8/1">Given its usage, age and strategic importance, there will always be a need to undertake routine and emergency works on the M1 to keep the motorway in a safe and serviceable condition. Some resurfacing/patching will be carried out over the next two years. These works will be carried out in the majority of cases overnight to keep disruption to a minimum, and in most cases delays will be minimal.</p>

	<p pid="a.185W.8/5">There may also be some additional works required on sections of the M1 motorway this year to finalise and complete technology works between M1 J6a to 10 and M1 J25 to 28. Works will be carried out overnight to keep the disruption to the travelling public to a minimum.</p>
	<p pid="a.185W.8/6">The M1 has recently been widened to four lanes in both directions from junctions 25 to 28. The lanes opened to traffic in May this year completing ahead of the programme schedule.</p>

	<p pid="a.187W.2/1">A comprehensive package of measures is in place making vehicle excise duty convenient to pay but difficult to evade. Registered keepers are sent renewal reminders to alert them that the vehicle excise duty is due and offering a variety of ways to license their vehicle. Online and telephone services are used by a large number of customers together with the traditional paper service at the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.2/2">Those who fail to license their vehicles are subject to proportionate enforcement measures ranging from automated penalties from the vehicle record, through to direct enforcement action such as the wheel clamping, impounding and, ultimately, disposal of the unlicensed vehicle. The latest national statistics on vehicle excise duty evasion shows that this package of measures has been successful and 99.4% of all revenue payable in 2009 was collected.</p>

There is no evidence that a limit is required for safety reasons. A legal limit would be difficult to enforce and might require all rail passengers to book in advance or risk not being allowed to travel. This would be very unpopular with many rail users and probably unworkable on commuter sections of the railway, where most crowding occurs.</p>

	<p pid="a.189W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-24">24 June</phrase> I wrote to all local authorities in England and Wales, including Transport for London, setting out the Government's position on speed cameras. My letter confirms that central Government will no longer fund new fixed speed cameras and encourage authorities to consider the full range of local road safety interventions, including educational and engineering solutions. I want to work with local authorities and the police on ways of making local partners accountable to local voters for the decisions they take on the location of cameras and the scale of camera operations, and for the financial consequences of those decisions. A copy of the letter has been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.192W.0/1">The transitionary Protocol concerning the composition of the European Parliament is a technical change to the Treaty relating to numbers of MEPs. It allows 18 extra MEPs provided for by the Lisbon Treaty to take their seats now rather than in 2014. The UK receives an extra MEP as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.0/2">The Protocol does not determine how, or from which UK European parliamentary electoral region, the UK's additional MEP should be elected; rather that the MEP should be elected using one of the methods set out in the Protocol. Therefore, no prior consultation of the Electoral Commission was needed. Details of the process to be undertaken to elect the UK's extra MEP will be announced in due course, and the Electoral Commission will be consulted fully at the appropriate time, as required by the relevant legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.192W.3/2">The very nature of forced marriage means that cases often go unreported. The statistics we do have are based on the work of the Forced Marriage Unit. In calendar year 2009 the Unit dealt with 1,682 reports of possible forced marriage and, as of the end of June, has dealt with 893 in 2010. This includes cases in the UK and involving British nationals overseas. It is likely that there are many more cases that are not drawn to the Unit's attention and we will continue to raise awareness of the help available.</p>

This will include consideration of whether civil partnerships should be allowed to include religious readings, music and symbols.

	<p pid="a.204W.5/1">The unprecedented number of health claims applications (more than 4,000) from businesses has meant that the timetable for European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) completing its assessments and the development of the European community list (<phrase class="date" code="2010-01-31">31 January 2010</phrase>) has slipped.</p>
	<p pid="a.204W.5/2">EFSA has decided to issue its opinions in batches, and has rejected requests from the Commission and others to limit publication to a single list: the first batch was published in October 2009 and EFSA predicts that the final batch will be published in 2012. Several European Commissioners past and present have made clear that the Commission will authorise claims in batches, to give clarity to the market and ensure consumer protection, and that it is not willing to change its position. We have not therefore made representations to the European Commission on this matter but Food Standards Agency (FSA) officials are working to ensure that claims are authorised appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.204W.5/3">The FSA compiled a Regulatory Impact Assessment on the nutrition and health claims regulation in 2007. It has not carried out a formal assessment of whether any costs to business will result from changes to the planned timetable for assessing health claim applications however officials are willing to work closely with businesses and with enforcement bodies to minimise any negative impact on businesses.</p>

An internal project is being carried out on International Cancer Benchmarking and the National Cancer Director, Professor Mike Richards, has undertaken a study of international variations in drug usage, and the causes for any such variation.

	<p pid="a.211W.0/6">A study published by the Health Protection Agency, Imperial College London and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine following the end of the second epidemic wave of influenza A (H1N1) has estimated that the influenza A (H1N1) vaccination programme may have prevented between about 230,000 and 710,000 cases and between 26 and 67 deaths from influenza A (H1N1) in England (there are no similar estimates for the United Kingdom). These estimates are based upon a number of assumptions about the vaccination programme and the performance of the vaccine, including that the uptake of vaccine in clinical risk groups would reach 70%, by early November 2009. In fact, the uptake of vaccine in the clinical risk groups was about 30 per cent, by late December 2009. Therefore, the number of cases and deaths prevented may be of a lower range than these estimates. A published Canadian study of the influenza A (H1N1) vaccination programme in Ontario suggested that vaccinating 30% of the population of that province would prevent about 35 deaths.</p>

	<p pid="a.216W.8/1">Planning is a devolved matter, so this answer relates only to England. In the coalition agreement we undertook to maintain the green belt. One major step has already been taken-we have just revoked regional strategies, thus removing regional housing targets and the pressure they created to release green belt land for development. That means the protection of particular green belts is in the hands of local communities. Local planning authorities-including those around Coventry- are free to exercise the powers to protect green belt currently set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, &quot;Green Belts&quot;, including the presumption against inappropriate development on green belt land.</p>

They have not been subject to any recent assessment by the Department for Transport. A recent assessment of the impact of Regulation 1370/2007 on bus and rail services was carried out by the Department in the context of a questionnaire issued to member states in March this year on behalf of the European Commission, asking for information on the implementation of the regulation.

The West of England local authorities published a Gypsy and Traveller accommodation assessment in October 2007. If the West of England local authorities decide to review the levels of provision in their area the 2007 assessment will form a good starting point.

The blueprint sets out HMCS's strategic objective for enforcement which is for a cheaper, faster and more proportionate system that primarily focuses on 'first time' compliance while continuing to apply the principles of rigorous enforcement to the hard core of defaulters.

	<p pid="a.234W.5/1">The principal risk assessment tool used across the probation service and prison service is the Offender Assessment System (OASys). OASys includes two predictors of reoffending, the OASys General reoffending Predictor (OGP) and the OASys Violence Predictor (OVP), and a separate risk of serious harm component focusing upon the likelihood of life-threatening and/or traumatic events. For those offenders who are not assessed through OASys, the Offender Group Reconviction Scale version 3 (OGRS 3) provides a prediction of proven reoffending within one and two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.234W.5/2">Other tools are used for particular groups of offenders. The Spousal Abuse Risk Assessment (SARA) is frequently used with those convicted of domestic violence. Risk Matrix 2000 (RM2000) is used across both prison and probation services to estimate likelihood of sexual and violent reoffending risk among men with a history of sexual offending; this is a static risk scale which informs decisions about appropriate intensity of treatment and management. Also for sex offenders undergoing treatment programmes, the Structured Assessment of Risk and Need (SARN) is used to guide treatment, report on the impact of treatment and determine future supervision needs. For long-term, violent, prisoners, tools such as the Historical Clinical and Risk management 20 (HCR-20), Violence Risk Scale (VRS), and Psychopathy Check List Revised (PCL-R) may also be used in order to guide risk assessment and treatment approaches.</p>

In terms of community sentences, the proportion of offenders commencing a court order who committed a re-offence in 2008 was 36.1%. Differences between the offenders that receive different sentences mean comparisons with other forms of disposal cannot be made using these raw figures. However, the Department is currently working on a more sophisticated analysis of re-offending rates to control for differences between those sent to prison and other offenders. The results will be published in late November.</p>

It can also encourage the offender to deal with any problems that might be making them commit crime, such as drug or alcohol misuse. The failure to deal effectively with the root causes of an individual's offending and the excessive use of imprisonment often just delays further offending when that person is released from prison, having been further influenced by exposure to more serious offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.239W.3/1">The First-tier Tribunal (Social Security and Child Support) does not record disability living allowance (DLA) appeals by the age of the appellant or by their disability and cannot, therefore, provide the cost of specific case types. This information could be provided only at disproportionate cost by manually checking individual appeal files. In addition, the First-tier Tribunal (Social Security and Child Support) destroys appeal files six months after the conclusion of a case, so, for the majority of the period requested by the hon. Member, information is no longer available.</p>
	<p pid="a.239W.3/2">The Tribunals Service was created in 2006 and can provide figures only from this date. Prior to this, the Appeals Service, an agency of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was responsible for the appeals system. The DWP is unable to provide any data.</p>

	<p pid="a.242W.2/1">The protection and resilience of the Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), which underpins the delivery of essential services to our citizens, is taken very seriously across Government. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) works closely with the Centre for the Protection of Critical National Infrastructure (CPNI) and the energy industry to ensure an integrated approach to protective security in the sector, by means of physical, cyber, and personnel security measures which are appropriate and proportionate to the risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.2/2">The Government's Cyber Security Strategy of the United Kingdom, published alongside and reflected in the National Security Strategy update of June 2009, considers a range of methods of cyber attacks. It also outlined new governance structures and workstreams which are now building on existing work to take forward the Government's plan for reducing the impact on and vulnerability of the UK's interests from cyber attacks. The Government are building upon this work and have already discussed the importance of proportionate protection for cyber attacks within the newly formed National Security Council, at which the SoS for Energy and Climate Change was present.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.2/3">DECC works closely with the UK's energy sector to consider the impacts to energy supplies of a range of hazards and threats, including solar flares and electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Together with CPNI and the Office of Cyber Security (OCS) we identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the national infrastructure that could be exploited by such threats, including cyber threats, and share best practice across the CNI. We continually assess the risks we identify, determine proportionate mitigations where necessary, and regularly test our responses through national and international exercises.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.2/4">CPNI provides advice on electronic or cyber protective security measures to the businesses and organisations that comprise the UK's critical national infrastructure, including public utilities, companies and financial centres. CPNI also provides a Response Service which responds to reported attacks on private sector networks. Indeed, if a cyber security breach impacts an energy utility company's operational capability leading to security of supply concerns, the Government have existing procedures (including my Department's emergency response plans) and existing powers (including, where appropriate, emergency powers under the Energy Act 1976) to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.2/5">We are keen to discuss these proposals with US counterparts, and have an ongoing interest to learn from our allies and their approaches to national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.242W.2/6">DECC does not, or course, have responsibility for the resilience of sites critical to the UK national defence, one of the aspects of this particular Act. I can confirm, however, that my colleague, the Secretary of State for Defence, has robust defences and continuity arrangements in place to maintain the integrity of all sites critical to the defence of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.246W.2/1">There are currently no plans to bring forward measures to limit the height of wind turbines or introduce a proximity rule. The assessment of an application to develop a wind farm already includes, among other things, an analysis of visual and landscape impacts to ascertain whether the location and height of the wind farm is acceptable. The Government consider that these impacts are best assessed on a case by case basis so that local factors can be taken fully into account, regardless of whether applications are dealt with at national or local level. Where applications are dealt with at local level, we believe that councils should have the opportunity to decide these matters on behalf of their local community.</p>

This will bring cafeteria prices into line with benchmark workplace venues and bar prices into line with a competitively-priced high street pub chain.

	<p pid="a.249W.5/6">were unregistered. The report does not give a specific percentage for the numbers of low paid people who are unregistered, however the report did find that that:</p>
	<p pid="a.249W.5/7" class="indent">&quot;areas with the highest levels of employment and income deprivation had the highest levels of non-registration in 2000.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.249W.5/8">While no recent national estimates have been made in these areas, the Electoral Commission's more recent report The Completeness and Accuracy of Electoral Registers in Great Britain (March 2010) found that, based on case study research:</p>
	<p pid="a.249W.5/9" class="indent">&quot;Under-registration and inaccuracy are closely associated with the social groups most likely to move home across all seven areas in Phase two (therefore excluding Knowsley), under-registration is notably higher than average among 17-24 year-olds (56% not registered), private sector tenants (49%) and black and minority ethnic (BME) British residents (31%)&quot;.</p>

Furthermore, so that pensioners are not left worse off than they would have been under the old price link, in 2011-12 the basic state pension will receive an increase equivalent to the growth in RPI, should that deliver the highest percentage increase. The following figures take into account the effects of this commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/4">These rates are estimated using the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts for growth and are consistent with the basic state pension expenditure forecasts published in the Budget of <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/5">The rates are indicative only as actual levels of inflation and earnings used may differ from forecasts. Actual increases in benefit rates are decided once the September inflation rates are available, ahead of the annual uprating order.</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.5/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) was responsible for establishing level thresholds for the 2010 national curriculum tests. Lin Hinnigan, QCDA executive accounting officer, has written to my hon. Friend with the information on the mechanisms used to agree thresholds for this year's tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lin Hinnigan, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-15">15 July 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.5/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to the Parliamentary Question you recently tabled regarding level setting National Curriculum Tests, as requested by the Minister of State for Schools, Nick Gibb MP: &quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what mechanism was used to establish threshold levels for standard assessment tests in 2009-10; and whether the industrial action by teaching unions had an effect on the threshold.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.5/4" class="indent">The process of level setting for Key Stage 2 tests in English and mathematics 2010 was exactly the same as for previous years. The industrial action undertaken by teacher unions did not have any effect on how the process worked this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.5/5" class="indent">In terms of the process used to set levels, a range of procedures, both statistical and judgemental, are used to ensure the standards of performance required for the award of each level are maintained consistently from year to year. This includes extensive pre-testing of all test papers so that tests can be equated statistically from year to year. Since this equating is based on data obtained during pre-testing, loss of data due to fewer pupils taking the actual test would not have an impact on the process. Evidence is also obtained through a judgemental exercise, whereby a panel of senior markers scrutinise real pupils' test papers in order to identify the threshold where performance characterises that expected of pupils at each level.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.5/6" class="indent">QCDA then chairs a formal level setting meeting which takes place to weigh up both strands of evidence in order to recommend a final threshold for each level which is signed off by the QCDA accountable officer. This meeting is also observed by Ofqual, who have a role as the regulator to ensure that assessments give a reliable indication of achievement and indicate a consistent level of attainment.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.5/7" class="indent">I trust this information is useful. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

	<p pid="a.280W.11/12">The increase in the number of lone parents claiming jobseeker's allowance in Peterborough reflects a national trend that is a consequence of the change in the eligibility rules for income support. In October 2008 a lone parent could claim income support on grounds of being a lone parent until his or her youngest child reached 16. From November 2008 this has been reduced in steps to 10, and, under current legislation, will be further reduced to seven in October 2010. Budget 2010 announced that this age limit will be further lowered to the point when the youngest child turns school age.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.11/13">The policy is an important part of the strategy to combat child poverty. The need to increase the rate of parental employment needs to be balanced against their caring responsibilities, and accordingly the jobseeker's allowance regime has been adapted for lone parents to ensure that those with children under the age of 13 can restrict their availability to school hours, and that non-availability of child care can constitute good cause for turning down an offer of employment.</p>

The data presented in this publication combine three main data sources: benefit claims data held by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) covering new ESA claims that started between October 2008 to August 2009; functional assessment data sourced from ATOS Healthcare covering assessments completed up to February 2010; and appeals data sourced from Tribunals Service covering appeals heard up to February 2010 (and which link to ESA claims up to the end of March 2009).  2. The table provides national data for all ESA claims, up to the end of March 2009 where person claiming has been found fit for work, who subsequently appeals the Department's decision and the appeal has been heard by Tribunals Service the end of February 2010. ESA was introduced in October 2008 so data are available only from this date onwards. The table shows that for all ESA claims received between October 2008 and March 2009, there were around 28,000 appeals. Of these, 11,000 or 39% found in favour of the appellant.  3.Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted Tribunals Service and heard, we still expect there are more appeals that have not yet been heard for these early cohorts of ESA claims. These figures should continue to be treated as emerging findings and not final at this stage.  4. The Department regularly publishes official statistics on the work capability assessment-the statistics were last updated in April 2010 and published in the report 'Employment and Support Allowance: Work Capability Assessment: Official Statistics: April 2010', a copy of which has been placed in the Library. The information is also available on the internet at the following address: http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/workingage/esa_wca/esa_wca_arc.asp</td> </tr>

Key to this will be the measures set out in the Budget to secure a sustained, private sector-led, recovery in the economy and employment, through tackling the deficit, improving competitiveness and supporting business by cutting regulation and taxes. The Government are also exploring ways to ensure that people on benefit keep more of their earnings when they move into work or increase the hours they work.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.2/2">In addition, the Next Step service (our new universal integrated adult careers service which starts from August) will offer advice to individuals on how to progress in their careers. This would include helping them overcome barriers to working full-time, such as accessing child care, or where their skills were a barrier to gaining full-time work, how they could get the necessary skills through training or development activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.293W.14/1">Figures recently released by the Office for National Statistics show that construction output declined overall by 1% in the first quarter of 2010. There was an encouraging increase in new build, for the second quarter in succession since the end of the recession. Repair and Maintenance had shown a strong increase in the third quarter of 2009, and the decline in the latest figures is likely to reflect work having been brought forward before the ending of lower rate VAT in January this year. New orders for construction rose by 1% over the previous quarter, with a strong increase in private housing and increases in all other sectors except private non-housing projects.</p>

In addition, the Construction Innovation and Growth Team is looking at how the industry can best become equipped to meet the challenges of a low-carbon economy, and will report in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.297W.5/1">The Government are supporting employment in the manufacturing industry by creating a stable business environment that will give businesses the confidence they need to plan and invest for the future. We are doing this by creating a more supportive tax environment, freeing up credit through the banking system, reducing regulation, maximising the flexibility of the labour market and focusing on training and apprenticeships. For example, we have already redirected &#163;150 million to create up to 50,000 extra apprenticeships, which will be workplace-based and employer-led.</p>
	<p pid="a.297W.5/2">In taking this forward, we are currently developing our thinking on manufacturing. It is clear we need a fresh approach which addresses the UK's competitive advantage and weaknesses in manufacturing including productivity, skills, R and D and exports.

	<p pid="a.298W.5/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/2"><i> (a)</i> We are not aware of the quantities of nanomaterials in cosmetics, but under the EU cosmetics directive cosmetic products are required to undergo a safety assessment which takes into account all aspects of the product use and content, including particle size of the ingredients. Under the EU cosmetics regulation which comes into force in 2013, the requirements for the safety assessment remain, but new requirements will be brought in to provide competent authorities with more information about products containing nanomaterials.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/3">BIS are not the lead Department for the other areas of the hon. Member's question but we have received the following contributions from the relevant Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/4"><i> (b)</i> Biocidal products currently subject to specific national controls under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 are wood preservatives, public hygiene insecticides and insect repellents used on animals, rodenticides and antifouling coatings. There are approximately 2000 biocidal products approved under the 1986 regulations. We are not aware that any of them contain manufactured nanomaterials, although many were approved years before the development of this relatively new technology. However, the national scheme is being progressively overtaken by a European scheme under the Biocidal Products Directive 98/8/EC, which is implemented in the UK by the Biocidal Products Regulations 2001 and equivalent legislation in Northern Ireland. Under the directive the scope of biocidal products is broadened to include disinfectants. Currently there are only three biocidal products authorised under the new biocides legislation, none of which contain nanomaterials. However, the number authorised under the new scheme will grow in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/5">The existing national and EU schemes are broadly similar. Both afford high levels of protection to people and the environment. Active substances, the ingredients that have the biocidal effect, are subject to detailed toxicological and ecotoxicological assessment before they can be used in biocidal products. In addition, each biocidal product is subject to detailed assessment of risk, covering both people and the environment. Biocidal products are only authorised for supply and use when expert assessment and validation confirms that risks are very low, where appropriate conditions of authorisation are imposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/6"><i> (c)</i> The Food Standards Agency is aware of only one food product on the UK market produced using nanotechnologies, a food supplement that consists of a nanoemulsion of co-enzyme Q10.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/7"><i> (d)</i> Human medicines are regulated in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It is not possible to give an accurate percentage of UK licensed medicinal products that contain nanomaterials as defined by ISO/TS 27687:2009 because that is only a recent definition. However, approximately 5% of licensed medicinal products in the UK contain colloidal silicon dioxide. This material has been used as a pharmaceutical powder flow aid for many years and the MHRA is not aware of any safety issues that have arisen following extensive clinical use.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/8">Additionally, a small number of medicinal products (&lt; 1%) contain nanoparticles in the form of liposomes (e.g. Caelyx, Myocet), polymer protein conjugates (e.g. PegIntron, Somavert), polymeric substances (e.g. Copaxone) suspensions (e.g. Rapamune, Emend) or viral-vectored vaccines. The manufacturing of these products often employs standard processes, which are well-described and understood and include the formation of mixed micelles (Liposomal Doxorubicin) or colloidal dispersions (Sonovue), the manufacture of large peptides by standard synthetic techniques or the manufacture of large molecules by standard polymerisation methods.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/9">For human medicines the manufacture, sale, supply and importation of medicinal products into the UK is governed by Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. All medicines on the UK market have been assessed as acceptably efficacious and safe. Public health is safeguarded by the use of robust and evidence-based assessments for each medicinal product to ensure that the benefits to the patient outweigh any risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.5/10">(i) and (ii) The Government have an extensive research programme to promote the responsible development and safe use of nanotechnologies. This work aims to improve understanding of the behaviour of nanomaterials and their effects on human health and the environment, in particular focusing on those materials and products which are currently available or close to the market, and includes collaboration in national and global initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.299W.2/1">We fully support the creation of the National Composite Centre (NCC) in Bristol. It will play a key part in developing the UK's capability to manufacture composite structures quickly and cost effectively. The global shift from metal to lightweight extra strong composite materials in sectors such as aerospace, wind energy and marine will provide vast commercial opportunities and the NCC will help UK companies realise these opportunities. Greater use of lightweight composites in transport vehicles will, through reduced fuel consumption, help deliver significant CO2 emission savings. The centre will be operational in August 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.301W.8/21">The regional estimates for quarter one 2009 are taken from the Labour Force Survey, which does not have a large enough sample to calculate estimates for smaller geographies. However, it is possible to calculate estimates of young people NEET in local authorities from the Annual Population Survey, which has a larger sample than the quarterly Labour Force Survey. The estimates provided in Table 2 cover the period between January to December 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.8/22">Although local authority level estimates can be calculated from the Annual Population Survey, these estimates are generally subject to large sampling variability and some estimates for smaller authorities will be based on very small samples subject to extreme variability. The estimates in Table 2 should therefore be treated with considerable caution and viewed in conjunction with their Confidence Intervals<sup>(2)</sup>, which indicate how accurate an estimate is. For example, a Confidence Interval of +/-4 percentage points (pp) means that the true value is between 4pp above the estimate and 4pp below the estimate.</p>

City of Durham constituency, as constituted in 2008, consisted of 20 electoral wards, nine more than the current constituency. The breakdown of the data available is not sufficiently detailed to determine whether the newly constituted parliamentary constituency contains the same estimated number of lone parents as the 2008 constituency.</p>
