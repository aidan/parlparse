	<p pid="b.1703W.3/2">The Government are committed to maintaining a diverse and vibrant child care market where providers from the private, voluntary, independent and maintained sectors work together in support of children and families. The new duties in the Childcare Bill will require local authorities to assess child care needs within their area, find out what parents want, and try to meet their needs. This will deliver choice and maintain diversity, responding to the needs of parents who&mdash;perhaps because they work atypical hours&mdash;are looking for flexible child care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1703W.3/3">All three and four-year-olds are currently entitled to 12 and a half hours of free early learning and child care, and by 2010 this will have increased to 15 hours. Parents will be able to use the free entitlement flexibly enabling them to balance work and family life more effectively. From later this year pathfinders will test delivery mechanisms to ensure that parental demand for increased flexibility can be met without driving smaller settings out of business. The findings from the pathfinders will inform the roll out of the extension in hours and flexibility by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1703W.3/4">The duty in the Childcare Bill to secure sufficient child care which is eligible under the child care element of the working tax credit will help to improve the affordability of child care by providing greater access for families to the financial support available through the tax credits system. During 2005-06, the level of investment in the child care element of the working tax credit was more than &pound;2.4 million a day, benefiting around 356,000 families. This year the maximum proportion of costs that can be claimed through tax credits increased from 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. We are also tackling high child care costs in London through a pilot programme being run jointly with the London Development Agency and the Greater London Authority which will deliver an additional 10,000 child care places for families on lower incomes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1704W.2/2">I understand that Hertfordshire county council is still developing its children's centres implementation plan. Each local authority has strategic responsibility for developing children's centre services in its own area. We have issued guidance to help local authorities do this, including examples of good practice. However, detailed plans will be based on an individual authority's own assessment of the needs of children under five and their families in the area, including the levels of disadvantage they face.</p>

	<p pid="b.1704W.8/1">The available figures are shown in the table. They are taken from press releases issued by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) in April each year which summarise applicant numbers as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-24">24 March</phrase>, for each of the age bands of under 21 years, 21-24 years, and over 24 years. The figures reinforce our view that the long-term trend of increasing university applications will continue. There was a larger than expected increase in the number of applicants for entry in 2005 and although the number of applicants for 2006 are down compared to 2005, they are above the numbers for 2004 entry. We experienced a similar dip in applications in 1998 when tuition fees were introduced, but numbers returned to their usual levels the following year and continued upwards thereafter. We expect this to be the trend going forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.1708W.3/1">Questions 61a and 63a were removed from the survey because they were not providing an accurate measure of the levels of discrimination and bullying in the Army, or of the Army's commitment to issues of equality. They asked whether individuals believed that bullying and discrimination exists rather than whether they had direct experience of such incidents. Responses were therefore likely to be influenced by factors such as anecdotal evidence, media coverage and popular opinion as opposed to personal knowledge. Other questions related to direct experience remain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1708W.3/2">Question 66 was replaced by question 39c to give the respondent more opportunity to explain their reasons for not making a formal complaint and to provide a richer source of data for analysis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1711W.6/1">The sale of a stake in QinetiQ to The Carlyle Group was completed in February 2003. Starting in 1998, the overall PPP process included: options studies and public consultation; the division of DERA into QinetiQ and Dstl; the formation of QinetiQ as a limited company; the conduct of the competition resulting in the selection of Carlyle as MOD's Strategic Partner; and the completion of the legal negotiations and due diligence process necessary to complete the transaction. Work on many of these activities was conducted in parallel and they have not been separately costed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1711W.6/2">MOD's total expenditure on advisers throughout these stages of process was approximately &pound;17.5 million over 5 years. This includes a cost of approximately &pound;9.2 million for legal advice, broken down by financial year as shown in the following table.</p>

Consequently, it is not possible to accurately attribute these costs across individual financial years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1714W.6/1">Working with Italy, which retains the international lead on judicial reform in Afghanistan, and other international partners, the UK is helping Afghanistan establish a functional, accessible, equitable and sustainable justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714W.6/2">The UK has provided US$500,000 in support of the United Nations Development Programme &quot;Strengthening the Justice System of Afghanistan&quot; (SJSA). The SJSA programme is helping the Government of Afghanistan restructure the justice system to bring it into compliance with the constitution; rehabilitate judicial infrastructure; strengthen service delivery capacity of justice institutions and justice professionals; promote rule of law and improve access to justice. This programme supports the Government of Afghanistan's &quot;Justice for All&quot; Action Plan which provides the basis for the reform of the Justice Sector over the next twelve years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714W.6/3">Through the Global Opportunities Fund, the UK has also funded the Bar Human Rights Committee to deliver training to key actors in the legal sector. The training, delivered in April 2006, to staff from the Ministry of Women's Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Afghan National Police and the Lawyers Association of Afghanistan focused on the re-establishment of the rule of law, women's access to justice, and human rights in international and domestic law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714W.6/4">Germany is responsible for co-ordinating international assistance to the Afghan government's police reform programmes. Since 2002, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has administered almost &pound;5 million in support of these programmes through the Department for International Development/Ministry of Defence/FCO funded Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP). In financial year (FY) 2002-03 the GCPP Afghanistan Strategy contributed around &pound;112,000, in 2003-04 &pound;2.5 million, in 2004-05 &pound;1.6 million and in 2005-06 &pound;760,000. This has funded two UK police trainers at the Kabul Police Academy (2002-06), five UK mentors at the Regional Police Training College in Mazar-e-Sharif (2004-06) and the creation of a Crime Scene Investigation team in Kabul (2003-05). In FY 2006-07 the GCPP will continue to support police reform through the appointment of a Senior Police Adviser to the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in Lashkar Gah. The Adviser's role will include the provision of support to local police and justice officials in Helmand as well as identifying ways in which the UK can provide assistance to support the German and US police programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714W.6/5">The UK has also allocated &pound;15 million in FY 2006-07 towards counter-narcotics law enforcement in Afghanistan. This funding will help support the Counter-Narcotics Police of Afghanistan, the lead drugs law enforcement agency, and the Afghan Special Narcotics Force (ASNF) through training, mentoring and equipping personnel. The ASNF has caused significant disruption to the drugs trade, forcing traffickers to move drugs in smaller quantities. The ASNF is playing an important role as part of the wider Afghan law enforcement effort against illegal drugs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1715W.2/1">Italy has been leading the international community's effort on judicial reform. Training members of the judiciary has been a central focus and progress has been made. Over the past four years a series of training programmes funded by the international community has seen over 600 Afghan judges, prosecutors and lawyers, of whom 42 were women, undergo specialised legal training. These programmes are set to continue with further projects delivering training in legal aid, criminal and commercial law, technical assistance, financial crime, juvenile crime and gender justice to senior judges, law graduates and government officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/2">Despite these efforts Afghanistan's justice system still lacks sufficiently qualified officials, adequate legal education and the necessary administrative tools and physical infrastructure. The UK will continue to support both the Afghan Government and our development partners in reforming Afghanistan's justice sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/3">Germany has been leading efforts to train and reform the Afghan national police with assistance from the US. Since August 2002, there have been some considerable achievements. Over 50,000 police of all ranks and branches have been trained at the re-established Police Academy and at five regional training centres. A pay and rank review is under way aiming to reduce the current top-heavy structure and raise police salaries in order to attract the best candidates. An international conference on border management and police was co-hosted by Afghanistan and Germany in Qatar in February. It endorsed the findings that replenishment of the Law and Order Trust Fund, used to partly fund police salaries, was critical to the success of police pay and rank reform. We support this finding and the valuable work that the international community, in particular Germany and the US are putting into police training and reform.</p>

	<p pid="b.1717W.5/1">UK forces in Afghanistan are deployed under the international security assistance force (ISAF) and are not there to take direct action against the drugs trade. They will contribute to the broader counter-narcotics effort by providing the secure environment in which the rule of law can be applied, reconstruction can take place and legal rural livelihoods can be developed. ISAF forces will be able to help with the provision of training to Afghan counter-narcotics forces and will, within means and capabilities, provide support to their operations. They will also help the Afghan Government explain their policies to the Afghan people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1717W.5/2">Sustainable drug elimination strategies take time. Bringing about a sustainable decrease in poppy cultivation requires a range of activities including arresting and convicting the traffickers who profit from the trade, and putting in place the development programmes which enable farmers to move away from growing poppy. That is why the UK is spending &pound;270 million over a three-year period on supporting the Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1717W.8/2">The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), established in June 2002, is an autonomous institution within the Afghan Government set up to monitor human rights abuses and implement transitional justice. It continues to work closely with the Government of Afghanistan and international partners to combat the culture of impunity that has existed in Afghanistan and led to past human rights abuses. Since its inception the Commission has closed some 40 private jails; has had 1,600 people, who were being held illegally, released from prison, and managed eight workshops for prison governors on human rights. Its work is helping the country make a full transition to stability and peace based on democracy and human rights. I am pleased to be able to tell the hon.

	<p pid="b.1723W.5/1">We welcome the EU's decision to list the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a terrorist organisation. The EU listing procedure is a means by which EU member states work together collectively to fulfil their obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373 to freeze the assets of terrorists without delay. The EU has repeatedly urged the LTTE to change their ways, to turn away from violence, return to the negotiation table and pursue peace through political means. It is hoped the listing will help the LTTE to see that they need to change their ways and move away from their path of violence. At the same time, the EU has asked the Government of Sri Lanka to rein in other paramilitary groups from carrying out attacks in Government-controlled areas. The only way forward in the conflict is a negotiated settlement that satisfies the concerns and legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lankans and preserves democracy in Sri Lanka.</p>

	<p pid="b.1724W.5/2">There have been no ministerial discussions between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on this issue. Officials from both the Departments, however, work closely throughout the year to ensure our policy on whaling is communicated to countries that are currently members of the International Whaling Commission and to those who have an interest in cetacean conservation. We will continue to work together on these important issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1724W.8/2">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not discussed whaling with any country in the last 12 months. Every year, in advance of the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office issues lobbying instructions to its missions to seek support from their host countries for the UK's position on whaling. The prominent role we play within the IWC ensures no country can be in any doubt as to the importance we attach to whale conservation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1725W.7/1">The Committee has recently made a number of recommendations on changes to the rules on broadcasting proceedings of the House and on filming and photography within the precincts. Mr. Speaker has agreed to these changes being made on a trial basis. The Committee will consider in December whether to recommend that they be made permanent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1725W.7/2">From the return of the House in October, and for a trial period, a greater variety of shots of proceedings in the Chamber will be allowed than is the case at present, including a greater use of reaction shots in order to illustrate the mood of the House, and the provision of a low-level atmospheric sound-feed during divisions rather than the current complete silence.</p>

A reporter voice-over will also now be permitted during divisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1725W.7/4">Two new interview points have been identified within the precincts: in the south west corner of Westminster Hall once the current works there have been completed, and on the Green in New Palace Yard, subject in the latter case to a permit from the Serjeant at Arms. Filming pieces to camera of a presenter walking across Central Lobby will also be permitted before 9 am on non-sitting days, similarly subject to a permit from the Serjeant at Arms.</p>

	<p pid="b.1728W.5/1">I understand from Crossrail London Rail Links Ltd (CLRL) that reusing the section of Thameslink running from Farringdon to Moorgate for operational purposes would involve bringing the tunnel up to the surface near Farringdon and returning below ground near Moorgate. This is considered impractical, given that there is not sufficient space for tunnel portals in these areas. Therefore, CLRL has not carried out a cost assessment of this option.</p>

The grant is distributed to local authorities on the basis of their rural population. Total grant for England has risen from &pound;32.5 million in 1998 to &pound;54.3 million in 2006. The grant has provided for over 2,000 new and enhanced services.</p>

Member, interpretation of the Licensing Act 2003 is a matter for licensing authorities in the first instance and the Courts in the case of a dispute. Ministers cannot tell licensing authorities how to interpret the legislation, although we are currently reviewing the guidance issued under s.182 of the Licensing Act 2003 which aims to help licensing authorities operate the regime. If the hon. Member would like to write to me to outline any specific concerns, I would be happy to consider them as part of the review of the guidance.</p>

All energy suppliers met their targets under EEC phase 1, allowing 10 million householders to benefit from energy saving measures. The second phase of the EEC came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> under Electricity and Gas (Energy Efficiency Obligations) Order 2004, and we have not received any recent representations about the operation of the 2001 Order.

	<p pid="b.1763W.6/1">DFID funds a number of projects in Shan state: the Fund for HIV/AIDS in Myanmar, to which DFID has committed &pound;10 million over five years, provides anti-retroviral treatment in almost every township; a project to strengthen the capacity of doctors to provide affordable TB and malaria services to low-income people (&pound;393,275 over three years) operates in the north and west of the state; and a programme with Save the Children to provide early childhood care and education (&pound;2.7 million over three years) in the most northern townships. These projects have been designed with the primary purpose of reducing poverty, rather than to support specific ethnic minority groups, any of which are able to access all of these projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.1764W.2/1">The humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is very serious across the country, especially in the eastern provinces of Katanga (particularly North Katanga), North and South Kivu and Province Orientale (especially Ituri district). The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that approximately 1.6 million people are internally displaced and over 300,000 are refugees in neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1764W.2/2">Increased conflict in North Katanga since November last year has led to a rise in displacement and this has contributed to a much higher monthly average of new displacements in 2006 compared to 2005, at over 100,000 newly displaced per month compared to 35,000 per month last year. It is hoped that the recent surrender of a Mayi-Mayi commander from that region may lead to greater stability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1764W.2/3">Elsewhere in the East, external armed groups such as the Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda (FDLR) in the Kivus and other rebels groups operating in Ituri, as well as ill-disciplined brigades of the DRC army, are committing abuses such as theft and violence, including high levels of sexual violence, against the civilian population. Operations by the Congolese army against the armed groups, often carried out jointly with MONUC (UN Peacekeeping force in the DRC), are frequently the cause of civilian displacement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1764W.2/4">Mechanisms are in place to get assistance to those who need it quickly, but lack of access due to insecurity and logistical difficulties can lead to delays.</p>
	<p pid="b.1764W.2/5">The UK has strongly supported efforts by the UN to mobilise greater international funding to meet humanitarian needs. DFID has increased UK humanitarian support to the DRC to &pound;60 million over two years. Some other countries have also increased funding, but overall support remains far too low to meet all the needs. The DRC remains a neglected crisis. I have called on my donor counterparts to do more and will continue to keep up the pressure to ensure that funding is forthcoming to meet all the desperate needs in the DRC.</p>

	<p pid="b.1766W.0/1">The situation in Sierra Leone is stable and the country has made considerable progress since the end of the civil war in 2002. This was confirmed by the withdrawal of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, UNAMSIL in December 2005. However, considerable challenges remain and the state is fragile. Current threats to continued stability include frustration resulting from large-scale unemployment, particularly among young men, and the weak capacity of government to deliver basic services. Poverty is high, with 70 per cent. estimated to be living below the poverty line. The run-up to the 2007 elections is likely to be a period of increased tension within the country and insecurity in other countries in the region may also present challenges to continued stability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.0/2">Sierra Leone is currently ranked 176 out of 177 on the Human Development Index and continues to have some of the worst health indicators in the world, particularly in terms of maternal and child mortality. Malaria is a major cause of death. There are occasional epidemics of cholera and Lassa fever poses a regional threat in the east of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.0/3">There are currently approximately 40,000 refugees in Sierra Leone principally from Liberia. With improved stability in Liberia, many of these have started, or are preparing to go home. Since January 2006, some 9,000 have returned. DFID has supported the care and maintenance of Liberian refugees in camps across the region for some years, and more recently has financed their repatriation from Sierra Leone and other countries. In 2005, &pound;1.1 million was committed for these objectives, and this year, a further &pound;700,000 has been allocated. In addition, DFID has spent over &pound;3.5 million per year for the last three years to help rebuild Liberia and thereby encourage refugees from Sierra Leone and other countries to return home.</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.0/4">DFID's programme since the end of the war has concentrated on security and rebuilding government institutions and these will remain an important component of the country programme. The programme is currently developing its strategy for the next three years, and as part of this is exploring options for expanding its work in the areas of basic services, economic development and job creation. Through our country-office in Freetown, and from Africa Division's Conflict and Humanitarian Unit in London, we are monitoring the humanitarian situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="b.1767W.2/1">The only significant disease outbreak currently affecting Darfur is that of the 75 cases of acute watery diarrhoea in South Darfur. The outbreak has so far claimed four lives in the state, with cases concentrated in Nyala, Kass and EI-Daein towns. The first report of the outbreak was on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase> and all four deaths to date occurred on 24-<phrase class="date" code="2006-05-25">25 May 2006</phrase>. This reflects the effective planning and response by the Government and humanitarian agencies. Although, the vast majority of cases have been amongst town residents rather than in the internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, the unconfirmed reports of a case in Gereida, where 100,000 IDPs have sought shelter, is of concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Health have established a task force to co-ordinate the response. In accordance with their contingency plans, a public health campaign has been launched, broadcasting hygiene promotion messages on local TV and radio. The immediate response has also included the mapping of cases, identifying high risk areas for chlorination of water supplies and testing. In preparation for an outbreak, the WHO stockpiled cholera treatment kits across Darfur. These have proved invaluable in enabling the immediate response. In addition, a Cholera Treatment Centre has been set up in Nyala with the capacity to handle 50 patients a day.</p>

	<p pid="b.1767W.5/1">I attach great importance to ensuring increased access to safe water supply and sanitation in the developing world and have recently committed to doubling DFID's expenditure on the provision of these basic services in Africa to &pound;95 million by 2007-08. However, while we recognise the importance of 'public-public' partnerships, our focus is on a pragmatic approach led by our partner countries, to ensure we are doing what works, and recognising that there can be failures of both private and public models.</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.5/2">In practice, the majority of our work on rural, urban and humanitarian water supply and sanitation services is spent through Governments, not-for-profit or humanitarian agencies (this was around 95 per cent. of our bilateral spend in 2003-04). We are currently actively involved in seven African countries (Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia). In these countries our effort is focused on helping Government and donors deliver more effective water services. We are engaged in sector working groups which aim to promote partnerships (including within the public sector and civil society) that will deliver effective services on the ground and increase access for poor people through better co-ordination at both national and local level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1768W.5/1">Major UK objectives for the World Bank 2006 Spring Meeting were delivery on 2005 commitments, governance and corruption, climate change and clean energy, and the Investment Climate Facility (ICF) for Africa. The Development Committee focused its discussion on two World Bank documents: (i) The Global Monitoring Report (GMR) 2006: Strengthening Mutual Accountability&mdash;Aid, Trade and Governance and (ii) Clean Energy and Development: Towards an Investment Framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.5/2">The GMR sets out clearly the progress that has been made on tackling poverty, and the challenges that remain. We noted that almost all developing countries are off-track to meet at least some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the lack of progress in Africa is especially worrying. More aid is clearly essential, and it must be delivered more effectively. We called on the World Bank, other bilateral and multilateral agencies to take action, and ensure that we live up to the commitments made in Paris on aid effectiveness last year, including a country-based approach. The Results and Resources Frameworks, first suggested in the Bank's Africa Action Plan, are a good vehicle for improving mutual accountability and we urged the Bank to develop and implement them quickly. We also called on donors to give more emphasis to assisting the poorest countries, including fragile states and make commitments to increased and long-term resources for education so that developing countries can fully finance their education plans over the long-term.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.5/3">The Development Committee agreed that donors should fully implement the commitments they have made for substantial increases in aid volumes, and that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have a key role in helping countries ensure that increases in aid volumes can be absorbed effectively, consistent with macro-economic stability and growth objectives. Rapid progress was required to implement the framework agreed in the Paris Declaration for enhancing aid effectiveness through a stronger focus on results. Donors need to improve the quality of aid, modalities of aid delivery to reduce volatility, achieve greater predictability, and provide stronger alignment with national poverty reduction strategies. They were encouraged where possible to move towards multi-year plans and commitments, and be ready to finance recurrent costs where sector policies are sound and fiduciary conditions are adequate. The Committee agreed that the World Bank and other partners should improve their coordination at the country level, particularly in strengthening health services and improving access to good quality education, to reduce transaction costs and help increase absorptive capacity. Donors should fill the Education Fast Track Initiative current financing gap and a progress report on Education for All should be submitted to the Annual Meeting in Singapore. The Committee urged the Bank to implement the annual Results and Resources Frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.5/4">The focus of this year's GMR was governance. Prior to the Development Committee, I wrote an article on corruption and participated in a forum on governance and corruption at the Center for Global Development in Washington. At the Committee, I underlined that governance was critical for development and achieving the MDGs, and an essential element of the compact between developing countries, developed countries and international institutions. Only countries themselves can make the decisive changes that are needed. However, donors can help the process of creating more effective states and it is vital that we assist. The proposed Bank framework for monitoring provided a practical and useful starting point, and should be developed further to include aspects such as the extent to which the state responds to the wishes of the people, particularly the poor. We strongly supported the message in the report that corruption is an outcome of poor governance, and caused by a number of failures of national and global systems. It should not be tolerated; but we made clear that our work on tackling corruption needs to get better at addressing the failures, and connect better with the people who have the power and motivation to do something about it. The international community must work collaboratively and take a firm line on the need to tackle and prevent corruption. It must not equate to doing nothing in poor countries where corruption is an issue. Instead, we must find more effective ways of engaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.5/5">I called on the World Bank to develop a framework for assisting developing countries with their long-term efforts to improve governance, and tackle corruption where it needs addressing. The framework will need to include how we can best ensure that aid is used for the purpose for which it was intended. This will include strong, independent units to detect and investigate fraud; strengthening national financial and accountability systems more effectively; and how to address the corruption that comes from beyond national borders, including developing global initiatives, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. We urged the World Bank to consult widely in taking forward this work, recognising that addressing governance failures will require action from all parts of the international community, not only from developing countries. It is essential that the framework commands broad support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.5/6">The Development Committee endorsed these views and the main messages of the report. It called on the World Bank to develop and submit to the Annual Meetings in Singapore a broad strategy for helping member countries strengthen governance and deepen the fight against corruption, with clear guidelines for World Bank operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.5/7">On clean energy and development, I made clear that the effects of climate change are already being felt in many developing countries and will seriously impact our global efforts to reduce poverty and meet the MDGs. Responsibility for mitigating climate change requires urgent action on the part of richer countries, while some fast-growing middle-income countries must shift to cleaner, more efficient energy production to avoid exacerbating the problem. Meanwhile, developing countries need access to affordable, reliable and clean energy to grow their economies and to lift people out of poverty. We urged the international community to act now to support countries to do this in a sustainable way and so achieve a double-dividend of poverty reduction and environmental protection. Helping member countries meet these challenges should be a key objective of the World Bank and other multilateral development banks over the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.5/8">We welcomed the valuable work undertaken already in the World Bank to develop an investment framework to accelerate investment in clean energy, energy efficiency and adaptation to climate change. This now needs to be developed further into an ambitious global investment framework based on sound analysis of existing financial resources and identification of gaps where new instruments are needed. We urged the World Bank to work closely with the multilateral development banks, private sector and civil society to create a global joint investment framework to be presented at the Annual Meetings in Singapore. The Development Committee endorsed the importance of this work and asked the Bank to submit a report on progress towards an investment framework in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.5/9">In the margins of the Spring Meetings, I co-hosted with President Wolfowitz a meeting to raise awareness among donors and African countries of the Investment Climate Facility for Africa. African governments and institutions know that creating the right environment in which people and firms feel comfortable investing their money is crucial for Africa's prosperity. If Africa is to achieve the growth necessary to meet the MDGs, the business environment must improve significantly. Boosting African growth and poverty reduction is, ultimately, what the ICF is all about. I urged donors to co-fund the ICF and cooperate operationally so that it can add value and truly be complementary to existing work. African participants welcomed the formation of the ICF with its strong African ownership. Donors (including the International Finance Corporation and the European Commission) and companies have also responded positively and the ICF was launched in Africa on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1771W.2/1">In 2004, the World Bank abolished its practice of &quot;prescriptive conditionally&quot;, which meant countries were urged to adopt specific economic policies to receive budgetary support. The UK pressed for a review of the World Bank's use of conditionality, and this concluded in September 2005. The World Bank undertook analysis of previous practice and recent thinking, and sought contributions and views from many sources, including developing countries. I made a written submission, setting out the Government's stance, and particularly emphasising the importance of country ownership in setting the development agenda. The review report has been published and is available on the World Bank website at <a href="http://www.worldbank.org">www.worldbank.org</a><i> .</i> It showed that the use of conditionality in sensitive areas, such as trade liberalisation and privatisation, had declined in recent years. The review also proposed five good practice principles to guide the World Bank's use of conditionality, and these were endorsed by ministers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/2">The principles are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/3" class="italic"> Ownership</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/4" class="indent">Conditionality should reinforce, not undermine, country ownership of policies and programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/5" class="italic"> Harmonisation</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/6" class="indent">Conditionality should be agreed up-front with the government and with other donors, as part of a wider framework for assessing progress on poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/7" class="italic"> Customisation</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/8" class="indent">Conditionality should reflect country circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/9" class="italic"> Criticality</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/10" class="indent">Conditionality that determines whether to release money should include only those actions that are critical for the programme's success.</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/11" class="italic"> Transparency</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/12" class="indent">Conditionality should be specified so that it can be reviewed transparently, and so ensure that the Bank's financial support is predictable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/13">The World Bank will be reporting back in the next few months on how it has implemented these principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.2/14">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also improved its practice on conditionality in recent years. The conditionality guidelines approved by the IMF in 2002 are similar to those adopted by the World Bank. A review of IMF conditionality last year demonstrated a sharper focus on core areas of the Fund's remit in macroeconomic management and a reduction in conditions on privatisation and liberalisation. A separate review of the Fund's trade policy and conditions showed a sharp reduction in overall conditions on trade policy since the adoption of the guidelines. In addition, it demonstrated a shift towards conditions on trade governance, such as reforming customs administration, and away from trade policy such as tariffs. The Independent Evaluation Office of the IMF is currently undertaking a study to look at the process of setting conditionality on economic reforms, which is expected to report later this year.</p>

This is something, which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1784W.9/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has a National Sales Team that provides an account management service to our major national employers. The Account Managers work at a strategic level to develop and agree Service Level Agreements with these companies. These Service Level Agreements are communicated to geographically-based Account Managers who ensure that they are used as a basis to agree local solutions to meet individual recruitment needs. The same Account Managers are responsible for engaging with service delivery colleagues within Jobcentres to resolve any issues involving employer requirements or service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1784W.9/5" class="indent">In addition to this, the National Sales Team is fully committed and engaged in the Employer Engagement Strategy at all levels of Jobcentre Plus through Vacancy Planning. Working with delivery colleagues, they are able to ensure that regional and district plans reflect the current and future needs of national employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1784W.9/6" class="indent">In support of these activities Jobcentre Plus will shortly be introducing the Employer Relationship Management IT system, which will provide an unprecedented level of data on employers and the labour market in general. Analysis of this data will allow Jobcentre Plus to provide tailored services that meet the needs of employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1784W.9/7" class="indent">Employer engagement strategies and marketing campaigns will all emanate from this new system and local resources will be channelled accordingly. Consistency of service will be ensured across the whole of Jobcentre Plus as access to the system will be restricted to key decision makers, such as the Account Managers, who manage the interests of the major national employers and will be able to communicate appropriate strategies throughout the organisation.</p>

Organisations within the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) covered by this work include the Child Support Agency, Debt Management, the Disability and Carers Service and The Pension Service.

We also work closely on a wide range of issues with the Home Office's Prison and Probation Services (National Offender Management Service) and Immigration and Nationality Directorate.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1785W.5/4" class="indent">The AAT was introduced in April 2006 to ensure all our advisers make an effective contribution to Jobcentre Plus' aims, and to identify those advisers who may need additional help to achieve this. The AAT supports the new Job Outcome Target which introduces a change to the way performance is measured. All job outcomes will count towards achievement of this target, not just those achieved through Jobcentre Plus notified vacancies or financial initiatives. Advisers will no longer have individual points targets linked to job entries as part of their personal objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1785W.5/5" class="indent">The AAT has been designed to improve adviser performance and strengthen the support for advisers and their managers. It reflects the new approach to evaluating individual performance which is required under the new target regime. It is supplemented by individually tailored Improvement Plans which managers and advisers will use to address personal development issues. It is intended that the AAT will provide an indicator of advisers' performance and will help their managers to regularly monitor adviser achievements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1785W.5/6" class="indent">Adviser managers will not rely on the AAT alone to deliver performance improvements. Other activities such as mandatory observations from the Quality Assurance Framework must also be undertaken on a regular basis, in conjunction with agreed individual objectives as part of the Department's internal Performance Development System.</p>
	<p pid="b.1785W.5/7" class="indent">We will be evaluating and refining the AAT throughout the year as the Job Outcome Target system becomes more established and we learn more about the blend of quality and productivity information needed to optimise individual adviser performance.</p>

The latest PEAT inspections have recently been completed, and the results will be published in due course.

	<p pid="b.1793W.0/2">The Department has received a couple of complaints during the last five years which were investigated. Information on complaints received by the NHS is not held centrally. Under the Care Standards Act 2000, BPAS is required to supply each patient with a written copy of its complaints procedure, fully investigate each complaint and maintain a detailed, written record of each complaint. BPAS is also required to send the Healthcare Commission a statement every year with a summary of the complaints received. In addition, the Healthcare Commission look at these records as part of a clinic inspection.</p>
	<p pid="b.1793W.0/3">The information requested on the number of NHS funded early medical abortions performed by BPAS is shown in the table. Information is not held centrally on the number of women referred to BPAS by NHS general practitioners; the abortion notification form collects the names and addresses of the two registered medical practitioners who authorised the abortion under the Abortion Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.1796W.5/2">The national minimum standards (NMS) for care homes, which are available in the Library, include specific requirements for homes to have complaints procedures for service users, relatives and friends.

Complaints procedures must be simple, clear and accessible and appropriate to service users' needs.

	<p pid="b.1796W.5/4">Service users whose care is arranged by their local authority (LA) are also entitled to pursue complaints about the way the LA has fulfilled its function regarding the provision of services to meet the needs of the individual via the LA's complaints procedure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1796W.8/1">The Department does not hold this information nationally or for individual local authorities. Council funding for adult social services is derived from a number of sources: a share of overall formula grant allocated by the Department for Communities and Local Government, specific grants distributed by the Department, revenue from council tax, income from fees and charges and the re-prioritisation of funds on the basis of local decision making. The most recent allocation of funds for adults' social services was made in December 2005 and covers the two financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.8/2">As most of the Government funding for adult social care is allocated without conditions, it is not possible to identify the proportion of that funding that may be attributable to care in the community.

Where the manufacturer is based outside the European Community this would include appointing an authorised representative to register on their behalf with the member state competent authority where they have their registered place of business. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency conducts an annual programme of inspections of custom-made appliance manufacturers and authorised representatives based in the UK selected at random.</p>

	<p pid="b.1808W.2/1">Less than one in four people experiencing long-term mental health problems is in employment, and one third of those in employment report having been dismissed or forced to resign. There is evidence that better access to psychological treatment can help people to return to or maintain employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1808W.2/2">The Government are committed to improving access to evidence-based psychological therapies, and this policy was set out in the Labour manifesto 2005 and the &quot;Our Health, our care, our say White Paper. Our Improving Access to Psychological Therapies&quot; programme forms a key part of the Government's &quot;Health, Work and Well-Being&mdash;Caring for Our Future&quot; (HWWB) strategy, which the Department launched last October with the Department for Work and Pensions and the Health and Safety Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1808W.2/3">The Department is not responsible for the protection of people with learning disabilities at work. However, people with mental health problems and learning disabilities are protected by all employment legislation, for example that governing freedom from discrimination and equal opportunities. In addition, &quot;The Duty to Promote Disability Equality statutory code of practice in England and Wales&quot;, published by the Disability Rights Commission in December 2005, includes mental illness and learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1808W.2/4">There are a wide range of measures to protect vulnerable people in regulated social care, including those with mental health problems and learning disabilities. We have set out standards for care and treatment for the national health service and social care services in the national service framework for mental health and the White Paper, &quot;Valuing People: a new strategy for learning disability&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1808W.2/5">We have introduced national minimum standards for care homes, domiciliary care and adult placements to ensure that vulnerable people can live in a safe environment, where their rights and dignity are respected and staff are properly trained. The regulator, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, has powers to take swift and decisive action where abuse occurs, by serving enforcement notices on care homes and domiciliary care providers and, ultimately, it can close services down.</p>
	<p pid="b.1808W.2/6">&quot;No Secrets&quot;, statutory guidance issued under section 7 of the 1970 Local Authorities Social Services Act by the Department in 2000, provides a complete definition of abuse and a framework for councils to work with the police, the NHS and regulators to tackle abuse and prevent it from occurring.</p>
	<p pid="b.1808W.2/7">We introduced the protection of vulnerable adults (PoVA) scheme in July 2004. PoVA prevents dangerous or unscrupulous people from gaining access to vulnerable people in care homes or being cared for in their own homes. The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill was introduced in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase>. The new scheme will build on the existing PoVA scheme and will make it far more difficult for abusers to gain access to some of the most vulnerable groups in society. Subject to the necessary legislation being passed by Parliament, it will begin staged implementation in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1809W.8/1">The latest reported savings figure for productive time is &pound;879 million at December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1809W.8/2">The Gershon report &quot;Releasing Resources to the Front Line&quot; identified three main contributors to front line service (productive time) efficiency&mdash;information communication technologies (ICT), process redesign and work force reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.1809W.8/3">Our delivery strategy for this programme recognises that efficiencies are achieved by technology, process and work force changes being delivered together. The national health service uses an integrated service improvement programme (ISIP) to plan and manage service improvement. This programme is a key element of implementing the national programme for information technology (NPfIT). More information is available at <a href="http://www.isip.nhs.uk">www.isip.nhs.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1809W.8/4">To avoid double counting, the approach to measuring most productive time benefits is based on outcome changes, for example day case rates, inpatient length of stay and emergency admission, rather than the separate contribution of ICT or work force or process change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1809W.8/5">It is not therefore possible to determine the proportion of current or future gains attributable specifically to the NPfIT but clearly its contribution is likely to increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1809W.8/6">Details of our approach to productive time measurement and the specific measures used are explained in the Department's efficiency technical note, which is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/12/41/37/04124137.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/12/41/37/04124137.pdf</a>.</p>

Central to the control strategy is a recommendation that radon concentrations at or above an action level should be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable.

	<p pid="b.1813W.2/1">Radiation protection principles are based on the level of risk and this approach is applied when dealing with radon gas levels in buildings. The risks from the presence of radon gas have to be balanced against other factors. From a public health perspective, priority has to be given to areas and houses that are more likely to suffer from the problem and this is tackled in many ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.2/2">The Government accepted advice in a statement from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), published in 1990, on the limitation of human exposure to radon in homes and implemented the recommendations contained in the supporting document (reference NRPB. Human exposure to radon in homes. Doc. NRPB. 1, No. 1, 17-32 (1990)). (In 2005, the NRPB merged with the Health Protection Agency (HPA), becoming its Radiation Protection Division.)</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.2/3">The results of 13 European studies of indoor radon and lung cancer, taken together, provide overwhelming evidence that radon can cause lung cancer. There is no evidence of a threshold below which radon exposure is safe, and there is substantial evidence of a risk for individuals who live in homes with moderate radon concentrations as well as those with homes above 200 bequerels per metre cubed, the current United Kingdom (UK) action level. Homeowners are currently advised to apply radon reduction measures if tests show levels above the action level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.2/4">Significant efforts are being made by World Health Organisation, developed countries, UK Government and the HPA to determine how to raise awareness of the issue and to how to better tackle the whole problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.1815W.0/2">Recent assessments by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), in consultation with independent experts, have concluded that the balance of risks and benefits of mifepristone (Mifegyne, RU-486) remains positive, for use in its licensed indications in medical abortion, and that no changes to prescribing advice are needed. The MHRA is aware of deaths that have been reported in association with the use of mifepristone both in the United States (US) and in the United Kingdom. However, as there is no clear evidence that mifepristone has caused these deaths there is no basis for regulatory action or further discussions with the US authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1815W.6/1">Specialist services including treatment for sexually transmitted infections, termination of pregnancy and mental health services are available for those children who need them as a result of sexual abuse, wherever they are in England. For children with less severe mental health problems, it is more appropriate for universal services to provide the psychological support they need than for them to be referred to specialist child and adolescent mental health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.6/2">The Department and the Mental Health Foundation jointly funded a multi-centre study to evaluate the use of psychotherapy with girls aged 6 to 14 years who had been sexually abused. Two of the main findings were that high rates of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder were found and both group and individual psychotherapy were effective and improvement in the patients condition tended to continue after treatment had ended.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.6/3">It is important that Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) are developed in a way that is responsive to the needs of the populations they serve. The CAMHS standard of the children's National Service Framework (NSF) sets out the requirement for an assessment of the needs of particular groups of children in the locality who are vulnerable or at risk. The NSF also states that commissioners and services should be able to demonstrate multi-agency partnership working in the following areas: the provision of services to children and young people who may or may not have been harmed, as set out in &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot;; contributing to the assessment of complex child abuse cases; the assessment and provision of post-abuse therapeutic services; and services for looked after and adopted children.</p>

	<p pid="b.1820W.0/1">The recent consultation on the review of England's Waste Strategy puts forward proposals for a greater emphasis on the recycling of commercial and industrial waste. This includes a wider role for local authorities in fostering better recycling services for small businesses, better integration of municipal and business waste management, and the further development of markets for recycled materials. The consultation also asked for views on how best the Government can support small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in overcoming the barriers they face in recycling their waste.</p>

	<p pid="b.1820W.0/3">In addition, the recently created Waste Infrastructure Development Programme is considering how to encourage local authorities to allow for appropriate, larger facilities that can serve the non-municipal sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.0/4">The Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme also plays a key role in reducing the amount of commercial waste sent to landfill&mdash;returning &pound;284 million to businesses over three years through resource efficiency and waste minimisation programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1820W.0/5">The Waste and Resource Action Programme (WRAP) has set up a pilot project providing sector-specific help for small businesses, and the Environment Agency (EA) is developing a pilot internet service called 'What do I do with my waste?'.

	<p pid="b.1822W.0/1">Based on returns supplied to the Environment Agency by the facility operators, 5,406 tonnes (48.6 per cent.) out of a total of 11,122 tonnes of waste landfilled at three licensed facilities in Herefordshire in 2002-03 were of commercial origin. This is the last year for which fully quality assured data are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1822W.0/2">This is a relatively small amount compared both to the total waste land-filled in the West Midlands (6,623,554 tonnes) and to the total waste dealt with (through treatment, transfer and disposal) in Herefordshire (167,846 tonnes). The tonnage deposited in landfills is likely to decrease further over subsequent years as landfill sites come under stricter regulation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1823W.0/1">Last year the Government launched the Courtauld Commitment, a voluntary agreement between 13 major retailers and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to reduce packaging waste. There are three broad objectives to meet, which are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1823W.0/2" class="indent">i. to design out packaging waste growth by 2008;</p>
	<p pid="b.1823W.0/3" class="indent">ii. to deliver absolute reductions in packaging waste by March 2010; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1823W.0/4" class="indent">iii. to identify ways to tackle the problem of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.1823W.0/5">There are also two sets of regulations which cover packaging in the UK both of which encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore, businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they handle. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1823W.0/6">Both regulations have led to decreases in packaging used around products. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging that is produced. We have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find solutions to this problem and to let me have recommendations for ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1823W.0/7">Although legislation is one way of reducing packaging, consumers also have a part to play. If consumers make a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, buy &quot;loose&quot; food rather than pre-packaged food and use their reusable shopping bags, manufacturers would be more inclined to think about the type and the quantity of packaging around their products.</p>

The work has now been completed and has taken into account existing deposit and return schemes in other parts of Europe, the USA and Canada.

	<p pid="b.1824W.2/2">The Department has also had discussions with the Advisory Committee on Packaging, regarding the impact of a deposit system.

	<p pid="b.1825W.9/1">The Real Nappy Scheme is funded through the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) and run by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP). WRAP publishes an annual report, which lists the achievements of each of its programmes. WRAP's accounts are audited on an annual basis by their own auditors, like any other company, and the Real Nappy Programme is considered as part of that process. In addition, the National Audit Office (NAO) is carrying out an investigation into reducing the reliance on landfill in England. As part of that process, they have considered the impact of WIP including the Real Nappy Programme. It is expected that the finalised NAO report will be available later this summer.</p>

One key purpose of this campaign was to set the tone of acceptable behaviour and how the use of alcohol would be policed both for the World Cup and the summer. The campaign did not extend into the period of the World Cup itself, as the police service has its own well-established plans for policing during major sporting events which are funded through the service's mainstream resources.</p>

	<p pid="b.1829W.2/1">Building and enforcing a modern culture of respect and tackling antisocial behaviour is a priority for the Government. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-10">10 January</phrase> the Government published the Respect Action Plan. The plan is central to the Government's drive to step up and broaden the clampdown on antisocial behaviour and to promote good behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/2">Prior to this the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 put in place a range of measures to tackle antisocial behaviour and gave local agencies the tools they need to tackle antisocial behaviour on the ground. Key measures in the Act include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/3" class="indent">Powers to close premises where drugs are used unlawfully.</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/4" class="indent">Powers enabling social landlords to take action against antisocial tenants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/5" class="indent">A package of support and sanctions to enable parents to prevent and tackle antisocial behaviour among children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/6" class="indent">Powers to allow police officers to disperse groups of people who are causing nuisance or intimidating others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/7" class="indent">Powers for environmental health officers to close noisy premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/8" class="indent">Powers to tackle graffiti and fly-posting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/9">The Housing Act 2004 also contained important measures to enable landlords to tackle antisocial behaviour. A survey of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships and Community Safety Partnerships in England and Wales in 2005 found that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1829W.2/10" class="indent">514 crack house closure orders were made between January 2004 and September 2005;</p>

	<p pid="b.1830W.11/1">There is continuing interest in the further development of CCTV across the country. The Government offices in the regions have a role in ensuring all interested parties, including local authorities and town and parish councils are involved, both in the planning and in finding the appropriate funds. Although there is no National CCTV strategy at the moment, work is under way to produce one by the end of the year. Under the Crime Reduction Programme, Central Government provided &pound;869,000 funding during 2001-02 for Leeds Watch Local, a CCTV scheme under the second round of the CCTV initiative. Money has been made more widely available since then through general crime reduction funding streams, for example under the Building Safer Communities Fund (BSCF).The allocation for CCTV cameras in the Leeds city council district over the last three years was &pound;2,170,000. Exact figures at town and parish council level are not held but funding, where allocated locally, was split fairly equally at approximately &pound;720,000 each year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1833W.5/1">Since the introduction of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) in April 2003, over 45,000 drug misusing offenders have entered treatment through DIP. The programme continues to have a positive impact in communities not only through the interventions that it offers but also by delivering a more integrated approach by local agencies to the problems of offenders. Acquisitive recorded crime&mdash;to which drug related crime (including theft) makes a substantial contribution&mdash;fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005 compared with the previous 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.5/2">The programme is highly regarded by operational staff and the many offenders whose lives it has helped to change. Its success has been achieved through a combination of additional resources, new legislation, revised working practices and a stronger focus on partnership working.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.5/3">We are on track to achieve the overall target of 1,000 offenders a week (4,300 a month) into treatment by 2008. In April 2006 over 2,800 offenders engaged in treatment through DIP. The programme continues to be developed and strengthened. For example, from <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> testing on arrest has been rolled out to 98 areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.5/4">Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a drugs worker. Testing on arrest is a way of identifying drug misusers at an early stage in the criminal justice process. Restriction on bail is now available across all local justice areas in England.</p>

Examples of these projects are; The National Roadshow of Influential Populist Scholars, work with the UK Youth Parliament seeking new and effective tools for engagement and youth workshops to challenge the radicalisation of Muslim youth. The Prison Service have commissioned a three year project on how prison service policies on preparing prisoners for release meets the needs of Muslim prisoners. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office have a full programme of media intensive visits by British Muslim delegations to a number of countries in the Muslim world. And as a Government we are committed to prioritising policies that tackle the real and perceived socio-economic inequalities confronting Muslim communities today. As well as focusing on tackling the issue of young Muslims being influenced and exploited by extremists, the Home Office has funded a number of initiatives in Burnley, Oldham and Bradford which are involved in engaging young people at risk of joining far right extremist organisations. The Home Office also works closely with Rewind a project aimed at tackling issues of racism among young people. We are also supporting an initiative in Blackburn with Darwen which will bring together young girls across faith groups to discuss issues of racism and extremism.</p>

	<p pid="b.1837W.9/1">It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the number of people trafficked into the UK for sexual or labour exploitation and particularly by reference to the year and country of origin. An indicator of the number of victims involved in this type of trafficking is the number of referrals to the Poppy project. Since the scheme's inception in 2003 a total of 184 women who met the criteria for the project have been referred to it (out of a total of 451 referrals between March 2003 and the end of March 2006). However, the scheme operates mainly in London and has tightly focused criteria, so the number of victims nationwide is likely to be higher. A breakdown of the country of origin for women who met the criteria for the Poppy project follows. Operation Pentameter, a police-led, multi-agency initiative aimed at tackling the trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation has resulted in the rescue of 75 women since its launch on the <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase>. These cases are subject to on-going investigation and as such it would not be appropriate to disclose the country of origin of the potential trafficking victims. The Home Office has commissioned CEOP, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, to conduct an intelligence gathering exercise to scope the problem of child trafficking in the UK; initial findings are expected in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1837W.9/2">There is currently little information on the scale of trafficking for labour exploitation and officials are considering ways in which our knowledge can be improved. Illegal working statistics may provide some indication of the possible size of the illegal working market. Statistical returns are provided on a monthly basis by local enforcement offices, showing the breakdown by nationality of those encountered during illegal working operations. There is currently no facility available to record whether those encountered have been trafficked for the purpose of labour exploitation. However, following are statistics available for illegal working operations for each financial year since 2002 with the top five nationalities identified (figures are not available prior to 2002). 2002-03&mdash;A total of 301 operations were reported; a total of 1,099 offenders were encountered. Poland, Lithuania, Brazil, Ukraine and Pakistan were the top five nationalities identified in descending order. 2003-04&mdash;A total of 697 operations were reported in 2003-04; a total of 2,304 offenders were encountered. Brazil, Poland, Lithuania, Bangladesh and Ukraine were the top five nationalities identified in descending order. 2004-05&mdash;A total of 3,314 operations were reported in 2004-05; a total of 9,227 offenders were encountered. Turkey, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Brazil were the top five nationalities identified in descending order.</p>

	<p pid="b.1838W.2/1">In April the Home Office entered into a two-year, &pound;2.4 million funding agreement with Eaves Housing for Women for the expansion of the Poppy project. This funding will not only provide for the existing crisis provision service for up to 25 women, it will also meet the costs of 10 additional &quot;step-down&quot; places which will help the women to live semi-independently with less intensive support, and the development of a resource pack for victims, service providers and law enforcement agency staff. It will also introduce the first ever specialist national outreach service in the UK for victims trafficked into sexual exploitation. Whilst the project remains London based it will continue to take referrals from across the country and provide a national service. We are currently looking at how best to utilise other existing local service providers to support victims and will continue to consider the feasibility of further extending the Poppy model of support to other areas in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1839W.2/1">The Government have taken a number of steps to deter child trafficking into the UK. They have, for example, strengthened the legislative framework by including the offence of trafficking children in the Sexual Offences Act, 2003 and the Asylum and Immigration Act, 2004. Additionally, the Sexual Offences Act introduced new offences of &quot;abuse of children through prostitution and pornography&quot; which aim to protect children under the age of 18. The law enforcement response to human trafficking is co-ordinated by Reflex, the multi agency task force on organised immigration crime, established in 2000. Reflex has been working closely with police forces in the regions to increase awareness of human trafficking and build capacity to tackle it. A key thrust of its activity is to develop our intelligence base, thereby improving our knowledge and understanding of the extent and nature of child trafficking within the UK. The establishment of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> brings a renewed focus on improving intelligence and targeting those organised crime groups causing the most harm. The previous Home Secretary (Mr. Clarke) made clear in his letter to all chief constables, in June 2005, that police forces should increase their efforts against organised immigration crime, focusing particularly on human trafficking. A national action plan is being developed this year incorporating the responses from the UK consultation on tackling human trafficking. The action plan will include measures to deter child trafficking. Responses to the plan from stakeholders are currently being collated with a view to publishing a summary report of these on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June 2006</phrase>. The Government are increasing their engagement with developing countries in helping to eradicate the root causes of trafficking such as poverty, social exclusion, discrimination against women, girls and inequality. The Government are working with several overseas countries to prevent human trafficking by helping to tackle poverty and removing the conditions that lead to forced migration. The Government are also seeking to build the capacity of these countries to combat trafficking by improving ways of stemming the problem. Through our embassies and consulates we are working to raise awareness in source countries on the dangers of trafficking among potential victims.</p>

	<p pid="b.1839W.5/1">Children who have been identified as having been trafficked and who are considered to be at risk are looked after by local authorities under section 20 of the 1989 Children Act. The arrangements for trafficked children as for other children in need in the UK are matters for local authorities to decide based on careful analysis of the risks, the needs and the circumstances facing that particular child.</p>
	<p pid="b.1839W.5/2">The Home Office National Asylum Seekers Service (NASS) is conducting a review together with the Department for Education and Skills, to ensure that safe arrangements for lone asylum-seeking children who have been assessed as being at risk from traffickers can be incorporated in those for other unaccompanied foreign national minors in need of support. This work will be carried out in partnership with the most knowledgeable and experienced local authorities. Her Majesty's Government are aware that children returned to certain countries could be put at risk of further harm, with the likelihood of being re-trafficked. As a general principle, therefore, children will only be returned, where it is considered both possible and safe to do so and only after a full assessment of each case has been thoroughly carried out. Before considering the return of a child, full consideration is given to the Government's obligations under the immigration laws and the European Convention on Human Rights and the unique circumstances of each case including an assessment of the country of origin.</p>

	<p pid="b.1844W.12/1">We have no plans to change the guidance in Annex C in HOC 46/2004, which was issued to provide for a fairer and more consistent framework within which police authorities review the injury pensions they are paying. Police authorities have a statutory responsibility to consider at suitable intervals whether the pensioner's loss of earning capacity has altered. The relevant provision is now set out in regulation 37 of the Police (Injury Benefit) Regulations 2006, but the legal obligation has been in place since before 1987, when the previous regulations were made.

	<p pid="b.1845W.2/1">While no assessment has been made of the effect of the creation of larger police forces on response times, we believe that strategic forces will have greater capability and capacity to deliver effective protective services, response policing and neighbourhood policing for all their communities. Targets on response times are set and monitored locally. It is an operational matter for the chief constable of each area to decide how he or she wishes to deploy the available resources to best serve their communities.</p>

The Prison Service is part of the MAPPA &quot;Responsible Authority&quot; with the Police and Probation and a protocol exists between the agencies which has been signed by the Area Manager. This requires the Area Manager to ensure consistent representation at strategic management board. The main responsibilities of the Prison Service and the Area Manager are to ensure that operational functions work consistently in prisons.

	<p pid="b.1848W.2/26">In reading the data supplied in the table, the following factors should be considered:</p>
	<p pid="b.1848W.2/27" class="indent">(i) the data include crimes committed on train journeys ending at these locations as well as those occurring on the stations themselves; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1848W.2/28" class="indent">(ii) the Home Office introduced a National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) that all police forces across England and Wales were required to adopt. BTP adopted this standard on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. The impact of the new recording standard saw an increase in recorded crime, equating to an average 22 per cent. increase recorded by all police forces across England and Wales. The basic principle of NCRS is that if on the balance of probability a crime has been committed it is recorded as a crime. As a result 2001-02 data cannot be meaningfully compared with subsequent years. The standard has made crime recording more victim focused.</p>

	<p pid="b.1850W.2/1">The SIA do not calculate the average processing times for applications. Some, such as those involving overseas criminal records checks, unavoidably take a considerable time. The SIA have a published target of processing 80 per cent. of all applications within six weeks, measured from the date that a properly completed application enters the processing system to the date that a licence is issued. From April 2004 until August 2005 the SIA processed 62 per cent. within six weeks and 88 per cent. within nine weeks. Since September 2005, there has been a backlog of applications that have been waiting to enter the system. These have added an additional time of between two and four weeks to the process, so it is now taking up to 10 weeks to process most applications.</p>

	<p pid="b.1851W.5/2">Local authorities can place restrictions on public drinking in areas with a history of alcohol-related crime, disorder or nuisance by making a Designated Public Place Order (DPPO), sometimes referred to as an 'alcohol control zone'. The power, given under section 13 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, is not available to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and can only be exercised by local government. Current figures reveal that around 170 authorities now have adopted this measure, with around 360 Orders published in England and Wales.</p>

This change means that comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications in 1984 and 1994. *The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with caution. Articles specifically examining the effect of the change in classification for circulatory disease and cancer trends were published in Health Statistics Quarterly 22 and 23. **More information about these changes, as well as the results of the study, can be found on the National Statistics website at www.statistics.gov.uk/icdl0mortality. *Mortality statistics: Cause 1984.
