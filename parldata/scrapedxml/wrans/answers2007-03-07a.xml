	<p pid="a.1979W.9/16">Harmony Guidelines for the RAF are based on formed unit tour intervals rather than individual personnel, whereby formed units, or sub-elements within them should spend four months on deployed operations followed by 16 months at base.</p>
	<p pid="a.1979W.9/17">The RAF Individual Separated Service assumption is that an individual should spend no more than 140 days of duty detached away from home in a rolling 12 month period. This allows for a four-month operational tour followed by three weeks of separated service due to routine tasks, unestablished commitments, unit assistance, pre-detachment training etc.</p>

	<p pid="a.1980W.2/1">The welfare and community support of service personnel and their families is core MOD business. This includes family liaison, which has always been exercised by personnel who have command responsibility as an integral part of their duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1980W.2/2">Each of the three services has robust structures in place to support and liaise with families and service individuals; the support offered is wide-ranging tailored to the requirements of the individual concerned. Examples of this include the support provided to families when the service spouse is deployed on operations. In such circumstances, units organise families' briefing sessions, coffee mornings, cr&egrave;ches and community social events. Assistance is also provided to enable families to keep in touch with their loved ones through the provision of publicly funded internet and email terminals at local community and education centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.1980W.2/3">Specialist charitable organisations such as the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmans' Families Association and the Army Welfare Service are also available to offer assistance. Services offered overseas include the running of the confidential helpline and the provision of contracted community support, some medical care and social work elements. In the UK, they may come into contact with families for a whole host of reasons. The issues dealt with span, the full spectrum of service and private life that may affect individuals or families from time to time.</p>

	<p pid="a.1983W.11/2">The Ministry of Defence has a unified philosophy towards equality and diversity. In support of this approach the MOD Diversity Panel, co-chaired by the Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), and the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and which includes a mix of internal and external members who have a range of experience in diversity issues, have endorsed a Unified Diversity Strategy. This strategy provides the strategic framework and incorporates our Diversity Vision; Diversity Mission; Objectives; Working in Partnership; Taking Responsibility; Complying with the Legislation; communicating and Building Commitment; Measuring Progress and the Business Case for Diversity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1983W.11/3">In April 2006, we published our first overarching MOD Equality and Diversity Scheme 2006-2009, together with a set of Action Plans for 2006-07. The Scheme encompasses the armed forces, civilians, the Ministry of Defence police and our executive agencies. This Scheme reflects not only the Department's statutory duties in respect of race, disability and gender but also those diversity strands not yet covered by specific public sector duties (age, sexual orientation and religion and belief).</p>
	<p pid="a.1983W.11/4">Our first annual Action Plan included our gender equality priorities. We will be publishing a report against the targets that we set for 2006-07 later in the year as well as issuing a new Action Plan for 2007-08. The Defence Analytical Services Agency will, be collecting statistical data on the recruitment, retention and progression of women. The aim of all this work is to achieve real improvement in outcomes for the various diversity groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.1986W.5/53">Mental health occupational therapists are now not employed by the MOD. Our current community-based mental health provision is occupationally orientated and aims to manage patients in their work/home environment. This is done by a multi-disciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, mental health nurseswith access to both clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. The employment of specific occupational therapists is no longer necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1986W.5/54">The MOD employed mental health occupational therapists up until 2003 at the Duchess of Kent Psychiatric Hospital. The mental health occupational therapists that were employed were civilian.

We continue to reiterate our unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of our nuclear arsenal leading to nuclear disarmament as required under 'Step 6', most recently expressed by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva last month. With regards to 'Step 9', we have undertaken several unilateral steps towards nuclear disarmament including reductions in warhead numbers, increased transparency by publishing historical accounting records of our defence fissile material holdings and significant reductions of the operational status of our nuclear weapons system. We have also pursued a widely welcomed programme to develop UK expertise in methods and technologies that could be used to verify nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988W.14/2">Finally, we have pressed consistently for early entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the commencement of negotiations, without preconditions, of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament.</p>

	<p pid="a.1989W.2/1">The planned reduction in the maximum number of operationally available warheads to fewer than 160, announced in December last year represents a 20 per cent. decrease from the previously declared maximum number. I intend that this reduction will take place this year. This reduction is pertinent to the UK's obligations under the nuclear non proliferation treaty and means that, since coming to power in 1997, the Government will have reduced the overall explosive power of the UK's nuclear arsenal by around 75 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.2000W.5/1">Companies, large and small, in a range of sectors from construction to business services will be needed to deliver the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, creating valuable procurement opportunities across the UK. The London 2012 website (<a href="http://www.london2012.org/en/gettinginvolved/Business/">www. london2012.org/en/gettinginvolved/Business/</a>) contains the most up-to-date information about business opportunities, including a new e-tendering facility, advance notice of contracts ahead of tender competitions, and information about past and upcoming business events. The website also allows businesses to register their interest in being a supplier to the Games and sign up to receive e-alerts. 467 businesses from the East Midlands have already signed up for this service.</p>
	<p pid="a.2000W.5/2">Working with London 2012, the London Business Board and other agencies, the East Midlands Development Agency (emda) has played a leading role in the development of the national Business Opportunities Network. The Network will be launched soon and will build upon existing information on the London 2012 website about business opportunities and timelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.2000W.5/3">Businesses in the region will also stand to benefit from the work of the East Midlands Group for the 2012 Games chaired by emda. It will target business opportunities for the region and deliver a business support programme. A regional business opportunities group has also been established to help the region understand how local businesses want to engage with, and contribute to, the Games. It is chaired by one of Leicester's leading lawyers and comprises representatives from business organisations, the construction sector and the Learning and Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.2000W.5/4">Working below the regional level, each county in the region has set up its own steering group. Leicestershire's is chaired by the chief executive of the local sub regional partnership (Leicestershire Economic Partnership) and comprises representatives from across all sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.2002W.0/1">The successful elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2006 were a major step forward in securing lasting peace in the DRC. The people of the DRC have a democratically elected President, parliament and provincial assemblies for the first time since 1960. However, the elections are only the first step towards peace and the DRC Government, with co-ordinated support from international partners, will need to tackle several priority issues to maintain the political settlement achieved through the elections and consolidate peace and security:</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.0/2" class="indent">Reform of the army, police and justice system, to ensure they provide security for DRC's citizens and legal and peaceful means of addressing grievances and resolving disputes;</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.0/3" class="indent">Ensuring the new democratic system as inclusive as possible so that all groups feel their voices are heard and that the Government are accountable; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.0/4" class="indent">Ensuring that the Government delivers early and tangible benefits to DRC's population.</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.0/5">I believe that now is a time for cautious optimism for the DRC. Success or failure at sustaining peace ultimately depends on the choice of DRC's politicians, however, the international community can continue to provide vital political, technical and financial support to help increase the chances of success. DFIDhas rapidly increased its support to the DRC, from &pound;5.56 million in 2001-02 to &pound;67 million available this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.2018W.8/1">Preventing the importation of cocaine from Latin America into the UK is a top priority for the UK's international counter-narcotics efforts. The UK works closely with host governments to disrupt trafficking, and to seize consignments of illicit drugs and their financial proceeds. We are helping to build capacity among the region's law enforcement agencies and judiciary, with the provision of training and equipment. We work closely with other partners including the EU and US to maximise joint effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018W.8/2">The UK devotes considerable resources within the region in its fight against cocaine and in helping to reduce harm to the UK. Through its Drugs and Crime Fund, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has allocated some &pound;1.7 million to specific projects to support counter-narcotics efforts in the Latin American region since 2005. For the financial year commencing April 2007, a sum of &pound;960,000 has provisionally been allocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018W.8/3">The Government take a broad approach to tackling the trade in illicit drugs, through a mix of political engagement, capacity building and law enforcement support in producer, transit and consumer countries. This includes working with governments of producer and transit countries in Latin America, as well as with governments in countries along the main trafficking routes for drugs from Latin America (especially through the Caribbean and West Africa).</p>

An estimated two million people have been displaced in Darfur and a further two million remained displaced as a result of the earlier conflict between the north and south; though many of the latter are now returning. As a result of the Darfur conflict there are 233,000 Darfuri refugees in eastern Chad. There are 340,000 refugees from southern Sudan in neighbouring countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.2022W.2/1">Some progress is being made on the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). A Government of National Unity has been established in Khartoum. The Sudanese armed forces are redeploying from the south ahead of schedule and integrated northern/southern military units have been created. The administration in the south is starting to develop and roads are starting to be built there. A new currency has been launched in southern Sudan.</p>

Figures for earlier years are not readily available and it would incur disproportionate cost to compile them.</p>

	<p pid="a.2035W.2/2">The cost of means-tested benefits for each year from 2006 to 2050 is set out in the following table. The level of administration subsidy paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to local authorities in 2006-07 is &pound;555 million. The cost of administering pension credit claims in 2006 is not available. The cost of administering pension credit claims during the year to March 2005 has been estimated as &pound;237 million. This figure is an approximate assessment only. The Pension Service continues to develop its unit cost information and a modern resource management system which will support improved costing analysis is being developed. The timescales of when this will be rolled out across the Department are not currently known.</p>

The White Paper 'Strong and Prosperous Communities' set out our proposals for a new performance framework forlocal government, which will support continued improvement for all.

	<p pid="a.2045W.3/1">At the Prime Minister's Summit on guns and gangs on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>, a three-point plan was announced focusing on policing, powers and prevention. This work-plan includes a review of legislation relating to gangs, which will look at sentencing of juveniles, and gang membership as an aggravating factor in sentencing and other issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/2">We are working closely with ACPO on the related issues of gangs, guns and drugs supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/3">We are also working with the Metropolitan police on the development of an operational toolkit on gangs; developing a community-focused toolkit to provide advice to parents and young people; and working in conjunction with the Department for Education and Skills on a toolkit on gangs aimed as schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/4">There are a number of wide-ranging national and local programmes that tackle gang-related issues:</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/5" class="indent">The Youth Inclusion Programme established in 2000 provides tailor-made programmes for 13 to16-year-olds identified locally (by police, schools, social services etc.) as engaged in crime, or being at most risk of offending, truancy, or social exclusion. In first three years of programme, arrest rates for the 50 young people considered to be most at risk of crime had been reduced by 65 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/6" class="indent">Safer Schools Partnerships were launched in 2002. With 370 police officers in selected schools in areas with high levels of street crime, the partnerships aim to reduce victimisation, and criminal and antisocial behaviour within the school and its community.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/7" class="indent">The Positive Futures scheme provides lifestyle, educational and employment opportunities for young people living in deprived areas. Between 2003 and 2006 &pound;15 million of funding from the Home Office and &pound;3 million from Football Foundation, plus individual funding from local supporters, was provided. Since 2000 over 26,000 children have been involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/8" class="indent">The Manchester Multi-Agency Gangs strategy is a partnership which helps young people exit gangs, working intensively with young people and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/9" class="indent">The West Midlands Mediation and Transformation Service provides conflict resolution and support services, which have defused tension and aim to help young people exit gangs.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/10" class="indent">Other programmes such as From Boyhood to Manhood focus on helping young men develop self-esteem. Boys are referred to the FBMF by local education authorities, special needs departments, youth-offending teams and social services departments. The FBMF helps them to get back on track through its day-programme of education and self-development.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/11" class="indent">Other local programmes include the &quot;Defending Da Hood&quot; programme in Waltham Forest to engage with hard-to-reach young people in order to discuss issues which are relevant to them, and raise awareness of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/12">We also support local initiatives through the Connected Fund, which was established in 2004. The sixth round was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase> and will accept applications from small community organisations working on gangs issues for grants up to &pound;5,000. The closing date for bids is <phrase class="date" code="">12 April</phrase>. We have also provided project funding via the Government offices for the regions and directly to projects such as the Urban Concepts &quot;Don't Trigger&quot; anti-gun crime campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.2045W.3/13">Long-term prevention work includes parenting support to ensure that young people are given guidance in their developing years, volunteering programmes to help young people and provide alternative activities, and mentoring services to support young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.2046W.5/2">Disclosures are primarily designed to be used by an employer at the point of recruitment for a particular position. Ultimately it is for each employer and not the CRB to decide whether a fresh disclosure should be applied for, bearing in mind their legal and other responsibilities and subject to any statutory requirements. There are a number of reasons why an employer may not wish to accept a disclosure that has been processed for a previous employment position, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.2046W.5/3" class="indent">The disclosure may not be at the right level (there are two different levels of CRB check; standard and enhanced);</p>
	<p pid="a.2046W.5/4" class="indent">The older a disclosure is the less reliant the information is, because the information it contains may not be up to date;</p>
	<p pid="a.2046W.5/5" class="indent">Information revealed through a CRB check reflects the information that was available at the time of its issue&mdash;a person may have committed a crime in the intervening period;</p>
	<p pid="a.2046W.5/6" class="indent">An organisation or employer may be required by law to carry out a fresh check against the Protection of Children Act List (PoCA) and/or the Protection of Vulnerable Adults List Act (POVA), thereby limiting the use of portability.</p>

	<p pid="a.2050W.2/2">As announced at the Prime Minister's Summit on guns and gangs on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>, we are tackling gun crime with a three-point plan, focusing on:</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.2/3" class="indent">Policing&mdash;ensuring the police are equipped to tackle gun crime;</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.2/4" class="indent">Powers&mdash;giving the police and courts the powers to deal with offenders; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.2/5" class="indent">Prevention&mdash;empowering communities to take action themselves to prevent gun crime and gang culture and offering support to parents to challenge their children's behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.2/6">This comprehensive approach draws together the broad range of work currently underway including tough new gun laws, intelligence-driven policing initiatives and community-led projects and will be taken forward by the Home Office Round Table on Guns, Gangs and Knives which is chaired by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.2/7">In April we will introduce a new offence of 'using someone to mind a weapon', meaning that people who pass weapons to girlfriends, younger siblings or other gang members will still face prosecution. People should not think they can get away with passing off their gun to someone else. Unlawful possession of a prohibited firearm means five years in jail, and this will now also apply to people who use others to look after their weapons for them. This measure was passed in the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 and will become an offence this spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.2/8">ACPO are already leading work on issues around the international market in firearms and supply, building up a national intelligence picture of the scale and nature of the problem around guns and gangs and working with individual forces to tackle problems proactively and robustly.</p>

	<p pid="a.2051W.5/1">The Government are fully committed to fulfilling the requirements of the 3rd European Union Money Laundering Directive. Part 7 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 is compliant with the directive. In respect of the three issues identified, it will not be necessary for the Government to bring forward new legislation to achieve compliance. These obligations will be fulfilled by other means.</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.5/2">The Government recognises that the importance of protecting the identity of those making suspicious activity reports (SARs) to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), and has taken firm action to address this matter. After consultation with the private sector we issued detailed guidance to the police, other law enforcement agencies, and prosecution agencies on the importance of confidentiality in the handling of SARs. Adherence to this guidance is a condition of access to the SARs database maintained by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. This issue was also addressed in Sir Stephen Lander's review of the SARs regime which was published in April 2006. SOCA has subsequently set up a dedicated telephone line to enable any breaches of the guidelines to be reported. We will keep the guidance under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.5/3">SOCA has governance of the SARs regime and will be reporting to Ministers on its effectiveness through an annual report in October 2007. An unclassified version will be published on the SOCA website thereafter. This will include information on breaches of confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.5/4">SOCA regularly shares information on trends and specific threats in money laundering activities with the reporting institutions, the regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies. In addition, SOCA has established the following mechanisms to facilitate effective governance and dialogue about the SARs regime:</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.5/5" class="indent">a sub-committee of SOCA's board to oversee the regime's governance. Membership is comprised of representatives from the reporting sector, regulators, SOCA and end users;</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.5/6" class="indent">a vetted group, comprised of representatives of the reporting sectors, of law enforcement and of the key policy departments, to discuss sensitive casework and reporting issues, and to clear the distribution of SOCA Alerts and guidance;</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.5/7" class="indent">Sector specific seminars, aimed at providing directed feedback to individual sectors;</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.5/8" class="indent">a regulators' forum, to provide regulators with information about reporting within their sectors; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.5/9" class="indent">an alerts branch to issue warnings and advice to encourage businesses, the public and others to take appropriate action against serious organised crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.2057W.2/1">All published material is subject to the Obscene Publications Act 1959 (OPA). Under this Act, it is a criminal offence to publish any article which is considered to be obscene; that is, an article, which, in the view of the court, tends to 'deprave and corrupt' a person who is likely to see hear or read it. This is a flexible test which has been shown to apply to material at a lower threshold where children are likely to access it. The OPA applies equally to material published over the internet, including material made available through file-sharing programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.2/2">The Government, through the Home Secretary's Task Force for Child Protection on the Internet, is also promoting the development of a BSI kitemark for computer safety software which will help parents and carers choose the most effective technical means of protecting children from unsuitable internet based content and services, including those which prevent the use of file-sharing software. There is also to be new Safety Software Sub Group of the Taskforce to encourage internet and software services to seek accreditation, encourage take-up of the software by parents, and to ensure a process for review and updating the standard if it proves effective.</p>

These set out minimum standards to be followed in the event of any failure to comply with a requirement of a sentence. There is no specific guidance on recall of sex offenders. probation officers are trained to assess the level of risk in each case, including sex offenders, and act in order to protect the public.</p>

RRS acts on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Circular includes specific instructions for emergency requests, where the offender presents a high, or increasing, risk of serious harm and is subject to Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements. In such cases, the offender's licence is revoked within two hours of notification.</p>

	<p pid="a.2064W.6/1">My colleagues in the Department of Constitutional Affairs set out the Government's position on data sharing last September. Of course this must be done in a responsible manner but we believe there can be significant advantages for the public if different Departments co-operate to ensure services are personalised and built around individual needs rather than forcing people to give the same information, over and over again, to different Departments and agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.2066W.3/1">Local authorities have an existing duty to carry out an annual assessment of child care provision in their area, including out-of-school provision for 11-year-olds. From April 2007, the ChildcareAct 2006 places a new duty on local authorities to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the sufficiency of child care in their area, taking into account for all age groups the demand for child care, supply of child are, and any gaps between the two. Jobcentre Plus are designated 'partners' of local authorities in the fulfilment of this duty. Recently published statutory guidance highlights the importance of considering the child care needs of lone parents and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.2066W.3/2">Local authorities must complete their first sufficiency assessment within one year in order to prepare for their new duty, coming into force in April 2008, to secure sufficient child care provision to enable parents to enter or remain in work, or to make the transition to work. Statutory guidance will make it clear that local authorities will need to ensure that there is sufficient provision available to meet the needs of families at risk of social exclusion, including lone parent families. The greater availability of child care should make it easier for lone parents to return to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.2076W.2/1">The Department issues guidance on arrangements for money to follow permanently excluded pupils. This is published online at:</p>
	<p pid="a.2076W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/behaviour/exclusion/guidance/part8/">http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/behaviour/exclusion/guidance/part8/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.2076W.2/3">In addition to these statutory arrangements local authorities have discretion to include in their local funding formula a factor that makes a further adjustment to a school's budget for a permanent exclusion. This provides the local authority with additional funding that can be used to support the pupil while he attends a Pupil Referral Unit or other provision or be given to an admitting school.</p>
	<p pid="a.2076W.2/4">Currently local authorities are committed to providing suitable full-time education for all permanently excluded pupils from the 16<sup>(th )</sup>day of their exclusion until such time as they are admitted to another school. From<phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2007</phrase> (subject to Parliamentary approval) there will be a statutory duty on local authorities to provide suitable full-time education for all permanently excluded pupils from the 6<sup>(th )</sup>day of their exclusion. We estimate the cost to local authorities of provisionfor pupils that have been permanently excluded is&pound;3.5 million in 2007-08 (for September 2007 to March 2008), which local authorities will need to meet from within the 5 per cent. increase in the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) per pupil that all authorities have received for 2007-08. Subject to the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, funding will be included in authorities' DSG allocations for 2008-09 and beyond to cover the whole year cost. Guidance on implementing day 6 provision is published online</p>

	<p pid="a.2076W.5/1">The Government believe there is no place for homophobic bullying in schools and our general guidance on bullying and the Anti-Bullying Charter make this clear. In 2004 my Department and the Department of Health jointly published guidance on challenging homophobia in schools called &quot;Stand up for us&quot;. Recognising that homophobic bullying can be a particularly difficult issue for many teachersto deal with, my Department has more recently commissioned Stonewall and Educational Action Challenging Homophobia (EACH) to produce web-based guidance for schools which will look more specifically at how to prevent and tackle homophobic bullying. We intend to issue the guidance later this year and will follow this up with a series of regional seminars for local authorities and schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.2076W.5/2">The responsibility for ensuring that teachers are not discriminated against at work rests with their employer (the governing body of the school or thelocal authority). The Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 outlaws discrimination and harassment in employment and vocational training on the grounds of sexual orientation, and schools and staff representatives work together to ensure that the framework provided by the Regulations keep all school staff free from homophobic bullying and harassment.</p>

	<p pid="a.2078W.0/19">Media coverage of the issue of student loan borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt during the passage of the Enterprise Act in 2002 may have contributed to the rise in bankruptcies in 2003 and 2004. In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one.</p>
	<p pid="a.2078W.0/20">Provisions were therefore included in the Higher Education Act 2004 to prevent student loans being written off on bankruptcy. This may explain the subsequent fall. While borrowers who have become bankrupt remain liable to repay their student loans, they continue to benefit from the same terms as other borrowers, with repayments linked to income and no obligation to repay if their annual income is below &pound;15,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.2079W.2/4" class="indent">In rely to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of Stat for Work and Pensions, whether Child Support Agency staff have received guidance on the prioritisation of the Agency's caseload by age of case; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/6" class="indent">The Secretary of State sets a number of targets to measure the performance, and set the priorities, of the Child Support Agency on a yearly basis. The Secretary of State's case clearance target by March 2007 is to clear 55 per cent. of cases received that month within 12 weeks, and 80 per cent. of cases within 26 weeks. In addition, under the Operational Improvement Plan, the Agency is committed to reducing the number of uncleared new scheme applications by 25 per cent. by March 2007. The Agency issues guidance to its employees in order to ensure people and resources are effectively deployed to meet these targets and commitments, and to ensure more money gets to more children as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/7" class="indent">As of December 2006, 55 per cent. of Agency cases were cleared within 12 weeks, up from 49 per cent. on December 2005, and 74 per cent. of cases were cleared within 26 weeks, up from 64 per cent. in December 2005. Further, as of December 2006 the number of uncleared new scheme applications stood as 186,000 and the total number of uncleared cases in the last three months has been the lowest since comparable records began in 1999.</p>

	<p pid="a.2080W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what additional amount of unpaid maintenance debt has been recovered in each month since the introduction of the Operational Improvement Plan; what new debt accrued in each month; what maintenance remained uncollected in each month; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/6" class="indent">The Operational Improvement Plan announced in Parliament on 9<sup>(th)</sup> February 2006 and launched in April 2006 aims over the next three years to improve our service to clients, increase the amount of money we collect, achieve greater compliance from non-resident parents and as a result achieve a reduction in child poverty and a better standard of living for many more children.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/7" class="indent">The initial phase of the Operational Improvement Plan has focused on the organisational and operational restructuring of the Agency, and the training of our people to increase our capacity and capability. No commitments were made for the first year but once this phase is complete we can expect to see more clearly the benefits of the Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/8" class="indent">Even now early results show improvements in several key areas and more money is already getting to more children; at the end of December 2006 compared with a year ago:</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/9" class="indent">58,000 more children were in receipt of maintenance or had a maintenance direct arrangement in place</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/10" class="indent">59 per cent of new scheme cases with a liability made a payment or arranged Maintenance Direct (up from 54 per cent)</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/11" class="indent">Uncleared new scheme applications were down by 13 per cent (across both schemes) since March 2006 and in the last three months have been at their lowest since comparable records began in May 1999</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/12" class="indent">55 per cent of applications were cleared within twelve weeks (up from 49 per cent and meeting target level for March 2007) and 74 per cent within six months (up from 64 per cent)</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/13" class="indent">The Agency answered 97 per cent of queued calls over12 months (up from 90 per cent)</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/14" class="indent">The Operational Improvement Plan included plans to contract out some of the outstanding debt owed to parents with care, to private debt collection agencies. By the end of January 2007 just under &pound;750,000 had been collected by these agencies. A letter sent by the Agency to inform clients that their debt is to be transferred to the external debt collection agencies had also resulted in an additional &pound;640,000 collected by the Agency by the end of January 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/15" class="indent">During the year ending March 2006 a total amount of&pound;13.5 million was collected through specific legal enforcement work, an average monthly amount of &pound;1.1 million. This has increased to &pound;13.53 million between April and December 2006, giving a monthly average of &pound;1.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/16" class="indent">The Agency continues to improve the collection of child support maintenance arrears and during the year ending March 2006 a total amount of &pound;80.8 million was collected, an average monthly amount of &pound;6.7 million. This has increased to an average monthly amount of &pound;7.3 million between April and December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.2/17" class="indent">The attached table states the average debt growth and the total debt outstanding at the end of each month since the implementation of the Operational Improvement Plan.</p>

These figures relate to allocated funding for the year whereas the expenditure figures in the tables in the response reflect actual in year expenditure. Provision needs to be set aside from allocated funding for future Annual Compensation Payments even though such costs are not incurred in year.

I have not included those offices that have yet to convert.</p>
	<p pid="a.2086W.5/5" class="indent">There are several sites which either show no staff are based there or have low numbers of staff. Those showing no staff based there are flexible delivery sites where staff from a nearby office open the site on a limited number of days each week. Sites that show low numbers of staff are either in rural areas providing a full Jobcentre Plus service or in urban areas providing Crisis Loan payments at a screened delivery point.</p>

	<p pid="a.2087W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning incidents of violence towards Jobcentre Plus staff <i> (a)</i> from customers receiving a decision on Social Fund Crisis funds and <i> (b)</i> more generally in the delivery of our services. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.2087W.2/4" class="indent">The Agency has robust arrangements for collecting information following verbal, attempted, or actual assaults on our staff. As part of the incident reporting process, we ask our staff to categorise as near as they can the cause of an incident by selecting from a list. We do not have an exact match to the 'Social Fund Crisis funds' category in your question, but the second column of the table below shows where staff have selected the closest match&mdash;a category entitled 'Social Fund/Hardship claim dispute, e.g. eligibility, delays, demands'. The third column shows the total number of actual assaults against our staff during the period you state. Incidents relating to Social Fund/Hardship represent a small proportion of the total number of assaults.</p>

	<p pid="a.2087W.2/15" class="indent">We take the safety of our people very seriously. Customer-facing activity is thoroughly risk-assessed and control measures are in place to manage the risk in our offices. Whilst no assault is acceptable, our assault figures should be seen in the context not only of the millions of face to face contacts we have with customers each year, but also a more rigorous approach to reporting incidents being adopted. The likelihood of being subject to an actual assault in our offices is low: for example, in 2006, around one half of one percent of our staff reported such an incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.2087W.2/16" class="indent">Moreover, the vast majority of these assaults do not result in any physical injury: fewer than 20 assaults each year result in injuries reported as 'more than minor cuts and bruises' and the number of injuries per year, unlike the wider reported trend, has not increased since 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.2100W.5/1">Most competence for action in the field of public health remains with the member states, but the European Union has the responsibility, set out in the treaty, to undertake certain actions which complement the work done by member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.2100W.5/2">Article 152 of the EC treaty covers public health. It states that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all community policies and activities; and that community action should be directed towards improving public health, preventing human illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to human health and complement national policies. The article also encourages co-operation between the community and member states on public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.2100W.5/3">In practice, EU work on public health often focuses on facilitating the exchange of information, knowledge and best practice between member states and covers many issues, from the general (eg health inequalities) to the specific (eg, action on alcohol use). Article 152(4) also sets out specific areas, e.g. standards for quality and safety for blood, in which legislative measures can be adopted by the Commission in this field. EU legislation that has a beneficial effect on public health has also been adopted on the basis of other parts of the treaty (eg, tobacco packaging legislation, based on Article 95 which relates to the internal market).</p>

	<p pid="a.2107W.2/1">Following the publication of the National Audit Office report &quot;A safer place for patients: learning to improve patient safety in November 2005&quot;, the Chief Medical Officer commissioned a review of the organisational arrangements in place to support patient safety.

	<p pid="a.2107W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The role of the NPSA should be refocused on its core objective of collecting and analysing patient safety data to inform rapid patient safety learning, priority setting and coordinated activity across the NHS.

These include work on safety aspects of hospital design, cleanliness and food; the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees the National Clinical Assessment Service and managing the contracts of the three national confidential enquiries.</p>

	<p pid="a.2114W.2/1">Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in December 2006 makes it clear that the national health service should set an example in developing public health policies, including promoting healthy food and drink choices. This will include restaurants, vending machines and other food outlets whether directly provided by the organisation or by third parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.2114W.2/2">NHS trusts are locally responsible for decisions relating to the provision of all food to patients, staff and visitors. NHS trusts are encouraged to generate income by making best use of their assets and this can include the provision of retail services of the type to which you refer in your parliamentary question. The precise contractual arrangements will depend on the individual scheme and the local situation.</p>
