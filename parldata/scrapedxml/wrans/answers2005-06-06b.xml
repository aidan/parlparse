	<p pid="b.235W.7/3">which the UK showed during the review process. The Attorney-General, many Government departments, law enforcement agencies, parliamentarians and others made a great effort to ensure that the OECD examiners had access to all those with an interest in our anti-bribery framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.7/4">Bribery of any official or 'agent' are long standing crimes under UK law and since 2002 our courts have had jurisdiction over acts of bribery by UK nationals and companies even if the acts take place entirely overseas. Against this background the OECD Bribery Working Group concluded in 2003 that</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.7/5" class="indent">UK law now addresses the requirements of the convention&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.7/6">The latest report commends the UK for other aspects of our anti-bribery framework, such as employee whistleblower protection, the ability of the tax authorities to make spontaneous disclosures of suspicious information to law enforcement agencies and the wide scope of the regulated sector&quot; in our anti-money-laundering reporting regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.7/7">The report also notes the support the Government have provided to a number of private sector and civil society anti-corruption initiatives, e.g. Transparency International's Business Principles on Countering Bribery, the International Business Leaders' Forum and the Commonwealth Business Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.7/8">As is customary with these reports, it also presents recommendations for further action. These focus on areas such as awareness-raising and the prevention and detection of foreign bribery. We are considering how best to take these forward and will report on progress to the OECD Bribery Working Group in December.</p>

We are working with the Afghan Government and others to increase activity in all areas of their strategy over the coming year&mdash;the principles of which were underlined by President Karzai during the first Afghan Counter Narcotics National Conference held at the beginning of December shortly after his inauguration. President Karzai has continued to make very clear his determination to tackle the drugs problem. He reinforced this determination when he met my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary in February.

The statement outlined increased UK support for the Government of Afghanistan's 8-pillar 2005 Counter Narcotics Implementation Plan (Institution Building, Information Campaign, Alternative Livelihoods, Law Enforcement, Criminal Justice, Eradication, Demand Reduction and Regional Co-operation). Our activity in the last financial year included: the running of seven training courses on intelligence and investigation techniques for the Afghan Counter-Narcotics Police; support for over five major seizures of opiates; the provision of a mobile forensic laboratory; and help to establish regional law enforcement offices in seven provincial centres outside Kabul.</p>
	<p pid="b.236W.3/4">In addition, the UK works closely with Afghanistan's neighbours, including providing assistance, to help their efforts to counter the flow of opiates from Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.236W.3/5">The UK is currently pressing for specific commitments from partners following a joint Foreign Secretary and International Development Secretary lobby letter campaign in February. We want to solicit funds for the Counter Narcotics Trust Fund (CNTF), in support of the Afghans' Counter Narcotics Implementation Plan.</p>

Where a claimant qualifies for Humanitarian Protection or Discretionary Leave, limited leave will be granted for a period of up to three years. Those who are found not to be in need of international protection and have no other basis of stay would be expected to leave the United Kingdom, subject to the outcome of any appeal. If a claim is certified as clearly unfounded, then any appeal could only be brought from abroad; otherwise the claimant would be entitled to remain in the United Kingdom until their appeal has been determined.</p>

	<p pid="b.246W.7/1">The UK Government take their responsibilities to safeguard individuals taken into custody by UK forces very seriously. This includes those who were subsequently transferred to US custody in Iraq. In March 2003, the UK and US Governments agreed a Memorandum of Understanding which contains mutual assurances on the treatment of all transferred persons in Iraq and confirms that such persons are entitled to the full protection of the Geneva Conventions. Within the terms of that MOU however, specific procedures for handling internees are a matter for the US authorities. These procedures may include measures amounting to sensory deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.246W.7/2">The UK considers that the use of certain sensory deprivation techniques, for example blindfolds, is lawful for certain aspects of prisoner handling. For example, it may be necessary to blindfold a prisoner being moved from one location to another for reasons of force protection and security. It is however unlawful to use any sensory deprivation techniques during interrogations.</p>

	<p pid="b.250W.3/1">DFID has provisionally allocated &pound;282.7 million across the whole of Sudan over the next three financial years. This money is not earmarked between north and south Sudan. We have, however, pledged &pound;23.5 million over three years to the World Bank's multi donor trust fund for South Sudan (we are making an equal commitment to the same Fund for the North). We have also allocated some &pound;2.6 million for UNICEF's interim Capacity Building Trust Fund for the South.</p>
	<p pid="b.250W.3/2">While exact allocation of the remaining funds will be decided over the coming months and years, our support is likely to focus on humanitarian relief; delivery of basic social services (including working closely with other donors in South Sudan to ensure that the Government of South Sudan has the capacity effectively to deliver services to all their citizens, including returned refugees and internally displaced people); rule of law; disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of soldiers; and enhancing the accountability of the Security Sector.</p>

In April the World Food Programme targeted 2.1 million beneficiaries, and reached 1.6 million leaving a shortfall of 500,000 not receiving food aid, largely due to insecurity such as banditry.

The UK will chair the EU at the UN climate change conference at the end of this year at which these discussions are due to commence. Our presidency of the EU gives us an excellent opportunity to galvanise work on preparing for future action. Nevertheless, experts have been considering what different approaches might look like and a number of approaches have been suggested for the design of future action on climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.3/2">At this stage, it is important that we remain flexible in looking at the options, that all existing suggestions for future frameworks remain on the table, and that full consideration is given both to the possible frameworks themselves and to the elements within them that could be used to form part of a workable solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.3/3">In considering any future regime, the Government's long-term view is that the architecture of a future framework needs to be realistic (relevant to countries with different national circumstances), robust (capable of being adjusted in the light of experience) and durable (will not become irrelevant after a few years) but for any such framework to be effective, it would be necessary for it to achieve a wide global acceptance and to deliver results in terms of significant emissions reductions. The Government are committed to finding a solution to the issue of climate change that meet these criteria.</p>

	<p pid="b.254W.2/2">Following public consultation carried out on the Schedule last year, my aim is to revise it during 2005 before the next round of licensing at the end of the year. On the main body of the Act, the Department is developing new options which aim to deliver the public safety benefits of the legislation but also to reduce the level of regulatory burden on local authorities and animal keepers. This will require a slightly longer timescale which may be affected by other initiatives such as the Animal Welfare Bill. I expect to consider the options this year with a view to further developing new proposals for consultation early in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.255W.2/1">In response to Sir Michael Lyons's Report 'Towards Better Management of Public Sector Assets' published in December 2004, Defra is developing a comprehensive Asset Management Strategy covering both the core Department and its associated public bodies (i.e. its Executive Agencies, NDPBs, and Public Corporations). A key aim of the strategy will be to rationalise and improve the use of assets, and to dispose of those assets that are under-utilised or under-performing. It will be closely integrated into our overall efficiency programme which itself will present important opportunities for asset rationalisation and disposal. The strategy will also consider opportunities to exploit the value of Defra's intangible assets particularly intellectual property.</p>
	<p pid="b.255W.2/2">As part of our strategy, plans are already in place to dispose in 2005&ndash;06 of <i>(a)</i> approximately &pound;5 million worth of land and buildings owned by the core Department, and <i>(b)</i> a further &pound;14 million of property assets owned by Defra Executive Agencies and NDPBs.

	<p pid="b.257W.2/1">A detailed analysis of how English dairy farmers stand to benefit or lose out relative to historic entitlements is provided in the document; CAP Single Payment Scheme, Basis for Allocation of Entitlement, Impact of the Scheme to be Adopted in England, which is available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/capreform/background/pdf/webnoterev16.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/capreform/background/pdf/webnoterev16.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.257W.2/2">Data on the numbers of farmers who receive higher or lower subsidy payments will not be known until all of the claims for Single Payment have been scrutinised by the Rural Payments Agency. Only then will we know what areas of land and what entitlements have been claimed.</p>
	<p pid="b.257W.2/3">By the end of the transitional period some sectors will have gained or lost against historical subsidy receipts. Generally speaking, flat rate payments redistribute subsidy from more intensive to less intensive producers and to land not formerly in receipt of subsidy. On average larger dairy farms will receive lower payments under this system than under one based on historic receipts (although, by contrast, smaller farms will on average be better off). However, we believe that the eight-year transition to the flat rate payment should give farmers time to adjust.</p>
	<p pid="b.257W.2/4">All payments to dairy farmers in the UK, as for other recipients of the Single Payment, will be decoupled from production, and therefore are no longer linked to particular farming activity. In a decoupled subsidy environment, farmers should only produce milk if they can do so profitably.</p>

The first related to the import of maize grain for use as any other maize (including feed but excluding cultivation) and the second to food products. Both dossiers will now go to the Council of Ministers for decisions as no qualified majority was reached at the respective committees.</p>
	<p pid="b.259W.5/3">The vote on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase> related to the application by Monsanto via the German authorities under Directive 2001/18/EC for the import and use of GM maize grain, including feed but excluding food and cultivation. Monsanto's dossier included data from a rat feeding study. The German authorities submitted the dossier to other member states with a favourable opinion. In the UK the application was considered by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and the Advisory Committee on Animal Feed and based on their advice the UK gave a favourable opinion on this application.</p>
	<p pid="b.259W.5/4">The vote on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-19">19 May</phrase> was on an application made to the German authorities in August 2002 under the novel food regulations (EC) 258/97. This application is for food use of ingredients derived from GM maize MON 863. This dossier also included the results of the rat feeding study. The initial opinion from the German authorities was referred to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which concluded that MON 863 maize will not have an adverse effect on human health. This conclusion has been endorsed by the UK expert committee, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.259W.5/5">In September 2004 the German authorities submitted a critique of the rat feeding study by Professor Pusztai. This highlighted a number of features of the study that appeared to indicate adverse effects of the GM maize. EFSA examined this document and issued a statement in September 2004 that confirmed its earlier conclusions. At the same time, the rat feeding study was independently re-examined by the GM sub-group of the UK's Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs, which confirmed that this was a normal and well-conducted study that did not indicate any adverse effects.</p>

	<p pid="b.262W.5/3">These regulations are continually reviewed by UKXIRA as outlined in section two of the fifth annual report, published in 2003, which resulted in UKXIRA recommending that the Government review the definition of xenotransplantation. This work is currently being taken forward to ensure that the United Kingdom's definition of xenotransplantation is in line with the revised, broader, definition adopted in the United States in 2000, and which the Council of Europe is expected to recommend for adoption by member states. The fifth annual report is also available from the website address above.</p>

We have been mindful to create a fair and equitable licensing system which allows full cost recovery of the licensing authorities' administration, inspection and enforcement costs. We appreciate the important roles that amateur sports clubs play in local communities. As such, my Department held detailed discussions on fee levels with the Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR), and other sports bodies, both during the passage of the Act, and thereafter. My Department has agreed to monitor the impact of the fees on all sectors including sports clubs. We intend working closely with CCPR to that end. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made a commitment to an independent review of fee levels and associated costs, within a reasonable period after the new framework is fully introduced. That review will be chaired by Sir Leslie Elton. The results of the review will inform any necessary adjustments to the levels of fees, including those payable by amateur sports clubs.</p>

The fee bands under the Licensing Act 2003 are set by reference to non-domestic rateable values. The Government believe that this is the fairest way of ensuring that larger premises pay more than smaller premises and of accounting for location. Rateable values are also reviewed every five years and subject to specific appeal mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.3/2">In some cases, a small bar in a larger premises will have its own rateable value and its licence fee will reflect this. In other cases, the non domestic rateable value will apply to all parts of the premises, including an area designated for a licensable activity. The new fee structure includes a multiplier, and a higher fee, for larger premises which are exclusively or primarily engaged in the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premises. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made a commitment to an independent review of fee levels and associated costs, within a reasonable period after the new framework is fully introduced. The results of that review will inform any necessary adjustments to the levels of fees introduced under the Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.271W.2/1">Sport is already the single biggest volunteering activity in England, with 26 per cent. of volunteering going on in sports related activities. Thereare an estimated 6 million sports volunteers, representing 15 per cent. of the adult population and contributing over 1 billion hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/2">Volunteers are a key driver for change if we are to achieve our targets of increasing participation in sport and physical activity. The National Strategic Partnership for Volunteering in Sport was launched last October to provide a single strategic voice to drive forward, promote and develop volunteering in sport and the wider voluntary sector across Government and other partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/3">Sport England's partnership with Volunteering England, the national development agency for volunteering, is aimed at ensuring a joined-up approach to volunteering between sport and other sectors. National Governing Bodies of Sport set targets for raising the number of volunteers within their Whole Sport Plans that are agreed with Sport England.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/4">Step into Sport is one of the eight workstrands of the PE, School Sport and Club Links (PESSCL) strategy, which aims to provide a simple framework of opportunities for young people in leadership and volunteering through sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/5">In March, the Russell Commission recommended a framework that will deliver a step change in the diversity, quality and quantity of young people's volunteering, with the aspiration to attract 1 million more young volunteers across all forms of activity. This year's Budget announced funding for the framework of up to &pound;150 million that will include matching funds from the private sector and contributions from Sport England.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/6">2005 is The Year of The Volunteer&quot;, a Home Office initiative run by the Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England to promote volunteering across a range of sectors throughout the year in which August is the themed month of sport.</p>

	<p pid="b.274W.6/3">The Government are determined to tackle child poverty, with women disproportionately represented in households with children living in relative low-income. The Government's reforms since 1997 have reduced the number of children living in relative low-income households by over half a million.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.6/4">The Government are also providing support to the poorest pensioners through the pension credit. Women pensioners, many of whom have not been able to build up an entitlement to a full basic state pension in their own right in the past, have been among those to benefit the most from pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="b.280W.11/1">Pelican crossings were introduced in 1969. We have no recent studies of their effectiveness but studies into the effects of converting a zebra to a pelican crossing, comparisons of pedestrian crossings, and the comparative safety of pedestrian crossings were conducted in the years following their introduction. Reports are available from TRL Limited (formerly the Transport Research Laboratory).</p>
	<p pid="b.280W.11/2">Research carried out by the Transport and Research Laboratory for my Department in 1992 following the introduction of new puffin crossing estimated an average net benefit of approximately &pound;10,000 per site per annum through reduced vehicle delays, giving an overall benefit across the country of about &pound;50 million, if installations were to take place at all sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.280W.11/3">The Highways Agency commissioned work from the London Accident Analysis Unit in 1996 to carry out a comparative accident study at five pelican crossing conversions to puffins. The investigations found that puffin was no worse than a pelican crossing but in some cases it was better in terms of accidents involving pedestrians.</p>
	<p pid="b.280W.11/4">Further research has been commissioned by the Department for Transport to examine the effectiveness of puffin crossings at six sites and the effect of the new crossing on pedestrian and driver behaviour. This work will conclude by the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.293W.8/1">The UK continues to be absolutely committed to the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to ensure that it delivers maximum debt relief for the world's poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.293W.8/2">Many bilateral donors have joined the UK in providing 100 per cent. relief. However, multilateral institutions only provide relief at around half this level. The Chancellor and Secretary of State for International Development announced in September 2004 that the UK would pay our share (10 per cent.) of 100 per cent. debt service relief on all World Bank and African Development Bank loans for all post-Completion Point HIPCs. This relief will also be extended to all low-income countries with sufficiently robust public expenditure management to ensure it helps towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
	<p pid="b.293W.8/3">The Chancellor discussed this proposal at the G7 Finance Ministers in London in February, and in Washington in April, where the G7 agreed that further debt relief is needed, and to the principle of up to 100 per cent. multilateral debt relief. We are working with G7 countries, the IMF and World Bank to put this principle into action. Canada and the Netherlands have announced that they will join the UK in providing their share of multilateral debt relief. We continue to urge other countries to join us in providing additional multilateral debt relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.293W.8/4">Iraq is not eligible for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries' Initiative. The UK is in the process of reaching a bilateral agreement with Iraq to implement the terms of the debt relief package agreed between Paris Club creditors and representatives of Iraq on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-21">21 November 2004</phrase>; Paris Club creditors, including the UK, agreed to provide a total amount of debt reduction to Iraq of 80 per cent. in three phases.</p>
	<p pid="b.293W.8/5">For IMF debt, we believe the IMF's gold reserves are an under-utilised resource that could be used to finance further debt relief by the IMF. IMF analysis of debt relief and gold sales show that sales of the magnitude which would be required to finance the UK's proposal for debt relief could if properly phased be accommodated by gold markets without significant difficulty, and fall well within the bounds set by official sellers of gold in recent years.</p>

These changes included the requirement to complete individual (rather than household) forms, the requirement to re-register every year, and the requirement to provide personal identification details.

The Government will be working closely with the Commission and other member states to ensure that the Commission delivers an effective package of further proposals for simplification of existing legislation&mdash;including repeal or amendment of legislation which is disproportionately burdensome for citizens and business&mdash;later in the year. As a first step, following its Communication Better Regulation for Growth and Jobs&quot; adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase>, the Commission has asked member states for suggestions of which specific legislation would benefit most from simplification. Cabinet Office officials are currently consulting Government Departments, as well as external stakeholders, to identify suitable candidates which the UK will propose.</p>

	<p pid="b.305W.3/2">Risk assessments on chemicals are carried out according to EU and UK regulatory requirements to provide the necessary data for the protection of human health and the environment. There is currently a legal requirement to use animals for some testing where there is no other method for producing the data. The Government are keen to keep animal testing to a minimum and supports the development of alternative methods which, once properly validated, may be accepted as part of the regulatory system. My Department is supporting the development of alternative methods and strategies that will lead to the reduced use of animals in chemical assessment programmes and is hosting a workshop on this topic in June.</p>
	<p pid="b.305W.3/3">The Government through the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) fund the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs). The Centre provides a UK focus for the development, promotion and implementation of the 3 Rs in biological and biomedical research in academia and industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.306W.5/1">To provide a detailed answer at this stage would undermine our negotiations with other G8 countries. I can confirm, however, that DTI is working actively and closely with the Prime Minister's office, Defra, FCO, Treasury, DFID and other Departments in order to prepare for a successful summit at Gleneagles. DTI's contribution reflects the fact that energy policies are fundamentally important in tackling the causes of climate change: one of the two main themes for discussion. Defra and DTI also co-hosted the Energy and Environment Ministerial Roundtable in March which brought together energy and environment ministers or policy makers from 20 countries with significant energy needs; businesses, NGOs and international organisations such as the IEA also participated.</p>

	<p pid="b.311W.8/2">In the first quarter of 2005 complaints received by the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) were down by a third compared to 2004 at 8,446 complaints. This represents a 33 per cent. reduction in the number of complaints compared to the first quarter of 2004, during which ICSTIS received 12,542 complaints. ICSTIS has taken a number of measures to inform consumers about premium rate services and numbers that appear on their telephone bills, and has increased its use of emergency procedures to close down services before they can cause extensive consumer harm.</p>

The police also have the power to stop and search someone suspected of causing criminal damage. The Home Office is currently reviewing the Graffiti Removal Notice power introduced by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. This power is currently available to 12 local authorities on a pilot basis. Following the review of the pilot a decision will be made on whether these powers will be rolled out nationwide. The Home Office also reviewed the legislation in preparation for the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. This strengthened existing legislation regarding the under-age sale of aerosol paints. The Home Office will keep graffiti legislation under review.</p>

These arrangements are kept under review. Effective training to improve operational performance is central to the Government's agenda on police reform and is continually reviewed and developed as part of the drive towards workforce modernisation.

	<p pid="b.324W.5/1">The Secretary of State has established a comprehensive programme of measures to tackle crime in Hertfordshire, as elsewhere in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/2">The 10 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) in Hertfordshire are responsible for the delivery of crime reduction at the local level. The performance of the CDRPs is managed by the Home Office team in the Government office for the east of England, whose role is to support and challenge the partnerships in their region. The director of this team is held accountable by the Crime Reduction Director in the Home Office through quarterly bilateral meetings, supplemented by performance review meetings with Home Office performance support managers in the intervening months.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/3">To ensure that the Home Office meets its Public Service Agreement one, 'to reduce crime by 15 per cent., and more in high crime areas, by 2007&ndash;08', the Government offices in the regions have negotiated crime reduction targets with all their partnerships. The aggregate target reduction across Hertfordshire is just over 15 per cent. to be measured by the British Crime Survey (BCS) Comparator using a baseline of 2003&ndash;04. The BCS Comparator is a subset of all recorded crime that relates closely to the questions in the BCS.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/4">All the Hertfordshire partnerships have planned their crime reduction activity for their three-year strategies, which they are implementing from April 2005. The Government office for the east of England will have monitored the contents of these strategies to ensure that they address crimes of both local and national concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/5">The Secretary of State has also initiated a number of national programmes to support the work undertaken at local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/6" class="indent">Prolific and Priority Offenders&mdash;partnerships are required to identify the most prolific offenders in their area and focus their activity on them through three strands, prevent and deter, catch and convict, and rehabilitate and resettle. There are three prolific offender schemes running in Hertfordshire: North Hertfordshire, Watford and Hertsmere. In all 206 prolific offenders have been identified in Hertfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/7" class="indent">The intensive elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme (DIP)&mdash;drug testing of offenders charged with a range of trigger offences&quot;&mdash;is a way of identifying drug users at an early stage of their contact with the criminal justice system. Key elements of DIP&mdash;the throughcare and aftercare parts of the programme&mdash;are delivered in all areas of England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/8" class="indent">Both the Acquisitive Crime Team and the Violent Crime Unit in the Home Office are developing policy that can be implemented at local level to support crime reduction activity. They also undertake research, disseminate publicity and good practice in their subject areas, and visit partnerships with particular needs .</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/9">The Police Standards Unit (PSU) in the Home Office regularly monitors the performance of police forces and, within them, basic command units, and engages with forces who are underperforming on a range of indicators. Forces' performance against their peers is an important aspect of the assessment. PSU have not been engaged with Hertfordshire police.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/10">Hertfordshire constabulary had 2,135 police officers on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase>, 213 more than in March 2001. The Crime Fighting Fund has funded 113 extra officers in the force since April 2000, over and above the force'sown recruitment plans. At the end of March Hertfordshire constabulary had 99 community support officers, supplementing the work of the force in providing reassurance to communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/11">The Home Office has made available to all police forces and CDRPs a statistical database, iQuanta, that enables them to monitor their crime reduction performance. Through the crime reduction website CDRPs are able to access 'toolkits' and examples of good practice to help them with planning crime reduction activity.</p>

Although these include statistics on drugs offences&mdash;such as possession&mdash;and on property crimes&mdash;such as burglary&mdash;they do not contain information on the offender's drug habits. It is therefore not possible to estimate from these statistics the numbers of crimes in Wales that are drug-related.</p>

	<p pid="b.326W.5/2">Home Office interest in ticket touting is limited to section 166 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which prohibits ticket touting in respect of regulated football matches. This is a public order provision which explicitly applies to football in view of the importance of segregation in reducing the potential for disorder between rival fans. The provision has not been extended to cover other sports as there is no comparable public order threat.</p>

	<p pid="b.326W.8/1">This is a local operational matter. Traffic wardens are employed by police authorities and act under the directions of the chief officer of police. Their role in enforcing parking restrictions is being reduced as decriminalised parking enforcement is becoming more widespread. Community Support Officers and accredited persons can also exercise certain traffic related powers and these are being extended by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The recruitment of parking attendants to enforce civil parking infringements is a matter for the local authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.326W.11/1">It is difficult to determine exactly the impact of Neighbourhood Watch (and other Watch activity) on reducing crime in isolation from other factors. The 2000 British Crime Survey found that 75 per cent. of respondents thought that Neighbourhood Watch schemes were effective in preventing crimes such as burglary. The information was published in 2001 as part of Home Office Research Findings 150. The Home Office has not made a separate assessment of the effectiveness of Shop Watch, Pub Watch, Farm Watch, Rural Watch or other Watch&quot; schemes. Following a research and public consultation exercise in 2004, the Home Office is in the process of setting up a new national forum organisation which will act as an umbrella body for the Watch movement as a whole. The new organisation will be a registered charity and independent of Government. It will aim to share good practice within and between different Watch organisations and help to improve co-ordination between them.</p>

	<p pid="b.329W.2/1">Anti-litter campaigns are supported by guidance for primary schools relating to the curriculum. For example, geography guidance encourages schools to promote anti-litter activities. Through citizenship lessons pupils learn about what improves and harms their local environments and the ways in which they can play their part in looking after them. Such lessons contribute to pupils' understanding of the consequences of dropping litter.</p>

	<p pid="b.329W.5/1">Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for the management of their own affairs. Their governing bodies have a duty to ensure that non-discriminatory practices are followed, in accordance with current equality legislation. The universities' representative body, Universities UK, has asked the Equality Challenge Unit (sponsored by the HE Funding Councils, Universities UK, and the Standing Conference of Principals) to look at the issue of extremism and intolerance on campus with a view to updating guidance to universities. I welcome this. It would be for Universities UK to monitor levels of discrimination against all minority groups and to consider whether any assessments should be carried out across the sector.</p>

More than a quarter of local authorities are now part of this ambitious programme, and the following are some headlines on the progress of current BSF projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.330W.2/2">Of our 17 Wave 1/Pathfinder projects; 16 Education Visions have been signed off, 11 Business Cases have been approved (the remainder are due to be approved by September 2005). eight projects have gone out to market, three of which have issued their short list of preferred bidders. Local Education Partnerships (LEPs) will be set up between March 2006 and March 2007. The first school will be open by the beginning of 2007.

	<p pid="b.338W.5/1">The Department's technical note does not propose <i>(a)</i> a reduction in the number of teachers and their replacement with interactive whiteboards and classroom supervisors or <i>(b)</i> replacing all supply teachers with classroom supervisors.</p>
	<p pid="b.338W.5/2">The Gershon review focuses on improving efficiency and recycling such gains into the frontline. The Department's expenditure therefore remains unaffected and the Department will continue to invest in schools at the record levels already announced.</p>
	<p pid="b.338W.5/3">The effective use of information and communications technology (ICT), such as electronic interactive whiteboards, is a significant and powerful tool for increasing teachers' productive time and improving the quality of learning and teaching. ICT supports and enhances quality teaching and is not a substitute for it. The January2005 figures show that the number of teachers increased by 4,000 during the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="b.338W.5/4">Schools spent around &pound;800 million in 2003&ndash;04 on agency staff and supply teachers. As part of remodelling the school work force the Department is supporting schools in developing and implementing more effective and cost efficient solutions. For example, the Department does not believe that it is a good use of teachers' time to cover for absent colleagues. The use of established cover staff for short-term absences provides better supervision by staff who belong to the school and know the children concerned, and at less cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.343W.2/1">Most local authorities that maintain schools engage education specialists to work with those schools. For the portion of these specialists' time when they are helping authorities hold schools to account, they are commonly termed 'link advisers'. The introduction of the School Improvement Partner function means that the accountability role will pass to School Improvement Partners. This means that a portion of the work of local authorities' current education specialists will no longer be needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.2/2">What it does not mean is that the individual education professionals will all have to cease employment on school improvement work. There will be opportunities for some of them to become School Improvement Partners for all kinds of school, but particularly for primary schools, where we envisage that the majority of School Improvement Partners will come from local authority backgrounds. And there is a range of school improvement work beyond the School Improvement Partner function, some that schools commission and some that local authorities commission to support weak, failing and underperforming schools. The arrival of the School Improvement Partner function does not alter the need for this other work.</p>

	<p pid="b.345W.0/1">My Department has received just over 770 detailed responses to the consultation on our proposals for new school funding arrangements to be introduced from April 2006, together with around 1,650 letters as part of a campaign initiated by the F40 group of local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.0/2">The consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-13">13 May</phrase>. A consultation report will be published when our analysis of all the responses is complete, and copies will be placed in the Library. We will consider all the views expressed very carefully as we consider the way forward on school funding in the light of the consultation, and expect to announce our final decisions on the new arrangements over the summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.345W.6/1">The role of School Improvement Partners is part of a ground-breaking new approach for supporting schools and holding them to account, called the New Relationship with Schools. Working from powerful new data analyses and from schools' own evaluations of themselves, the New Relationship will get deeper into each school's key issues than has been possible hitherto and will do so with less red tape. But the underlying purpose of holding each school to account is not new and the New Relationship does not change the formal accountability requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.6/2">A school's Improvement Partner is a credible, experienced education practitioner charged with challenging and supporting the school. School Improvement Partners are accredited to a demanding national standard and work locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.6/3">Local authorities will be able to find part of the funding for the School Improvement Partner function by discontinuing some of their existing work&mdash;the series of meetings and reporting currently used for formal school accountability, including reviews of school targets. But for secondary schools, existing funding will not suffice. The Government are making a contribution that we expect will cover the majority of the costs, because the School Improvement Partner function requires more investment than the current function that local authorities will be able to discontinue. We are offering each local authority &pound;2,000 a year for each of the secondary schools to which it appoints a School Improvement Partner, together with a one-off payment of &pound;380 for each secondary school to support the establishment of the School Improvement Partner function. For School Improvement Partners for primary schools roll-out of the function begins a year later than for secondary schools, in September 2006. We are just beginning a trial of the School Improvement Partner function for special schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.346W.2/1">Reducing youth unemployment is a priority for this Government, which has a target to reduce the proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds not in education, employment or training (NEET) by 2 percentage points between 2004 and 2010. The recent 14 to 19 Education and Skills White Paper sets out how we will build a system to raise participation and achievement; ensuring young people are able to master the functional skills, attitudes and behaviours needed for their continued engagement in education and employment after age 16.</p>
	<p pid="b.346W.2/2">School leavers in particular may seek information, advice and guidance on their post-16 options from their school, the Connexions Service, or the Connexions Direct helpline. The forthcoming Youth Green Paper will examine how all those involved in delivering information, advice and guidance can work together to ensure all young people receive the help and support they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.346W.2/3">The Connexions Service, which works closely with Jobcentre Plus actively identifies school leavers who are unemployed, and seeks to find them appropriate work or learning opportunities. Those not yet ready may undertake Entry to Employment, a tailored programme of learning and support to enable them to progress to further learning opportunities or meaningful employment. The Government announced, in the recent Budget, plans to pilot Activity Agreements and an Activity Allowance to help re-engage 16 to 17-year-olds who have been out of education, employment or training for some time.</p>
	<p pid="b.346W.2/4">The Education Maintenance Allowance gives young people from lower income households the financial support they need to remain in education. Young parents may also receive funding to cover the cost of child care through the Care to Learn initiative.</p>

	<p pid="b.349W.2/1">Information provided by the Council for the Advancement of Communication for Deaf People shows that in 2003&ndash;04 over 20,000 people were learning British sign language (BSL)&mdash;approximately 18,500 at level one, 400 at level two, 400 at level three and 200 at level four (including those studying at higher education (HE) institutions).</p>
	<p pid="b.349W.2/2">It is recognised that the demand for BSL courses is currently greater than the supply of provision. The main contributory factor is the recognised shortage of BSL tutors. That is why some of the &pound;1.5 million made available by Government to support the recognition of BSL as a European language is being used to fund six initiatives, which will contribute to establishing a Great Britain wide framework to support the recruitment, training and deployment of BSL tutors. The aim is to enhance numbers, status and levels of qualification. The Learning and Skills Council is currently discussing with the DWP how it might work in partnership to assist in the development of the national framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.349W.2/3">Funding is also being made available to support four initiatives which will promote access for BSL users through awareness-raising among employers, among service providers and in the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="b.349W.2/4">HE institutions are autonomous and so free to plan and deliver programmes as they wish. If they choose to run sign language courses, they may use funding provided through the HE Funding Council for England for this purpose. However, records are not kept centrally of the number of HE courses involving the teaching of sign language.</p>

	<p pid="b.354W.2/1">Domestic violence proceedings are a priority area for legal aid funding. The Legal Services Commission's (LSC's) Funding Code Criteria for domestic violence cases are wider than for most other family and non-family areas; they are not limited to any specific definition of domestic violence or abuse. Legal aid solicitors have wide devolved powers to grant funding for victims of domestic violence who are in urgent need of the court's protection. Following the Department's consultation 'A New Focus on Civil Legal Aid', provision was made for the LSC to waive the upper monthly disposable income limit for legal representation in specified domestic violence proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.354W.2/2">Legal aid advice is provided by solicitors and advice centres with a contract with the LSC. An LSC leaflet 'Domestic Violence, Abuse and Harassment' is available from solicitors, courts and advice and support agencies. The LSC funds community projects providing advice, legal and practical help on domestic violence.</p>

	<p pid="b.360W.2/1">There are currently 15 secure accommodation places at the regional secure care facility at Lakewood centre in Bangor, an increase of seven beds since 2001. Work is currently under way on building a replacement facility which is due to open in 2006 increasing the number of regional places to 16. In addition, under the terms of the legislation governing the use of secure care Health and Social Services Trusts can secure children at other locations, including statutory children's homes. The potential total number of secure places is therefore not limited by the number of places available at the regional unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.360W.2/2">The strategic aim of the Department is to provide a diverse range of provision suited to meet the needs of children in care. In addition to building a replacement regional secure unit, existing intensive support provision will be replaced and extended throughout Northern Ireland. This will provide 11 additional places and 55 replacement beds, alongside an additional eight beds in a regional Social, Emotional and Psychological unit. It is intended that these expanded services will divert children from secure accommodation into accommodation better suited to meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.360W.2/3">The number of places at this regional secure facility, as well as the planned expansion of intensive support and other specialist places is based on the level of need identified by the four Health and Social Services Boards to the Children Matter Task Force which is led by the Department. Under the auspices of the Task Force an additional 86 beds and 47 replacement beds have already been provided. At the end of Phase II, a further 43 additional and 159 replacement beds will have been provided.</p>

This law will prohibit discrimination on grounds of disability in education and will require schools and general qualifications bodies to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that children and young people with disabilities are not put at a substantial disadvantage compared to those without disabilities. Type 1 diabetes would be considered a disability under this legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.367W.3/2">In recognition of the success of the scheme which has, since its inception in 1978 assisted almost 18,000 participants into home ownership, the Department has recently increased its funding level by &pound;23 million over the next three years to provide almost &pound;39 million over the period. This, together with funding of almost &pound;60 million which will be provided by the Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing Association (NICHA), which operates the scheme on the Department's behalf, will help support around 2,400 applicants over the period. The eligibility rules have also recently been amended to make the scheme more reflective of house prices in the starter home end of the market.</p>

	<p pid="b.373W.5/1">The Government along with the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland abhors hate crime in all its manifestations and is taking positive and practical steps to tackle this. In particular the Government are currently considering its response to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee's report entitled the Challenge of Diversity&mdash;Hate Crime in Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.373W.5/2">The Government have already introduced the Criminal Justice (No.2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 which directs the courts to take account during sentencing of any offence where there is evidence of hostility based on religion, race disability or sexual orientation. In addition the legislation increases the maximum sentences available for certain specified, mainly violent offences including where racial, religious or sexual aggravation is proven.</p>
	<p pid="b.373W.5/3">Work is concluding on the development of the Racial Equality strategy, which will provide a framework for practical and protective measures to tackle hate crime and the causes of hate crime. This will be a joined-up strategy involving every part of Government working together to address this most serious issue. One of the practical outcomes of this will be the provision of additional support for the victims of this type of crime and taking forward work to have better information about hate crime incidents so that resources can be targeted to address them.</p>
	<p pid="b.373W.5/4">Finally, the police are investing considerable time and effort in addressing race crime. Recent initiatives include the introduction of an on-line reporting system on the PSNI website as part of the Hate Crime is Wrong campaign&quot;. The Police Service is determined to fully investigate all hate related incidents and where possible to secure sufficient evidence to prosecute offenders.</p>

	<p pid="b.375W.6/1">Children with autism spectrum disorders are entitled to disability living allowance on the same basis as anyone else with a severe disability. They will qualify if they meet the entitlement conditions for the benefit, which depend on the effects that severe physical or mental disability have on a person's need for personal care and/or their ability to walk and not on particular disabilities or diagnoses. There are no plans to amend the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.6/2">The numbers of children receiving disability living allowance as a result of the effects of autism spectrum disorders are not recorded separately, but are included in the more general category of those with 'learning difficulties'. As at <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-30">30 November 2004</phrase>, over 71,000 children whose main disabling condition is recorded as learning difficulties were receiving the benefit. Of these over 30,000 were in receipt of either the highest rate care component or the higher rate mobility component, or both.</p>

	<p pid="b.376W.3/1">Entitlement to carer's allowance depends on whether the qualifying conditions are satisfied and this can be reliably established only after a claim has been made. There are no data available which would provide an estimate of the number of carers who would meet those conditions if they claimed.</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.3/2">Information and advice about entitlement to carer's allowance are available from a range of outlets including social security offices, Jobcentre Plus offices, DWP and other helplines, DWP and other internet sites, local authorities, Citizens Advice and welfare benefit offices, public libraries, health clinics, doctors' surgeries and health visitors. Officials from the Department's disability and carers service also discuss carer's allowance at outreach events up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.3/3">In addition, the extensive pension credit take-up campaign, recently mounted by the Pension Service, has helped many older carers to benefit from the Government's abolition of the upper age limit on claims to carer's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.3/4">The carer's allowance claim pack is kept under review and improvements are introduced on an ongoing basis. Claims can be made in writing, by phone and on-line, and can be accepted by organisations such as Age Concern and Citizens Advice as well as DWP offices.</p>

	<p pid="b.383W.8/1">I am replying as Minister for HM Revenue and Customs who are responsible for enforcing the controls on trafficking and brokering in military equipment. Enforcement in this area is, in the main, intelligence led. HMRC will assess any information that suggests a trafficking and brokering offence has been committed in the United Kingdom, or has been committed overseas by UK citizens. Depending on their assessment, Customs will either visit the trader using their regulatory powers to inspect records and to require information or will conduct a full investigation using their powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.8/2">Where it is necessary to gather evidence overseas, Customs will do so using applicable mutual assistance arrangements where they are in place. Where there is sufficient evidence that a UK national has committed an offence overseas, Customs could put out a warrant for his arrest on return to the UK or consider extradition.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.8/3">Customs will normally seek prosecution in all cases where there has been a deliberate breach of the controls. They will review the evidence with the Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office who will advise whether there is sufficient evidence and whether prosecution is in the public interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.389W.3/2">The recent report of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights provides graphic testimony about his detention conditions. While we do not condone the actions for which Roy Bennett was charged, we believe that the sentence he received was wholly disproportionate to his offence. The Zimbabwean Attorney-General admitted this in two concessions submitted in court last week. He added that Parliament was not properly constituted as a court of law when it heard Roy Bennett's case. We condemn the fact that the Government's Chief Legal Officer withdrew the two concessions as a result of political pressure.</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.3/3">The case of Roy Bennett is only part of a broader pattern of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, and the growing abuse of the legal system. We will continue to work for the restoration of human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe and to discuss our concerns with African and other international partners.</p>

	<p pid="b.392W.8/1">The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 received Royal Assent in May 2002. Most of the provisions have now been introduced through a series of commencement orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/2">The first phase of leasehold reforms came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-26">26 July 2002</phrase>, with the second phase coming into effect in two parts on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-31">31 October 2003</phrase>. These measures included: a relaxation of the qualifying rules to make it easier to buy the freehold or a new lease; a new no fault 'Right to Manage' provisions for leaseholders of flats to take over management of their block where they do not wish to or cannot afford to buy the freehold; and new procedures for consultation on service charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/3">A further commencement order brought into effect the provisions in Part 1 of the Act relating to Commonhold, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-27">27 September 2004</phrase>. Commonhold is a new form of tenure for blocks of flats and other multi-unit properties, under which occupiers would own their units outright, and through a commonhold association own and mange the common parts collectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/4">Finally, another phase of the leasehold reforms was brought into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February 2005</phrase>. This provides leaseholders with better protection against forfeiture, and requires landlords to send a written demand for ground rent before it become payable. Leaseholders of houses can also now choose their own buildings insurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/5">The remaining provisions and Regulations of the Act, once enabled, would require collective enfranchisement to be exercised through an RTE company; require landlords to keep service charge monies for each group of service charge payers in separate (designated) accounts; require landlords to provide a regular (yearly) statement of account together with other relevant information; and require notices sent by landlords to tenants for administration charges to include content prescribed by Regulations. No timetable has yet been set to bring these provisions and Regulations into force.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/6">The Welsh Assembly has devolved responsibility for secondary legislation in respect of leasehold provisions in Wales. The hon. Member may wish to write to that office in respect of the commencement orders for Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.394W.0/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to supporting local authorities in delivering improvements in key public services without unacceptable council tax rises. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister worked closely with local government during the last spending review to identify pressures and burdens as well as the scope for efficiency savings, and the totals for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 reflect the outcome of that work. It is imperative that councils focus on how the money available to local government is spent and improve productivity. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believes that local authorities have demonstrated that they will make their full contribution to the local government efficiency target of &pound;6.45 billion by 2007&ndash;08, which will provide further investment to front line service. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue to work closely with local government to ensure that levels of central grant are based on a realistic assessment of service commitments pressures faced by local government. Such assessment underpinned the decisions taken in Spending Review 2004 and spending plans for 2007&ndash;08 remain as set out in the Review.</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.0/2">The level of the council tax increase in the coming financial years will depend on local authorities' spending decisions. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will work to ensure that improved local services are deliverable within the spending plans for local government. The Government will not hesitate to use their capping powers to deal with excessive increases.</p>

Following negotiations with the Council of Mortgage Lenders on the introduction of private finance to fund loan assistance, we hope to extend assistance through the first joint equity products from April 2006 to 20,000 additional households, with perhaps as many as 30,000 households, if we can extend our approach to the New Build Homebuy option also.

	<p pid="b.408W.0/18">Changes between years may not be valid due to changing local authority responsibilities. For example, the decrease for fire authorities between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 is due partly to the lower levels of grant per capita received by combined fire authorities compared with other fire authorities. Before 2004&ndash;05 grants were not paid directly to combined fire authorities and so these were not included in the figures for earlier years.</p>

	<p pid="b.418W.8/1">Medical opinion differs on the most effective treatment for sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). In recognition of this, in 2004 the Department asked the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME. This work is expected to be published in 2007. The national health service is able to provide treatment for the range problematic symptoms often associated with this condition&mdash;for example sleep disorders, pain, anxiety, depression and stomach disorders.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/2">The three main treatments provided by the NHS specifically for CFS/ME are:</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/3" class="indent">Pacing&mdash;learning to effectively manage activity and energy levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/4" class="indent">Graded activity&mdash;gradual but progressive increases in aerobic exercise.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/5" class="indent">Cognitive behavioural therapy&mdash;helping recognise and change behaviours and beliefs which can impact on the illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/6">Data on the incidence and treatment rates of specific medical conditions such as CFS/ME are not collected by the Department. However, it is estimated that around 240,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from CFS/ME.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.8/7">Local health professionals in primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for determining which health services their local populations require and ensuring the provision of these services. It is, therefore, the responsibility of individual PCTs to decide the level of funding they allocate to services for CFS/ME. However, in May 2003, the Department announced that additional funding of &pound;8.5 million would be made available for services specifically designed for people with CFS/ME. This money will help develop clinical services where none currently exist, including 12 new centres and 28 local support teams solely for CFS/ME sufferers.</p>

	<p pid="b.421W.6/2">Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority has received &pound;2 million from access funding and the three PCTs in Gloucestershire have reported proposals to spend their share on commissioning additional capacity to provide for the registration of 7,100 patients and the treatment of 900 additional orthodontic patients. In addition, West Gloucestershire PCT is one of the 16 PCTs in England receiving assistance from the Department's dental access support team. With the team's support, a new dental practice has been established in Cinderford, in the Forest of Dean, and there are plans to establish a new four surgery practice within the centre of Gloucester City by mid 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.6/3">Nationally we are currently undertaking the most far reaching reforms of NHS dentistry since 1948, supported by the biggest investment programme in the history of NHS dentistry.

We are also funding an extra 170 dental training places from this October, a 25 per cent. increase, supported by &pound;80 million capital investment. Pending completion of the training of the additional students, we are, this year, recruiting the equivalent of 1,000 extra dentists and we have allocated &pound;59 million to improve NHS dentistry.</p>

	<p pid="b.422W.5/2">In May 2004, 11 staff worked on learning disability policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.5/3">The Department has reorganised the way it works in all policy areas and reduced in size in consequence. Policy on learning disability is clearly expressed and set out in the Valuing People&quot; White Paper. As new policies need to be developed, extra resources will be brought in as necessary from a pool of staff that currently numbers 40. In both years, 14 staff in the Valuing People&quot; support team have been responsible for supporting implementation of the policy. Currently four staff devote a proportion of their time to learning disability issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.5/4">The Department of Health and other Government Departments are undertaking a number of projects on wider areas of work. These include the adult services Green Paper, Independence Well-Being and Choice&quot;, the Prime Minister's strategy unit report, Improving Life Chances for Disabled People&quot;, the Mental Capacity Act implementation and the Supporting People&quot; programme. These all benefit people with learning disabilities, although they are not exclusively for this client group.</p>

Concerns regarding possible side effects from high doses of fluticasone, and other inhaled steroids, led the then Medicines Control Agency to conduct an exhaustive review of the evidence for this in 1997. The CSM issued advice in a bulletin to healthcare professionals in 1998 about possible adverse effects of both inhaled and nasal steroids, especially when used in high doses and for prolonged periods. In addition, further advice specifically relating to adult doses of Flixotide was issued in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.8/18">The CSM conducted a further wide-ranging review of the issue of adrenal suppression caused by high dose inhaled steroids, such as fluticasone, in 2002, resulting in further strengthened warnings to prescribers and a reminder of the licensed doses of these products. The safety of Flixotide remains under continual review.</p>

	<p pid="b.426W.5/1">To underpin increased capacity in medical schools, we have introduced a range of measures that help the supply of general practitioners. Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire have a strategy to increase the recruitment, retention and training of GPs in the two counties, and are participating in the centrally funded GP flexible career scheme, which seeks to increase the number of flexible posts in general practice. In addition, other family friendly policies have been introduced, including access to childcare co-ordinators and better provision of childcare for primary care staff. These include funding through global sum for locum cover for GPs on maternity, paternity and adoptive leave.</p>

Craven, Harrogate and Rural district PCT is not forecasting a deficit for 2004&ndash;05. Tees and East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service national health service trust is forecasting that it will break even in 2004&ndash;05 having received planned brokerage of &pound;2.6 million from the North and East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire strategic health authority (SHA). The Selby and York PCT's three year (iterative) financial recovery plan was presented to the PCT board on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-17">17 May 2005</phrase> and approved. The South Tees hospitals NHS trust is forecasting a deficit of &pound;9 million as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, as opposed to a mid-year forecast deficit of &pound;12 million.

	<p pid="b.427W.5/3">It is now the responsibility of SHAs to deliver both overall financial balance for their local health communities and to ensure each organisation achieves financial balance. However, there is a degree of flexibility in how this is managed at a local level. In circumstances where a surplus or underspend cannot be generated in the following year, SHAs can agree to a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years.</p>

The Department has made it clear that funding for newly licensed treatments should not be withheld because guidance from NICE is unavailable. In these circumstances, we expect primary care trusts (PCTs) to take full account of the available evidence when reaching funding decisions.

Price increases therefore reflect considerations such as the firm's required rate of return, as well as costs including the cost of other standards designed to protect users and their families. Local social service departments and the national health service pay for over two thirds of the cost of residential care, and significant extra resources have been made available as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/3">Funding for social services has increased by 6 per cent. a year over the three years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. These increases follow a 20 per cent. increase in the level of funding for social services between 1996&ndash;97 and 2002&ndash;03. This enables local councils to contract with providers at realistic prices.</p>
