Police data submitted to the UK Football Policing Unit, from more than 3,000 football matches each season, shows police issued section 27 notices to football supporters on 60 occasions during 2009-10 and 69 occasions during 2010-11.

	<p pid="a.956W.8/2">Discussions took place in 2009 between Home Office, the UK Football Policing Unit, the Association of Chief Police Officers and individual police forces on the use of section 27 powers during police football operations. These discussions focused on the need to ensure that any use is proportionate and appropriate, fully compliant with the Act, follows Home Office guidance and does not stereotype the behaviours of groups of football supporters. The decision to use section 27 is an operational matter for chief officers.</p>

	<p pid="a.967W.2/2">The cost of calling HMRC is dependent on several factors. Calls are charged to the customer based on the tariff arrangements they have with their service provider, the device they use for the call and the location from which they call.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.2/3">However, HMRC recognise that the cost of calling its 0845 numbers can be an issue for some customers&#8212;particularly those using pay-as-you-go mobile phones. It has therefore been actively reviewing its numbering strategy to see if it can find ways of reducing the costs involved while striking the right balance between costs to the caller and costs to the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.2/4">I can confirm that as part of the process of agreeing its next telephony contract-which is due to take effect by June 2013&#8212;HMRC will continue to investigate alternatives to 0845 numbers. As a first and immediate step, HMRC expect that they will, by the end of the year be able to offer an 0345 number for those customers calling its tax credit helpline (which last year accounted for around 40% of the total calls handled by its contact centre network).</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.2/5">The provision of a 0345 number is expected to result in significant cost savings for the majority of callers to the line.</p>

	<p pid="a.967W.5/15">All disclosures received by HMRC are subject to close examination. It is the returns of scheme users that are potentially subject to enquiry rather than the scheme disclosure itself and each disclosed scheme may have multiple users. Many users of the schemes are subject to further investigation by HMRC's teams of tax specialists. Although information on investigations is held by HMRC, it is not collated centrally in the form requested and it is not possible to provide details within the time and cost constraints.</p>

	<p pid="a.974W.2/2">The Government believe that the best way to raise boys' attainment is by raising the status and quality of teaching; investing in school leadership; setting clear expectations of what all children must know and be able to do at each stage of education and freeing up schools to develop their own strategies for tackling underperformance.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.2/3">There is ho single strategy that has been shown to achieve the best possible results for boys, disadvantaged boys or boys from a minority ethnic background. Evidence does show however, that schools are independently important for narrowing attainment gaps. That is why we are providing head teachers with the freedom and the funding they need to develop local solutions to local needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.2/4">From April 2011, for example, the &#163;201 million Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant has been mainstreamed into the wider Dedicated Schools Grant. This will give schools greater freedom over how the grant is spent and allow them to respond more flexibly to the needs of ethnic minority pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.2/5">We have also introduced a pupil premium and increased this to &#163;488 per pupil, providing additional funding for the most disadvantaged pupils of both genders at both primary and secondary level. Total funding for the pupil premium is &#163;625 million in 2011-12 and this will rise to &#163;2.5 billion a year by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.2/6">The data, from foundation stage onwards, do point to a persistent problem with boys' mastery of English and literacy. To narrow the GCSE attainment gap between boys and girls, we need intervene early to make sure that boys can read well. By ensuring high quality synthetic phonics teaching, we will improve literacy levels for all pupils, helping them to develop a love of reading and giving them a solid base on which to build their future education.</p>

Of these 112 were in respect of closed schools where the playing field was not needed by any other local school. Prior to 1998 playing fields were not protected and this information, along with the acreage of fields sold each year, is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.5/3">School playing fields are protected by Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The aim of the legislation is to stop their indiscriminate sale. It sets out clear criteria for sales and establishes a system of checks. Schools and local authorities must obtain the Secretary of State for Education's approval before they can dispose of their land; and applications to dispose of school playing fields are approved only when it is demonstrated that the land is genuinely surplus to the needs of all local schools and community sports activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.981W.11/2">The Government believe that ship salvage and towage is properly a commercial matter between a ship's operator and the established commercial tug industry. The commercial tug and salvage industry will be used by operators in future to assist ships that get into difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.11/3">Following the withdrawal of publicly funded emergency towing vessels (ETVs), the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has arrangements in hand for shipping to be alerted in the areas affected. The relevant coastguard co-ordination centres will actively monitor shipping using the automatic identification system and will be proactive in contacting ships that are observed to be stopped at sea or behaving erratically. Coastguards will monitor tug availability in the waters around the UK and will encourage ship masters, owners and their insurers to take early action to summon tug assistance should ships get into difficulty or become disabled. Coastguards will also advise the principal salvage and towage brokers about the existence of disabled vessels so that they can match market capabilities with demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.11/4">Additionally, Her Majesty's Coastguard has longstanding arrangements with ports, harbours and tug brokers for the supply of tugs in an emergency situation, and the Coastguard Agreement for Salvage and Towing (CAST) provides a further option for the provision of emergency towing.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.5/2">On any day there will be around 400 vessels with a bollard pull of between 30 and 300 tons operating in UK waters and the North sea. Around 90% of these will typically engaged for service against short-term or long-term commercial contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.5/3">Around 10% of the vessels can be expected to be capable of being available to be tasked to respond to requests for salvage or emergency towage, with a majority of these being based along the east coast of the UK or in the North sea. There will also be tugs available to respond to vessels in the English channel and Western Approaches to the Irish sea although they may vary in number because their positioning closely reflects the likely opportunity for salvage and wider towage market conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.986W.9/3">To mitigate these harsh conditions we have in place a robust support and allowance package that is kept under regular review. This package includes a range of services such as shops, operational fitness equipment, and entertainment facilities. It also provides telephone and internet facilities and pastoral care by deployed chaplains. The services that individuals will be readily able to access will, however, understandably vary depending on their location.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.9/4">Communication facilities, in particular, have been significantly improved in the last year. Iridium satellite phones, text link, email and wi-fi internet access are now being provided at even some of the most austere locations. Moreover, in addition to the digital television that is provided in the main operating bases, British Forces Broadcasting Service has introduced an internet television facility to allow individuals a much broader range of options for what they can watch and when.</p>

	<p pid="a.988W.5/26">The MOD is required to seek the Attorney's nomination in any case in which we wish to choose counsel who are not on the panel, for example, to use leading counsel. The panel system is also supplemented by the retention of two senior counsel known as &#8216;First Treasury Counsel&#8217; to advise on, and represent the Department in, particularly complex and sensitive matters. Hourly rates of &#163;220 have been agreed with the two current First Treasury Counsel, James Eadie QC and Jonathan Swift QC.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/27">Similar arrangements exist in Scotland overseen by the Office of the Advocate-General. As with the Attorney-General in England and Wales, the Advocate-General maintains a panel of standing junior Counsel in Scotland. The Advocate-General likewise approves nomination for the instruction of senior counsel.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/28">When assistance from external firms of solicitors is required in England and Wales, the MOD also choose from panels of competitively selected firms, with which Government have negotiated fee rates. The MOD also instructs a panel of external law firms to provide commercial legal services in support of private finance initiatives and major Defence projects. Since January 2010, this panel consists of the following private firms: Denton Wilde Sapte, Shepherd and Wedderburn, Mills and Reeve, Pinsent Masons, Wragge and Co., Simmons and Simmons and Field Fisher Waterhouse. The MOD has in place framework agreements with each of these firms with rates which were agreed during the competitive selection process. Expenditure on the panel for 2010-11 is currently being collated.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/29">In Scotland, the MOD acquires legal services for a period of four years by means of a competitive tendering exercise that is open to all law firms able to provide advice on Scots Law. From <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-01">1 September 2011</phrase>, Morton Fraser LLP retained this contract following the competitive tender being found to provide best value to the MOD. I am withholding details of current rates charged, as their disclosure would prejudice commercial interests. I am however able to disclose that the fees paid in the last year of the former contract were &#163;799,454, a lower figure than that incurred in each of the preceding two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.5/30">Finally, in keeping with the Government's Transparency Agenda, since 2010 the MOD has subject to the accepted Freedom of Information and Data Protection exemptions, published details of payments of over &#163;25,000 on a monthly basis at the following internet address:</p>

	<p pid="a.1000W.11/2">The Government and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) established the nations and regions group (NRG) to ensure UK-wide engagement and to maximise the legacy from London 2012. This group works directly with representatives from each of the nations and English regions to realise the sporting, economic, and cultural benefits of the 2012 games.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.11/3">As part of the funding of the London 2012 activity in the nations and regions the Department is contributing towards the costs of the Scottish Government employing the Inspire programmer in Scotland from 2010-11 to 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.11/4">Scotland stands to gain from the wide range of opportunities created by the 2012 games, through businesses winning games-related work, increased tourism and cultural celebrations. Some examples of how Scotland will benefit from the games are given as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.11/5">Over 19,800 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for LOCOG's London 2012 education programme Get Set, 1,251 schools and colleges are registered in Scotland, 44.7% of the total number of schools and colleges in the nation. 95 schools in the Fife area have registered for Get Set including Glenrothes High School.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.11/6">Over 1,700 cultural or sporting projects across the UK have been awarded the Inspire mark. In Scotland 36 projects have been awarded Inspire marks. In June 2011, the Festival of Sport was launched in Scotland, Fife council participated in this Inspire marked project. The aim of the festival was using the inspiration of the games to profile physical activity and increase the membership of sports clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.11/7">The Legacy Trust have awarded &#163;4.7 million for 'The Scottish Project', a diverse range of cultural, sporting and educational activities, bringing together thousands of volunteers, artists and the public to leave a lasting legacy from London 2012 and Glasgow 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.11/8">In addition, 25 contracts have been awarded by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) to businesses in the nation. These include KN Environmental Services Ltd from Perth who provided materials for the Aquatics Centre, Millstream Associates Ltd from Aberdeen who provided procurement services and Mason Land Surveys Ltd from Dunfermline who provided engineering services. The hon. Member can find a list of contractors on the ODA suppliers map at the link as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.1000W.11/10">So far 4,072 companies in the nation have registered on Competefor (the website where London 2012 contract opportunities are advertised), and 48 contracts have been awarded to Competefor suppliers. Not all the information on 'supply chain' level contracts is in the public domain. There may be other companies that have secured &#8216;supply chain&#8217; contracts in the nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.11/11">Locations across the UK, particularly those that are hosting international teams in pre-games training camps (PGTCs), have additional opportunities to realise the economic benefits of the games. Two agreements have been signed with teams to hold PGTCs in Scotland, with the National Olympic Committees of Zambia and Namibia. In addition, Hampden Park will host rounds of the football competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.11/12">The Department is currently working with Glasgow 2014 Ltd on the post-games relocation of shooting range assets to Scotland. Furthermore, there is the potential for relocation of other facilities as part of the LOCOG post-games games equipment and assets transfers.</p>

Jobseekers may undertake up to two weeks of full-time training in any 12-month period, with the agreement of their Jobcentre Plus adviser, without jeopardising their benefit entitlements. Jobseekers who have been on jobseeker's allowance for more than six months are able to access training for up to 30-hours per week for up to eight weeks, subject to the agreement of their adviser, and still remain on jobseeker's allowance. Jobseekers can also undertake part-time education or training at any point in their claim and continue to receive jobseeker's allowance as long as they continue to meet the basic conditions of entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.2/2">For other types of training, the Department can pay training allowances instead of jobseeker's allowance. But this, like help to cover travel costs for accessing training, or paying for replacement adult or child care to enable a claimant to undertake training, is met from the Flexible Support Fund and is discretionary.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005W.2/1">Since October 2008, new claims to incapacity benefits have been made to employment and support allowance so the only flows to old-style incapacity benefits&#8212;incapacity benefit (IB) and severe disablement allowance (SDA) have been from linked claims. Information on flows to incapacity benefits and other benefits can be found on the Department's Tabulation Tool at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.2/2"><a href="http://83.244.183.180/flows/flows_on/tabtool.html">http://83.244.183.180/flows/flows_on/tabtool.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.2/3">For example, the following link shows flows onto old-style incapacity benefits for people of working age by region/country. This shows the number of flows in the year to February 2011 was 1,820 in Wales:</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.2/4"><a href="http://83.244.183.180/flows/flows_on/ibsda/cdquarter/ccgor/ccclient/a_carate_r_cdquarter_c_ccgor_p_ccclient_working_age.html">http://83.244.183.180/flows/flows_on/ibsda/cdquarter/ccgor/ccclient/a_carate_r_cdquarter_c_ccgor_p_ccclient_working_ age.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.2/5">The number of flows onto old-style incapacity benefits in Wrexham local authority area is around 60. This is calculated from further breakdowns available using the tabulation tool.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.2/6">Information tracking people claiming old-style incapacity benefits and what happened to them at the personal capability assessment (PCA) is only held from October 2008 onwards. At this stage most assessments related to existing longer term incapacity benefit claims and not new incapacity benefit claims, (i.e. repeat PCAs and not the initial PCA). Therefore, information relating to both initial and repeat PCAs combined has been presented.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.2/7">Table 1 shows information on the number and outcomes of PCAs carried out between March 2010 and February 2011 (the latest data available). Note that the information in Table 1 cannot be directly compared to data on new claims to IB as the data contain information on repeat PCAs which make up the vast majority of PCAs carried out in this time period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1006W.3/1">We believe that EU accession, and the accession process itself, is the best guarantee for bringing about long-term stability in the Western Balkans. As I said in response to the EU enlargement progress reports, we remain clear that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the EU once the full range of criteria have been met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.3/2">In addition to our support for the EU accession process, the UK also pursues a range of activity in the region aimed at increasing stability. The Western Balkans has been allocated &#163;5.52 million this financial year as part of the Conflict Prevention Fund. Project work is also funded through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Diplomatic Values and Influence Fund&#8212;Reuniting Europe. Some examples of the steps the FCO has taken to help increase stability in the Western Balkans include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.3/3">In Albania project work supports the Supreme Court, Bar Chamber and Parliament. For example, the parliamentary project is working to tackle the political stalemate through supporting dialogue in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.3/4">In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the UK provides secondees to the EU Police Mission and the Ministry of Public Security. The UK strongly supports the role of the EU-led Peacekeeping Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR Althea, contributing troops, and has seconded a UK national to support the work of the EU Special Representative Peter Sorensen. The UK also commits programme funding to post-conflict reconciliation and Srebrenica-related projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.3/5">In Kosovo, the UK currently provides over 30 secondees to the EU Rule of Law Mission (EULEX), including the Deputy Head of Mission, judges, police officers and the Head of Customs. The UK is also funding conflict-related projects, such as on post-war property issues. Kosovo's progress as an independent state is crucial for the region's stability and to this end the UK remains actively engaged in lobbying for further recognitions. I have met the leaders of the Kosovan and Serbian delegations to the EU-facilitated dialogue, as the UK strongly supports the dialogue as a means for stabilising relations between Pristina and Belgrade.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.3/6">In Macedonia, the FCO supported the Ohrid Framework Agreement academic conference in June. This reinforced the importance of closer inter-ethnic relations as a way of further securing stability in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.3/7">In Montenegro, the UK is providing project support to assist with the implementation of the reforms required for EU and NATO membership. This will enable Montenegro to be a stable country inclusive of ail its communities and making progress towards its Euro-Atlantic ambitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.3/8">In Serbia, the UK is spending &#163;500,000 in this financial year supporting conflict prevention activity, including activities strengthening civil society links between Serbia and Kosovo, improving access for ethnic minorities to state institutions, and increasing the range of Serbian actors involved in reconciliation activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1012W.8/2">In my discussions, I made clear the UK's condemnation of the violence against civilians who are expressing their views in peaceful protests, and the need for the Syrian authorities to show restraint and to respond to the legitimate demands of people with immediate and genuine reform, not brutal repression.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.8/3">We have also led work to secure UN action. The UN Security Council Presidential Statement issued on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-03">3 August</phrase> condemned the violence in Syria. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-04">4 October</phrase>, the Security Council voted on a draft UK, French, German and Portuguese resolution on Syria, condemning the Syrian regime's use of force, calling for an end to violence, and threatening sanctions. Nine of the fifteen members of the UNSC voted in favour of this Resolution, but Russia and China regrettably chose to block it. It is a mistake on their part to side with a brutal regime rather than with the people of Syria.</p>

	<p pid="a.1013W.9/1">There is no national body that supervises the activities and charges made by private bailiffs' companies recovering debts owing to local authorities. These activities and charges are governed by a combination of statute, secondary legislation and the individual contract arrangements agreed between the local authority and the bailiff company concerned. Concerns about the activities and charges of bailiffs, acting on behalf of a local authority, should be directed to the local authority or if appropriate, to the court for review. There are no figures available detailing the number of prosecutions against bailiffs for illegal action. The Government are clear that aggressive bailiff activity is unacceptable and are committed to bringing forward effective proposals which protect the public and ensure that bailiff action is proportionate.

	<p pid="a.1019W.2/1">All EU member states are parties to the European convention on human rights and are required under that instrument to provide those charged with a criminal offence the right to a fair trial and to respect the fundamental rights of litigants in civil proceedings. The action that the Ministry of Justice can take bilaterally in respect of the domestic legal systems of other member states is limited; however bilateral meetings are sometimes held to raise particular issues in appropriate circumstances. Consular staff from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office can offer assistance to British nationals who are detained in other EU member states. While they cannot give legal advice, they can give basic information about the local legal system and provide a list of local lawyers. If appropriate they will consider approaching the local authorities if a British national who has been arrested in another country is not being treated in line with internationally-accepted standards of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.2/2">At EU level, the Ministry of Justice is participating in the negotiations on a series of EU measures to set minimum standards in the area of procedural rights for defendants in criminal proceedings known as the &#8220;Roadmap&#8221; on Procedural Rights. These instruments aim to ensure that all member states provide a high minimum standard of rights to defendants so that competent authorities are able to operate EU instruments of mutual recognition against a background of mutual trust, and they will benefit UK citizens in other member states. The UK opted in to the first two measures on the Roadmap, but has not opted in at the initial stage of the negotiations to the latest directive: on access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and the right to communicate upon arrest. The Government believe that access to a lawyer is an essential right of accused persons at appropriate stages of any process of criminal investigations. However, we are of the view that the Commission's proposal is not proportionate and could have an adverse effect on our ability to investigate and prosecute offences effectively. The Government are participating in the negotiations and if our concerns are satisfactorily addressed, we will consider applying to opt in once the instrument has been adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.2/3">EU legislation in the area of civil judicial co-operation is restricted to matters having cross-border implications. In the context of facilitating the international recognition and enforcement of civil judgments within the EU, which is regulated at the EU level, a UK priority is always to secure a fair balance between enabling claimants to get their judgments recognised and enforced abroad and, at the same time, ensuring that there is proper protection for the interests of defendants. The means whereby this balance is struck varies depending on the nature of the particular civil proceedings which are being regulated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1020W.2/2">The information requested is not held centrally. Costs are either unavailable or can be derived only at disproportionate cost for hearings for which it is not possible to attribute case costs to elements of the decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1035W.5/1">In 2010, the Department funded NHS Improvement to work with a number of national health service organisations to identify the benefits of pathway redesign in audiology services and spread good practice. Models to improve accessibility of audiology services including delivering care closer to home, delivering services in the community and the introduction of direct access healthcare scientist-led clinics have been identified and shared with the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1035W.5/2">A key enabler to improve accessibility is extending patient choice of provider which is intended to empower patients and carers, improve their outcomes and experience, enable service innovation and free up clinicians to drive change and improve practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1035W.5/3">Any qualified provider (AQP) is a model to support such choice&#8212;it means that when patients are referred (usually by their general practitioner) for a particular service, they should be able to choose from a list of qualified providers which meet NHS service quality requirements, prices and normal contractual obligations. Adult hearing services is one of the eight clinical areas identified through consultation as a priority for the first phase of AQP implementation. Subject to local commissioning decisions, during 2012, the AQP model will start to benefit people with hearing problems and will be a key step to ensuring greater access, choice and convenience for patients needing audiology services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1037W.8/4">As such the Department is able to derive, for each income line in the accounts, how much of that income is received from third parties (i.e. non-NHS bodies). However, it is not possible to disaggregate this income by individual (non-NHS) third parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.1039W.2/1">In &#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January 2011</phrase>, we have committed over &#163;450 million over the next four years to support earlier diagnosis of cancer. This money will be used to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer; fund increased general practitioner (GP) access to diagnostic tests; and pay for more testing and treatment in secondary care. One of the tests we are increasing access to is non-obstetric ultrasound to support the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. We are working on a guide to help GPs with the relevant criteria for requesting non-obstetric ultrasounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/2">To assess what more can be done to encourage appropriate referrals to secondary care and to diagnose less common cancers such as ovarian cancer earlier, the Strategy also set out our commitment to work with a number of rarer cancer-focused charities to discuss their concerns. Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including an ovarian cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis, such as symptom awareness, and to discuss potential solutions. This will inform our future work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/3">Early symptoms ovarian cancer can include pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, persistent bloating and difficulty eating. However, they can be difficult to recognise, especially when the disease is at an early stage, as they are often the same as the symptoms of other, less serious, conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or pre-menstrual syndrome.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/4">To improve public awareness of the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer the Department has worked with health professionals, patient groups and charities to develop key standardised messages on ovarian cancer for the public. These are now available on NHS Choices and the Department encourages the national health service and charities to use them widely in awareness raising activities. Key messages have also been developed for health professionals to support the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer and are available on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/5">In April this year, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a clinical guideline, the &#8220;Recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer&#8221;, which sets out recommendations for the detection of the disease in primary care. In addition to this, NICE is developing a Quality Standard (QS) for ovarian cancer which will set out what good ovarian cancer treatment and support looks like and will help support clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) when they take responsibility for commissioning ovarian cancer services. Detection of ovarian cancer in primary care will also be considered when developing this standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/6">Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, the Department will hold the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) to account for the outcomes it achieves through the NHS Outcomes Framework, and will publish a mandate to the NHS CB which will set out objectives the NHS CB should seek to achieve. The Department will not, therefore, issue guidance directly to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), but the NHS CB will be able to publish guidance for clinical commissioning groups, to which CCGs must have regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/7">The Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) will be the forum to bring together elected councillors, local authority officers, patient representatives and clinical commissioning groups to develop shared understanding of local need, develop joint local priorities, and encourage commissioners to work in a more integrated and joined up manner, we have strengthened the requirements around HWBs involvement in the commissioning plans of CCGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/8">Regarding the introduction of a screening programme for ovarian cancer, the NHS Constitution commits the Government to provide screening programmes as recommended by the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (UK NSC). The UK NSC is responsible for advising Ministers and the NHS in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/9">The UK NSC's current position on ovarian cancer screening is that it should not be offered except in the context of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKTOCS) randomised controlled trial. The UK NSC agreed at its meeting in June 2010 that screening for ovarian cancer would next be reviewed when results of UKTOCS were published or earlier if any new significant peer reviewed evidence emerges in the meantime. The initial follow up of the UKTOCS trial is expected to be complete in December 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/10">Finally, the Department is a partner in the Technology Strategy Board's Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform (SMIP) initiative and also Cancer Research UK's (CRUK) Stratified Medicine Programme. The SMIP brings together the stratified medicine-related activities of a number of important organisations to accelerate the development and uptake of stratified medicine in the UK. Specifically in cancer, the SMIP has so far invested &#163;6 million in industry-led collaborations developing new genetic tests and data handling solutions, which are co-ordinated with CRUK's Stratified Medicine Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.2/11">CRUK is carrying out a two-year project to collect genetic data from tumours and information on how gene faults affect patient survival, helping research to develop new cancer drugs targeted at specific genetic mutations. The project will recruit up to 9,000 patients and collect data on six tumour types, including ovarian.</p>

I also announced that my plan to consult on improvements to the buying and selling process of park homes to prevent the unacceptable practice of the blocking of lawful sales by unscrupulous site owners and to provide an effective means of redress for residents where this happens. In May my officials and I met with key industry and resident partners, and my officials met separately with local authority partners and representatives of holiday caravan owners, to help inform the consultation and gain a better understanding of the expectations and aspirations of our partners in this sector of the housing market.

	<p pid="a.1048W.6/2">The Government published their draft new planning policy for Traveller sites for consultation in April. The consultation closed in August. We are currently analysing the responses and intend to publish a new policy as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1048W.6/3">In the meantime, Circular 01/2006 (Planning for Gypsy and Traveller Caravan Sites) and Circular 04/2007 (Planning for Travelling Showpeople) are extant. However, decision makers are entitled to have regard to the fact that it is intended to withdraw them and replace them with the draft policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.2/1">Information on planning applications within the green belt submitted to district level local authorities is not available centrally. Statistics published by the Department do show, however, that between 2% and 3% of new dwellings were built in the green belt each year between 2001 and 2010. I would add that the last Government's top-down regional strategies sought to remove green belt protection in 30 towns and cities across the country.</p>
