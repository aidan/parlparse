'Cycle Sense' encourages teenagers to wear cycle helmets and provides advice on technique; cycle maintenance and visibility are also addressed. The campaign consists of a series of posters, a website and a supporting TV Filler film. Earlier this year, the Department also ran a new cycle safety campaign aimed at teenagers with Emap magazines and TV channels, featuring a website and a comic to support it. 'Cycle Smart', which includes a comic, website and posters, is aimed at younger children and uses Disney characters to communicate simple cycle safety messages.</p>

	<p pid="c.154W.12/2">BW plans to increase fees by 2.7 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> and is considering an additional 10 per cent. increase over and above the agreed licence fee index from 2008 onwards. The EA, following consultation with users, has approved an increase in registration fees of 12 per cent. for 2007-08, with the total increase over the next three years likely to be around 40 per cent. The Broads Authority charges tolls for vessels using its waterways. Tolls for 2007-08 have not been finalised but are likely to increase by 9.9 per cent. for private craft and 6.1 per cent. for hire fleet vessels.</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.12/3">The cost of maintaining our inland waterways is considerable and in order for them to remain sustainable, boaters need to contribute a fair and reasonable amount. Research and consultation carried out by DEFRA-sponsored navigation authorities suggest that, while any increase in licence and/or registration fees is unpopular, they are still manageable. The cost of boating on other inland waterways is a matter for the relevant navigation authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.163W.0/1">In the article that Mr. Booker wrote in June, he suggested that the report published by the US Environment Protection Agency in 2005 demonstrated that the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive was an unnecessary piece of legislation. I do not share this view.</p>
	<p pid="c.163W.0/2">The Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive aims to minimise the amount of hazardous substances in waste electrical and electrical equipment that could enter landfill sites at end of life by restricting the levels of such substances that are used in the manufacture of such equipment.</p>
	<p pid="c.163W.0/3">It is well known and widely recognised that the four heavy metals restricted by the RoHS Directive (and, as a consequence, the UK RoHS Regulations 2006) are toxic materials that could cause death, illness and other medium to long-term health impacts. This is also the case in regard to the polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) restricted by the Directive. The situation in respect of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is less conclusive, so the most commonly used&mdash;DecaBDE&mdash;has been exempted from the restrictions in the light of extensive research undertaken for the European Commission by the Environment Agency for England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="c.164W.5/2">Firstly, the implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive provides a significant opportunity to modernise and simplify the UK's consumer law framework. We are still considering how to implement the Directive, but one option is to provide access to civil and criminal investigative powers for almost all breaches of the Directive. Given that the Directive contains important provisions that are new to UK law, this would effectively extend Trading Standards' existing powers. We are also considering placing a duty to enforce on Trading Standards and the OFT in order to ensure effective enforcement of the Directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.164W.5/3">Secondly, the Consumer Protection Co-operation regulation will provide enforcers, including Trading Standards departments, with a new power of on-site inspection to investigate civil infringements of consumer law. In addition, the regulation formalises co-operation arrangements on the enforcement of intra-Community laws that protect consumers' interests. It will therefore place a legal requirement on enforcers to provide mutual assistance for the exchange of information and co-operation on cross-border cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.164W.5/4">In addition, the Government will be establishing the Local Better Regulation Office which will work in partnership with Trading Standards to reduce administrative burdens on business.</p>

	<p pid="c.172W.2/1">Under the rules of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 75 (AFPS 75) officers who complete 16 years reckonable service from age 21 receive an immediate pension (IP) based on the representative rate of pay for their rank.</p>
	<p pid="c.172W.2/2">The IP point was set at 16 years to meet the needs of the armed forces in terms of its manpower profile. Service beyond this point will normally be subject to the individual's potential. Typically, officers leaving at the IP will be in the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Major or Squadron Leader, and will be awarded a pension of &pound;12,942 per annum and a pension lump sum of &pound;38,826.</p>
	<p pid="c.172W.2/3">Under AFPS 75, members of the armed forces with the same rank and same number of years' service are normally awarded the same pension, regardless of their actual pay either at retirement or discharge, or earlier in their career. This is known as the representative pay rate. Representative pay is worked out using specially selected rates of military salary.</p>
	<p pid="c.172W.2/4">The Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2005, which was introduced in April 2005 under the provision of the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act 2004, does not feature an IP. Instead, officers who serve for at least 18 years and are aged at least 40 (the Early Departure Payment Point) will receive payments under the Early Departure Payments Scheme Order 2005. The aim of these payments is to encourage personnel to serve until the Early Departure Payment Point and to compensate them for the fact that the armed forces cannot offer the majority a career until age 55.</p>

	<p pid="c.172W.5/1">The retirement age of 55 for the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 75 (AFPS 75) was set to reflect the career structure of the armed forces and standards of fitness and health we required of Service personnel. The majority of Service personnel who are members of AFPS 75 serve leave before the immediate pension point (16 years from age 21 for officers and 22 years from age 18 for other ranks) and their pensions are preserved until age 60 for service before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> and until age 65 for service after that date: very few members of the armed forces continue in service until age 55.</p>
	<p pid="c.172W.5/2">The question of normal retirement age was considered during the review which led to the introduction of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2005 (AFPS 05) in April 2005 and it was decided to keep it at age 55 for the reasons set out above. The preserved pension age for AFPS 05 members is 65. AFPS 05 does not feature an immediate pension point because provisions of the Finance Act 2004 prevent pensions in the new scheme being paid before age 50 except in the case of ill-health retirement. Instead, payments will be made under the Early Departure Payment Order 2005 which are aimed at drawing Service personnel through to at least age 40 with 18 years service, and then compensating them for the fact that the armed forces cannot offer the majority a career until age 55.</p>

The retirement age for magistrates is set at 70 by s.12(2) and 13(1) of the Courts Act 2003. Therefore, moving magistrates on to the Supplemental List at age 70 will not constitute unlawful age discrimination under the Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.179W.8/3">It is our policy to increase judicial diversity and it is particularly important that magistrates, whose great strength is that they are local people delivering local justice, reflect the diverse communities they serve. Nationally, 80 per cent. of magistrates are over 50. We need to recruit substantially more magistrates under the age of 50, and allowing magistrates to sit beyond 70 would work against this important objective.</p>

	<p pid="c.186W.8/1">In relation to question 102804, the Information Commissioner has responded to two previous related consultations: on the Every Child Matters Green Paper (2003), and on recording practitioner details for potentially sensitive services and recording concern (2004-05). We are currently consulting on draft regulations that will bring the index into operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.186W.8/2">We have consulted the Information Commissioner throughout the development of the information sharing index and we continue to value this important relationship. We look forward to receiving the Information Commissioner's response to the draft regulations, and to engaging with him further on the draft statutory guidance for the index that will cover issues such as subject access requests and securing explicit consent in handling sensitive services.</p>
	<p pid="c.186W.8/3">In relation to question 102805, the index will receive initial data and regular updates from existing databases including, where appropriate, those of the police, to help establish and maintain accurate and up-to-date records. There will be no facility to link the index to police records, nor to feed data back into police databases. Information may only be disclosed from the index for the purposes set out in sections 10 and 11 of the Children Act 2004 and section 175 of the Education Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.186W.8/4">In relation to question 102810, access to the index will be granted according to the role of the practitioner. Draft regulations specify the types of practitioners whose role would make it appropriate for them to have access to the index, including authorised staff employed by a number of national and local voluntary and community sector organisations. The draft regulations provide that decisions on the practitioners who will be granted access may be made by a local authority, by a body designated by a local authority or by a body designated by the Secretary of State. All authorised users must have undergone an enhanced CRB check and have received training in the correct use of the index and the importance of security and good security practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.186W.8/5">In relation to question 102811, it is intended that the DfES will, in time, contract out the running of the central functions of the index once it is operational. This body will be responsible for national statistical reporting and monitoring local authority operation of the index. Both national and local index operation will be subject to scrutiny by the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.186W.8/6">All index user access will be continuously recorded and reviewed for suspicious patterns of access. Where suspected misuse is detected, it will be the responsibility of the agency where the practitioner works to investigate and, where appropriate, take action under their disciplinary and performance management arrangements. Misuse of the index may lead to a penalty or imprisonment.</p>

At the CCW Review Conference we secured agreement for a group of governmental experts to look at these issues, including existing International Humanitarian Law and the reliability of cluster munitions, reporting back to the next meeting of States Parties in November 2007. The process will include the main users and producers of cluster munitions and is an essential preliminary step towards any negotiations on a new and legally binding protocol which could restrict the manufacture, stockpiling, use and transfer of those cluster munitions which are of greatest humanitarian concern.</p>

	<p pid="c.191W.3/1">In Lebanon, some progress has been made in rebuilding communities. As of <phrase class="date" code="">21 November</phrase>, 73 villages in the south have received financial assistance (21 per cent. of total) and this process should be complete by the end of January 2007. The Jieh power station is being rehabilitated and 100 per cent. of all transmission lines have been repaired. 575 damaged schools have been rehabilitated. Six of the 24 destroyed bridges have been fully repaired and detours have been built around all other bridge locations. DFID provided six temporary bridges to the Lebanese authorities to help improve humanitarian access. 68 per cent. (1.7 million cubic metres) of rubble has been cleared. One of the most difficult problems is danger to civilians from unexploded bombs. So far over 16 per cent. (31.5 sq km) of land affected by unexploded ordnance has been cleared, supported by a DFID contribution of &pound;1.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.191W.3/2">Israel has not asked for assistance from the UK, nor, to our understanding, from any other country. Residents returned rapidly to their homes after the ceasefire and our understanding is that the Government are providing compensation to those families who suffered damages. The Israel Emergency Campaign of the United Jewish Communities/federation system has raised nearly $330 million to help the most vulnerable Israeli communities in the north. For example it has made allocations for emergency small business grants, for school supplies for families living with financial hardship, and for school-readiness programs to help pupils return to normalcy before the start of the school year.</p>

	<p pid="c.191W.6/1">We will set out our priorities for the increased aid allocation in a new Country Assistance Plan (CAP) for Pakistan. DFID officials are now preparing for the consultation process. We will seek as wide a variety of views as possible and ensure they are fed into our CAP thinking and planning. The Government of Pakistan has made progress in fighting extreme poverty and hunger but very real needs remain. One in 10 children die before their fifth birthday; around eight million children do not go to school; approximately 50 per cent. of the adult population are illiterate, two thirds of whom are women; and at the last count, some 38 million were living below the poverty line in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.191W.6/2">At the G8 conference in 2005 the UK made a commitment to increase its aid budget to 0.7 per cent. of national income by 2013. This rise in DFID's budget will enable us to increase our spending in those countries which need it most, including Pakistan, in order to help them to meet the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

	<p pid="c.199W.8/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary question about what the planned timetable is for the completion of the upgrading and replacement of the Stranmillis Road foul and storm drainage system (101852). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.199W.8/4" class="indent">At a meeting with Water Service officials in December 2004, you were advised that a major upgrading of the public sewer at Stranmillis Road was included in the capital investment programme to begin during the 2005-06 financial year. Subsequent investigations carried out by Water Service indicated that the proposed work could result in serious flooding occurring at the junction of the Stranmillis Road and Malone Road and, as a result, commencement was deferred. Water Service informed you, and local residents, of the position in April 2006 and gave an undertaking that, pending the outcome of further investigations, the existing system would be inspected on a regular basis and any blockages would be removed as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.199W.8/5" class="indent">The latest investigations have concluded that the overall solution to the drainage problems involves the upgrading and replacement of the sewers over a much wider area. This will require a major programme of work and incur significant expenditure. As the commencement of the work will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of funding, I cannot, at this stage, provide a firm timetable. I will, however, ensure that you are kept informed of developments.</p>

	<p pid="c.209W.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Jil Matheson, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-23">23 November 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.3/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking how many people in Scotland aged 16 and 17 earn less than <i> (a)</i> &pound;5.35 and <i> (b)</i> &pound;4.45 an hour and how many people in Scotland aged between 18 and 21 years earn less than &pound;5.35 an hour. I am replying in her absence. (101580, 101582).</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.3/4" class="indent">Earnings statistics are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for employees whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period. The standard definition used for ASHE would only include employees on adult rates of pay, however for this analysis employees on trainee and junior rates have been included. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.3/5" class="indent">For estimates of employees falling below hourly earnings levels, the ASHE does not provide counts, but rather provides estimates of the proportion of total employees. The levels of &pound;5.35 and &pound;4.45 are the current levels of the national minimum wage for employees aged 21 and over and employees aged 18-21 years, which came into effect <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. However, available estimates are based on the ASHE 2006, which relates to April 2006 when the national minimum wage levels were &pound;5.05 and &pound;4.25. The estimates of the proportion of employees in Scotland aged 16 and 17 years earning less than &pound;5.35 and &pound;4.45 an hour are 75 per cent. and 45 per cent. respectively. The estimate of the proportion of employees in Scotland aged between 18 and 21 years earning less than &pound;5.35 an hour is 38 per cent. Corresponding estimates for 16-17 year olds earning less than &pound;5.05 and &pound;4.25 are 60 per cent. and 38 per cent. respectively, with 20 per cent. of 18-21 year olds earning less than &pound;5.05.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.3/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent. sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

	<p pid="c.213W.2/1">The impact of reducing council tax bills by <i> (a)</i> 75 per cent. for Band A homes, <i> (b)</i> 50 per cent. for Band B homes and <i> (c)</i> 25 per cent. for Band C homes is shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.2/2">These figures assume that tax bills in the unaffected bands remain unchanged. Taking into account the resulting fall in the taxbase, while assuming the amount of gross council tax raised locally and nationally remains the same, local authority Band D bills would rise. This would result in higher bills for properties in all Bands not experiencing a reduction in their bill but in no additional cost to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.2/3">Note that reducing council tax bills will have no impact on the council tax benefit recipients themselves while on benefit, because it will not alter their net income after housing costs, although it may help them get out of benefit more easily. The savings to the Department for Work and Pensions reflect the proportion of the overall council tax revenue lost that would have been paid for by that Department.</p>

	<p pid="c.214W.3/1">The Firefighters' Pension Scheme 1992 originates from 1948 when the role of a firefighter was restricted to firefighting duties and it was considered appropriate because of the risks of the job to have a minimum pension age of 50 with 25 or more years' service and a compulsory retirement age of 55. However, a number of factors including: the extension of the role of a firefighter to cover, for example, fire safety; improved personal protective equipment and clothing; a better understanding of risk management; and good occupational health services, a normal retirement age of 60 is now justified as a firefighter's life expectancy is now the same as that of the wider population.</p>

You are still entitled to breast screening&quot;.

	<p pid="c.218W.5/1">The aim of the national programme for information technology in the national health service is to substantially achieve integration of health and social care information systems in England by 2010. The decision that NHS Connecting for Health should be time-limited is in keeping with this timescale, funding plans announced in the 2002 expenditure review, and when contracts for centrally delivered systems were placed. It is also consistent with plans to locate much of the ownership of the national programme, over time, in local and regional bodies in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="c.218W.5/2">The enduring existence of a central NHS IT function will be subject to review comparable to those of the Department's other executive agencies to ensure they continue to be the best means for delivering the Government's objectives.</p>

	<p pid="c.224W.11/1">The National Health Service Act 2006 consolidates various previous legislative provisions relating to the NHS and fulfils a commitment given in 2001 so to do. Section 129(2)(c)(ii), and the equivalent measure for Wales, set out the conditions under which an application to provide NHS pharmaceutical services may be granted. This is known as the control of entry test.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.11/2">It states that an application will only be granted if it is necessary or expedient in order to secure the adequate provision of NHS pharmaceutical services locally. The previous NHS Act 1977 used the terms necessary or desirable. The same terminology was originally adopted in the drafts of the new NHS Act published on the Department's website in February and May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.11/3">Subsequently, the term expedient was used for the Bill as introduced to Parliament in June 2006. This term was adopted in preference to the term desirable to update the language used in, and to ensure legislative consistency within, the new Act. The two terms are interchangeable in meaning. Unless the contrary intention is shown, a consolidation Act is presumed to be a straight consolidation and does not change the law.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.11/4">Therefore, as there is no change in the meaning, the new Act, once it comes into force, will not change nor have any effect on the basis on which primary care trusts and health boards are to continue to decide NHS pharmaceutical applications. They will continue to apply the necessary or desirable criteria as set out in the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005 as amended, and the equivalent provisions in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="c.228W.9/1">The Criminal Law Subgroup of the Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet have considered the possibility of amending the Protection of Children Act 1978 as one of the options for dealing with cartoon child pornography. This legislation made it an offence to take, make, distribute or show indecent photographs of real children. Its purpose was to protect children from abuse. It was subsequently extended to cover simple possession of indecent photographs, to reflect concern that possession fuels demand and perpetuates abuse, and to &quot;pseudo photographs&quot; to cover manipulation of images where, for example, an adult's head can be joined to a child's body. (The resulting image must appear to be a photograph of a child.)</p>
	<p pid="c.228W.9/2">The age of the child was raised from under 16 to under 18 in the Sexual Offences Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.228W.9/3">Offences under the 1978 Act (as amended) attract substantial penalties to reflect the fact that real children are involved in the making of the material: there is a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment for taking, making and supply of such images and a maximum of five years' imprisonment for possession.</p>
	<p pid="c.228W.9/4">Although cartoons depicting child abuse are deeply offensive, they do not in themselves constitute abuse of a child. The 1978 Act is well understood by those who work with it and enforce it and there are substantial arguments against extending its scope to cover cartoons of child pornography. We are, however, giving close consideration to the issues and options in this difficult area, including how it has been tackled abroad.</p>

	<p pid="c.231W.2/1">The United Kingdom has no plans to propose measures to end or restrict the use or supply of non-human primates in scientific procedures as part of the current revision of EU Directive 86/609. The development of new drugs and medical and veterinary technologies is still dependent on the information and insights derived from the well designed, properly conducted and carefully regulated use of animals, including primates. There is no immediate prospect of an end to the use of primates while the benefits to humans, animals and the environment outweigh the costs to the animals involved and until there are suitable alternatives available.</p>
	<p pid="c.231W.2/2">We also have no plans to introduce a unilateral ban on the importation of primates from countries with indigenous non-human primate populations as it would close off the supply and use of second generation captive-bred animals from such countries even where the production of such animals for use in the United Kingdom is not dependent on the taking of animals from the wild. Such a ban would also raise potentially complex legal issues with respect to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and European Community Law. The importation of non-human primates is an issue on which the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is the lead Government Department. The controls in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 relate only to the use of such animals.</p>
	<p pid="c.231W.2/3">Except where the information is already in the public domain, it is not our practice to identify overseas sources of non-human primates. We believe that the activities of the small number of extremists involved in the intimidation of suppliers and licensed establishments provide clear grounds for maintaining this approach. However, I can confirm that during 2005 and 2006 the Animals Scientific Procedures Inspectorate (ASPI) visited four overseas non-human primate breeding or supplying centres in the Netherlands, Vietnam and China.</p>
	<p pid="c.231W.2/4">We do not consider the removal of approved status from Nafovanny to provide non-human primates for use in the United Kingdom to be necessary at this time. Nafovanny's two main facilities in Long Thanh, Vietnam, have periodically supplied non-human primates (generally second generation captive bred animals) for use in the United Kingdom. However, after an Inspectorate visit in the spring of 2005 identified shortcomings in animal accommodation and care we informed the breeding centre that once pending orders for animals for use in the United Kingdom were supplied, its status as an approved centre would cease. By the end of 2005 we had received reassurances and evidence that significant improvements had been made. Subject to being satisfied that further additional safeguards and welfare-related measures are in place, we believe it should be able to meet the standards we would expect of such a centre. Should Nafovanny wish to continue to supply animals for use in the United Kingdom we will revisit the relevant facilities.</p>

The sanctions also provide for the freezing of assets of individuals and entities supporting DPRK's nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes and a travel ban on those individuals.

Friend the member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)</phrase> has not been appointed as a special representative. He himself stressed this to his interlocutors and to the media while in Sri Lanka. His visit came about following discussions between my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and President Rajapakse of Sri Lanka in August in which, it was felt that some sharing of our experience with the Northern Ireland peace process might be of help and encouragement to all parties. In line with this, my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen, accompanied by a senior official of the Northern Ireland Office, visited Sri Lanka from 14 to <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase>. While there, he met with a range of key participants in the Sri Lankan peace process including the President, Sri Lankan Government Ministers and political representatives of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He also talked about the UK's experiences of Northern Ireland with a wide variety of other Sri Lankans, including the media. We hope that my right hon. Friend's efforts, which were much appreciated by all concerned, will be of some help in the pursuit of peace for all the people of Sri Lanka.</p>

	<p pid="c.250W.5/1">The United Kingdom is a staunch supporter of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540 in the Security Council, on the 1540 Committee and internationally. National implementation of UNSCR 1540 is almost complete and work is in hand to bring into effect outstanding elements (e.g. enactment of primary legislation to ratify the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material). The UK's first national report to the 1540 committee offered assistance to those who wanted help implementing UNSCR 1540. We are engaged in a number of outreach efforts on export control to this end. Much of the UK's work under the Global Partnership assists directly to implement UNSCR 1540.</p>
	<p pid="c.250W.5/2">The UK has also co-sponsored and participated in the first regional seminar on promoting 1540 implementation, which took place in Buenos Aires in September 2005. Further seminars have been organised and UK participation, whether direct, through EU sponsorship, or both, remains a priority.</p>
	<p pid="c.250W.5/3">The International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, as international and regional organisations, were mentioned in preambular paragraph 10 of the resolution. This recognised the need for these organisations to enhance co-ordination in response to the serious challenges and threats to international security posed by weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The UK supports such complementary efforts to promote effective implementation.</p>

	<p pid="c.252W.0/1">NATO nuclear policy is well-established. The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear forces is political: to preserve peace and prevent coercion. Since the height of the cold war NATO has reduced the number of sub-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe by over 95 per cent. The remaining US nuclear weapons based in Europe are in the sole possession, and under constant and complete custody and control, of the United States. These arrangements for basing US nuclear weapons in Europe are fully compatible with the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
	<p pid="c.252W.0/2">NATO does not follow either a nuclear first-use or no-first-use policy. As the nature and scope of potential conflicts cannot be predicted, the Alliance does not pre-determine how it would react to military aggression. It leaves this question open and in so doing ensures uncertainty in the mind of any potential aggressor about the nature of the allies' response.</p>
	<p pid="c.252W.0/3">There is no evidence to suggest that either aspect of NATO nuclear policy provides a motivating factor in the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
