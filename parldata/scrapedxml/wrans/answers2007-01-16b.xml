	<p pid="b.956W.3/3">The Department for Transport's guidance on local transport plans (dated December 2004 and published on the DfT website) pointed out that the eventual allocations for individual local transport plans would be adjusted for performance and so might differ significantly from these indicative planning guidelines. The guidance, however, indicated an intention (now delivered) that each plan area would receive at least three quarters of its planning guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="b.966W.4/1">The number of abandoned vehicles has significantly reduced over the last few years. DEFRA's Waste Data Flow survey shows that there has been a 58 per cent. reduction from 294,000 in 2002-03 to an estimated 126,000 in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.966W.4/2">The end-of-life vehicle directive (ELV) sets out measures to recycle and reuse end-of-life vehicles and their components to reduce the amount of waste sent for disposal. The producer responsibility obligations mean that, since <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, vehicle producers have been required to make available an adequate network of facilities where last owners can receive free take-back for their vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="b.966W.4/3">Best Value Performance Indicator 218 was introduced to record the percentage of vehicles investigated within 24 hours of the report being received and the percentage of vehicles being removed within 24 hours of being legally entitled to do so. This will encourage local authorities to clear vehicles from the road as quickly as possible and therefore reduce the probability of arson and associated antisocial behaviour. This is a mandatory local area agreement indicator for all local authorities in receipt of Neighbourhood Renewal funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.966W.4/4">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 gives local authorities more powers to deal with abandoned cars. All vehicles abandoned on a road can now be removed as soon as they are identified. The definition of 'road' has been widened, so abandoned vehicles can be removed immediately from any road. Rules on disposing of abandoned vehicles have been simplified. Abandoned vehicles that are only fit for destruction, or those that do not display a license or number plate, can now be destroyed immediately. If local authorities are unable to find the owner of a vehicle, or if the owner does not collect the vehicle within seven days of being contacted, the vehicle can be disposed of. Also, local authorities can impose fixed penalties of &pound;200, in lieu of prosecution, if the owner of an abandoned vehicle can be identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.966W.4/5">DEFRA is also working closely with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) to increase the percentage of vehicles that are registered. The introduction of continuous registration and the statutory off-road notice have made it easier to provide a clear picture of vehicle ownership through the vehicle register. 93 local authorities have received training and devolved powers from the DVLA to remove unlicensed vehicles from the road. It is often unlicensed vehicles that end up abandoned and/or are involved in criminal activity and therefore the quicker they are identified and removed the better. It is likely that the number of abandoned vehicles will continue to decrease as the percentage of unlicensed vehicles is reduced.</p>

	<p pid="b.969W.5/2">The impact of aviation on climate change is not limited to CO2 emissions. Although there is need for further research, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that the total climate change impact of aviation is between two and four times greater than that of its CO2 emissions alone. This is due to some of the other emissions released, including nitrous oxides, particulates and water vapour, and their specific effects at altitude.</p>

	<p pid="b.971W.8/1">The Government's Fourth Annual Progress Report, published in June 2006, shows the latest available figures. This report indicated that, in 2004, around 2 million households were in fuel poverty in the UK with 1.5 million being classified as vulnerable, compared with around 6.5 and 5 million respectively in 1996. The report is available on the Defra website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.971W.8/3">We are aware of the challenges presented by rising energy prices and the fact that the impact of price rises over the last two years on the number of households in fuel poverty has yet to be reflected in the official statistics. The Government remain committed to work in this area to deliver our targets to eradicate fuel poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.972W.5/1">The British Greyhound Racing Board guidance, on which Defra was consulted, provides a level of detail above that contained in the European Union Welfare in transport Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005. It is therefore welcomed as a practical guide to the provision of good welfare. However, it is not a substitute for the rules set in the regulation, but a supplementary tool to aid compliance. Ultimately, the welfare in transport regulation must take precedence. This requires that the cage must be of an appropriate size to match the size of the dog.</p>

	<p pid="b.972W.8/1">During 2007, the Government will continue to work, through bilateral and multi-lateral processes, to develop restrictions on the import of illegally harvested timber.</p>
	<p pid="b.972W.8/2">The Government are working to implement the EU Forestry Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation which was adopted in 2005. This allows the EU to enter into Voluntary Partnership Agreements with timber producing countries, and will include a licensing system to identify legal products for export to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.972W.8/3">A number of countries will be negotiating partnership agreements during 2007. Malaysia, Ghana and Indonesia have announced their intentions to proceed with formal negotiations, and several more countries are expected to confirm their intention to negotiate by the summer. The Department for International Development (DFID) is engaged in the negotiations together with the European Commission and other member states. DFID is also providing financial support to put in place reforms. The length of negotiations will vary, but we expect the first partnership agreement to be signed by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.972W.8/4">The EU FLEGT Action Plan required the assessment of potential additional legislative options to tackle imports of illegal timber into the EU. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-20">20 December 2006</phrase>, the Commission launched a public consultation on this. The Government will review the applicability of the options presented, including their compatibility with World Trade Organisation rules, before deciding what, if any, additional measures to pursue at a national or EU level.</p>
	<p pid="b.972W.8/5">Collaboration continues with other major consumer countries in the G8, China and the private sector. In particular, the UK Government's timber procurement policy, which requires all timber supplied to have derived from legally harvested trees, has become a beacon for other governments to tackle illegal logging through voluntary consumer action.</p>

	<p pid="b.978W.0/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is commissioning a risk assessment report on the future of paper exports, which will outline the opportunities and risks associated with the export of paper, as well as future predictions and recommendations. This report will help inform WRAP's future work in this area. However, increased exports of recovered paper to China are unlikely to have a significant impact on WRAP's 2008 target to increase the use of all recyclates by the UK manufacturing sector by an additional 220,000 tonnes a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.0/2">In 2005, paper manufacturers within the UK used 4.5 million tonnes of recovered paper, while 1.5 million tonnes were exported to China. Since 2001, work by the WRAP has led to an extra 3 million tonnes of new recycling capacity, with at least another 1 million in the pipeline. It is also increasing demand for recycled materials across the public and private sectors. Capital funding from WRAP has provided an additional 320,000 tonnes of newsprint reprocessing capacity at the UPM Shotton paper mill&mdash;enough to recycle the newspapers and magazines from an extra 4 million households in the UK. In addition, manufactured newsprint in the UK is now made from 100 per cent. recycled fibre.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.0/3">WRAP's Recycled Paper Advocacy Team, launched in September 2006, is already working with a number of large companies and Government Departments to help them switch to using high quality recycled paper for their office requirements and printed publications. This includes work with a large number of blue chip companies with the potential to increase the use of recycled paper by up to 2,000 tonnes per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.0/4">WRAP is working to increase the levels of paper and other recyclates recovered from all sources (including businesses, schools and universities) and is due to launch the Schools Recycling Awareness Programme on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.0/5">The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) recently held a consultation on a sustainable schools strategy and Defra will be working with DfES and other partners, including WRAP, following the consultation to help schools minimise, reuse, recycle and compost their waste. It is our intention as part of this work to issue guidance to schools to include issues around the definition of waste from schools and 'top ten tips'.</p>

	<p pid="b.979W.3/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is piloting portable waste battery collection schemes by working in partnership with a range of local authorities and not-for-profit organisations that already run recycling collection services. WRAP began trials of kerbside collection schemes in April 2006, initially covering over 350,000 households in a mixture of high-rise, urban and rural areas across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.979W.3/2">A second set of collection trials started at the end of October 2006, where householders in two trial areas are now able to return their unwanted batteries to a range of participating retailers, where special collection containers have been provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.979W.3/3">Further trials, including a postal return scheme for remote rural areas, and a number of community drop-off/bring schemes, should be started shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.979W.3/4">To date, it is estimated that the trials have collected over three to four million batteries (18.6 tonnes). Initial results from the trials can be found on the WRAP website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.979W.6/1">An independent, DEFRA-funded research study, carried out by Enviros Consulting and Cranfield University in 2006, concluded that there was no evidence of rises in rat populations resulting from alternate weekly collection of household refuse designed to increase levels of recycling.</p>
	<p pid="b.979W.6/2">The study found that the influence of domestic waste management arrangements on rats is likely to be insignificant in comparison to other factors, such as the age of the property, the area (urban or rural), and the adequate upkeep of drains.</p>
	<p pid="b.979W.6/3">The winter interim report for phase one of the study has been published and is available from DEFRA's Local Authority Support website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.979W.6/5">Proper design of an alternate weekly collection (AWC) service should avoid any increase in nuisance to householders. The Waste and Resources Action Programme has published guidance for local authorities on the design and implementation of alternate weekly collection services, in order to minimise nuisance and health risks. This includes, for example, hygiene measures for bins.</p>
	<p pid="b.979W.6/6">This is an important issue and DEFRA is supporting further research into this area. A report covering the summer period is currently under way and will be published soon.</p>

	<p pid="b.980W.2/1">The updated guidance on the recycling credits scheme, issued in April 2006, reinforced that the Government expect all waste authorities to be predisposed to the payment of credits to third parties for recycling and reuse activity. The guidance was updated following a review of the existing arrangements and consultation on future options.</p>
	<p pid="b.980W.2/2">No formal assessment has been made by my Department of the willingness of local authorities to pay recycling credits to third parties, or the proportion of such applications which are refused by local authorities. The revised guidance for the scheme made clear that all waste authorities should properly assess applications they receive, considering the social, environmental and economic benefits of the recycling/reuse activity. In addition, the guidance set out the circumstances whereby an application for credits may reasonably be refused. Under best practice guidelines, the local authority should also provide an explanation if an application for credits is refused.</p>

	<p pid="b.986W.6/1">The African Union (AU) is playing a pro-active role in considering how to take forward the question of a possible international mission in Somalia. Uganda has already offered to contribute 1,000 to 1,500 personnel and we understand the AU is consulting other AU members who might contribute personnel. The Peace and Security council of the AU agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-08">8 January</phrase> to reconvene shortly to finalise plans for the deployment of an international mission to Somalia working closely with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Transitional Federal government and other stakeholders. We are awaiting further details of their plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.989W.8/1">The nature of the security challenge is complex and varies across the country. In some areas, in particular in and around the capital, the security situation is grave, with an unacceptably high level of violence. 80 per cent. of the attacks in Iraq happen within a 30 mile radius of Baghdad. Improving security is the highest priority for both the Iraqi Government and the Coalition. Prime Minister Maliki has recognised that a large part of the solution lies in promoting national reconciliation as well as in military action. We strongly welcome his commitment in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.989W.11/1">As my right hon. Friends the Foreign and Defence Secretaries have made clear we welcomed the Iraq Study Group's (ISG) report and broadly agree with its analysis of the security situation in Iraq. However the ISO's recommendations largely reflect our own strategy for our areas of responsibility and, throughout Iraq, our fundamental objectives remain the same&mdash;to boost capacity to deliver security and basic services to the Iraqi people.</p>
	<p pid="b.989W.11/2">It is important to remember that this report was commissioned by and for the US government. Many of its detailed recommendations are particular to US foreign policy and/or conditions in US areas of responsibility in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="b.996W.2/1">Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes are of serious concern. Iran has continued its uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities in defiance of the United Nations Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors. As successive reports by the IAEA's Director-General have made clear, Iran's co-operation with the IAEA remains inadequate. Iran has not yet chosen to engage seriously with the generous proposals made by the E3+3 (France, Germany, UK + China, Russia, US) for a negotiated solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.996W.2/2">Iran's failure to address international concerns, and to take the steps that would enable negotiations to begin on a long-term solution, left the Security Council no choice but to adopt a further Resolution on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-23">23 December 2006</phrase>. This imposes targeted and proportionate measures against Iran's most sensitive nuclear and missile activities. The Director-General of the IAEA will report by <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase> on Iran's compliance. If Iran has not by then complied, the Security Council has agreed to impose further measures; the Council has also said that it will suspend the implementation of measures if and for as long as Iran suspends all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities.</p>

Orders in Council are made on a case-by-case basis as necessary and appropriate, and usually after consultation with the Governments of the Overseas Territories. An example of this is the Anguilla Constitution (Amendment) Order 2007 which will amend the current Anguilla Constitution so as to give effect to police reforms requested by the Government of Anguilla. We intend to submit that Order in Council to the Privy Council at its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February 2007</phrase>. Orders in Council implementing UN sanctions in the Overseas Territories are made pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) and we expect a number of these over the coming months. For example, it is intended that an Order under the UN Act 1946 will be made at the <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase> meeting of the Privy Council to give effect in the Overseas Territories to the sanctions measures in UNSCR 1737 on Iran.</p>

	<p pid="b.1002W.8/1">I was grateful to Hans Blix and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission for their thoughtful work in producing this report. Some of the Commission's recommendations on non-proliferation and disarmament have great merit, e.g. on Comprehensive Safeguards and the Additional Protocol. But not all remain relevant (e.g. on North Korea and Iran where recent UN Security Council Resolutions have changed priorities for action). I do not believe that a change in Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty institutional arrangements will bring about substantive change in the positions of states party to the treaty. Political will drives change in these areas. The UK continues to support early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Ratification by the remaining Annex II states is key.</p>

	<p pid="b.1006W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence does not usually subsidise telephone, television or internet for Service personnel while serving in Great Britain. Televisions in communal areas on bases are free but these are usually provided by non-public funds. Televisions in private and Service-provided accommodation have to be licensed and provided by the individuals (except in substitute single service accommodation). New single accommodation facilities are wired for satellite and internet but individuals pays their own subscriptions. Telephones in all accommodation are privately funded except in substitute single service accommodation where the line rental and any telephone equipment rental costs are reimbursed to the occupant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.8/2">Service personnel overseas, either permanently based abroad or on operations, are entitled, where practical, to receive at no cost British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) radio and television. Internet and telephones are privately funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.8/3">While deployed on operations overseas the provision of welfare facilities is dependent on location. The MOD operational welfare package includes the provision of welfare telephones and 30 minutes of free calls per person per week to anywhere in the world. In addition free e-mail and internet access as well as British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) television and radio broadcasts may be provided. Furthermore, televisions, radios, DVD players, DVDs and video games may be available at no cost to the individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.8/4">Free internet and e-mail access during working hours is available at family centres to keep families in contact with their spouses when serving away from home. Some units also have funded an internet cafe where PCs, or access to WiFi, are non-publicly funded but usage has to be paid for by the individual.</p>

	<p pid="b.1023W.10/1">Where assessment indicates this is in the interests of preventing a repetition of antisocial behaviour by children and young people up to the age of 17, Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) can apply for a parenting order under section 26 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. A parenting order can also be made under section eight of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 on conviction of a juvenile or where an antisocial behaviour order, child safety order or parental compensation order is made. A parenting order requires the parent/s to attend a parenting programme and to comply with specific requirements in the interests of preventing a repetition of the kind of behaviour that led to the order being made. Breach of a parenting order is a criminal offence and can result in a fine of up to &pound;1,000 and/or a community sentence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.10/2">YOTs also have statutory power, under section 25 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, to enter into parenting contracts, with parents whose child has engaged in, or is likely to engage in, criminal conduct or antisocial behaviour. The contract would include specific ways in which the parents agree to exercise control over the child and to attend a parenting programme. If parents refuse to enter into a contract or fail to comply with one, the YOT may apply for a parenting order.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.10/3">Parenting orders can also be made under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 following prosecution of parents for their child's non-attendance at school. Section 19 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 provides local authorities and schools with the power to enter into parenting contracts to help address children's behaviour and attendance at school. Section 20 of the Act provides that local authorities can also apply to the courts for a parenting order where a pupil has been excluded permanently or for more than one fixed period as a result of serious misbehaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.10/4">These powers will be enhanced by the measures introduced in the Education and Inspections Act 2006 which from <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase> will: allow parenting contracts to be used as an earlier intervention (without the need for exclusion); enable parenting orders to be applied for by schools; and permit orders to be applied for where there has been serious misbehaviour but without the necessity of excluding the pupil.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.10/5">The Education and Inspections Act also introduces a new duty on schools to arrange reintegration interviews following a pupil's fixed period exclusion from school. This duty will apply to all fixed period exclusions of primary-aged pupils and those of more than five days of secondary-aged pupils. These interviews will enable the school to engage formally with the parent and so assist the pupil's reintegration and improvement in his or her behaviour. It will be mandatory for parents to attend these interviews and failure to do so will be a factor which a court may take into account in any future application for a parenting order. Parents will also be required to ensure that their child is not present in a public place, without reasonable justification, during school hours in the first five days of any exclusion from school. If parents fail to be responsible for their child's whereabouts during this time, they will commit an offence. They may discharge liability for the offence by paying a penalty notice; however, failure to pay could result in prosecution for the original offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.10/6">The Police and Justice Act 2006 enables a wider range of agencies, including local authorities and registered social landlords, to apply for parenting orders where children or young people have engaged in antisocial behaviour or to enter into parenting contracts where they have engaged in, or are likely to engage in, criminal conduct or antisocial behaviour. The Police and Justice Act 2006 will be commenced later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.10/7">Parental Compensation Order (PCO) powers were commenced in 10 local authority areas on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July</phrase>. The PCO is a civil order designed to reinforce the responsibilities of parents of children under the age of 10. It requires parents to provide compensation if a child under 10 takes or damages property in the course of anti-social behaviour or behaviour which, if he were over 10, would have constituted an offence, and where it would be desirable in the interests of preventing a repetition of the behaviour in question. Compensation is limited to &pound;5,000. The PCO is made in the adult magistrates court on application by the local authority. The court has the same powers to enforce payment as it does for fines.</p>

	<p pid="b.1028W.8/1">The penalty notice for disorder (PND) Scheme was set up under the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Under the scheme, the police may issue a fixed penalty notice of either &pound;50 or &pound;80 for a range of minor disorder offences. Details of PND recipients are initially recorded on a database kept by the Central Ticket Office of an individual police force. Each force is responsible for maintaining their own local database; there is currently no national system for recording PNDs. However the Government do intend to establish a single national penalty notice processing system for all PNDs and road traffic tickets by September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1028W.8/2">Where the PND is issued for a recordable offence, a record of the offender is also created on the Police National Computer (PNC) within 24 hours and updated within seven days: the PNC is available to officers 24 hours a day. Repeat offenders should be identified using PNC if they have committed recordable offences. For all other offences, while the current local database could also be interrogated to check if a PND has already been issued, it is normally only available during office hours and to those officers local to the force.</p>
	<p pid="b.1028W.8/3">A list of all PND offences is given in Table one, showing which are recordable.</p>

It is the responsibility of the sponsor to ensure compliance with this requirement. Clause 6.2 requires any media interest in the event to be notified in writing to the banqueting office. In practice inquiries from the media now tend to come by telephone and the banqueting office does not insist on written notification from the media. Such inquiries are referred to the event organiser.</p>

	<p pid="b.1038W.6/3" class="indent">all households with one person aged 75 or over</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.6/4" class="indent">all households with one person with a significant disability in the relevant qualification period. This will be defined as being eligible for the following social security benefits: disability living allowance (including where the qualifying person is a child), attendance allowance, constant attendance allowance (CAA) under the industrial injuries disablement benefit scheme and CAA and war pensioners mobility supplement under the pre-2005 war pensions scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.6/5" class="indent">all households where one person is registered severely sight impaired/blind or where one person is registered sight impaired/partially sighted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.6/6">The definition of household will follow the DWP definition of a &quot;benefit unit&quot;: a couple and any dependent children (aged under 16 or in full-time education). Non-dependent adults will be able to claim assistance in their own right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.6/7">The Digital Switchover (Disclosure of Information) Bill would enable the scheme operator to target eligible individuals making it easier for them to claim and so help to increase take-up. The scheme will be supported by targeted communications and will benefit from more generic switchover-related communications, which Digital UK is producing and which will increase as switchover nears.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.6/8">Digital UK will ensure, as part of its communications activities, that those hard-to-reach groups, particularly those who do not qualify for support from the Help Scheme, have adequate information available to support them through switchover.</p>

	<p pid="b.1044W.0/1">The consultation document &quot;Making Good Progress&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-08">8 January 2007</phrase> and the consultation runs until <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April 2007</phrase>. It proposes a pilot to run for two years in a small number of local authorities (LAs). In some schools in those LAs, single-level &quot;tests for progress&quot; would be piloted, running alongside existing multi-level tests so that the results could be calibrated for consistency. Pupils in the pilot would therefore take both kinds of test. The document suggests that in-year tests might ultimately replace end of key stage arrangements, but this would depend on the experience of the pilot and is not an early prospect. Arrangements for the pilot, including the terms of reference for external evaluation, will be announced after the end of the consultation. The document makes clear that any changes trialled in the pilot, or adopted subsequently, would not be allowed to compromise the accountability delivered by the framework of tests, targets and performance tables which have helped to drive up standards so sharply over the past decade. The current national curriculum assessment arrangements at the end of key stages 1, 2 and 3 will continue to be an important part of our drive to raise standards in schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1045W.0/1">Building Schools for the Future (BSF) aims to rebuild or refurbish all secondary schools in England in 15 waves of investment which started in 2005-06. Prioritisation is on the educational and social needs of geographical groupings of schools proposed by authorities. The needs of all maintained schools of all types in these areas must be considered by authorities when developing details of their plans. In general, we would not expect school buildings built less than 15 years ago to receive significant investment. Full details of the criteria were published in November 2004 in &quot;BSF Prioritisation and Forward Planning Information&quot;, a copy of which is available in the House Library. Six local authority BSF projects have now reached financial closure. This means that they have been formally granted BSF funding for the schools in their projects. Other local authority BSF projects are finalising their school estate plans. The six projects at financial close are Bradford, Bristol, Lancashire, Manchester, and the London boroughs of Lambeth and Greenwich. In their projects there are in total:</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/2"><i> (a)</i> 32 community schools, of which 10 are special schools; two are pupil referral units and one a sixth form college</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/3"><i> (b)</i> Four voluntary aided schools;</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/4"><i> (c)</i> No voluntary controlled schools;</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/5"><i> (d)</i> No foundation schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/6">Of the above, 18 are specialist schools and one is a grammar school</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/7">A limited amount of BSF funding was also made available to pathfinder and wave one authorities in 2004-05 and 2005-06 for &quot;quick win&quot; projects. These were intended to help develop the early elements of BSF prior to the first formal phase of investment in 2005-06. Of the schools which received this funding:</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/8" class="indent">12 are community schools, including four community special schools;</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/9" class="indent">One is a voluntary controlled school;</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.0/10" class="indent">Two are foundation schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1050W.5/1">The Association of Colleges, which represents the interests of Further Education Colleges in England and Wales, has welcomed the proposals in Clause 19 (Power to award Foundation Degrees only) of the Further Education and Training Bill. In addition, the Mixed Economy Group and the 157 Group of leading Further Education Colleges have been similarly supportive of the move. Positive feedback has also been received in my Department from individual college principals within the FE sector who feel that the proposals are enabling, and that they will facilitate the sector's vital role, emphasised by Lord Leitch's recent report on skills, in providing high-quality training that is flexible and responsive to employers' and learners' needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1051W.0/1">Unlike the GCSE, International GCSEs, including French, have been designed primarily as a qualification for overseas candidates and are not aligned to the national curriculum programmes of study at Key Stage 4. They have not, therefore, been approved by the Secretary of State under Section 96 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 as an external qualification for use with pupils in maintained secondary schools. The GCSE remains the principal means of assessing pupil attainment at the end of compulsory schooling in maintained schools; there are no current plans to change this. The Department recently launched an e- consultation on IGCSEs to seek the views of the wider community on the issues for IGCSEs in the maintained sector.

	<p pid="b.1056W.2/1">This Government are committed to improving school buildings so that they are suitable for teaching and learning needs in the 21st century. We are supporting record levels of investment in schools: &pound;5.9 billion this year, rising to &pound;8 billion a year by 2010-11. This compares with investment of under &pound;700 million in 1996-97.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056W.2/2">This funding is being used to rebuild or refurbish school premises. The option chosen is a local decision, which should be based on a rigorous options appraisal, including the suitability and condition of existing school buildings, value for money, whole-life costs and sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056W.2/3">The primary capital programme starts in 2008-09, and will support investment of &pound;150 million in that year and &pound;500 million in each of the following two years. Subject to future public spending decisions, we expect the programme to continue for around 15 years. The decision whether to rebuild or refurbish a school is best taken locally on the basis of a proper options appraisal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056W.2/4">However, we have said that our long-term objective is to improve at least half of all primary schools. Our planning assumptions are that this will include replacing or taking out of use 5 per cent. of school buildings in the worst physical condition nationally, and replacing or taking out of use the 20 per cent. of the worst condition buildings in our most deprived communities. With strategic and joined-up planning and funding, we hope to exceed this over the life of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1060W.3/1">Schools, colleges, work-based learning providers, higher education institutions and employers, through Diploma Development Partnerships, have been involved from the beginning in the design of the new diploma qualifications and will be key to the delivery of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/2">The Department has a number of channels through which we disseminate information to these stakeholders, e.g. regular emails, the 14-19 website (<a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/14-19">www.dfes.gov.uk/14-19</a>), Directgov, and the 14-19 newsletter for which there is a subscription list. The focus so far has been on getting information to providers in preparation for the Gateway process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/3">We have already received great interest from areas wishing to deliver the diplomas in 2008. A total of 1,121 self assessments were received from consortiums (partnerships comprising local authorities, learning and skills councils, schools, colleges, and employers/work-based learning providers) wishing to go through the Gateway process, which means that nearly every local authority area hopes to offer diplomas in 2008. The Gateway is a process that will assess consortiums and identify those best equipped to secure the necessary awarding body approval to deliver the diplomas in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-12">12 December 2006</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced our diploma &quot;champions&quot; who will promote the diplomas and wider reforms with their sectors. These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/5" class="indent">Sir Alan Jones, Chairman of Toyota as the diploma champion for employers;</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/6" class="indent">Sir Mike Tomlinson, the former Chief Inspector of Schools and current chair of the Learning Trust in Hackney, as the diploma champion for schools, colleges and work-based learning providers; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/7" class="indent">Professors Deian Hopkin, Vice Chancellor of London South Bank University and Michael Arthur, Vice Chancellor of the University of Leeds, as diploma champions for higher education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/8">In addition, the Department is undertaking the following specific activity to promote the uptake of Diplomas:</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/9" class="indent">(i) nine regional conferences were held in October 2006 for schools and colleges and others involved in Gateway consortia, aimed at sharing information and practically supporting areas in the delivery of the 14-19 education reforms;</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/10" class="indent">(ii) five regional conferences are being held throughout December and January to provide information to higher education on the diplomas and other reforms;</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/11" class="indent">(iii) We are supporting the Association of Colleges to run a series of further education conferences on the 14-19 education reforms from February to March, which will include diploma workshops;</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/12" class="indent">(iv) We are working with the CBI and others to engage employers in diploma delivery. The DDPs will also be promoting the diplomas within their sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.3/13">We do not expect all areas to be offering diplomas in September 2008. In spring 2007 we will be announcing which areas have passed through the Gateway process and will be offering diplomas for young people to study. We will then be targeting the young people and parents affected regionally with information to help individuals to make the best personal choice.</p>

	<p pid="b.1061W.5/2">The Department focuses on reducing all absences from schools, not just those which are unauthorised. Overall absence rates have been substantially lower than the 1996-97 rate in all but two of the last nine years. In 2005-06, when absence rates were affected by unusually high levels of sickness, absence was still 0.54 per cent. points below the 1996-97 level&mdash;equivalent to 37,000 more pupils in school every single day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1061W.5/3">We do not have a direct measure of truancy. Unauthorised absence is often used as a proxy for truancy, but it is an imperfect measure because it also includes lateness and some term time holidays. It is also well known that unauthorised absence tends to rise when schools take a tougher line on absence generally, as has happened in recent years, without reflecting any underlying increase in truancy. The latest figures show no increase in unauthorised absence. That is why the Department has moved away from targets focusing narrowly on rates of unauthorised absence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1061W.5/4">The vast majority of unauthorised absence is very short term: of the secondary school pupils with unauthorised absence in the autumn and spring terms 2005-06, 55 per cent. missed only one or two days and 75 per cent. missed 5 days or fewer. But we also now know that a small minority of pupils miss significant amounts of their schooling. That is why we are now focusing our efforts on reducing persistent absence, including persistent truancy, in schools where this problem is most acute. This is proving highly effective. Last year, our targeted challenge and support in 198 secondary schools helped to reduce the number of persistent truants in those schools by 27 per cent., to reduce the average rate of absence in those schools by 0.63 per cent. and the average rate of unauthorised absence by 0.89 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1061W.5/5">Building on that success, we are now focusing on providing challenge and support to 436 secondary schools with high levels of persistent absence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1065W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what the backlog is for dealing with new cases at Basildon Jobcentre Plus. This is something that falls within my responsibilities as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1065W.2/4" class="indent">Basildon Benefit Delivery Centre (BDC) has recently completed a programme of centralising all Incapacity Benefit, Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance work previously carried out at offices throughout the county. The centralisation has caused some backlogs but we have successfully reduced these and expect to see a continued improvement into the New Year. The volume of claims outstanding has been steadily reducing over recent months and the current position represents a 17 per cent improvement against the position in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1065W.2/5" class="indent">The latest figures (for week ending <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase>) show that Basildon BDC has a combined total of 3,060 new claims to Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support and Incapacity Benefit outstanding against an expected claim intake figure of 2640. The difference of 420 equates to approximately 1 days intake of claims.</p>
	<p pid="b.1065W.2/6" class="indent">The management team at Basildon are working hard to make significant improvements to their performance. A recovery plan is in place and other BDCs within the network are undertaking work on behalf of Basildon to increase productivity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1069W.5/4" class="indent">We do not have crisis loan helplines. Currently customers can be dealt with in 3 different ways when applying for Crisis Loans through Social Fund:</p>
	<p pid="b.1069W.5/5" class="indent">Regions and Countries that have migrated Social Fund into their regional and national sites and have officially gone live as a Benefit Delivery Centre will have issued an 0800 number for their customers to telephone. These 0800 numbers are specific to their Regions and Countries. Currently we have 4 Benefit Delivery Centres that have recently gone live that have centralised Social Fund&mdash;Sheffield, Norwich, Newcastle and Nottingham. Not all districts in these regions have migrated their work into these Benefit Delivery Centres yet. It is therefore too early to have gathered information on numbers of calls and possible delays. Managers have responsibility for ensuring 25% of their staff are available at all times to answer telephone calls.</p>
	<p pid="b.1069W.5/6" class="indent">Offices that have rolled-out into Jobcentre Plus will give their customers the option of using the telephone service. In Regions and Countries that have not yet centralised Social Fund, these numbers will be local numbers (not 0800 numbers). In most cases customers will be ringing their nearest office. Information is not collated on the number of calls to these offices for crisis loans.</p>
	<p pid="b.1069W.5/7" class="indent">Not all offices have rolled out into Jobcentre Plus and customers in these areas will visit their local social security office to make an application for a crisis loan at the office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1069W.5/8" class="indent">Once all Benefit Delivery Centres have rolled out and Social Fund has migrated into the nominated Social Fund sites in the Regions and Countries, then 0800 numbers will be used nationally. Completion of roll-out for all Benefit Delivery Centres is March 2008 when advanced telephony systems will also be in place, enabling us to monitor telephony performance site by site.</p>

In particular, it is required to publish, and periodically review, a Disability Equality Scheme which sets out how it intends to carry out its disability equality duties.

These amount to &pound;645,000 and include spending on the central team which co-ordinated and planned publication of the Schemes, the costs of publication and liaison with the businesses. This figure also includes the cost involved in producing Gender Equality Schemes and progress reports on Race Equality Schemes which were published with the Disability Equality Schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1071W.3/9">As a result of the reforms which Sir David Henshaw put forward he estimated that the number of children receiving maintenance would increase from 1.1 million to 1.75 million, with an increasing proportion of parents making private arrangements. In steady state Sir David Henshaw estimated the long run administrative savings to be in the region of &pound;200 million, based on a caseload of between 0.8 million and 1.1 million in the new organisation. In making these estimates Sir David identified in his report the need to do further research to support the transition of cases and that there is an element of unpredictability about such transitional flows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1071W.3/10">The assumptions about increased numbers of children receiving maintenance were used in conjunction with the Family Resources Survey to estimate the potential impact of the redesigned system on child poverty. This suggested that a full disregard of maintenance in benefit calculations could reduce child poverty by 80,000 to 90,000 children. A further 30,000 children could be lifted out of poverty as a result of expected increases in compliance and the number of cases with a positive maintenance liability.</p>

Also, after 13 weeks of entitlement to jobseeker's allowance the amount of travelling time a jobseeker would be expected to undertake between their home and the proposed place of employment in order to find work increases from one hour to one hour and thirty minutes. Additionally, jobseekers who are still unemployed after 13 weeks are required to undertake a weekly, rather than fortnightly, job review for a period of 6 weeks.</p>

However, the diagnoses of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) are rarely recorded in hospital systems as such a diagnosis may not be identified at birth. It requires identification of the facial or other FAS abnormality at this early stage, which can be very difficult and problems that raise the possible diagnosis may only become apparent during schooling. In addition, sensitive information about heavy drinking during pregnancy may not be revealed in that context.</p>

	<p pid="b.1090W.9/15" class="indent">3. Data was sourced from Households Below Average Income Northern Ireland (HBAI NI). The HBAI NI is based on information collected from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS was first run in Northern Ireland in 2002-03.</p>
	<p pid="b.1090W.9/16" class="indent">4. The HBAI is the main source of income poverty measures throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1090W.9/17" class="indent">5. Poverty is defined as households who have an income less than 60 per cent. of the contemporary GB median income.</p>

	<p pid="b.1090W.9/19" class="indent">7. Income before housing costs (BHC) includes the following main components: usual net earnings from employment; profit or loss from self-employment (losses are treated as a negative income); all social security benefits (including housing benefit, social fund, maternity, funeral and community care grants but excluding social fund loans) and tax credits; income from occupational and private pensions; investment income; maintenance payments, if a person receives them directly; income from educational grants and scholarships (including, for students, top-up loans and parental contributions); the cash value of certain forms of income in kind (free school meals, free welfare milk, free school milk and free TV licence for those aged 75 and over).</p>
	<p pid="b.1090W.9/20" class="indent">8. Income is net of the following items: income tax payments; national insurance contributions; domestic rates (this includes water and sewerage charges for Northern Ireland); contributions to occupational pension schemes (including all additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to occupational pension schemes, and any contributions to personal pensions); all maintenance and child support payments, which are deducted from the income of the person making the payment and parental contributions to students living away from home.</p>
	<p pid="b.1090W.9/21" class="indent">9. Income after housing costs (AHC) is derived by deducting a measure of housing costs from BHC income measure.

	<p pid="b.1094W.8/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding, what evidence he has assessed on the effect of road excavation in streets by utility companies on the lifespan of streets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.8/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.8/5" class="indent">I should explain that road structures have a limited lifespan and can deteriorate for many reasons, including road openings by utility companies and no matter how well these are reinstated they inevitably weaken the road structure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.8/6" class="indent">Over the last decade there has been extensive research carried out, both here in the UK and North America, into the long-term damage of the road pavement caused by road openings by utility companies. In assessing the effects of road openings, Roads Service like many other road authorities in the UK has considered the outcome of the detailed research carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). The Department of Transport and County Surveyors' Society jointly funded two reports and these are the most recent and perhaps pertinent publications considered by Roads Service as part of our assessment into the residual life of utility reinstatements. These reports are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.8/7" class="indent">1. Long Term damage Performance of Reinstated Trenches and their Adjacent Pavements. Part (1) Literature Review by M. Zohrabi and MH Burtwell. TRL Report No. TRL 572</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.8/8" class="indent">2. Long Term damage Performance of Reinstated Trenches and their Adjacent Pavements. Part (2) Long Term Performance of Reinstatements in the Highway by DP Steele, W McMahon and MH Burtwell. TRL Report No. TRL 573</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.8/9" class="indent">It is worth noting that the need for the premature resurfacing of streets was also highlighted in the Traffic Management Act 2004, with an explanation of concerns covered in the associated Regulatory Impact Assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.8/10" class="indent">Further research into long-term damage to road structures is currently being advanced by TRL and Roads Service will consider carefully, the conclusions and recommendations of their report.</p>

	<p pid="b.1094W.11/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland three Parliamentary Questions:</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.11/4" class="indent">(i) whether the Draft Street Works (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order will require a full cost-benefit analysis to be carried out as part of the legislative process;</p>

	<p pid="b.1094W.11/6" class="indent">(iii) if he will undertake a further consultation on the impact of costs arising from the Draft Street Works (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order on the utility consumer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.11/7" class="indent">I have been asked to reply as the issues raised fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.11/8" class="indent">With regard to the issues raised in your first and third questions, the Street Works (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order itself will not have any direct cost implications. However, it is possible that regulations to be made under the Order would have cost implications for the utility companies. As a result, there mil be further consultation and a full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) completed in relation to each set of draft regulations. A cost benefit analysis is a central analytical component of the RIA, However, it should be noted that the provisions of the Order mil not directly impose any additional costs on utility customers. Whether utilities pass on any element of additional costs to their customers is a matter for the utility in question and its regulator.</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.11/9" class="indent">Turning to the second of your questions, the Department, at an early stage, considered the application of certain provisions of the Draft Amendment Order to works, other than street works, on roads. Since those issues were outside the legislative scope of the proposed Street Works (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order, legal advice was sought on the most appropriate way to proceed. The advice received was that if the Department proposed to apply those measures to other works on wads they should be taken forward through the amendment of the appropriate legislation. I expect we will consider doing so in due course, but we have a high workload and no immediate plans to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.1100W.8/3" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-16">16 January 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.8/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question about the latest estimates of net migration (a) per year and (b) over the next 20 years at England and Government Office Region level. I am replying in her absence. (114499)</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.8/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics publishes international migration estimates for calendar years in its migration annual reference volume (series MN) which can be found on the ONS website at <a href="http://nswebcopy/STATBASE/Product.asp?vlnk=507">http://nswebcopy/STATBASE/Product.asp?vlnk=507</a>. The most recent estimates on this basis are for 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.8/6" class="indent">Mid-year to mid-year estimates of net international migration are calculated as a component of change within the official population estimates. Table 1 shows the 2003-04 and 2004-05 net international migration used in these estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.8/7" class="indent">The ONS is also responsible for the regular production of official national and subnational population projections. In producing these, the ONS makes assumptions on the future levels of international migration over the projected period. These assumptions are based upon observed historic trends in migration and are the subject of a consultation with key users and local authorities. Table 2 shows the assumptions on future levels of net international migration for years 2005-06 to 2007-08 as used in the most recent, 2004-based, sets of projections. The international migration assumptions for the year 2007-08 are the long-term assumptions and remain at the same level for the following 20 years. Note that these assumptions are based on historic data to mid 2004 only and so are not consistent with the 2004-05 estimates shown in Table 1.</p>

	<p pid="b.1103W.2/1">To support the Government's agenda for growth in the Gateway, ODPM (now Communities and Local Government), originally proposed in the 2003 sustainable communities plan to commit support that would enable the development of 120,000 new dwellings up to 2016, subject to the review of the relevant regional plans (also known as regional spatial strategies).</p>
	<p pid="b.1103W.2/2">As part of the ongoing regional spatial strategy process, it has been calculated that the Thames Gateway has the capacity to accommodate 160,000 new homes by 2016 rather than 120,000 as thought possible in 2003. In publishing the Thames Gateway Interim Plan on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-22">22 November 2006</phrase> the Department included the housing numbers as published in the three draft regional plans, that is the East of England Plan (to be finalised and published in summer 2007), the further alterations to the London Plan (currently undergoing formal public consultation to be concluded in December 2006), and the draft south east plan (currently undergoing an examination in public). However, the housing numbers may still be subject to alteration due to the Examination in Public process or any further consultations that are carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1103W.2/3">While Government have included the new housing figures as put forward by the three regional plans, the housing numbers contained within them have been calculated by the two Regional Assemblies (South East and East of England) and the Greater London Authority. Government, its agencies and the Government Offices therefore have not suggested or approved the number of new homes to be constructed within the Thames Gateway but rather included the housing numbers contained within the three regional plans subject to the Examination in Public process or any further consultations that are carried out.</p>

	<p pid="b.1104W.6/1">No changes are currently planned for the Very High Cost Civil Cases (VHCCC) budget for 2006-07. VHCCCs are case managed by the LSC's Special Cases Unit (SCU). They are identified when the LSC receives the solicitor's estimated costs to conclude the case. If the actual or likely costs exceed the sum of &pound;25,000, the case is automatically referred to the SCU. There may be other requests such as authority to use a QC and this would trigger a referral to the SCU. In addition, all multi party actions are referred to the SCU as they would be likely to satisfy the criteria for SCU referral.</p>
