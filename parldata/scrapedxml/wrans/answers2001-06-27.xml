	<p pid=".87W.9/1">No firm date has been set for the accession of any candidate country to the EU. However, the Gothenburg European Council agreed that, provided progress towards meeting the accession criteria continues at an unabated pace, the road map for enlargement should make it possible to complete negotiations by the end of 2002 for those candidates that are ready. The objective is that they should participate in the European Parliament elections of 2004 as members. The Government fully support this approach.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.9/2">Both Turkey and Cyprus are candidates for the EU. Cyprus is well advanced in its negotiations, having provisionally closed negotiations in 22 out of the 31 chapters of the EU's acquis communautaire. Turkey has yet to begin negotiations, as it has not fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria (covering issues such as human rights, the rule of law and respect for and protection of minorities). The Government look forward to further progress by Turkey, in line with the priorities set out in the EU's Accession Partnership with Turkey.</p>

	<p pid=".88W.5/1">The UK is working closely with its partners and key international organisations to bring peace and stability to the Balkans.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/2">In Kosovo, we fully support the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) in their efforts, in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244, to secure the establishment of a democratic, tolerant, multi- ethnic society and to achieve lasting security for all of Kosovo's population. Elections to a Kosovo Assembly in November 2001 will deliver the provisional democratic self-governing institutions foreseen in UNSCR 1244, and will provide an important opportunity for the people of Kosovo to have a say in how Kosovo is to be run. Extremism and organised crime are significant regional problems, and are the biggest internal threat to stability in Kosovo. We support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to combat extremism and to promote law and order throughout the province.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/3">In Macedonia, we strongly support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and condemn all acts of extremist violence. We welcome the efforts of EU High Representative Solana and NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson to promote inter-ethnic dialogue and an overall political settlement. The British Ambassador in Skopje has played a key role in recent months as Mr. Solana's Special Representative. We welcome the <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-25">25 June</phrase> decision of the EU's General Affairs Council to appoint a senior political figure, Francois Leotard, as Mr. Solana's new full-time resident representative in Skopje. In the light of recent events, we hope he will be able to encourage all the parties to take the political process forward rapidly, to head off the risk of further violence. We are discussing with Allies a possible NATO role in disarming NLA members in support of any peace agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/4">The key elements of our regional strategy are fostering regional co-operation, inter-ethnic reconciliation and economic reform through the Stability Pact and the EU's Stabilisation and Association Process. As it made clear at the Zagreb summit, the EU has offered the incentives of potential EU membership, generous trade access and technical assistance in return for commitments to democracy, regional co-operation and economic reform. We also continue to take tough measures against extremists and organised crime whose activities continue to undermine the region.</p>

The NHS Cancer Plan set out our commitment to increase NHS investment in specialist palliative care by &pound;50 million by 2004 to end inequalities in access to care and enable the NHS to make a realistic contribution to the cost that hospices incur in providing agreed levels of service.</p>

Earlier this year we met representatives from the Haemophilia Alliance to discuss the case for extending this provision to all haemophilia patients in England and we are giving this careful consideration. However there is currently a worldwide shortage of recombinant clotting factors and, while this continues, it will not be possible to increase the availability of these products.</p>

	<p pid=".101W.12/1">The Prime Minister set the tough target of reducing the number of people sleeping rough in England to as near to zero as possible and by at least two thirds by 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.12/2">In 1998, there were approximately 1,850 people rough sleeping in England. In June 2000, published figures indicated that approximately 1,180 people were sleeping rough, (546 in London and 634 outside of London). This represents a 36 per cent. reduction. The unit will publish updated figures in due course in relation to counts carried out this year.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.12/3">&quot;Coming in from the Cold&quot;, the Government's strategy on tackling rough sleeping, outlined a raft of new policies and services to deliver the target which are now all in place in all major cities.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.12/4">These include helping people sleeping rough on the streets with drug, alcohol and mental health problems; helping former rough sleepers rebuild their lives through education, training and employment; and preventing a new generation of rough sleepers particularly those leaving care, the armed forces and prison.</p>

This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Met Office.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.2/4" class="indent">BAe Systems are currently modifying and fitting out the aircraft to undertake atmospheric research for both the UK University Community and the Met Office. The aircraft is owned by BAE Systems and will be operated under a service provision contract in the first instance with the University of Manchester Institute for Science and Technology (UMIST) and then the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for a total period of at least 10 years. The Met Office use of the aircraft will be through a partnership agreement with UMIST and NERC.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.2/5" class="indent">The BAe 146-300 will be capable of operating at heights of between 100 feet and 35,000 feet above sea level with short periods at 50 feet. The highest operating level, in particular, will allow access to a region of the atmosphere that it is critically important to atmospheric researchers.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.2/6" class="indent">Met Office equipment being transferred from Hercules XV208 to BAe 146-300 initially cost in the order of &pound;1.5 million. New and existing on-board instrumentation is also being provided by the University Community.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.2/7" class="indent">The leasing, hourly and annual operating costs of the BAe 146-300 are commercial-in-confidence. However, the consequential savings to the Met Office of moving to shared use of the BAe 146-300 will be &pound;8 million over the next 10 years.</p>

	<p pid=".107W.9/1">No formal assessment has been undertaken into the ability of schools applying for specialist school status to raise sponsorship. We recognised there were difficulties with the original &pound;100,000 requirement and reduced this to &pound;50,000 in 1999. My Department grant aids the technology colleges and youth sport trusts, which provide advice to schools about raising sponsorship and raise funds themselves to support applicant schools. The network of 684 specialist schools shows that applicant schools across the country, including those from rural and inner city areas, have successfully raised the sponsorship required. We shall keep the sponsorship criteria under review.</p>

	<p pid=".116W.8/2">In publicly funded family work, the Lord Chancellor introduced the Family Graduated Fees Scheme for junior and Queen's Counsel, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-01">1 May 2001</phrase>. The scheme provides for set fees, graduated to take account of complexity and specific issues in the case. In criminal cases, regulations introduced in September 2000 have controlled more tightly the circumstances where QCs or more than one advocate might be allowed for the defence in Crown court cases. Individual case contracts have been introduced in high cost cases. These secure the provision of legal services at a fixed price. New regulations, to be introduced in October, will extend the existing 10-day advocates graduated fees scheme for Crown court trials to cases lasting up to 25 days.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.2/1">It is open to parties who believe items of cost to be unreasonable to challenge those costs in a court assessment. While it is a matter ultimately for the courts, the Government believe that recoverability includes reasonable premiums reasonably incurred, including premiums on policies taken out before any proceedings start. As long as liability insurers wish to be able to recover their costs in cases that they win, it is not unreasonable for claimants to take out insurance against that risk at the outset and to seek to recover the premium in cases where they are successful.</p>
