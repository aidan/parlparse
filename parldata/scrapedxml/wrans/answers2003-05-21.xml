	<p pid=".769W.0/1">On cycle tracks, cyclists and pedestrians may be segregated or they may share the same space. Highway authorities use signs and markings from the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 to indicate the part of the route which is allocated for cyclists and for pedestrians. On segregated tracks, cyclists must keep to the side intended for their use.</p>
	<p pid=".769W.0/2">The Highway Code advises cyclists to take care when passing pedestrians, especially children, elderly or disabled people on cycle tracks, and allow them plenty of room. The code also advises that cyclists should slow down and stop for pedestrians if necessary. The law applying to dangerous and careless cycling applies on cycle tracks as it does on the road. Under the Road Traffic Act 1991, the two worst cycling offences attract maximum fines of &pound;2,500 (for dangerous cycling) and &pound;1,000 (for careless cycling).</p>
	<p pid=".769W.0/3">There are no specific requirements for cyclists to warn other users of their presence on a cycle track. However, the Highway Code advises cyclists that they should be considerate of other road users, particularly blind and partially sighted pedestrians, and to let them know of their presence by ringing their bell. In April this year, the Pedal Bicycles (Safety) Regulations 2003 were published, coming into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. These will make it a requirement for a bell to be fitted on a bicycle by manufacturers at the point of sale. The Regulation will enhance the safety of pedestrians sharing space with cyclists, and had been requested for some time by groups representing pedestrians and disabled people.</p>

	<p pid=".774W.3/1">There is no single &quot;Civil Service exam&quot;. With the exception of the Fast Stream, and recruitment to the most senior posts, recruitment to the Civil Service is the responsibility of individual government departments and agencies. In general their systems are based on the competences their businesses require, and their recruitment processes are determined by the needs of the post. Departments are free to choose the selection methods that best demonstrate the competences and skills they are seeking. These can include a variety of tests and exercises, interviews or assessment centres.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.3/2">My own Department recruits for the graduate Fast Stream Programme on behalf of Departments and reports annually to Parliament with details of the scheme, including numbers of applicants and successes at each selection stage. The tests, exercises and interviews are designed and validated with the aim of achieving the best possible prediction of suitability for, and success in, the job. The recruitment process for all jobs in the Civil Service must be consistent with the principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition, in accordance with the requirements of the Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code.</p>

	<p pid=".777W.2/1">Defra's policy is to transpose in such a way as to achieve the objectives of the European measure on time and in accordance with other UK policy goals, including minimising the burdens on business. A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is started before the Commission formally publishes its proposal, and is then developed as the proposal goes through negotiation and at the transposition stage. A Risk Management approach is used, ensuring that the risks are identified and evaluated for Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".777W.2/2">The normal procedure is that a project plan for transposition is developed, and a draft legal text of implementing regulation is prepared. Collective ministerial agreement for implementing regulations is sought, and the implementing regulations are laid before Parliament. Defra works closely with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations and where applicable, the Government of Gibraltar, to ensure effective and timely transposition of the Directive throughout the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".784W.3/1">No reviews are planned and no studies have been conducted into the provision of naval navigational aids. However, an Assessment Phase is currently being undertaken for a long term PPP/PFI Acquisition programme for the future provision of Marine Services. These services are currently provided by Serco Denholm, under a Government Owned-Contractor Operated (GOCO) arrangement and by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service (RMAS), part of the Warship Support Agency. The RMAS are currently responsible for the laying/recovery and annual maintenance of some 205 navigational buoys around the coast of the British Isles. Under current plans, the design authority for navigational buoys and the supply of related mooring materials will also be transferred to the successful bidder.</p>
	<p pid=".784W.3/2">Discussions took place with the General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA), Non-Departmental Public Bodies sponsored by the Department for Transport, in 2001 to determine whether there was scope for the GLA's to take over the maintenance and upkeep of Ministry of Defence United Kingdom navigational buoys. However, it was subsequently decided not to proceed as such an arrangement would provide little benefit to the MOD. No further discussions on this matter have taken place either with public or private sector bodies.</p>

Members of the RAF sponsored reserves have been called out on a regular basis since October 2000 but the exact occasions and numbers have not been recorded centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Currently, 18 members of the RAF sponsored reserves are called out for permanent service.</p>

	<p pid=".791W.5/1">The Government are working with the International Labour Organisation and other UN bodies, NGOs and governments to combat the diverse forms of contemporary slavery, such as forced or bonded labour, debt bondage and serfdom. The UK has ratified the key international legal instruments that outlaw slavery: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Slavery Convention, and ILO Conventions 29 and 105 on Forced Labour. We are promoting the widest possible ratification and practical implementation of these. We have also signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and intend to ratify once domestic legislation is in place.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/2">The FCO finances a number of projects to promote the rights of the child and to combat contemporary forms of slavery. This year projects include an Anti-Slavery International initiative to end the use of child camel jockeys, and a project to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/3">In 2002, the FCO and the National Hi Tech Crime Unit provided 10 countries with equipment and training to investigate on-line child abusers. The project has resulted in a number of convictions and we expect to extend it to another 10 countries this year. UK law enforcement agencies work closely with partners in source, transit and destination countries to detect, prevent and prosecute organised criminal gangs that traffic in humans for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2003 the Government provided an additional &pound;60 million to combat organised immigration crime.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/4">The UK was one of the first signatories to the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the two associated protocols against the facilitation of illegal immigration and for the prevention of trafficking in human beings, especially women and children. This requires signatories to ensure trafficking is a punishable offence, alongside the introduction of prevention, education and support initiatives for victims. We plan to ratify the Convention and the Protocol later this year and are encouraging those countries that have not yet signed the Convention or protocols to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/5">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, introduced a new offence of &quot;trafficking a person for the purpose of controlling him or her in prostitution.&quot; This ensures there is a serious criminal sanction against traffickers, and is punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment. We will introduce legislation on new offences covering human trafficking for labour exploitation as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/6">In 2000, the FCO set up a dedicated unit to tackle the issue of forced marriage. The Unit has handled over 500 cases and repatriated over 100 victims. The Unit works with NGOs, police and judiciary in the UK and overseas. It carries out preventative work in the UK, developing guidelines for the police and social services, increasing public awareness, and achieving wide media coverage.</p>

	<p pid=".805W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has undertaken a considerable amount of work in the important area of assisting developing countries, including in Africa, in the areas of standard setting and compliance. Bilateral trade related technical assistance projects in Malawi and Ghana have both provided support to the Standards Bureaus in those countries, to enable them to participate in international standard setting and implement the standards set by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Codex Alimentarius Committee. The new Regional Trade Facilitation project in southern Africa, covering the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, also has a component to support implementation of international standards that SADC members have signed up to.</p>
	<p pid=".805W.3/2">Through its funding of the Trade Policy Development Project of the World bank, DFID has supported the creation of the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF), which has already undertaken exploratory work in Africa and will be developing projects to enable African countries to meet standards for agricultural exports. The STDF is a partnership of the World bank, World Trade Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Health Organisation, which attempts to strengthen donor coordination in standards related to food safety, and plant and animal health. Between November 1999 and February 2003, reports and action plans were developed in Nigeria, South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya and Uganda, examining the link between trade facilitation, standards and trade.</p>
	<p pid=".805W.3/3">DFID is also contributing to a new United Nations Industrial Development Organisation Trust Fund, 'Enabling Developing Countries to Participate in International Trade',which includes African countries in its first wave of projects. The Fund aims to: enhance developing country market accesses through appropriate infrastructure in order to meet and show compliance with export requirements; build capacity in potentially high productivity sectors; and provide support to developing countries that have encountered problems with meeting standards requirements for their exports.</p>
	<p pid=".805W.3/4">The G8 will be reporting on their actions to implement the commitments in the Africa Action Plan, including in the area of standards, at the G8 summit in Evian in June 2003. However, the European Commission has already announced the establishment of a 'Help desk' within DG Trade, intended to facilitate developing country exports to the European Union through providing information on the requirements of the European Union market, including product standards.

	<p pid=".806W.2/1">DFID promotes agricultural productivity in Africa through supporting African efforts to increase domestic productivity and working to creat a fair and equitable international trading system. We do not earmark bilateral funds, but support Africa's own priorities defined in national Poverty Reduction Strategy processes, which also seek to address the many constraints that lie outside the agriculture sector. These include issues such as economic policy, trade policy and credit and infrastructure provision. UK resources for Africa will increase by nearly 50 per cent. to around &pound;1 billion by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.2/2">The UK supports the development of a fair and equitable international trading system. We believe the G8 process can add significant political momentum to the relevant negotiations. Following Kananaskis, DFID has been supporting progress internationally on CAP reform and WTO agriculture negotiations, the reform and harmonisation of G8 preferential access schemes and multilateral trade related technical assistance to Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.2/3">Access to agricultural technology in Africa was highlighted at Kananaskis. Two relevant initiatives are our support for the design of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (a public-private partnership to enable access to agricultural technology) and provision of &pound;16 million to support agricultural research for Africa in 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".807W.5/1">The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognises four key factors that can improve access to medicines for diseases prevalent in poor countries (including AIDS, TB and Malaria): affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of existing drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/2">The UK Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World, chaired by the former Secretary of State, reported to the Prime Minister in November 2002. A copy of the report is available in the Library. The Working Group consisted of senior representatives from UK Government, pharmaceutical industry, the UN, EC and other international organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/3">The UK Working Group was asked to specifically consider:</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/4" class="indent">ways of improving access to medicines through measures such as facilitating differential pricing arrangements and encouraging appropriate donations; and</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/5" class="indent">what policies could be pursued by the UK Government that would increase research and development into diseases of poor people.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/6">The Group recommended specific action on R&amp;D, and outlined proposals that would encourage voluntary, widespread, sustainable and predictable differential pricing as the operational norm. In the short-term, it recommended gaining significant international commitment to this approach, including through the G8. A team has been established within DFID specifically to take this forward.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/7">The UK Government are firmly committed to increasing access to medicines and to strengthening health systems in developing countries. DFID has committed over &pound;1.5 billion since 1997 to support health systems, which will help build capacity to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection of drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/8">On sustainable financing, we have pledged $200 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). This will help pay for increased coverage of proven interventions for the three diseases and some associated health systems strengthening. We have already disbursed $80 million to the Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/9">The UK is also working through the World Trade Organisation to ensure that a satisfactory conclusion is reached on the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public Health agreement that will assist developing countries with insufficient or no drug manufacturing capacity to make effective use of compulsory licensing.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.5/10">Tax measures were introduced in the 2002 Budget aimed at encouraging private sector companies to increase investment into the research and development of new treatments for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in developing countries, and encouraging responsible donations of medical supplies and equipment to developing countries. Departments across Whitehall will be working together to monitor the impact of these tax initiatives and to explore the potential of other mechanisms to increase investment.</p>

	<p pid=".809W.2/2">The nature of trafficking means that it is a hidden crime and there are no reliable figures about children being trafficked into or out of the UK. There have been a few high profile instances of children being trafficked into or through the UK, but there is insufficient information to say if this is a growing problem. However, the very nature of the crime demands that it is treated very seriously, which is why the Government have introduced criminal sanctions covering child traffickers and has tasked the Reflex group with co-ordinating intelligence on the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".809W.2/3">The UK is committed to tackling the trafficking of children for sexual exploitation. Our strategy on trafficking is set out in the White Paper &quot;Secure Border Safe Haven&quot; and focuses on strengthening the law through new offences covering trafficking; providing appropriate support to victims of trafficking in the UK; tackling the criminals through intelligence and enforcement operations through the Reflex taskforce; EU co-operation and provention is source and transit countries in partnership with Foreign and Commonwealth (FCO) Department for International Development (DFID). Joint work is also underway between key agencies at principal entry points to identify children at risk, and the Home Office is working closely with the Department of Health on good practice in delivering the best service to children who have been trafficked.</p>

	<p pid=".810W.2/1">The UK has contributed &pound;1.5 million to the Integrated Framework Programme (IF) so far. The programme has been extended from the initial five least developed countries to include three pilot countries under the revised programme and a second wave of 11 least developed countries. There are sufficient funds available to complete the IF process in these countries. Further expansion will be considered following the evaluation of the programme this summer. The UK has committed &pound;51 million to trade related capacity building since June 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.2/2">The Integrated Framework aims to support least developed countries mainstream trade priorities into their development programmes, usually framed in the country's poverty reduction strategy. The process includes a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) which recommends policy measures and a matrix of technical assistance and capacity building support needs. The process is country led and the DTIS team comprises both international and local experts. The priorities will be funded through the existing mechanisms for support from bilateral and multilateral partners. In response to the call from participating countries and the World bank, a further trust fund is envisaged to support modest, priority, quick win projects to bridge the period between the DTIS and access to development assistance through the established consultative groups, roundtables and programme support. Its terms of reference were agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-16">16 May 2003</phrase>. The UK plans to contribute shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".811W.5/1">HIV/AIDS represents a major development challenge in Southern Africa, and is a priority for DFID's funding in the region. Because good sexual health is essential for the prevention of HIV/AIDS, much of DFID's support for sexual health is now included in our response to HIV/AIDS. DFID has supported major programmes to combat HIV/AIDS and promote sexual health in South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In addition, DFID supports a South African Development Community (SADC) HIV/AIDS programme covering Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland. Also DFID has recently approved a programme that will work across Africa to support connections between on-going regional work, and fund some new regional initiatives such as working with Orphans and Vulnerable Children. In addition to direct support for HIV/AIDS programmes, DFID is increasingly mainstreaming efforts to combat HIV/AIDS into all development programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".812W.11/1">Maintaining clean water supplies in Iraq has been an immediate concern. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and others, including the UK military, have worked hard to repair water stations and to supply water by alternative means in the interim. In Baghdad power and water are now reaching 80 per cent. of the urban population on an intermittent basis.</p>

DFID has also provided &pound;7 million to UNDP for its emergency assistance programme in the electricity sector, focusing on central and southern Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".813W.2/1">It is difficult to establish an accurate picture of disease trends in Iraq, as the former Iraqi disease surveillance system is no longer functioning. The reactivation of this system is a priority for the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>
	<p pid=".813W.2/2">Recent weeks have shown a steady increase in the number of reported cases of water- related disease in many locations. This is due to a combination of normal seasonal trends including the start of the hot season, inadequate supply of safe water, and poor sanitation. The Iraqi Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF and NGOs are currently conducting assessments, and drawing up an action plan to deal with outbreaks of water-related diseases. UNICEF has prepositioned an extra 200,000 sachets of oral rehydration salts, in the region to deal with diarrhoeal disease outbreaks. DFID is donating cholera kits, sufficient to treat 11,000 people, and emergency health kits, sufficient for 10,000 people for three months, to WHO to assist their response as and when required.</p>

Water disinfection normally involves treatment using chlorine, and reduction of turbidity using Aluminium Sulphate. One metric tonne of chlorine gas is sufficient to treat water for one million people for one day. The quantity of Aluminium Sulphate required depends on the turbidity of the water. Some shortfalls of stocks have been identified in Iraq, which the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), UNICEF and the Coalition have taken steps to meet from outside the country.

	<p pid=".814W.5/1">DFID is providing funding and other support to the UN agencies, Red Cross / Red Crescent and NGOs to enable them to provide humanitarian assistance where it is needed. DFID has committed &pound;115m to support work by humanitarian agencies in the current crisis and has set aside a further &pound;95 million to support emerging humanitarian needs. The attached table shows the detailed allocation of the funding. Supporting such agencies as part of a co-ordinated international response is more effective than running separate national relief operations. DFID looks to the UN to coordinate this humanitarian effort. DFID has also seconded staff to the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Affairs, the UN, and UK forces to advise on humanitarian relief activities.</p>
	<p pid=".814W.5/2">Now that major combat operations are complete, international staff from UN agencies and NGO's have begun returning to Iraq. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-02">2 May</phrase>, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, Ramiro Lopes da Silva, arrived in Baghdad with senior representatives of the World Food Programme, United Nations Development Programme, World Health Organisation and UNICEF to re-establish a permanent presence. The UN's presence is now expanding rapidly, co-ordinated through five regional teams based in Baghdad, central Iraq, the north and in the upper and lower south.</p>

	<p pid=".817W.8/1">The UK's policy towards engagement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has resulted in limited but carefully targeted humanitarian contributions. There are many constraints to humanitarian agencies operating in North Korea, including problems of access. The Government of North Korea generally refuses to allow international organisations free and open access to rural areas and forbids post-distribution monitoring and evaluation.</p>
	<p pid=".817W.8/2">The UK stands ready to provide humanitarian assistance in response to any new sudden humanitarian crisis. DFID contributed just over &pound;2 million to humanitarian assistance projects in 2001&ndash;02. This support was channelled through UNICEF for essential drugs, immunisation and water and sanitation activities and through the British Red Cross for disaster preparedness and flood relief.</p>
	<p pid=".817W.8/3">DFID is also providing support through the European Community's programme. In 2002, the European Community allocated nearly 6 million Euros (&pound;4,244,000). DFID contributes around 20 per cent. of the European Community's budget.</p>

	<p pid=".818W.2/1">Poverty in the West Bank and Gaza has increased dramatically since the intifada started in September 2000. According to a recent World Bank assessment, some 60 per cent. of Palestinians are now living on less than $2 a day. Unemployment stands at 53 per cent. and many families are now dependent on food aid. A study by UNICEF has also found the incidence of acute malnutrition in Gaza (13.3 per cent.) is comparable to levels in Zimbabwe (13 per cent.) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (13.9 per cent.). Palestinian refugees in neighbouring countries also live in unacceptable circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".818W.2/2">The key element of any strategy to reduce poverty sustainably is a successful peaceprocess leading to the establishment of a viable Palestinian state living in peacealongside a secure Israel. Our programme in the West Bank and Gaza provides support for the peace process; capacity building and institutional development; improvements to basic services, and a range of emergency programmes arising from the current conflict.</p>

The Government of Tanzania carried out an initial food and crop assessment in May. This will be followed in July by a further assessment to identify particularly vulnerable areas following the June harvest. We await the results of these. DFID is ready to respond to any request the Government of Tanzania may make at that time.</p>

	<p pid=".822W.2/1">The 10 per cent. target for audio description was considered as part of the Review of the Statutory Requirements for the Provision of Subtitling, Signing and Audio Description, the report of which was published In January 2001. Having considered all the issues, during the review, we concluded that the 10 per cent. target should be maintained. We believe that this target is challenging but achievable.</p>
	<p pid=".822W.2/2">This decision recognised the unresolved production and distribution difficulties with the audio description modules needed to receive the service. The Government have been working with the RNIB, broadcasters and manufacturers to help identify possible solutions to these problems and we are disappointed that the current problems have not yet been solved.</p>
	<p pid=".822W.2/3">The Communications Bill, currently in Parliament, allows the Secretary of State, following consultation with OFCOM, to vary the target percentage for audio description, by order. So even though the target is currently 10 per cent. it means that if there were significant advances in the current technology, and more widespread take-up of the modules, targets could be increased.</p>

	<p pid=".822W.8/1">DCMS has received a great deal of correspondence from organisations representing musicians and other performers about the Licensing Bill, most of whom have been concerned that it will restrict their activities. The vast majority of their concerns have been unfounded and based on a misinterpretation of the Bill's provisions. Where we believed that the Bill could be improved, however, we have listened to the concerns expressed to us and have made appropriate amendments, for instance by exempting places of public religious worship from the licensing regime as it relates to the provision of entertainment and entertainment facilities and by accepting the spirit of an amendment which exempts incidental live music in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".822W.8/2">Under the provisions of the Bill there will be no separate licence for the provision of regulated entertainment. Permission to carry on any of the activities licensable under the Bill will be covered by a single premises licence. It will cost no more to apply at the same time for a licence permitting the sale of alcohol and the provision of entertainment than it would to apply for one permitting the sale of alcohol only. I therefore believe that the Bill will make it more affordable than now for venues to put on live performance in the vast majority of cases and increase opportunities for musicians and other artists to perform.</p>
	<p pid=".822W.8/3">The Regulatory Impact Assessment that was published alongside the Licensing Bill states that just over 9,000 on-licensed premises and registered members clubs hold permanent public entertainment licences or certificates of suitability. An estimated 37,000 temporary public entertainment licences are also issued each year. The Government have made no estimate of the number of premises that will apply for permission to provide regulated entertainment under the new licensing regime. We expect, however, that the removal of the cost deterrent in applying for permission to provide such entertainment, along with the provision of a less bureaucratic system and measures to prevent unnecessary conditions being attached to licences by licensing authorities will encourage many more in respect of their premises to take the opportunity to provide public entertainment.</p>

	<p pid=".823W.2/1">The Fitness for Purpose initiative was launched in the autumn 2001 by my Department in conjunction with the Local Government Association. The initiative promotes better inspection and regulation of hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast accommodation which are failing to meet minimum legal requirements on health and safety, food hygiene, trading standards and fire safety, in order to help them improve. Further details can be found at <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/tourism">www.culture.gov.uk/tourism</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".823W.2/2">From April this year, leading local authorities have been carrying out pilot studies of the initiative in major English tourist destinations. The lessons from these pilots will form the basis of a full set of proposals which DCMS and the Local Government Association will produce next year. We then hope to see Fitness for Purpose adopted across England from 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".826W.2/2">The Communications Bill currently before Parliament strengthens the requirements for subtitling on television. The Bill sets subtitling targets of 90 per cent. of programmes on Channels 3 and 4, and 80 per cent. of programmes on all other channels, extending these requirements to digital cable and satellite broadcasters for the first time.</p>
	<p pid=".826W.2/3">The Government is working with a range of organisations in the audiovisual sector-such as the Broadcasters Disability Network, film distributors, trade organisations and companies providing subtitling&mdash;to promote awareness of subtitling issues on DVD and video. We try to ensure that the views of people with sensory impairments are taken into account, and work is taken forward in liaison with organisations representing these groups.</p>
	<p pid=".826W.2/4">Promotion of awareness of subtitling issues in cinema is primarily through the Film Council as the national body responsible for film strategy, but we also liase with other interested organisations in the sector such as PACT and the Film Distributors Association.</p>

	<p pid=".827W.2/1">The Regional Tourist Boards (RTBs) are not Government organisations and their geographical boundaries are for them to decide in consultation with their membership. They are the natural partners of the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) for the development and implementation of Regional Sustainable Tourism Strategies. The question of the coterminousness of RTB and RDA boundaries can be considered during the process of formulating those strategies, in consultation with RTBs and other RDAs as appropriate. Five of the regions already have coterminous boundaries.</p>
	<p pid=".827W.2/2">Government funding for the RTBs, to be distributed via the RDAs single pot for three years from 2003&ndash;04, is a continuation of the funding the RTBs received from the former English Tourism Council in 2002&ndash;03 in respect of regional projects. It is guaranteed for three years at the same level as in 2002&ndash;03 and does not take into account individual local authority spending on tourism, some of which may comprise membership subscriptions to RTBs. There are separate arrangements for London and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport funds the Greater London Authority (GLA) towards meeting its tourism responsibilities. Most of this funding flows to the London Development Agency, which in turn uses the London Tourist Board as a key delivery agent. The amounts for RDAs to pass on to RTBs in 2003&ndash;04 are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".828W.2/1">The Government's policy is that television advertising should be undertaken responsibly and its regulation should be directed at ensuring the prevention of harm to vulnerable groups including children. To this end, television is regulated by the Independent Television Commission (ITC), which establishes codes covering all television advertising and sponsorship. Broadcasters must comply with these codes and sanctions are available for non-compliance. In relation to food advertising, the codes include provisions to prevent harm notably from advertisements which mislead, make unsubstantiated health claims, disparage good dietary practice or encourage excessive consumption. The ITC keeps the effectiveness of the codes under review and they can be amended, after appropriate consultation, if they are found to be inadequate in preventing harm. The Communications Bill provides for OFCOM to take on the responsibility for ensuring that standards are maintained. The Government believe that these arrangements provide for the effective regulation of television advertising and that at present there is no case for further Government action, such as entirely prohibiting the advertising of food during children's programming.</p>

	<p pid=".830W.8/2">Suffolk LEA has not received capital funding specifically for PRUs in the last five years. The Department currently allocates most capital funding for schools and PRUs to LEAs by needs-related formulae, and it is for authorities to assess and prioritise the capital needs of their school and PRU buildings through their asset management planning process, in consultation with local schools. Individual LEAs will therefore hold information on how much capital investment is being directed towards the provision of PRUs.</p>

	<p pid=".834W.3/2">The latest published figures on full-time equivalent students are contained within the Departmental Annual Report (DAR) 2003, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-14">Wednesday 14 May 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.3/3">The methodology for calculating full-time equivalent students is the same for both sixth form colleges and further education colleges and has remained unchanged since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.3/4">The Individualised Student Record (ISR), and now the Individualised Learner Record (ILR), contains information on each student's 'guided learning hours' depending on the number and type of qualifications they are studying for in the further education sector. Guided learning hours are described as 'all times when a member of staff is present to give specific guidance towards the qualification or module being studied on a programme'.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.3/5">Students with total guided learning hours of 450 or more are classified as one full-time equivalent. Students with less than 450 guided learning hours are counted as a fraction of one full-time equivalent student. This fraction is calculated by dividing the student's guided learning hours by the median guided learning hours for students with a total of 450 or more guided learning hours. The median for students with a total of 450 or more guided learning hours is re-calculated each year.</p>

The process has included a series of regional Skill Summits and a monthly Stakeholder Group meeting. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-26">26 March</phrase> the Department published a Progress Report, &quot;Developing a National Skills Strategy and Delivery Plan&quot;, which invited comments from recipients. At the same time, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published a consultation document on funding adult learning. Each local LSC is holding consultation events with employers and learning providers in their area. Responses are currently being considered. A summary of responses will be set out in the National Skills Strategy White Paper to be published in June. Throughout the process, a key message from employers has been the need to make adult skills training and funding more responsive to their needs.</p>

	<p pid=".838W.9/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent further question concerning the 1991 Census. (114607)</p>
	<p pid=".838W.9/4" class="indent">The delivery of census forms for the 1991 Census took place between 12 and <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-18">18 April 1991</phrase>, although in some areas, particularly inner cities, forms were being delivered up to Census day&mdash; <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-21">21 April 1991</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.9/5" class="indent">In the 1991 Census, forms were collected by enumerators during the collection round between 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-25">25 April</phrase>. However it was anticipated that a number of forms would be posted back direct and measures had been put in place to deal with direct postal returns. Just over 1,000 forms were returned prior to Census day and these were transferred to the processing office for inclusion in processing. The early receipt of these forms had no impact on the 1991 Census.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.9/6" class="indent">During the collection round, the timing of which was originally extended until <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-29">29 April</phrase> in inner city areas, enumerators checked the forms briefly for any omissions, and issued further forms where contact had not been established or where there was some uncertainty about the occupation of the accommodation. Where households were absent a form was left asking the householders to complete and return the form to the local field staff. Due to the large number of uncollected forms, mainly from non-contacts and in inner cities, the collection period was extended into May in some areas and specially targeted postal facilities were introduced in the very worst areas to allow forms to be returned direct to OPCS (now ONS). Forms continued to be received in this way until early July.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.9/7" class="indent">A processing order of Counties and Regions had been agreed in advance, and the late returns did cause some problems, particularly for Inner London and counties early in the processing order, because it was necessary to insert the forms into their correct position prior to processing. Information about those households known to be present but for which no form was received in time to be included in the processing was imputed.</p>

	<p pid=".839W.5/1">A key element of the Government's enterprise policy is the recognition that social attitudes, the business environment and specific market failures can present significantly higher barriers to enterprise within the UK's disadvantaged communities. Moreover it is in these communities that the benefits of enterprise are likely to have the greatest social impact through promoting increased economic activity and the creation of jobs. The Government is therefore concentrating particular efforts on the needs of the Enterprise Areas, the most deprived communities across the UK, with the intention of increasing the amount of enterprise in these communities.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/2">In England the Enterprise Areas are defined at electoral ward level. The following numbers of wards are eligible in each region.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/3" class="indent">East Midlands&mdash;128</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/4" class="indent">East of England&mdash;55</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/5" class="indent">London&mdash;233</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/6" class="indent">North East&mdash;208</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/7" class="indent">North West&mdash;284</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/8" class="indent">South East&mdash;60</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/9" class="indent">South West&mdash;55</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/10" class="indent">West Midlands&mdash;116</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/11" class="indent">Yorkshire and Humberside&mdash;123</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/12">The Inland Revenue website contains a postcode search tool for the Enterprise Areas at <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/so/pcodesearch.htm">www.inlandrevenue. gov.uk/so/pcode search.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/13">Particular measures that will benefit businesses in the Enterprise Areas, including those in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, include the exemption from stamp duty of all non-residential property transactions, which will reduce the costs to business of locating and investing in disadvantaged areas, and the introduction of the community investment tax relief, which is intended to increase the amount of investment in disadvantaged communities.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/14">The Government is also putting in place measures to improve planning flexibility in these areas such as the introduction of Business Planning Zones in the current Planning Bill&mdash;these are areas in which there will be no requirement to apply for planning permission where predetermined criteria are met&mdash;and taking steps to help local authorities ensure that the planning system is transparent, accessible and affordable for businesses in these areas. These are set out in Budget 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.5/15">The Enterprise Areas were designated in the Pre-Budget Report in November 2002. Evaluation is being or will be conducted on a number of the policy measures, though no results are yet available. An evaluation of the fiscal measures introduced to stimulate the regeneration of deprived urban areas, including exemptions from stamp duty, is being commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid=".845W.5/1">By 2005&ndash;06, the first full year of national implementation, the expected cost of the pay element of Agenda for Change proposals will be around &pound;950 million in England. This includes provision for the costs associated with the proposals for additional annual leave and changes to working hours. The figure does not include annual uplifts in pay awards for the cost of living, which have been set at 3.225 per cent. as part of the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; package. It is not possible to give a firm estimate of the projected administrative costs associated with implementing &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, but we anticipate that these costs will be outweighed by the longer-term savings resulting from harmonisation and rationalisation of current pay systems in the national health service.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.0/1">Under the Agenda for Change proposals, there is no automatic connection between a job evaluation profile and any change in the length of the working week for a post covered by that profile. The proposals include a harmonised working week of 37&frac12; hours for full-time national health service staff covered by Agenda for Change, including provisions to phase in these arrangements for staff who currently have longer or shorter hours. In broad terms, the proposals involve a phased increase in the working week for the Whitley groupings of professions allied to medicine, administrative and clerical, professional and technical staff B and speech and language therapists' assistants. A number of staff groups work unconditioned hours and there are national provisions for working hours to be determined locally for a number of staff groups.

However, the Choice Protects review is considering ways to collect this information in the future. The review is also looking at a number of issues that affect the recruitment and retention of foster carers, including role and status, training, support and rewards.</p>
	<p pid=".848W.9/2">The Department has also worked closely with both the Inland Revenue and the Department for Work and Pensions to introduce an appropriate tax threshold for foster carers and extend Home Responsibilities Protection to foster carers. Both changes were recently announced at the beginning of April 2003 and should encourage recruitment and retention of foster carers.</p>
	<p pid=".848W.9/3">We do not collect data centrally on the numbers of adoptive families. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-16">16 May 2003</phrase>, the Adoption Register for England and Wales included 1,068 families who were approved as suitable to adopt and waiting to be matched with children.</p>
	<p pid=".848W.9/4">The Adoption and Children Act 2002 overhauls the legal framework for adoption. Adoption support services are a key part of the Act and should encourage more people to adopt looked after children. The Government is determined to deliver early improvements in the provision of adoption support and recently announced an extra &pound;70 million over three years for local authorities to develop their adoption support services.</p>
	<p pid=".848W.9/5">The Department of Health is committed to supporting local and national recruitment activity, through support of National Adoption Week. The Department made a further &pound;60,000 available to support National Adoption Week in 2002, following a grant of &pound;50,000 in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".848W.9/6">The Department has also developed an &quot;Adopter Recruitment&quot; Toolkit and an information video for use by adoption agencies in preparing adopters.</p>

	<p pid=".858W.5/1">The Government is committed to tackling low pay in the National Health Service. As part of NHS pay awards for 2002&ndash;03, extra resources were targeted to give proportionally greater pay increases to the lowest paid National Health Service staff. From <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, all non-medical staff groups received an increase of either 3.6 per cent., or 400 if greater. There was also a range of targeted action focused on the lower paid. This gave a new national minimum hourly rate for staff directly employed by the NHS of &pound;4.47 from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".858W.5/2">The minimum national adult rate, excluding trainees, has increased since 1997 from &pound;3.46 an hour to &pound;4.47 an hour; an increase of 29 per cent. in cash terms for staff directly employed in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".858W.5/3">A proposed agreement on pay modernisation for NHS non-medical staff, Agenda for Change, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-03">3 March</phrase>.2003 Staff organisations are currently consulting their members on the proposed agreement. If ratified, the agreement will, when implemented, provide a new minimum wage for directly employed staff of &pound;10,100 (at 2002&ndash;03 pay levels), equivalent to &pound;5.16 an hour. This will represent an 11 per cent, increase in basic starting salary for the lowest paid. Subject to the outcome of consultation, the proposed agreement will be implemented in a number of 'early implementer' sites from June 2003 and nationally from October 2004. Under the proposed agreement, rates of pay will in addition be uplifted by 10 per cent, over the next three years, compared with the 2002&ndash;03 level set out above.</p>
	<p pid=".858W.5/4">The information in this answer relates to England, although the Agenda for Change proposals apply across the United Kingdom. Pay for NHS staff in Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved administrations.

While the number of doctors on an individual rota on call will generally have to increase to implement the 2004 requirements, the intention of the Department's guidance&mdash;HSC 2003/001: Protecting Staff, Delivering Services&mdash;Implementing the European Working Time Directive for Doctors in Training&mdash;is that trusts should find ways to reduce the number of resident rotas.

	<p pid=".862W.0/1">Detailed information on total pay costs is not available centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/2">It is however estimated that there are currently about 2,000 traffic wardens employed by police authorities in England and Wales, over a third of this total being employed in the Metropolitan Police District. While average salary costs nationwide are not available, I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that the cost of one Metropolitan Police traffic warden is at present approximately &pound;18,500 a year. Since costs in the Metropolitan Police District are likely to be substantially higher than elsewhere, the total national pay cost should not exceed &pound;37 million.</p>

	<p pid=".863W.0/1">The advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (AMD) that cannabis should be reclassified to Class C under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has accepted, was based on a detailed study of the available scientific literature covering all relevant aspects of the issue, including epidemiology and risks to health. Although products with cannabis remains illegal and controlled&mdash;it is a harmful drug. Higher concentrations of the main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), became available during the late 1980s and 1990s, there has generally been a very wide variation in the THC levels found in cannabis, and this continues to be the case and the Advisory Council Misuse of Drugs took this into consideration in the advice they gave.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/2">The Government give close attention to developments on drugs laws and polices in other countries within the framework of the United Nations Conventions of 1961 and 1971. Government representatives regularly attend a variety of international fora at which information and ideas are exchanged with other Governments. The Government note the policy being followed in the Netherlands in respect of cannabis. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the proposal to reclassify cannabis to Class C provides the best prospect for putting out a credible message to young people about drugs, based on a scientific assessment of the relative harm they cause, and for putting a clear focus on Class A drugs, the ones which do the most harm to individuals and to society.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/3">The '2001&ndash;02 British Crime Survey'&mdash;the latest year for which results are available&mdash;estimated that 25 per cent. of 16 to 18-year-olds had taken cannabis in the last year. The 'Drug use, smoking and drinking among young people in England in 2001' survey estimated that 13 per cent. of school children aged between 11 and 15 had taken cannabis in the last year. Copies of both surveys can be found in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/4">There have been no recent UK studies that have looked specifically at cannabis as a gateway drug among teenagers. However, some relevant analysis has been undertaken which examined wider progression from one group of drugs to another. It used the 1998&ndash;99 Youth Lifestyles Survey, which questioned 3,700 young people aged between 12 and 30 years. The analysis examined progression from a group of drugs, including cannabis, LSD, amphetamines, amylnitrate and magic mushrooms, to a group of highly dangerous drugs, including heroin, crack and methadone. When social and psychological factors, such as disturbed family background and disadvantaged location, were taken into account, little evidence was found for a gateway effect caused by use of the first group of drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/5">This analysis can be found in Home Office Research Study 253 entitled: 'The Road to Ruin? Sequences of Initiation into Drug Use and Offending by Young People in Britain'. Copies of this report can be found in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/6">The report of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs on the classification of cannabis provides a detailed assessment of the medical evidence with regard to the possible effects of cannabis use on health. A summary of the findings is contained in Chapter 4. A copy of the Council's report, 'The classification of cannabis under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971', with bibliographical references, is in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/7">An Order in Council is needed to change the classification of any controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Such an Order is subject to the draft affirmative resolution procedure. My right hon. Friend intends that a draft Order to amend the Act to reclassify cannabis will be debated in Parliament in good time for changes to the penalties for trafficking Class C drugs proposed in the Criminal Justice Bill being approved and taking effect.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/8">My right hon. Friend and I regularly receive written representations from right hon. and hon. Members and members of the public about the Government's proposal to reclassify cannabis.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/9">We have not received any recent representations from Drugscope or Lifeline (Manchester) about drugs misuse issues with particular reference to cannabis.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.0/10">We have received a few letters from residents of Lambeth in the past year concerning cannabis issues generally. Issues have also been raised in discussion by constituency MPs for the area and its surroundings.</p>

	<p pid=".875W.2/1">Under the Local Government Finance Settlement for 2003&ndash;04, Revenue Support Grant (RSG) increased by 15.3 per cent. and the National Non Domestic Rates (NNDR) Distributable Amount decreased by 6.2 per cent. NNDR and RSG (along with Principal Formula Police Grant) are part of general grant which increased by 5.9 per cent. or &pound;2.249 billion overall on a like for like basis.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimate the change in national insurance contributions will increase local authorities' pay costs on average by some &pound;250 million. It is estimated that the 0.4 per cent. increase in employers contributions to the Teacher's Pension Scheme which local authorities have had to fund from within the 5.9 per cent. increase in general grant will add some &pound;54 million to local authorities' revenue expenditure. These pressures add 0.73 per cent. to the 2002&ndash;03 adjusted baseline of &pound;41.445 billion. If both are excluded, the increase in general grant would be 5.17 per cent. or &pound;2.145 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/3">The Spending Review 2000 took into account the results of the 1998 Local Government Pension Scheme valuation exercise and the forthcoming 2004 valuation exercise will inform SR2004. Pay settlements for local government staff are a matter for local authorities and the pay review bodies. It is expected that awards which take into account the overall increase in funding available to councils while reflecting the need to recruit and retain staff.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/4">The Government funds all new burdens placed on local authorities under the principle of New Burdens which requires Government to reimburse local authorities for any additional costs they face as a result of the imposition of new powers or duties. For example, the Spending Review made clear for the first time the burdens funded in the environmental, protective and cultural services and provided &pound;82 million in year one for burdens such as the changes affecting the disposal of fridges. Following the Spending Review, we transferred funds into the settlement for burdens which could not be agreed at the time, such as an additional &pound;50 million a year over the next three years for the implications for age-equalisation on the mandatory concessionary fares scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".876W.5/2">The rules for planning appeals, which came into effect in August 2000, introduced the requirement for the appellant and local planning authority to prepare jointly a statement of common ground. The purpose of this document is to set out the agreed factual information about the proposal in advance of the inquiry, and so reduce the time taken on this when the inquiry opens. Consideration is also being given to increasing the use of pre-inquiry meetings (where the appointed Inspector can set out the timetable and running order in advance of the inquiry) for suitable cases.</p>

So the order for a local government referendum to be held will set out the text of the options which are to appear on the ballot paper. Sections 3(7) and 3(8) of the Act provide, respectively, that the Electoral Commission must be consulted on this wording and that their comments are laid before each House when the order is laid. The order will also be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.Local government reorganisation would only go ahead if an elected assembly is to be established.

	<p pid=".880W.3/1">Contracts for Government work are awarded within a policy and legal framework which requires the process to be fair and objective and deliver value for money. However, responsibility for any contract rests with the individual Department concerned. Information for the Government as a whole is therefore not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
