	<p pid="c.1767W.3/1">The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) was formed in May 2007. The number of press officers employed by the MoJ in 2007-08 (as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>) was 33. The number employed in 2008-09 (as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>) was 40. This includes a member of staff on maternity leave. The MoJ press office operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, dealing with all media relations for the department and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) from the international, national and regional media. The MoJ is one of the largest Departments in Government. It is right that the public know and understand the work of the MoJ and its agencies and how taxpayers' money is being spent. Communications, including the work of the press office, is an important element of this. The rise in the number of press officers is attributable to the need to increase the capability of the press office to deal with the expanded remit of the work undertaken by the MoJ, compared to its previous incarnations, and to fill vacancies.</p>

The same two continued to be employed throughout 2008-09 and remain in post.</p>

	<p pid="c.1767W.6/15">The Ministry of Justice is applying the Government's Security Policy Framework to effectively, efficiently and reliably control risks across its organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1767W.6/16">This comprises the requirement for all areas to apply procedures for reporting security incidents robustly, including the identification and investigation of the departure, however minor, from all security procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1767W.6/17">The outcome is an evidently effective security management regime which in 2008-09 saw the lowest number of escapes from prisons to date; abscond performance is good and improving.</p>
	<p pid="c.1767W.6/18">Where incidents involve the inadvertent disclosure of personal data these include the requirement to involve managers and Senior Civil Servants within an hour of any potential disclosure being identified. The circumstances surrounding each potential incident are investigated and where appropriate disciplinary action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.1767W.6/19">These figures differ from those provided by me in a written answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon.

I will be writing to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and will issue a corrected answer to be printed in the <i> Official Report</i>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1767W.6/20">The figures in this answer include an additional 4,507 security incidents/breaches relating to operational breaches of security in prison establishments. These mostly relate to the smuggling of drugs into prisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.1767W.6/21">Drugs misuse as measured by random mandatory drug testing has decreased by 63 per cent. since 1996-97, principally as a result of an effective offender management and prisoner support regime, combined with prison governors deploying a comprehensive range of robust security measures to detect contraband and prevent its importation into prisons.</p>

	<p pid="c.1773W.5/3">The NOMS Muslim adviser, together with some Muslim chaplains, has consulted widely on the issue of Halal meat. The work culminated in the introduction of a NOMS Halal Standard which has been agreed by senior Muslim scholars from across all the different Muslim schools of thought. It has also been acknowledged by a senior official at the English Beef and Lamb Executive (EBLEX) as an example of best practice. The Halal Standard together with comprehensive commodity specifications helps ensure that all Muslim prisoners are provided with assured, quality products. Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, all Halal raw poultry products have been accredited and supplied to this new standard.</p>
	<p pid="c.1773W.5/4">If any prisoner has any doubt about the credibility of the Halal menu option offered, despite the introduction of these standards, there is always an option to choose a vegetarian or vegan option as an alternative.</p>
	<p pid="c.1773W.5/5">All contracted suppliers are required to comply with Food Quality Standards provided by the authority. This includes the standard for Halal, a copy of which has been placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.1779W.0/2">The total number of recorded security breaches/incidents occurring in 102 Petty France (MoJ HQ) for the last reporting year was 25.</p>
	<p pid="c.1779W.0/3">Most of these were low-level departures from security procedures by staff and none were assessed to be significant, for example not displaying their passes adequately.

	<p pid="c.1779W.0/4">The MoJ is applying the Government's Security Policy Framework to control risks effectively, efficiently and reliably across its organisation. This includes a regime of education and awareness for staff/contractors, robust implementation of controls to manage risks to a reasonably practicable level and a physical security monitoring/inspection and auditing regime across its HQ estate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1779W.3/25">Of the total, over 80 per cent. relate to incidents involving prisons and courts. This needs to be put into the context of the challenges faced with work in the high-risk prison environment. 2008-09 saw the lowest number of escapes from prisons to date; abscond performance is good and improving.</p>
	<p pid="c.1779W.3/26">The Ministry of Justice is applying the Government's Security Policy Framework to control risks across its organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1779W.3/27">Although, there has been a 43 per cent. increase in reported information and IT security related breaches/incidents, much of this is the result of the implementation of a robust information assurance programme. This has included the need for all areas to robustly apply procedures for reporting security incidents, including the identification and investigation of the departure, however minor, from all security procedures. The result is an evidently improving information security management system. This has seen a 70 per cent. reduction in the number or significant information security incidents/breaches between the two reporting years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1779W.3/28">The figures above detail a 47 per cent. increase in building/physical related breaches/incidents and 87 per cent. decrease in operational security breaches between the two years. 97 per cent. of these relate to either prison or court physical security operational breaches/incidents. The split is solely attributable to the change in the way HM Prison Service have assigned breaches/incidents to classifications between the two years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1787W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Andrew Hind, dated July 2009:</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.6/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Question on what guidance the Charity Commission has issued on whether registered charities may <i> (a)</i> register as third parties with the Electoral Commission, and <i> (b)</i> engage in political campaigning during an election period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.6/4" class="indent">Charity law on campaigning and political activity is set out in our published guidance 'Speaking Out-Guidance on Campaigning and Political Activity by Charities' (CC9) and 'Charities and Elections' which are available on our website at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk">www.charitycommission.gov.uk</a>. This guidance makes clear that a charity can carry out campaigning and political activity as a means of furthering or supporting its charitable purpose, but that under charity law a charity must never carry out party political activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.6/5" class="indent">On part <i> (a)</i> of your question regarding the issue of a charity's registration as a third party with the Electoral Commission, our guidance signposts charities to the Electoral Commission and to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. We do not provide detailed guidance ourselves. Charities must not support or oppose any party political campaign, candidate or manifesto. Therefore we do not envisage circumstances where it would be necessary for a charity to register with the Electoral Commission as a third party. We would be concerned about any charity that was recognised in this way, and would certainly want to explore this further with them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.6/6" class="indent">As to part <i> (b)</i>, the Commission's guidance on political campaigning during an election period makes clear that the principles for a charity engaging in any campaigning or political activity continue to apply. The key principle of charity law in terms of elections is that charities must be, and be seen to be, independent from party politics. We therefore urge charities to think carefully about what activities they engage in during this period, and how they might be perceived.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.6/7" class="indent">We are currently in the process of arranging to meet with the Electoral Commission to discuss further the issue of third party registration. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have other questions. I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.1788W.5/2">While there is no one budget for cyber security, and the Government do not provide details of the resources employed by the UK intelligence and security agencies, cyber security is a key priority and as such is appropriately resourced. A number of Government bodies contribute towards the protection of UK networks. For example: CPNI, Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, provides advice on electronic or cyber protective security measures to the businesses and organisations that comprise the UK's critical national infrastructure, including public utilities companies and banks CPNI also runs a CERT service which responds to reported attacks on private sector networks; and CESG, part of GCHQ, provides Government Departments with advice and guidance on how to protect against, detect and mitigate various types of cyber attack.</p>
	<p pid="c.1788W.5/3">CESG also runs the computer emergency response team, GovCertUK, which provides warnings, alerts and assistance in resolving serious IT incidents for the public sector. In addition to this existing work, the June 2009 Cyber Security Strategy also announced the provision of additional programme funding for the development of innovative future technologies to protect UK networks; the details will be reported to Parliament in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="c.1801W.2/1">Service men and women should be provided with the best possible support as they move back to civilian life, and this is recognised in the Service Personnel Command Paper, The Nation's Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans, published in July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1801W.2/2">Measures proposed in the Command Paper to improve access of ex-Service personnel to housing include: a change in legislation to enable Service personnel to establish a local connection with the area in which they are serving; an investigation to see what steps are required to ensure that local authorities follow good practice in respect of 'cessation to occupy' certificates when service-leavers are threatened with homelessness; the consideration of how 'void' military accommodation can be used to temporarily accommodate injured ex-service personnel; and an extension to the Key Worker Living programme to ex-service personnel for up to 12 months after discharge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1801W.2/3">The Department does not hold figures on the number of veterans sleeping rough. However, independent research carried out, specifically in London, last year by the University of York shows that the proportion of veterans among the homeless population has fallen dramatically over the last 10 years. Veterans are now some 6 per cent. of the homeless population in London.</p>
	<p pid="c.1801W.2/4">The MOD works closely with the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) and the Devolved Administrations, veterans' organisations and other service providers to ensure a co-ordinated and structured approach to this problem as it affects a small minority of our ex-service personnel. We aim to prevent new service leavers becoming homeless and to provide an effective safety net for those veterans who are homeless.</p>
	<p pid="c.1801W.2/5">Current measures, including new commitments in the July 2008 Service Personnel Command Paper, provide a comprehensive package of support. Mike Jackson House provides 25 units of secure short-term supported accommodation built in Aldershot for young single ex-service leavers identified at risk of homelessness. Mike Jackson House opened in March 2008 on land gifted by MOD.</p>

	<p pid="c.1805W.2/2">The MOD ran an Expressions of Interest campaign earlier this year and a number of bids were received by the closing date. I have announced today that Our Enterprise, a community interest company that brokers and delivers bespoke commercial partnerships between charities, social investors, commercial operators and the public sector to deliver large-scale integrated regeneration projects, has been chosen as our preferred bidder for the site. Our Enterprise has been chosen as our preferred bidder for the site in accordance with Government policy on the disposal of historic buildings. We expect to exchange contracts with the purchaser and complete the transfer by the autumn, if not earlier.</p>
	<p pid="c.1805W.2/3">Our Enterprise has a vision of promoting the quality of life for both individuals residing on the site and for Gosport as a whole. I believe that the choice of preferred bidder for Haslar is good news for the local community, and will preserve the heritage and visual aspects of this important site.</p>

The UK has worked hard to ensure that members of the Senate are aware of the importance the UK places on the Treaty and the benefits for both nations in operational and industrial terms. MOD and FCO officials in the British embassy in Washington regularly discuss Treaty implementation with their US colleagues in preparation for ratification.</p>

A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. The figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> 2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the FCE Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> 3. The ICD-10 codes used to identify Cardiovascular failure are as follows:<br/> I50.0 Congestive heart failure<br/> I50.1 Left ventricular failure<br/> I50.9 Heart failure, unspecified<br/> I11.0 Hypertensive heart disease with (congestive) heart failure<br/> I11.0 Hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure<br/> I11.0 Hypertensive heart and renal disease with both (congestive) heart failure and renal failure<br/> P29.0 Neonatal cardiac failure</td> </tr>

Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> 5.

We amended the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to require public bodies (including schools and local authorities) to increase access to the curriculum and school premises over time for disabled students by making reasonable adjustments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1822W.5/3">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 has also been amended to place a general duty on all public bodies, when carrying out their functions to have due regard to the need to: promote equality of opportunity between disabled people and other people; eliminate discrimination that is unlawful under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995; eliminate harassment of disabled people that is related to their disability; promote positive attitudes by disabled people in public life; and take steps to meet disabled people's needs, even if this requires more favourable treatment. Additionally, public bodies have a specific duty to work with disabled people to develop, implement and publish a disability equality scheme outlining how the general duty will be met.</p>

	<p pid="c.1823W.11/1">Details on the funding, materials and support made available specifically for the victims of online child abuse are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1823W.11/2">However, expenditure on children's social care in England has increased from &#163;2.218 billion in 1997-98 to &#163;5.728 billion in 2008-09. This is a real terms increase of over 90 per cent., which equates to an average real terms increase of 6.1 per cent. per annum. In addition, the Government are investing &#163;130 million in social work reform over the full spending review period including &#163;109 million in the next two years of which &#163;57.8 million is additional new investment as part of the Government's detailed response to Lord Laming's Report.</p>
	<p pid="c.1823W.11/3">The Department of Health also makes available to local authorities &#163;100.045 million in 2009-10 for child and adolescent mental health services through the local authority area based grant. It is for local authorities to determine how to use those resources in order to deliver local and national priorities in their areas. These grants account for less than 20 per cent. of spend on CAMHS and the actual reported spend on CAMHS increased by 62 per cent. between 2003-04 and 2006-07 to &#163;523 million (latest available figure) when NHS spending is considered also.</p>
	<p pid="c.1823W.11/4">Statutory guidance contained in 'Working Together to Safeguard Children' explains the procedures to be followed if somebody has concerns about the welfare of a child and in particular has concerns that a child may be suffering, or may be at risk of suffering, significant harm. Chapter 5 sets out the principles that underpin work to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Where online abuse is concerned children and or parents can seek support from children's social care.</p>
	<p pid="c.1823W.11/5">In addition, the Government have committed &#163;30 million to the NSPCC's Childline services which offers trusted 1:1 counselling to children. The money will allow the NSPCC to expand their services significantly and improve them so that more children can be given the advice and help that can be so important.</p>

This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br/> 2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DCSF (then DfES). 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and from the RO1 form previously.<br/> 3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years.<br/> 4.

	<p pid="c.1828W.6/4" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-13">13 July</phrase> (Official Report, column 506W), asking for a progress update about discussions between Xafinity Paymaster and the Post Office concerning the payment of armed forces pensions into the Post Office Card Account.</p>
	<p pid="c.1828W.6/5" class="indent">In order for the MOD or Xafinity Paymaster to introduce a POCA facility for Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) payments a new contractual agreement between MOD and the Post Office for this provision would be required. This would incur significant set up costs, as well as higher ongoing costs, especially as the MOD volumes would be significantly lower than those which enabled DWP to negotiate the current rate. The Service Personnel Veterans Agency (SPVA) will continue, as always, to work closely with Xafinity Paymaster to ensure that we provide our customers with services that are both convenient and represent value for money.</p>

Setting national standards for provision cannot cater for local circumstances, such as differing demographic profiles and the extent of building development in an area.

This includes a new role for local authorities in the delivery of housing, enabling them to build 3,000 additional council homes over the next two years, which is a four-fold expansion of the scheme announced at the Budget. 12 ALMOs that have not yet met the Audit Commission's two-star standard to be eligible for support are more likely to receive funding in 2011-12. We remain fully committed to complete the Decent Homes programme, and once completed, to seeing this standard maintained in the future.

	<p pid="c.1859W.8/2">It was always the intention that the International Broadcast Centre/Main Press Centre (IBC/MPC) would be a combination of temporary and permanent elements. As it became clear that a private sector deal was not going to offer best value for money, a full assessment of the IBC/MPC site was undertaken to determine ways to make temporary those proposed permanent elements not required in legacy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1859W.8/3">The MPC offices, the two-storey IBC studio and part of the car parking facilities will be permanent buildings for games and legacy as originally planned but slightly smaller (totalling just under 100,000 sq m rather than 125,000). Some of this reduction is due to catering facilities, originally intended to be housed temporarily in office space during the games, now being provided in separate wholly temporary facilities. Other temporary elements of the project include both the other part of the car parking facilities and temporary retail facilities for media and broadcast personnel.</p>
	<p pid="c.1859W.8/4">Assessment of temporary versus permanent facilities is ongoing as the design and procurement teams continue to ascertain those components required solely for games-time. As such, careful attention is being given to identify those elements that can either be hired in for the duration of the games or that can be relocated following the games. For example, we are considering hiring much of the mechanical and electrical plant required to service the IBC in games-time and the generators for back-up power.</p>
	<p pid="c.1859W.8/5">Games-time operations are the responsibility of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), in conjunction with the Olympic Broadcast Service and Host Broadcaster, who will be providing much of their own broadcast equipment and operational functions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1859W.8/6">It remains the intention to create facilities that leave a real long-term employment legacy for Hackney and the buildings have been designed to be as flexible as possible. The public sector will retain ownership of the asset and receipt of all revenues from its sale after 2012.</p>

	<p pid="c.1861W.0/1">The Olympic Delivery Authority has directly awarded contracts to over 950 suppliers to date. The ODA was formed in April 2006, and began procurement from its inception to ensure that it was on programme. It was already working with a number of suppliers, 550 in all, by the time CompeteFor was launched in January 2008. Due to the scale and complexity of its procurements, the ODA has procured some of its contracts using established OGC frameworks to simplify the process, and a number are closed, for example, for security reasons.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/2">As of June 2009, 2,872 contract opportunities had been advertised on CompeteFor. These break down as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/3" class="indent">The ODA, its contractors, and buyers in their supply chains have advertised 2,335 opportunities</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/4" class="indent">LOCOG and its supply chain have advertised 88 opportunities</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/5" class="indent">Other partners, including the London Development Agency, and their supply chains have advertised 449 opportunities</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/6">It is anticipated that the ODA's and the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games' direct procurement will generate around 75,000 supply chain contracts. Contractors are encouraged to place as many as possible of their unallocated contract opportunities on CompeteFor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/7">It is estimated that for around 80 per cent. of these contracts, contractors will rely on their existing suppliers and sub-contractors leaving around 15,000, approximately 20 per cent., of opportunities to be placed on the system. The 20 per cent. figure is an estimate based on other large projects and the way in which contractors have decided to package and procure their sub-contracts. Given that the majority of these will be private procurements, we are unable to state precisely what proportion of these have been advertised on CompeteFor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/8">As expected, the vast majority of CompeteFor opportunities have been posted by the ODA's contractors and buyers in their supply chains, and the ODA continues to work with its contractors to ensure that as many as possible of their new opportunities are placed on the system. Some of the ODA's contractors are now also beginning to use CompeteFor for some of their 'non-Olympic' contract opportunities, opening up further opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/9">LOCOG is in the early stages of its procurement activity, and will start buying the majority of the goods and services required for staging the games from early 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.0/10">CompeteFor was established to help open up games-related opportunities to businesses across the UK and to provide a means of offering them any business support they need to win contracts. Our ambition is not only a legacy of businesses winning contracts but also one of businesses inspired to be fitter, more innovative and more competitive as a result. To date over 31,000 businesses have received business support as a result of registering on CompeteFor, and over 2,500 have received an intensive level of assistance.</p>

	<p pid="c.1863W.5/1">Lancashire is already benefiting from the London 2012 Games. 19 businesses in the county have won Games-related contracts and 115 Lancashire schools have registered for 'Get Set' the official 2012 education programme, enabling them to use a range of Games-related materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.1863W.5/2">Lancashire is also heavily involved in the region's cultural legacy programme WE PLAY. For example, Abandon Normal Devices is a festival of new cinema and digital culture and is a new regional partnership between Film, Art and Creative Technology (FACT) (Liverpool), Comerhouse (Manchester) and Folly (Lancashire) and is partly funded by Legacy Trust UK. Another example is New Cultural Journeys which is a major youth culture and sport programme for the Fylde Coast and Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="c.1863W.5/3">Lancashire, and the Northwest region as a whole, is playing an active part in maximising the benefits of the London 2012 Games. A key part of the region's plans are to ensure that all parts of the NW benefit and as such each sub region is represented on the NW Steering Group for the 2012 Games. This group feeds directly in to the Nations and Regions Group which is the joint Government Olympic Executive and London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games initiative aimed at deriving the maximum benefit from the Games for the whole of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1870W.2/4" class="indent">Research to examine local variations in the use of antisocial behaviour interventions.

	<p pid="c.1870W.2/5" class="indent">An evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of interventions to address anti-social behaviour. Results from this evaluation are due in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.1870W.2/6">Three independent reports have confirmed that our approach to tackling antisocial behaviour is working. The National Audit Office (NAO) reported that two thirds of people stop committing ASB after one intervention, rising to nine out of 10 after three interventions. Many of these were warning letters and antisocial behaviour contracts which are voluntary measures.</p>

	<p pid="c.1873W.8/1">The Home Office does not have a single crime prevention budget. Funding through the Local Area Agreements and support for Crime and Disorder Partnerships, including police funding, all contributes to locally agreed work to prevent crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.8/2">In addition to this, the Home Office funds projects and initiatives targeted at preventing crime through: offender-based interventions (to reduce recidivism); diversion and deterrence, especially around young people and those exposed to the problems of drug and alcohol misuse, antisocial behaviour, delinquency, chaotic families and poor parenting; support for victims, particularly victims of sexual or domestic violence (to reduce repeat victimisation and encourage the reporting of crime); improved local agency responses to antisocial behaviour and crime problems; and advice and practical measures of support for members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.8/3">Funding goes towards national initiatives, support for police and other crime-reduction partners in the development and use of new techniques, tools and powers, and grants for third sector organisations for the delivery of Home Office programmes or to support innovative approaches that contribute to crime reduction. In terms of national initiatives, programme and capital expenditure for 2009-10 has been planned for the following areas:</p>

	<p pid="c.1876W.2/1">The performance of the CRB remains good and in 2008-09 the CRB exceeded its targets for issuing 90 per cent. of all standard checks within 10 days and issued 88 per cent of all Enhanced checks in 28 days. In 2008-09, the CRB witnessed an unprecedented increase in demand for its service which caused a dip below the 90 per cent. target for processing Enhanced checks in 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.2/2">The disclosure process comprises broadly several stages involving the applicant, the registered body (RB) (the organisation that handles the application on behalf of an employer), the CRB and the police. Each stage is reliant on the accuracy of the data provided by the applicant and the subsequent verification of these data by the RB from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.2/3">A number of factors can cause delays, including the length of time it can take for an employer to deal with the initial application; the accurate completion of the application form; the clarity of the information provided; the existence of conviction or non-conviction information and the operational effectiveness of the Disclosure Units of the police forces involved in the enhanced disclosure process following recent high volumes of applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.2/4">The majority of applications spend between three and four days at the CRB and analysis undertaken by the Bureau has shown that the majority of delays that occur do so before the CRB receives an application and after it has been sent to the police.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.2/5">The CRB has set up an improvement plan with its delivery partners, including the police forces, to address the problems associated with delays. This is aimed at maintaining a balanced output of applications on the system while also reducing the number of cases that have been in process for more than five days. This work has started to show an improvement in turnaround times but the CRB will continue to monitor forces' performance in line with its own performance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.2/6">Where applications are returned to customers to acquire further information, reminders are issued but some customers can fail to provide this information or withdraw their application from the Bureau's systems where they no longer require their disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.2/7">The following table provides details of the longest time taken for the completion of a CRB standard and enhanced disclosure in each year since the inception of the Bureau. The figures have been calculated based on the date the disclosure was issued in each year, counting back from the date of completion.</p>

	<p pid="c.1878W.5/1">As part of 2008 drug strategy, we have expanded the 'street level up' (SLUA) initiative. The SLUA approach is a national, multi-agency project designed to make a sustained impact on the illicit drugs trade and drug related criminality, and harm it causes to people and communities. This approach builds on intelligence on street level dealers to identify and take out higher level dealers, thereby disrupting the entire supply chain. A number of police forces are involved in the second phase and the Serious Organised Crime Agency are working with forces to plan and support the local roll-out.</p>
	<p pid="c.1878W.5/2">As highlighted in the 2008 drug strategy 'Drugs: protecting families and communities', the Home Office and partners have put in place neighbourhood policing teams in every area of England and Wales to allow the police to respond more directly to any issues of concern identified by the community and to work in a more joined-up approach with local partners. Our next priority is to embed action to tackle drugs, where this is a local priority, within the neighbourhood policing and policing pledge approach to help the police and partners to be more responsive to community intelligence and concerns about drugs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1879W.2/2">This estimate is based on six categories of illicit drugs: cannabis, amphetamines, ecstasy, powder cocaine, crack cocaine and heroin.

The margin of error for these estimates are wide; &#163;3.5 billion to &#163;5.8 billion for England and Wales, and &#163;4.0 billion to &#163;6.6 billion for the UK. In terms of total street value, crack and heroin account for the largest shares of expenditure (respectively 28 per cent. and 23 per cent.); cannabis and powder cocaine make up 20 and 18 per cent. of expenditure, while amphetamines and ecstasy have a market shares of six and five per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1888W.0/1">In April this year law enforcement, government and academic experts from the G8 nations and others came together in a symposium hosted by the United States of America to discuss these issues raised; it included experts from the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). Their deliberations led to the issue on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-30">30 May 2009</phrase> of a G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Statement &quot;The risk to children posed by Child Pornography offenders&quot;. Among the many conclusions and recommendations was: an acceptance of a relationship between viewing and contact offending, although more work was required to determine the exact nature of that relationship; a recognition that based on conviction evidence a significant proportion of &quot;image&quot; offenders had committed some form of contact offence; and the exchange of child abuse images and communication between child sexual offenders legitimises and normalises their beliefs and behaviours providing a social context which encourages the further exploitation of children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1888W.0/2">The Home Office, CEOP and other relevant stakeholders from across Government will be exploring how the recommendations from the G8 ministerial statement can be taken forward in a UK context.</p>

Asset recovery investigations under the Proceeds of Crime Act's criminal confiscation, civil and tax recovery provisions cannot lead directly to prosecution.

	<p pid="c.1896W.3/2">It is in our national interest that Afghanistan becomes a stable and secure state able to deal with violent extremism within its borders and to prevent the export of terrorism abroad. We are fully committed to supporting a legitimate and democratic Afghan Government as they seek to build a peaceful and resilient nation, shaped by the will of the Afghan people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1896W.3/3">I recognise that individual reactions to UK foreign policies, such as military involvement overseas can be a factor in radicalisation, and that violent extremists exploit this when recruiting others to their cause. But we also know that radicalisation occurs for a wide range of complex and personal reasons. The aim of the Government will continue to be to prevent radicalisation at home and abroad.</p>
