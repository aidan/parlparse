All telephone exchanges except one in East Sussex are enabled for broadband and that one, Isfield, has a commercial wireless service installed. The wireless solution at Isfield was funded from a grant of &pound;50,000 from the South East of England Development Agency to the East Sussex county council to support wireless broadband community co-operatives. Apart from this, no direct funding has gone to East Sussex county council because we have successfully focused upon delivering a competitive marketplace to encourage the rollout of broadband.</p>

Catering for these events is procured in line with the EC's procurement rules and obtains value for money for the Department.

	<p pid="a.856W.2/1">Although the UK currently remains a net exporter of oil, it is likely we will become a net importer by around 2010. However, relying on imports need not be a problem in itself, although it does require us to take a longer-term strategic international approach to energy reliability. Oil is an internationally traded commodity and all countries, whether import-dependent or not, have a common interest in promoting open markets. Most other advanced industrial economies already import significant proportions of their oil needs without noticeable disruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.2/2">Notwithstanding this, however, the Government remain committed to maximising the economic recovery of the UK's own oil (and gas) reserves. The PILOT initiative&mdash;a joint programme involving the Government and the UK's oil and gas industry&mdash;is central to this aim. Moreover, the Government are already putting in place policies that will help ease the UK economy away from power supplied primarily through fossil fuel supply, by increasing energy efficiency and developing alternative technologies. Information on these policies can be found in the Energy White Paper 2003 Our energy future&mdash;creating a low carbon economy&quot; (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/index.shtml">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/index.shtml</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.2/3">In parallel, the Government have put in place a number of measures to improve the average fuel efficiency of vehicles, as set out in the July 2002 Powering Future Vehicles Strategy. These include fiscal incentives, such as the graduated, CO <sub>2</sub> based Vehicle Excise Duty and Company Car Tax schemes. The Government are also promoting the use of renewable transport fuels, such as biofuels, by means of fuel duty incentives. Sales of biofuels have increased rapidly during 2005, and currently stand at some 10 million litres a month, a five-fold increase over sales in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.865W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has been contributing to this process. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.</p>

Where the EU and NATO engage in dialogue which helps develop their strategic partnership&mdash;for example in the regular meetings between the Political and Security Committee and the North Atlantic Council&mdash;the EU Foreign Minister would present the EU policies, which we would have agreed to. This mirrors the current arrangement where the presidency presents agreed positions. The UK would, of course, be represented in both its UK and EU seats.</p>

It also proposed other adjustments to the own resources decision so as to reduce the net contributions to the community budget of Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The combined effect of these changes would have meant that over the 2007 to 2013 period, the UK net contribution to the Community Budget i.e. the UK's gross contribution less the abatement and UK public and private-sector receipts would have been approximately &euro;25 billion higher than it would have been if the current own resources system continued unchanged.</p>

These include simplifying and reducing the volume of legislation and using impact assessment for significant Council and Parliament amendments. Improving the regulatory environment in Europe and reducing the burden of regulation on business will make a real contribution to increasing European competitiveness.

	<p pid="a.882W.0/1">The Government have been closely monitoring the situation regarding ATM charges and will continue to do so. This includes monitoring the effectiveness of LINK rules on signage and regular discussion of relevant issues with LINK and other interested parties. The Office of Fair Trading's Payment Systems Task Force, established to address competition problems in payment systems, is about to start work on LINK Access and Governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.882W.0/2">We believe it is important that people are able to obtain cash free of charge. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of surcharging ATMs in the UK. However, statistics on the number of withdrawals at these ATMs indicate that most are to be found in locations where there are only a low number of transactions and where interchange fees would therefore be insufficient to cover the operating costs of the ATM, were it to offer free withdrawals. The Government believes that direct regulation of retail prices should only be a last resort, implemented where it has been very clearly established that competition is not feasible, or where a monopoly supplier would be the most efficient option.</p>
	<p pid="a.882W.0/3">Overall, relatively few withdrawals are made at charging machines. Over 96 per cent. of withdrawals are free of charge to consumers and there are over 30,000 free ATMs in the UK. The number of free ATMs is still increasing and the Government does not see any reason to believe that free ATMs are under threat. There are also alternative ways to obtain free access to cash. Many of the major banks now offer their customers free over-the-counter withdrawals at the Post Office and 'Cash Back' is widely available in supermarkets and shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.882W.0/4">The Government have responded to the Treasury Select Committee's recent report on cash machine charges (Treasury Committee's Fifth Report of Session 2004&ndash;05) and the Treasury Committee is expected to publish the response shortly, once it has been re-appointed following the general election. The Government's response to the Treasury Select Committees' report sets out policy on the issue in more detail.</p>

No local authority will be obliged to check Identity Cards as part of their business, however some may choose to do so to in order to benefit from more efficient processes and a estimated reduction in fraud as a result of using the Identity Card Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.906W.11/1">The Home Office has been working to identify areas where the identity cards scheme could provide business benefits. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the identity cards scheme. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the identity cards scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.907W.2/1">Reviews of current research and surveys conducted with companies involved in card technology has indicated the feasibility of an ID card that lasts for 10 years. This has been reflected in other identity cards schemes, Hong Kong for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.2/2">As the planned validity period of the identity card issued to UK nationals is 10 years, requests for replacement cards in advance of their expiry date are likely to arise from lost, stolen, damaged or faulty cards. Estimates have been made of the likely rates of failure, damage and loss (including theft) based on industry benchmarks and experience from other government departments, however due to reasons of commercial sensitivity, it is not appropriate to release these figures as it would hinder the Department's ability to achieve value for money in the forthcoming procurement phase.</p>

	<p pid="a.907W.5/2">The Identity Cards Bill contains, at Clause 41(1), the usual provision which ensures that any secondary legislation can contain different provision for different cases and that any exemptions and exceptions as are necessary are made. This inbuilt flexibility will allow for any special policies, practices or procedures which will have to be adopted to cater for the wide variety of special needs people with disabilities have.</p>

In addition, Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) that were introduced under Section one of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and first used in 1999 can also be used to prohibit certain people from entering specific areas or premises. ASBOs however have a two year minimum period and can contain various prohibitions. We are therefore introducing Drinking Banning Orders (DBOs) under the Violent Crime Reduction Bill that we introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June 2005</phrase>. The Bill received its Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-20">20 June 2005</phrase>. A DBO has an effect for a period not less than two months and not more than two years and would be more appropriate where binge drinking and alcohol fuelled behaviour needs to be addressed and discouraged and where there is a need for more flexible time limits to apply to a ban.</p>

The EU has decided that fingerprints should be included in passports issued by member states in the Schengen area, within three years of agreement on the technical specification. The UK is currently excluded from this requirement but there would be disadvantages for British passport holders if UK passports were issued to a lower standard than those of other EU member states. The UK is currently challenging its exclusion, and in parallel is considering whether to mirror the EU requirement. A statement will be made when final decisions have been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.2/1">The Passport Service's Authentication by Interview (AbI) scheme is intended both to deter and to detect fraudulent applications among adult first time applicants but its business case has been constructed on its potential deterrent effect, for which evidence exists. UKPS data sampling has identified the first time adult channel as accounting for 74 per cent. of all fraudulent applications, although this group accounts for less than 10 per cent. of all applications processed annually by the Agency. AbI closes the loophole that currently exists in the postal application system by bringing together the physical applicant, and current biographical information, to ensure they are one and the same. A fraudster will now be faced with having to act out their false identity, and risk a real possibility of detection. There have been a number of instances in the past where the requirement to attend for interview would have enabled UKPS to identify a fraudulent application and prevent the issue of a passport in a false identity. The estimated cost of the scheme in its year of introduction is aggregated within the total estimated unit cost of &pound;67.93 for 2006&ndash;07, published within the UKPS Corporate and Business Plan. The benefit the scheme is designed to deliver is in deterring fraudulent passport applications and thus contributing to the overall fight against identity fraud and reducing numbers of such frauds with consequent benefits to the individual and to the UK public and private sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.5/1">The introduction of interviews is one of a range of initiatives the UK Passport Service is taking forward to reduce passport fraud through improved detection and prevention, as indicated in its 2005&ndash;10 Corporate and Business Plan. The Passport Service's programme of work which has been informed by, and is closely related to the recommendations of the Cabinet Office study on identity fraud published in 2002, includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.5/2" class="indent">Increasing data-sharing with public and private sector organisations;</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.5/3" class="indent">Improving systems and staff training in identity authentication, and increasing the professionalism of its fraud investigation capability;</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.5/4" class="indent">Improving the security of the passport book, through the introduction of biometric chip enabled passports from 2006;</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.5/5" class="indent">Using facial recognition technology to detect fraudulent applications;</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.5/6" class="indent">Use of its new Omnibase, and Lost/Stolen/Recovered global passport databases to detect and prevent fraud;</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.5/7" class="indent">Working with law enforcement agencies to apprehend, disrupt and dismantle the activities of those involved in identity fraud; and</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.5/8" class="indent">Supporting the work of the Home Office's Identity Fraud Steering Committee in promoting closer public/private sector collaboration in combating identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.5/9">The planned interviews will be conducted after improved checking of the information provided by applicants, including database checks. The interview will then enable genuine applicants to demonstrate their knowledge of the identity claimed but will face fraudulent applicants with the likelihood of detection. The interview will have an important deterrent effect, and will close off loopholes associated with illegal immigration where the applicant is often not in the UK and would be unable to answer questions related to residence in the UK. Only a procedure that includes an interview will enable the UKPS to confirm that the intended passport holder is the rightful owner of the identity claimed and to close the loophole that is inevitable when applications can be submitted by post.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.3/1">The latest information on staff vacancies for each public sector prison establishment relates to staff in post at <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-31">31 May</phrase> and is calculated by comparing the operational staffing requirements as at <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. This snapshot is contained in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.3/2">Information on required staffing levels within prisons managed by the private sector is not collected centrally in this form and is therefore not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.3/3">Overall, Officer recruitment continues at a high level compared with previous years and the Service-wide shortfall among operational staff is well within an acceptable operating margin. To cover any vacancies in the short-term, certain establishments are allowing officers to work additional hours as part of the 'Contracted Supplementary Hours Scheme'. This scheme contributed the equivalent of 412 full-time officers at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. At that time the total operational staff availability was 25,858 compared to an operational staffing requirement of 26,087, resulting in a Service-wide shortfall of just 0.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.3/4">Staffing levels in non-operational roles are more fluid and vacancy figures require qualification. This is in part due to the number of reviews taking place across the Prison Service and on-going work to introduce greater efficiencies which has led to decisions to leave posts unfilled.</p>

There were an estimated 154 prisoners with a sentence length of three months to less than four years whose home detention curfew (HDC) eligibility date was <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-24">24 June 2005</phrase>. On that date, 46 prisoners were released on HDC. Information on the number of prisoners discharged by other means on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-24">24 June 2005</phrase> is not yet available. The number of prisoners with a sentence length of three months to less than four years will include some prisoners who are not eligible for HDC because of the nature of their current or previous offences. The figures also exclude a small number of prisoners in the population who are on remand at the end of the previous month, but are subsequently sentenced to a custodial sentence suitable for HDC and whose HDC eligibility date falls on that date. This occurs when they have spent a significant time on remand.</p>

	<p pid="a.936W.5/1">The information requested with respect to apparent natural causes deaths in prisons in England and Wales is provided in the following table. Prisons, together with their local healthcare partners, assess the healthcare needs of their populations, whatever their age, and develop services to meet those needs. The National Offender Management Service, Prison Service and Department of Health are working closely together to improve health care provision for prisoners. Key achievements include developing better mental health provision, including NHS-funded in-reach teams; supporting improvements in primary care services; developing the prison health workforce and improving the prison health estate. NHS primary care trusts started to assume responsibility for the commissioning of prison health services in public prisons in England in April 2004. This process is expected to be completed by April 2006. All deaths in custody are subject to a coroner's inquest and (since April 2004) an investigation by the prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO). The PPO's recommendations are considered carefully and the reports are analysed to identify common trends, issues that need to be addressed and good practice examples that can be disseminated.</p>

As part of this process we are evaluating, in three pilot areas, the use of a summary as an alternative to providing a full verbatim transcript of the video-recorded interview. The independent evaluation report of the pilot is due to be delivered at the end of August and this will inform the development of implementation plans for extending the availability of video-recorded evidence in chief. We will also consult the criminal justice agencies concerned before determining an implementation date. The implementation plan will incorporate a suitable period of notice to enable these agencies to prepare.</p>

For veterinary medicines a certain amount of animal testing is required by Directive 2001/82/EC in order to demonstrate efficacy as well as human, animal and environmental safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.0/3">Provision of animal test data is not optional but if sufficient information were available on a chemical through its historical use, through human exposure data, or from alternative non-animal testing methods, then expert judgment would be used by Regulatory Authorities to avoid unnecessary further testing on animals. Regulatory Authorities are fully cognisant of the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes and will not require unnecessary testing on animals. They welcome any proposals for non-animal testing that provide equivalent assurance of safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.951W.6/1">No additional action is proposed. Imports of beef from third countries including the USA, are subject to European Community rules. Each consignment has to come from an approved slaughterhouse or cutting plant and it must be accompanied by animal and public health certification signed by an official veterinarian.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.6/2">The health certification has to confirm that the meat does not contain, and is not derived from, specified risk material (SRM). SRM are those parts of the animal that could potentially harbour BSE.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.6/3">On arrival in the EU, each consignment is subjected to documentary and identity checks to ensure that import conditions have been met. At least 20 per cent. of consignments are also subject to physical checks.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.6/4">In recent years the UK has imported little beef from the USA. This is because of unrelated EU controls, which ban meat from cattle that have been given growth-promoting hormones (routinely used in America).

	<p pid="a.952W.2/2">The use of meat and bone meal, tallow and slurry in energy generation is permitted under the animal by-products regulation and the Government are keen to encourage the use of these valuable energy sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/3">The renewables obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to source at least part of their electricity from renewable generation. The use of meat and bone meal and the anaerobic digestion of slurry for the generation of electricity are eligible sources of renewable energy. Detailed guidance on the anaerobic digestion of slurry has been provided to industry. The Biomass Study Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, is looking at the barriers to developing biomass energy, including the use of slurry, and will recommend ways to overcome the problems. We will consider the way forward in the light of their recommendations. The Government are also looking at the scope for supporting renewable heat.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/4">We are liaising effectively with industry, the European Commission and other member states to ensure that the negotiations on an implementing measure for the animal by-products regulation will result in rules on the use of tallow for biodiesel which are proportionate, practical, and provide the industry with the maximum amount of flexibility. The production of biodiesel, including that produced from tallow, is supported by the 20 pence per litre reduction in duty compared to fossil fuels. The Government are carrying out a feasibility study on a renewable transport fuel obligation. If adopted, this would require a specified proportion of the total fuel supply to be from biofuels.</p>

	<p pid="a.953W.5/1">The Government issued a consultation paper on the Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2005 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-09">9 December 2004</phrase>. Chapter 8 of this paper considered whether there should be a voluntary or statutory producer responsibility scheme for the collection and recovery of waste non-packaging farm plastics. Packaging plastics are already covered by the packaging regulations, but it is envisaged that any scheme would collect both packaging and non-packaging plastic waste. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March 2005</phrase> and we are currently considering the responses to decide upon the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.5/2">In order to help prepare for a producer responsibility scheme, I have allocated &pound;1 million of Business Resource Energy and Waste (BREW) funds and my officials are currently discussing with the Agricultural Waste Stakeholders Forum (AWSF) how this money should best be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.5/3">The Local Government Association sit on the AWSF, and have also met with officials on the subject of farm plastics.</p>

	<p pid="a.956W.0/1">Neasden Goods Depot falls within an Air Quality Management Area declared by the London borough of Brent. Defra has provided supplementary credit approval to the London borough of Brent to help fund a detailed assessment of air pollution in the vicinity of the depot. This assessment has identified elevated levels of particulate matter (PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> ) in the vicinity of the goods depot. This appears to be caused mainly by waste management operations, regulated by the Environment Agency, located at the depot.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/2">The Environment Agency has been taking action to improve the standard of operations at Neasden Goods Depot, more recently in conjunction with the London borough of Brent.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/3">There are four sites at Neasden Goods Yard, three Waste Management Licences (WML) and one End of Life Vehicles (ELV) licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/4">To date the Environment Agency has:</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/5" class="indent">undertaken unannounced weekly inspections to all three sites holding a WML. During these, areas requiring attention to site infrastructure and operations are identified and improvements required;</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/6" class="indent">issued warning letters when necessary;</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/7" class="indent">served legal enforcement notices that have demanded specific actions be undertaken;</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/8" class="indent">served legal enforcement notices that have suspended operations when appropriate; and</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/9" class="indent">carried out comprehensive enforcement action against the site we believe to be the worst performing of the three that is contributing significantly to the pollution of the local environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/10">The above actions have resulted in a number of improvements being made:</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/11" class="indent">buildings are now constructed to contain the majority of waste handling operations at the three sites;</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/12" class="indent">large areas of concrete hard standing has been laid (where previously, significant areas of the goods yard were mud and hardcore) at all four sites as well as the communal haul road;</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/13" class="indent">improved drainage has been installed;</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/14" class="indent">dust suppression systems have been installed, used and maintained; and,</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/15" class="indent">daily road sweeping of service yard and section of public highway.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/16">The Environment Agency has recently commissioned independent environmental consultants to undertake a dust-monitoring programme. The monitoring&mdash;planned from July to September 2005&mdash;will clarify the contribution that the licensed sites make to PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> levels in the locality. This dust survey compliments that which the local authority has already put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/17">In addition the London borough of Brent has improved the pavement infrastructure on the highway near the goods depot and is regularly washing the road to reduce emissions of PM caused by road traffic.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/18">The Environment Agency continues its dialogue with all four operators, landlord and London borough of Brent. The result is a series of improvements have been delivered and further works is planned to tackle dust emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.0/19">London borough of Brent is continuing to monitor air pollution levels in the vicinity of Neasden Goods Depot to assess the results of the emissions control measures. Monitoring data are published on the world wide web at <a href="http://www.londonair.org.uk">www.londonair.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.957W.5/1">Defra publishes forecasts of high air pollution when it estimates that concentrations of specific air pollutants are likely to exceed guideline values. Similarly to weather forecasts, there is an element of uncertainty and expert judgement attached to air pollution forecasts.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.5/2">Warnings use a health-based index system, which has been developed by the Department of Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP). A COMEAP statement on the guideline values is available at <a href="http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol9.htm">http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol9.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.5/3">The thresholds for the guideline values are: nitrogen dioxide, 573 microgrammes per metre cubed, as an hourly average; sulphur dioxide, 532 microgrammes per metre cubed, as a 15 minute average; ozone, 180 microgrammes per metre cubed, as an hourly average and running eight hour average; particulate matter (PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> ), 75 microgrammes per metre cubed, as a 24 hour running average (measured byTEOM); and carbon monoxide, 17.4 microgrammes per metre cubed, measured as a running eight hour average.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.5/4">A summary of the index and the associated concentration levels and severity of health impacts is available at: <a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/standards.php">http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/standards.php</a>tfband</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.5/5">Defra warns of high air pollution through the air quality information archive at <a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk">www.airquality.co.uk</a>, Teletext, page 169 and the freephone service 0800 556677. On occasions when a notable air pollution episode is forecast, such as the first photochemical smog in any year, Defra may supplement these forecasts with a news release.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.5/6">Defra last published a warning of high air pollution on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-22">22 June 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.957W.5/7">It is accepted that both short term and long term exposure to air pollutants damages health.

The appointment of a quarantine veterinary surgeon (QVS) is approved by Defra, based on an assessment and recommendation of a local Veterinary Officer of the SVS. Assessment is focused on rabies diagnosis, welfare and security of the kennels rather than other diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.960W.11/3">It is the responsibility of all veterinary surgeons to ensure that their own continuing professional development encompasses all they might encounter in day-to-day work. For QVSs who attend the quarantine premises six days each week, this would include tropical diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.960W.11/4">Defra promotes awareness of any exotic disease through their passive surveillance programme DACTARI. This enables veterinary surgeons to report all travel-associated disease to the Department.

	<p pid="a.971W.6/1">Some 24.3 million patients in England were registered with a national health service dentist in May 2005, compared with 26.4 million in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.6/2">However, courses of dental treatment have increased by 6 per cent. from 31.3 million in 1997&ndash;98 to 33 million in 2004&ndash;05. This is a result of both the establishment of 53 dental access centres and the availability of dental access sessions offering NHS dentistry to patients who are not registered.</p>

	<p pid="a.978W.11/60">1. Finished in-year admissions:</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/61">A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/62">2. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis):</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/63">The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/64">3. Main operation:</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/65">The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, for example, time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/66">4. Ungrossed data:</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/67">Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is, the data are ungrossed.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/68">5. Time waited (days):</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.11/69">Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid="a.983W.0/1">The latest information available on electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) is that contained in the Department's publication Statistical Bulletin Electro Convulsive Therapy: Survey covering the period from January 2002 to March 2002, England. This was a follow-up to an earlier survey of the period January to March 1999. Both surveys were undertaken to provide data on ECT that are not currently available elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.0/2">The 2002 survey confirmed the continuing downward trend in the number of administrations of ECT. It collected information from national health service and independent sector care settings, including nursing homes, on the total number of administrations of ECT in NHS and independent sector care settings including data on sex, age, ethnicity, legal status and method of consent. It found that in the period January to March 2002:</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.0/3" class="indent">4.6 people per 100,000 of the population underwent ECT, compared with 5.8 in the 1999 survey period.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.0/4" class="indent">The prevalence rates for both men and women were lower in 2002 than in 1999. In 2002 2.8 per 100,000 men received treatment compared to 3.8 per 100,000 in 1999; additionally, 6.4 per 100,000 women were treated in the 2002 survey period, compared to 7.7 in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.0/5" class="indent">The incidence of the use of ECT was shown to rise with age in both of the survey periods. Overall, 13.5 per 100,000 population aged 65 and over underwent ECT in 2002; this compares to a prevalence rate of 5.6 in 45 to 64 year olds, 3.6 for 45 to 44 year olds and only 1.2 for 19 to 24 year olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.0/6" class="indent">In 1999, the statistics show a similar pattern with 15.1 per 100,000 population aged 65 and over undergoing ECT; this dropped to 8.0 per 100,000 in those aged 45 to 64, to 4.6 in those aged 25 to 44 and again to 1.5 in those aged 16 to 24.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.0/7">Copies of the 2002 (ISBN: 1 84182 709 6) and 1999 (IBSN: 1 84182 089 X) surveys are available in the Library and on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Statistics/StatisticalWorkAreas/StatisticalHealthCare/StatisticalHealthCareArticle/fs/en">www.dh. gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Statistics/Statistical WorkAreas/StatisticalHealthCare/StatisticalHealthCa reArticle/fs/en</a>?CONTENT_ID=4086494&amp;chk=QFb R7a.</p>

	<p pid="a.993W.9/1">International aviation is already subject to a well-developed and closely monitored regulatory regime established by the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention). Under the Convention the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) establishes detailed standards and recommended practices for the airworthiness of aircraft, the operational standards of airlines, and many other aspects of aviation. These standards and recommended practices relate primarily to safety and security issues, and cover safety issues relating to the carriage of munitions and other dangerous goods. In addition the Convention itself provides that weapons and munitions of war may only be carried through the airspace of a state with the permission of that state.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.9/2">To ensure that these standards are properly implemented, ICAO has established the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme under which the regulatory regime of each Contracting State is audited at regular intervals, and the results made available to all other States. Where deficiencies are identified, the State concerned is required to draw up an Action Plan agreed with ICAO, and ICAO subsequently assesses the implementation of the Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.9/3">Within Europe there is already a regulatory regime on aviation insurance, with the relevant national authority required to ensure that airlines/carriers have sufficient insurance cover, and in line with EU law and our bilateral agreements with third countries we require foreign aircraft visiting the UK to demonstrate evidence of adequate cover. Further rules on insurance would impose an additional regulatory burden in already well-regulated States but might not be adequately implemented or enforced in countries with less stringent governance.</p>

	<p pid="a.999W.2/1">The main steps are summarised in the Government's 2002 Powering Future Vehicles Strategy. The progress we have made in encouraging people to choose more fuel efficient vehicles is described in the first two annual reports on the delivery of the strategy. All of these documents are available via the Department for Transport's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/2">In 2001 we introduced a graduated vehicle excise duty system which rewards those who choose the most fuel-efficient vehicles. In 2002, we introduced a revised company car tax scheme, under which those who choose the most fuel efficient vehicles can save up to several thousand pounds a year. These changes have reinforced the actions of the motor industry to deliver fuel efficiency improvements under their voluntary agreements with the European Commission, improving the average fuel efficiency of new cars sold in the UK by some 10 per cent. over the last decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/3">We have also this year launched a colour-coded fuel efficiency label which will be displayed on new vehicles in nearly all UK car showrooms by the end of the summer. This will highlight the savings that motorists can make by choosing more fuel efficient vehicles. We are also considering, subject to the necessary state aid approval from the European Commission, the introduction of a purchase grant scheme which will reward those who choose the very cleanest and most fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002W.2/1">Discussions were first held in January when the Secretary of State for International Development visited Sri Lanka to make an initial assessment of the situation and the impact of our emergency assistance. I visited Sri Lanka from 15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">17 June</phrase> to review progress and to consider how best we may maintain support. During my visit I held discussions with the Finance Secretary, the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, the President's spokesperson for Relief, Reconstruction and Reconciliation, the Heads of the Government's Task Forces for Relief and Reconstruction, and local government representatives. I also met officials leading the peace process. I discussed progress with other donors, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and met some of the communities devastated by the tsunami.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.2/2">International organisations and NGOs have mobilised sufficient resources to meet all identified relief and reconstruction needs. The immediate relief effort was successful and recovery work has now started. There has been good progress: some 30,000 transitional homes have been constructed for families who lost their homes; contracts have been signed to rebuild 176 of the 182 schools damaged and funds promised for the balance. Some 95 per cent. of the children affected by the tsunami are now back at school. Hospital reconstruction is also underway and fully financed. Roads, railways and power supplies (where these existed) have been restored.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.2/3">Much remains to be done however. Increased effort is required to restore livelihoods. In addition the Government ban on rebuilding within a buffer zone stretching 100 to 200 metres from the sea is causing problems in some districts because of the scarcity of suitable alternative land. Furthermore the immense size of the reconstruction task is stretching the capacity of central and local government to manage and coordinate the reconstruction effort. Inevitably this contributes to bureaucratic delay in some instances and assistance reaching some communities sooner than others. The Government and LTTE agreement to establish a post-tsunami operational management structure should help ensure that communities in the north-east are better able to access external support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.2/4">The Government have commissioned an inquiry into the buffer zone regulation and has indicated that it may consider flexible implementation where appropriate. The Government also assures me that they will take the necessary steps to reduce delays in implementing reconstruction plans. I confirmed that Her Majesty's Government stands ready to provide support as needed. DFID staff in Sri Lanka are discussing options with Government and partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.1004W.2/1">The EU sugar regime is an anachronism and must be reformed. It supports EU growers and processors with expensive subsidies, to the disadvantage of efficient developing country exporters. The EU is one of the highest cost producers in the world, yet it is also the second largest exporter, thanks to these subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.2/2">The existing system leads many African Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) country producers to export raw sugar to the EU even when it is not profitable to do so, meaning that scarce government resources are often diverted to maintain a sugar industry. It also forces the EU to dump approximately five million tonnes of heavily subsidised sugar on the world market each year. This keeps the world price low, making it difficult for developing country producers to sell in their own markets locally, as well as making it harder for them to export. Reform should create an environment where growers make their decisions on the basis of their own competitiveness, not on how much money they will be paid in subsidies, and enable Least Developed Countries (LDC)s to benefit in a sustainable manner from the duty-free and quota-free access to Europe that they will receive for sugar by 2009 under the Everything But Arms initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.2/3">We are aware, however, that reform will have serious ramifications for some of the 18 African Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries that receive preferential access to the European market. These countries will face a price cut of up to 39 per cent. for their sugar exports to Europe. Some of them export only a relatively small proportion of their sugar crop to Europe, but others are heavily dependent on the European market. In Guyana, for example, sugar production makes up 18 per cent. of GDP, most of which is exported to Europe. We believe that reform could cost the ACP up to &euro;500 million per year in lost revenues and lost foreign exchange. This is why we have placed such an emphasis on the transitional assistance measures that are an integral part of the overall reform. The UK has been pushing for timely and adequate assistance to be made available, and we have been working with the ACP to help them to develop the country plans through which assistance will be delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.2/4">DFID funded a workshop in Trinidad in March involving the European Commission and the Caribbean Sugar Protocol countries to begin this process, and we will also be providing some &pound;200,000, with similar levels of joint funding from the European Commission, to help produce these country plans in the Caribbean. The Commission anticipates that the plans will provide for a combination of trade and aid measures to improve productivity in the sugar sector, to assist diversification into other sectors and to respond to the broader impacts of adjustment (such as on social services and macro-economic stability), with the balance between these varying country by country. We will continue to work with the ACP and the Commission to make transitional assistance available in good time and as, effective as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005W.5/3">Elsewhere, high value fruit and vegetable exports continue to expand, providing export earnings and much needed employment. This is especially evident in sub-Saharan Africa, where the annual value of horticulture exports now exceeds $2 billion with particularly strong growth in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Ghana. Small-scale production is playing a major part in this; in Kenya small-scale farmers produce 75 per cent. of fresh produce exports to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.5/4">We are supporting research through our contribution to the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre (currently &pound;300,000 in core funding) and our bilateral research programme is assisting the development of smallholder horticulture in Eastern and Southern Africa. We have also successfully persuaded the Science Council of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) to include horticulture within its research priorities for 2005&ndash;15.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.5/5">We are also focusing on the challenges which increasingly stringent product standards (often set by the retail trade itself) present to developing country producers, particularly smallholders, seeking access to valuable European markets. We have recently begun a three-year programme working with retailers, importers, standard-setting bodies (in particular the Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group&mdash;Good Agricultural Practices (EUREPGAP) and producers, aimed at ensuring that standards and other procurement practices do not discriminate against small-scale producers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.5/6">We are also active in a number of countries. For example in Kenya, through a programme to promote the development of business services in horticulture, DFID has supported export horticultural development to the tune of &pound;582,000 in the last two years. An additional &pound;290,000 will be spent by June 2006. Much of these funds are spent assisting smallholders to cope with the process and cost of compliance with EUREPGAP standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1006W.2/16">In addition, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has continued expenditure in Iraq under its &pound;30 million programme of quick impact projects (of which about &pound;27 million has been spent since April 2003); and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has made disbursements under the joint FCO/MoD/DFID financed Global Conflict Prevention Pool for Iraq (on which over &pound;23 million has been spent since April 2003). Monthly breakdowns of this spending are not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.5/1">The Further Education (FE) funding system is different to schools. Funding is paid for learning aims as well as an entitlement per 16&ndash;18 payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.5/2">Under the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC's) funding formula the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels in a sixth form college and an FE college to a student in the 2004/05 academic year was &pound;3,045. This figure comprises &pound;766 for the delivery of each A-level learning aim, and &pound;747 for each student for the entitlement element of their learning programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.5/3">Under the LSC's funding formula the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels to a student at an English maintained secondary school was &pound;3,212. This figure comprises &pound;785 for the delivery of each A-level learning aim, &pound;750 for each student for the entitlement element of their learning programme, and &pound;107 for each student to meet additional employers' contributions to teachers' pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.5/4">These figures do not represent all funding that colleges and school sixth forms receive and are not directly comparable. For example the FE funding rates include consolidated funds for pay and staff training that are not reflected in the school sixth form rates. Also, in each case additional funding may also be available to take account of the higher costs of delivering learning in particular geographical areas, in higher cost subjects, or to students with particular disadvantages or individual needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1017W.8/2">It is for local authorities themselves to decide how best to meet the needs of pupils in their area who, for reasons of illness, exclusion or otherwise, are unable to attend mainstream schools. However, guidance issued to local authorities and schools in January 2005 about pupil referral units (PRUs) and alternative provision emphasised existing advice that education for this group of pupils must be of high standard and appropriate to their particular needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.8/3">Local authorities use PRUs and a wide range of other educational provision to ensure this duty is adequately discharged. In 1997 there were 309 PRUs in England catering for 7,530 pupils compared to around 450 now catering for 14,470.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.8/4">The Oxfordshire education authority's PRU and Integration Service (PRUIS) provides or arranges alternative educational provision for around 250 pupils, including pupils in West Oxfordshire, this academic year. Admissions to Oxfordshire PRUIS, including from West Oxfordshire, are handled by a committee which meets every six weeks. The time taken from a referral for a place at PRUIS depends on the particular needs of the individual pupil. However, the education for pupils who have been permanently excluded is usually arranged and implemented from the 16 day of exclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1024W.0/1">This Government were the first to introduce statutory support for students studying on a part-time basis. From 2001 support for English part-time students was in the form of an income-assessed loan of &pound;500 per annum; a fee waiver system was also available to students in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.0/2">In 2004/05 a new package of statutory support was introduced comprising a non-repayable fee grant of up to &pound;575 and a non-repayable course grant of up to &pound;250. The grants are means-tested in order to target funding most effectively at those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.0/3">For the academic year 2005/06 the maximum fee grant is being increased to &pound;885. And we are improving the fee grant by linking the amount available to the intensity at which the student is studying.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.0/4">We will continue to monitor the sector to ensure that we use available funding in the most effective way to support those part-time students who most need it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1025W.5/1">We do expect the Brunel HSBC Education Trust Academy to increase post 16 participation rates in Hillingdon. It will be in a strong position to do this through its location on a university campus with access to Brunel University's facilities and expertise. It will also provide enrichment and placement opportunities for other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1025W.5/2">Data from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) shows that four of the six west London boroughs (Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hillingdon and Hounslow) have post-16 participation rates below the national average with participation rates in Hillingdon as low as 73 per cent. (2003). A particular issue in west London is the relatively low participation rate of white students (67 per cent.), particularly boys. This variation is also reflected in Higher Education participation rates where 30 ward areas within the six boroughs have been identified as having low participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1025W.5/3">The Academy aims to attract students who might not otherwise have remained in education at age 16. The curriculum to be offered by the Academy will principally cover education at levels 2 and 3. The sponsors expect about 50 per cent. of the intake to progress from level 1 to 2 and 50 per cent. to progress from level 2 to 3. They recognise that some students will require additional support before commencing level 3 courses in the Academy's specialisms of science, technology, maths and Chinese. There will be extensive discussions with education professionals and local providers to ensure that a suitable curriculum, which complements existing provision, is available for the students.</p>
