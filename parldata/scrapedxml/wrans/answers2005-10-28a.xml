Minutes of the meetings will be published on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/6">(2) Develop comprehensive, accepted risk assessment procedures to assess risks posed by non-native species and identify and prioritise prevention action.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/7">A research contract to develop a comprehensive risk assessment methodology was completed in February of this year. The scheme is based upon the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) pest risk assessment scheme used for plant quarantine purposes, adapted to be applicable to all taxonomic groups. It has been designed to generate an assessment of risk based on a three point scale of high, medium and low risk. A joint programme of peer review and further testing is being agreed between Defra and the Scottish Executive and will begin shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/8">(3) Develop codes of conduct to help prevent introductions for all relevant sectors in a participative fashion involving all relevant stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/9">The first code of practice, for the horticultural sector, was launched by Ben Bradshaw in March 2003. It is published in full on the Defra website, and has been summarised in a leaflet. This code should form a template for other codes&mdash;one for each vector of introduction. The programme board has suggested that a code for the pet trade should be the next to be developed in close association with the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/10">The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill, currently before Parliament, includes a provision to give the Secretary of State the power to issue or approve codes of practice in connection with non-native species. These codes will not be statutory, but may be used as evidence in any court proceedings and may be taken into account by the court when sentencing. A similar power has already been introduced within Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/11">(4) Develop a targeted education and awareness strategy involving all relevant sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/12">The programme board will establish working groups to take forward the review recommendations, and to fulfil our international obligations. It has suggested that an education and public awareness group should be established immediately. Membership of working groups will be drawn from Government and its agencies, the academic and professional sectors and non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/13">(5) Revise and update existing legislation to improve handling of invasive non-native species issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/14">A consultation on part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the principal piece of legislation which protects our native wildlife, was carried out in England and Wales last winter. This raised a number of issues associated with the legislative controls on non-native species, and we are taking forward two of these in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill. In addition to the power to issue or approve codes of practice, mentioned above, the Bill contains a power for the Secretary of State to ban the sale of certain non-native species, to be listed by order. There are no species proposed at this stage; any proposals will be the subject of full consultation in due course. We will develop a coherent package of further proposals for future consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/15">(6) Establish adequate monitoring and surveillance arrangements for non-native species in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/16">A national audit of non-native species has been carried out within Scotland and England, and this will form the basis of a research project to be let shortly to carry out an audit of current monitoring activity in Great Britain in relation to non-native species. This will identify where the most significant gaps lie in existing capacity, and what improvements can be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/17">(7) Establish policies with respect to management and control of invasive non-native species currently present or newly arrived in the wild, and develop operational capacity to implement these policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/18">It is not possible to take action against all of the non-native species currently present in the wild. A sound risk assessment process will provide the scientific basis for decisions about priorities for management and control of individual species.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/19">(8) Stakeholders should be fully consulted and engaged in development of invasive non-native species policies and actions through a mechanism such as a consultative forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/20">The holding of a regular forum, to which all relevant stakeholders are invited, is a valuable way to ensure a wider understanding and ownership of the issues. Two annual events have been held to date, and a further forum is scheduled to take place next spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.566W.0/1">The Government's 1998 White Paper, &quot;Smoking Kills&quot;, made clear that second-hand smoke, also known as passive smoking, was harmful to asthma sufferers and that they were more prone to attacks because of breathing in other people's smoke. We have in place a comprehensive strategy to tackle smoking and reduce the illness and death caused by smoking.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.0/2">As part of our strategy, we have boosted our tobacco education media campaign, and from 2003, we have run campaigns raising awareness of the health risks of second-hand smoke. Our &quot;Smoking Near Children&quot; campaign was the first to raise the general public's awareness of the health risks to children of second-hand smoke.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.0/3">Our new second-hand smoke media campaign launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-05">5 September 2005</phrase>, which will run until the end of October, focuses on the health risks in the home&mdash;as most deaths and harm are due to second-hand smoke in the home.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.0/4">In September 2005, the national health service updated and reissued the leaflet, &quot;Fact-Second-hand Smoke is a Killer&quot;, which gives the latest key facts on second-hand smoke. In the leaflet, it states that breathing in second-hand smoke doubles your chances of developing asthma, and if you are one of the 5.2 million people in the United Kingdom who already suffer from asthma, second-hand makes your breathing problems worse. A copy of the leaflet is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.567W.2/2">The risk of bowel cancer increases with age, with over 80 per cent. of bowel cancers arising in people who are 60 or over. Therefore, the Department has taken a pragmatic approach by inviting the optimal group of men and women who will benefit most from a screening programme. Also, we are determined that the new screening programme should not have a detrimental effect on services for patients with bowel cancer symptoms. When we have rolled out the programme to the whole country, we will make an assessment on whether to expand the programme to other age groups.</p>

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) evidence-based clinical guideline, &quot;The care of women requesting induced abortion (2004)&quot;, states that professionals involved in abortion care should be equipped to provide women with information on the long-term effects of abortion which are rare or unproven, including breast cancer.

	<p pid="a.568W.2/1">The Forrest report, on which the breast screening programme is based, recommended further research to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of offering routine screening to women under 50. This is under way, entitled &quot;UKCCCR randomised controlled trial of the effect of breast cancer mortality of annual mammographic screening of women starting at age 40&quot; (the 'Age' Trial).</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/2">The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of annual mammographic screening of women starting at ages 40 to 41 on mortality from breast cancer, thus giving a definitive answer to the outstanding question of whether population screening below 50 is beneficial or not. The study began in February 1991, and recruitment to the trial has now stopped at 160,000 women. The results of this study are expected to be submitted by February 2006 to a journal for publication after peer review.</p>

	<p pid="a.569W.5/1">The NHS cancer plan sets out our strategy for reducing cancer waiting times. A two- week outpatient waiting time standard for urgent general practitioner referrals of suspected cancer was introduced in December 2000. Cancer waiting times treatment standards of one month from urgent GP referral to first cancer treatment were introduced for cases of testicular cancer, children's cancers and acute leukaemia in 2001.</p>

These 31 and 62 day standards will be in place for all cancer patients from December 2005. Performance against the current cancer waiting times targets are published quarterly on the Department of Health website.

	<p pid="a.574W.8/1">Platinum-based medicinal products are effective in the treatment of certain cancers, including childhood cancers. They are, however, associated with a number of serious adverse effects. These are documented in the product information, together with warnings and advice, where possible, on how to reduce or avoid these adverse effects. When treating a patient with cancer, the doctor has to weigh up the risks of the treatment against the potential benefits and prescribe accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.8/2">The two platinum-based medicinal products licensed for human use have well-defined safety profiles and both are known to cause damage to hearing in both adults and children. Information relating to this appears in the summaries of product characteristics (SmPC) and the patient information leaflets (PIL) of the two products.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.8/3">The SmPC for cisplatin, which is authorised for use in children as well as adults, contains statements relating to its potential to cause hearing loss. The SmPC notes that cisplatin should not be given to patients with existing hearing impairment as this may be associated with increased toxicity. It also warns that the damage to hearing caused by cisplatin is cumulative and that audiometric testing should be performed before starting treatment and before each subsequent course of treatment with cisplatin. In addition, the SmPC warns that the simultaneous use of other medicines that cause hearing damage, such as certain antibiotics, may make such damage worse. The SmPC describes in some detail the hearing impairment in patients receiving cisplatin and notes that it is worse in children. This information is also presented in the patient information leaflet.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.8/4">Carboplatin is not authorised for use in children, but nevertheless, the SmPC contains a warning that clinically significant hearing loss has occurred in children given high doses of carboplatin in combination with other medicines that cause hearing damage. There is also general information about the incidence and degree of hearing loss caused by carboplatin, which is generally less damaging to hearing than cisplatin.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.8/5">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) continually monitors the safety of medicines in clinical use. To date, that is from 1963 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase>, the MHRA has received nine reports (of nine suspected reactions) of ear and labyrinth disorders associated with carboplatin. Of these, only one was in a child (one-year-old) who experienced deafness following therapy with carboplatin and gentamycin. During the same time period, a total of 19 reports (of 26 suspected reactions) of ear and labyrinth disorders associated with cisplatin have been received. Of these, three were in children (10 years old and younger) and the reported reactions were deafness for two cases and hearing impaired and tinnitus in the third case.</p>

	<p pid="a.579W.6/1">It is our policy that decisions on fluoridation schemes should be taken locally by strategic health authorities (SHAs), following consultations with the populations they serve. The previous legislation governing fluoridation left water companies responsible for final decisions on fluoridation. The main initiative the Government have taken on fluoridation has been to introduce amending legislation to make SHAs responsible for decisions and to define in greater detail how they should conduct consultations. The Department has also made grants totalling &pound;428,000 over the period 2001&ndash;02 to 2005&ndash;06 to the British Fluoridation Society to promote the benefits of fluoridation. This forms part of a wider programme of work to improve oral health and reduce oral health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/2">The guidance on consultations and ascertaining public opinion is available in the Library. Under this guidance, SHAs are expected to have regard to both the extent of support for the proposal and the cogency of the arguments advanced. Numbers of representations are not to be the sole determinant of the SHA's decision. I am not aware of any primary care trusts in the Surrey and Sussex SHA area that are currently taking steps to promote the fluoridation of the water supply.</p>

	<p pid="a.584W.2/2">Ministerial travel is conducted in accordance with the ministerial code and travel by Ministers. Guidance for Ministers on the use of air miles is set out in the ministerial code. The guidance makes clear that air miles should be used only for official purposes or else foregone. However, if it is impracticable to use the benefits for Government travel, there is no objection to Ministers donating them to charity if this is permissible under the terms of the airline's scheme and the charity is one chosen by the airline.</p>

This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision of music therapy.

We set out proposals to bring in new measures to improve the way the NHS helps smokers to give up in our White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&quot;. We will reduce exposure to second-hand smoke and, through a staged approach, make almost all enclosed public places and workplaces smoke-free. We will consult on introducing picture warnings onto tobacco packs. Together, these strategies have helped reduce adult smoking rates in England from 28 per cent. in 1998 to 25 per cent. in 2004.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-10-28a.17943.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-10-28a.592W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="592W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051028/text/51028w11.htm#51028w11.html_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.592W.0/1">Scientific data supporting the safety of tryptophan was assessed by the committee on toxicity (COT) in 2004. In its evaluation, the COT noted significant uncertainties and decided that an uncertainty factor of 10 should be applied to derive a dose that would not be expected to be a risk to health to the general population. The limit proposed by the COT was 220 milligrammes of tryptophan per supplement capsule. This factor is applied where there is uncertainty due to gaps in the scientific evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/2">A regulatory impact assessment (RIA) was carried out to determine the impact on industry and consumers, which was followed by a 12 week consultation period with stakeholders on the proposed regulations and the draft RIA. Tryptophan supplements were banned in the United Kingdom in 1990 and the new legislation will allow the reintroduction of the sale of L-tryptophan at a specified level and purity criteria. The impact on industry was considered and on balance was considered to be positive, given that supplements containing tryptophan have been prohibited for sale since 1990. Consumer choice will also be increased without presenting an appreciable risk to health. This approach is consistent with the principle of good regulation established by the better regulation task force.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/3">It is understood that three European countries have reintroduced the sale of tryptophan supplements at daily dose levels of between 160mg and 600mg.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/4">Responses were received by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) from the Health Food Manufacturers Association and the Institute for Optimum Nutrition (ION), on the approach taken by the COT on setting levels for the use of tryptophan in supplements and suggesting higher levels be permitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/5">The COT secretariat has reviewed the data submitted by ION in May 2005 and found that there was no new evidence to that already reviewed by COT in 2004, when it reached its conclusions on the safety of tryptophan that would support a higher level of tryptophan being used in food supplements. The FSA therefore adopted the level and purity criteria proposed by COT, and this has therefore been adopted into UK legislation to reintroduce the sale of tryptophan supplements in the UK, in the interests of consumer choice and safety. We have asked COT to review its recommendation and any new information on tryptophan since June 2004, and this will be considered at the COT meeting in December. Depending on COTs advice the legislation may be amended.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/6">The expert group on vitamins and minerals (EVM) proposed safe upper levels (SULs) for vitamins and minerals using the well-established paradigm for setting acceptable and tolerable intake levels for chemicals in food. Where the data were not adequate to set a SUL, the EVM gave guidance on levels that would not be expected to result in adverse effects. The COT uses the same paradigm in its consideration of the safety of tryptophan as a supplement. However, the scientific data did not support derivation of a SUL, and the COT conclusion is expressed in the same terms that EVM used for its guidance levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.0/7">The use of advisory statements was not considered appropriate due to the severity of the symptoms of Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome in people taking dietary supplements containing tryptophan pre-1990, and the uncertainty relating to gaps in the scientific evidence. COT decided to recommend a daily dose level of 220mg that would not present an appreciable risk to health.</p>

	<p pid="a.594W.0/1">The series of road shows was developed to build public awareness of the imminent changes to the passport and provide an opportunity for the public to try out the technology which will in time be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.0/2">Decisions regarding the dates of the biometric road shows were dependent on the availability of the venues selected; the dates were agreed and venues booked on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-16">16 August 2005</phrase>. A wide range of local media organisations were contacted, including newspapers, television and radio stations, according to locality and size of readership/audience. In each case local BBC and commercial television and radio stations were invited to attend, along with the main regional/local newspaper(s). Notice of the road shows was provided to local media the working day before each event.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.0/3">The dates and locations of the road shows were not released to the public in advance. As is usual practice, Ministers' movements are not confirmed in advance for security reasons. In addition, the road show stand was designed to attract passers-by (e.g. shoppers) and the local media. It would not have been able to accommodate a larger audience, had the road shows been publicised more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.0/4">A budget of &pound;150,000 was set aside to cover the cost of the road shows. This included the design and build of the stand&mdash;a resource that could be used in further events, venue hire, staff costs and transportation/set-up of equipment. Feedback from members of the public who attended was on balance positive. Requests have been received from hon. Members for road show events in their locality, though no decision on further dates have yet been taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.595W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.0/2">Each case the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) receives from the police is reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors to ensure that it is right to proceed with a prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.0/3">The Code sets out two stages in the decision to prosecute. Firstly, there must be sufficient evidence to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction'. This is an objective test which means that a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged. If the case does not pass the evidential stage it must not go ahead no matter how important or serious it may be.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.0/4">If the case passes the evidential stage then the second stage is to consider whether a prosecution would be in the public interest. A prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour, or it appears more appropriate in all the circumstances of the case to divert the person from prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.0/5">The review of a case is a continuous process, which carries on throughout its life and takes into account any new evidence or information which becomes available as the case progresses.</p>

	<p pid="a.607W.5/2">In the period from April to June 2005 a total of 3,531 people in the seven pathways to work pilot areas failed to attend one of their mandatory work focused interviews, however we do not have the information as to whether this was their first work focused interview or a subsequent one.</p>
	<p pid="a.607W.5/3">Where there is a failure to attend a work-focused interview a letter is sent to the individual making the consequences clear and asking the customer to contact their adviser. Where no response is received, the department will, in cases where the client has a known mental health problem or learning disability, additionally undertake a home visit to ensure the individual understands the requirements placed upon him. The application of a sanction is a last resort. A reminder that a sanction can be applied is almost always enough to encourage someone to comply with the requirement to attend an interview.</p>
	<p pid="a.607W.5/4">So the very large majority of these customers will have had their interview rebooked and will subsequently attend that interview (or it may be deferred where additional information comes to light that the timing of the interview is now inappropriate). Only in a very small percentage of cases is it necessary to impose a benefit sanction. This is because knowledge of potential sanctions incentivises people to attend their work focused interviews and the system's safeguards ensure that people do not lose benefit because of misunderstandings or an inability to comply with the requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.607W.5/5">As a result of these measures it has only been found necessary to impose a sanction, at the end of the process, on 100 people out of the 3,500 failing to attend.</p>

In his pre-budget statement in December 2004, the Chancellor announced a further payment of &pound;50 to eligible households with someone aged 70 or over. In the 2005 Budget, he announced a further &pound;200 payment for this winter to eligible households with someone aged 65 or over.

This non-departmental public body will operate at arms length from Government. It will be overseen by a highly experienced and independent chair and board appointed fully in accordance with the requirements of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. It will be staffed by people who are skilled and experienced in project management and cost control. The ODA will put in place a range of measures which will include tight contract management, effective value engineering to keep costs down and stay within budget at every stage and daily and vigilant monitoring of costs and progress.</p>

My aim will be to ensure rapid progress and effective cost control to deliver the games on time and within the present funding plans. Within those plans the aim is that the costs to band D London council tax payers will remain pegged at &pound;20 a year for 10 years. I am optimistic that with the expertise, governance and controls that we are putting in place this plan can be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.619W.4/1">The employer's (ie Exchequer's) contribution to the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund is determined by the Government Actuary's Department, which carries out a triennial assessment of the general financial position of the scheme. The last assessment examined the position as at <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.4/2">The current rate of employer's contributions is 24 per cent. of Members' salaries. This increased in April 2003 from the then contribution of 7.9 per cent. of Members' salaries. The 24 per cent. of Members' salaries currently contributed by the Exchequer is made up as follows: 19.3 per cent. to cover the employer's share of the cost of pension benefits accruing to current members of the scheme; and 4.7 per cent. to recoup a deficit in the assets of the scheme compared with its liabilities, as disclosed at the <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.4/3">The Government Actuary's Department's assessment is conducted using standard actuarial methodology. It relies on certain assumptions of a financial and demographic nature, including longevity, Members' likely parliamentary career patterns, and the expected level of long-term real returns on the scheme's investments. The Government Actuary's Department is currently undertaking an assessment of the position as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, to determine the employer's contribution that should apply with effect from April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.4/4">The rate of contribution made by employees is either 6 per cent. or 10 per cent. of salary depending on their chosen level of benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.0/1">The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains serious. 1.8 million people have been forced to flee their homes and 3.4 million are dependent on humanitarian assistance. Although the latest UN mortality survey shows that the number of deaths has decreased significantly, the security situation has deteriorated in recent months with an increase in banditry hampering humanitarian relief operations, particularly in West Darfur. Road access for humanitarian agencies in West Darfur has been cut and the UN has positioned air transport in El Geneina to meet priority humanitarian needs and is confident that essential operations can be maintained. In central Darfur, the upsurge in fighting has seen new waves of localised displacement. Contingency planning for more disruption is underway by the humanitarian agencies and we stand ready to provide additional support if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.0/2">The UN Secretary General's September 2005 report on Darfur states that all parties (SLA, Government, Arab militia) except the JEM initiated violent incidents. The African Union Mission in Sudan is investigating these incidents, and we are encouraging them to carry out a verification mission to identify the locations of all parties to the conflict, including militia groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.3/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) leads on engaging with British companies overseas. It has developed guidance explaining the effect of part 12 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security (ATCS) Act 2001. This Act gives UK courts jurisdiction over certain offences of bribery and corruption committed overseas by UK companies or nationals and gives UK companies a strong defence against attempts to extort bribes from them. DFID works closely with other UK Government departments, (including the FCO, the Home Office, HM Treasury, the Department for Trade and Industry and the Attorney General's Office) on anti-corruption activities, including raising awareness of the provisions of the ATCS act. We have a productive relationship with the Infrastructure sector Anti-Corruption Forum and the British Consultants and Construction Bureau.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.3/2">DFID'S bilateral programmes, working with other bilateral and multi-lateral donors, support a range of developing country governance reforms, including procurement reforms. Improving developing country systems reduces the environment for corrupt practice by foreigners and nationals by improving accountability, transparency and effectiveness. In addition, DFID has led in assisting several developing countries to enhance their capacity to prevent and prosecute corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.3/3">Since untying aid in 2001, DFID make no distinction between British and other companies. DFID's zero tolerance towards corruption is reflected within our standard contractual terms and conditions. From January 2006, procurement by all UK Government Departments will need to take account of the new EU procurement directives. These include the mandatory exclusion of suppliers, where contracting authorities are aware that they have been convicted of fraud, corruption and money laundering (Article 45 of the Public Sector Directive). Internally, DFID is also currently preparing guidance to staff to raise awareness of what constitutes bribery and corruption which will relate to the provisions of the ATCS act 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.625W.2/1">DFID operates an annual review of budgets that includes deciding how much money to allocate to each developing country. The process involves dialogue at all levels starting with country offices and culminating in approval by DFID's management board and, then, by Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.2/2">DFID uses a financial model to generate suggested allocations for bilateral country programmes. The model takes account of both the extent of a country's poverty and the likely effectiveness of aid in reducing its poverty. Vulnerability to economic shocks and the amount of aid which countries are likely to receive from other donors are also considered in deciding on the appropriate level of aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.2/3">In addition to the model's results, the regional divisions responsible for DFID's bilateral country programmes analyse a range of factors when considering allocations. These include the effectiveness of multilateral channels, conflict and reconstruction needs, inequality and social exclusion, our historical engagement and the political environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.2/4">The issue of effective allocation of aid is a broad one, which requires greater co-ordination between all aid donors, since the UK itself provides less than 10 percent. of global aid. We believe faster progress could be made towards the millennium development goals (MDGs) if the world's aid was more systematically allocated to countries most in need of, and best able to use it for poverty reduction. DFID has been urging other donors to focus more of their aid on poor countries and poor people, while recognising that security and conflict prevention have a key role to play. In this regard, DFID is leading initiatives in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)'s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to promote information sharing on different donors approaches to allocation and to create a DAC watch brief on aid flows to a list of fragile states.</p>

	<p pid="a.626W.2/1">DFID recognises that development and stability can be achieved with very different governance arrangements, as demonstrated by the experience of countries as diverse as Botswana, Chile, Mozambique and Vietnam. What constitutes good governance varies according to the country context. Therefore, DFID does not assess the quality of governance according to a standard set of criteria in the countries in which it works. Instead DFID analyses the quality of governance according to a framework of capabilities: political systems that extend opportunities to poor people; economic management that brings stability and facilitates investment; delivery of policies that benefit the poor; raising revenue and delivering public services; maintenance of safety security and justice; national security; accountability and tackling corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.626W.2/2">DFID builds effective aid partnerships based on a shared commitment to reducing poverty, respecting human rights and strengthening public financial management and accountability. DFID uses criteria to assess specific elements of governance that underpin these aid partnerships with developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.626W.2/3">Within each country partnership, we agree a regular assessment of progress in these three areas to ensure that we are achieving the shared objectives and to inform our dialogue with partner governments.

	<p pid="a.626W.5/1">DFID does not list recipient countries ranked in order of the quality of their governance. This is firstly because there is no agreed appropriate index suitable for all countries. Secondly, ratings depend on the quality of data used and where we are most concerned about the state of governance, data sources are often unreliable and inaccurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.626W.5/2">The UK Government allocates aid to each country on the basis of levels of poverty in that country, and the ability of the partner Government concerned to make good use of aid. In making these judgements, DFID takes into account detailed country level information, and assessments made by other institutions, notably the World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).</p>
	<p pid="a.626W.5/3">A listing of all the countries in which DFID works and the allocation of aid to each are in the 39th Edition of the Statistics on International Development (formerly known as British Aid Statistics), copies of which have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.2/1">DFID encourages improved governance and assists with governance reforms through specific programme activities, aid allocations and use of different ways of delivering aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.2/2">DFID allocates aid to partners on the basis of levels of poverty and their ability to make good use of that aid. Governance is relevant, in that, in general, the higher the standard of governance, the more likely it is that our partners are able to make good use of aid. This is especially true of sound public financial management. The poorer the standards of public financial management, the more control we are likely to wish to retain. If standards of governance are very poor, we may decide not to deliver aid through partner governments but to use alternative channels, such as non-government organisations (NGOs). In these ways, the standard of governance may have an influence on levels of aid and on how that aid is delivered. Recognition of this may provide some incentive to governments in developing countries to improve governance, particularly public financial management.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.5/1">DFID believes that effective aid partnerships are based on shared commitment to reducing poverty, respecting human rights and strengthening public financial management and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.5/2">DFID aims to provide appropriate and realistic support. This may include support to Parliaments, national audit offices and other oversight institutions. This helps to strengthen safeguards against bad Government. Where the standard of Government is very poor, aid may be aimed at helping to fulfil core functions, including protecting people from harm, delivering basic public services and providing an economic framework to enable people to support themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.5/3">The UK Government review of aid conditionally concluded that the UK will consider reducing or interrupting committed aid if:</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.5/4" class="indent">Countries veer significantly away from their agreed poverty reduction objectives or from the agreed objectives of a particular aid commitment (such as through an unjustifiable rise in military spending, or a substantial deviation from the agreed poverty reduction programme); or</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.5/7">Where a partnership breaks down in this way, the UK Government will judge carefully whether to reduce or suspend aid. This judgment will consider the impact for poor people, and for longer-term poverty reduction efforts, of stopping or continuing aid. The judgment will also take into account any other specific circumstances. In all cases the UK will seek to talk the issues through with partner Governments before taking a final decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.2/1">DFID anti corruption strategies make no distinction between heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) and other countries. The approach must be tailored to the specific circumstances prevalent in each individual country.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/2">Countries qualify for HIPC debt relief where they can demonstrate their commitment to poverty reduction and to sound macro economic management. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also assess public financial management and agree actions that countries will take to improve these systems. Where DFID gives direct budgetary support as part of our bilateral programmes in HIPC and non-HIPC countries, we undertake a comprehensive fiduciary risk assessment based on a thorough evaluation of partner Government public financial management systems, which include a specific evaluation of corruption. Where weaknesses are identified, appropriate anti corruption interventions are designed accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/3">Corruption is both a symptom and a cause of poor governance. Therefore, DFID bilateral programmes typically include support to a range of governance reforms. Support has been given to improve judicial systems, for example in Kenya, Nigeria Uganda and Sierra Leone. DFID has also provided technical and financial support to dedicated anti-corruption commissions in Sierra Leone, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia. DFID also supports a number of regional anti-corruption related initiatives spanning many of the HIPC countries, such as the regional anti-money laundering groups representing eastern and southern Africa (ESAAMLG) and western Africa (GIABBA).</p>

	<p pid="a.631W.6/1">Sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, are some of the most cost-effective and beneficial health service interventions available. However, the unmet need for condoms, and other methods of family planning, is very high. Globally, some 120 million women and men who say they would like to use family planning have no access to modern contraceptives. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) also estimates that the global condom needs for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is around 9 billion annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.6/2">DFID is working to change the situation and provides significant assistance to multilateral organisations such as the UNFPA, providing &pound;141 million for the period 2000&ndash;01 to 2005&ndash;06 in core support. An estimated &pound;46.5 million of this amount has been used by the UNFPA for the purchase of reproductive health commodities. DFID is also one of the leading bilateral providers of reproductive health commodities through its country programmes, where reproductive health supplies are an integral part of broader programmes to promote sexual and reproductive health and to prevent HIV. In 2004&ndash;05, this included commitments of &pound;40 million for condoms in Nigeria, &pound;6.37 million for condoms in Vietnam and &pound;220,000 for female condoms in South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.6/3">DFID has been the fourth largest provider of condoms, supporting the distribution of about 150 million condoms annually. In many countries, financial assistance provided through sector and budget support also enables countries to purchase their own reproductive health commodities, which we believe is an important long term approach to ensuring availability of these commodities.</p>

	<p pid="a.632W.2/1">DFID funds TB control through some specific bilateral projects, but increasingly also funds the broader health sector plans of developing country governments by direct financing through their budgets, or through multilateral organisations such as the World Bank. Such sector programmes will build capacity in health services to diagnose and treat all major causes of illness. It is therefore difficult to attribute accurately all of DFID's expenditure on TB control. The following are estimated figures for funding to TB control through bilateral and multilateral channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.2/2">DFID's bilateral expenditure directly targeting TB control was &pound;13 million in 2003&ndash;04, and &pound;15 million in 2004&ndash;05. These figures may underestimate DFID's TB bilateral expenditure since they only include the parts of projects which were specifically focused on TB control. They do not count the full costs of these projects which often provide funding to services which support TB control, but are not TB-specific. To count the full cost of these projects may be misleading as other diseases and sectoral areas are targeted within them. Expenditure estimates are not available prior to 2003 as information was not collected in a suitable format.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.2/3">DFID provides grants to the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) <sup>1</sup> and the World Health Organisation (WHO). We estimate that the amount of DFID funding that went to TB control through these two organisations was &pound;4 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;5 million in 2004&ndash;05. These figures are based on the share of spend which these organisations said they directed towards TB control (GFATM&mdash;13 per cent., the WHO&mdash;4 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.2/4">These figures do not include DFID's expenditure on TB through grants to other multilateral organisations including the World Bank and the European Commission. These organisations will target some of their work towards TB but do not currently report it explicitly in their budgets. Therefore, we are unable to provide an estimate of DFID's TB expenditure via these organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.2/5">DFID provides a significant part of its funding directly to government budgets in support of their overall strategies for poverty reduction ('Poverty Reduction Budget Support'). DFID provided &pound;339 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;423 million in 2004&ndash;05 in this way. Partner governments may use some part of this directly for TB control activities. It is not currently possible to provide accurate estimates of the proportion of PRBS which is spent directly on TB control.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.2/6">DFID does not have a target for expenditure on TB control. However, we are committed to at least maintaining our level of effort in order to halt and reverse the incidence of TB. We will continue to channel support through bilateral projects, contributions to multilateral organisations and funding to partner governments through PRBS. DFID has pledged &pound;5 million to the global Stop TB Partnership for 2005 to 2007, to co-ordinate technical support and supplies of quality drugs to TB programmes in developing countries, and &pound;200 million to the 'Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria' for the two year period 2006 to 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.2/7" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> DFID contributions to the GFATM are made on a calendar year basis therefore the financial year figures above do not reflect the doubling of UK contributions from 2004 to 2005.</p>

The training offered focuses on developing these skills to a more advanced level in the context of the FCO's business, for example writing courses and financial management training, which are available to all employees. These courses will be revised in 2006 to build on the Professional Skills in Government Agenda. Occasionally members of staff bid for and receive funding to attend courses, for example at evening classes, to improve their literacy and numeracy.</p>

The site operator has planning permission and a valid waste management licence for the temporary storage of asbestos. The Department is currently investigating a complaint about non-compliant waste deposited within the curtilage of the site. A judicial review of the planning permission is ongoing.</p>

In the interim, work is under way to bring about early improvements to the current provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.652W.8/4" class="indent">Roads Service plans to widen the Belfast-bound carriageway of the M2 motorway to create an additional lane between the Sandyknowes and Greencastle junctions. This will make it easier for traffic to join the M2 from the Sandyknowes junction, particularly during the morning peak traffic, and also provide greater capacity on the Belfast-bound section of the M2 towards Greencastle.

	<p pid="a.659W.9/1">Education and Library Boards are providing a range of measures to improve the safety of their bus fleets. 65 per cent. of Board buses now have seat belts fitted compared with 47.5 per cent. in 2001. In all new Board vehicles, seatbelts are fitted as standard. The Department of Education has also provided Boards with funding of &pound;4.25 million this year to replace existing school buses which have passed their replacement date. A further &pound;1.4 million was made available to purchase additional Board vehicles to cover bus routes which are currently serviced by more expensive operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.9/2">The Department of the Environment is also currently considering in detail the implications of the provision of seat belts in all school buses in its assessment of the four key recommendations of the Northern Ireland Assembly's home to school transport public inquiry. It is expected that the findings of this work, which is being carried out in partnership with the Department for Regional Development and the Department of Education, will be published later this year. No decisions on the way forward will be made until this assessment is complete.</p>

These figures include qualified social work staff and other social care staff such as day centre and unqualified residential workers (the figures do not include domiciliary workers or home helps). It has not been possible to provide a specific breakdown of the Social Services staff due to the complexity of the grade codes and the recent change in the title protection of the term 'Social Worker'.</p>

	<p pid="a.665W.0/1">The calculation of surplus places in post-primary schools, is based on the enrolment which can be accommodated by the total physical capacity of teaching spaces less the actual number of pupils attending.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.0/2">For primary schools, the methodology is based on the schedules of accommodation in the Department of Education Building Handbook for Primary Schools, which uses enrolment bands to determine the number of classrooms that a school should have eg the enrolment band for a seven classroom school is in the range 176&ndash;205 pupils. Many primary schools have a number of classrooms which are not used for teaching purposes and therefore to make some allowance for these non-teaching classrooms, the methodology for calculating surplus places has deemed the capacity of each primary school to be the lower end of the enrolment band. The actual enrolment is subtracted from this to produce an estimate of the surplus places.</p>
