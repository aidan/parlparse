	<p pid=".287W.3/1">The Gift Aid scheme only covers gifts of money. The relief for giving listed shares, introduced in April 2000, allows individuals and companies to deduct the market value of gifts of listed shares from their income or corporation tax calculation. Where shares are being actively traded, the value will normally be easily ascertained by reference to published prices. However, where trading is suspended, the value will be the price which might have been paid in a transaction at arm's length. Any relief would therefore reflect the suspension of trading in the shares. The shares would still, of course, be of value to the charity, when trading resumed.</p>

Taxpayer confidentiality prevents the disclosure of specific details on how much tax the Government has collected from payments from the Thalidomide trust to thalidomide victims. As with other discretionary trusts, the trustees account for tax at 34 per cent. on the income they pay out. The beneficiaries are then subject to tax on this income in the normal way, and they may claim credit for the tax paid by the trustees. This tax treatment has not changed so it is not possible to estimate the uptake of tax reclaim under a previous fiscal system. Information on the numbers of thalidomide victims claiming tax repayment is not available.</p>

However, as the Sandler Review of ''Medium and Long Term Retail Savings in the UK'' found, distributors have strong incentives to focus on higher income consumers. The Sandler Review therefore recommended building on existing product standards through the introduction of ''stakeholder'' products that could significantly help less affluent consumers by providing them with simple, good value, and risk-controlled products that could be sold face to face but without the time and cost associated with regulated advice.</p>

	<p pid=".298W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician. I have asked him to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.2/2" class="italic">Letter to Mr. Matthew Taylor from Len Cook, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-06">6 November 2002</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".298W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question concerning an estimate of the cost of measuring inflation rates between regions.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.2/4" class="indent">The development of regional inflation measures would require a major expansion of existing data collections and a substantial development programme to resolve a number of conceptual and technical issues. This would involve significant additional expenditure involving many millions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.2/5" class="indent">There are several reasons why the current available data is not suitable for the compilation of reliable regional indices. The selection of locations is not designed to be representative of individual regions; the locations would have to be resampled, increased in number, and substantially more prices collected. In addition, many of the centrally compiled indices (e.g. housing, cars, PCs) are designed as national indices; the possibility of developing these to produce regional indices would need to be investigated.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.2/6" class="indent">The data used for the weights (such as the Expenditure and Food Survey) would also have to be significantly enhanced to ensure that detailed regional expenditure categories (by type of good or service, and by type of outlet) were being weighted appropriately and represented in the sample of prices being collected. Finally, there will be a significant cost arising from the development of computer systems to produce regional indices.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.2/7" class="indent">The conceptual issues to be resolved include whether the items to be priced should be representative of national or regional baskets (different users will have different needs), and also the treatment of regional boundaries. Households do not necessarily restrict their shopping to the region where they live; they may physically cross regional borders for shopping or do so via Internet or mail order shopping.</p>

	<p pid=".299W.8/3">The Charity Commission announced new rules allowing sports clubs to qualify for charity status in November 2001 and now recognise as charitable purposes certain sports related activities.

However, no assessment of the number of sports clubs that qualify for mandatory rate relief is available.</p>

	<p pid=".300W.3/1">We are currently taking forward one of the largest organisational changes in the history of the civil service. We are integrating the whole of the old Employment Service and the Benefit Agency's services for people of working age to form Jobcentre Plus whilst simultaneously launching the new Pension Service.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.3/2">A key aim of the programme is to improve access to services providing active work-focused help to people of working age through Jobcentre Plus and an expert pensions advice service through The Pension Service. We are currently reviewing the facilities available to us to provide these services across the country. We are looking to make the most efficient use of these facilities whilst maintaining a high standard of service to all our customers. Both agencies are extending access to their services with, for example, the innovative use of new technology, the use of contact centres staffed by expert advisers, the extension of face-to-face services into communities and the sharing of facilities with our local partners such as local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.3/3">In spring 2003 Bath Pension Centre is scheduled to take over benefit processing and the telephone advice service for the Gloucestershire area. Pensioners will still be able to meet an adviser face to face at local advice surgeries or by arranging a home visit. This will be backed up by local services delivered in partnership with local authorities and voluntary sector organisations. Pensioners will receive letters explaining the changes fully and giving them all necessary contact details.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.3/4">The Coleford Jobcentre will be moving to new premises in the near future, as the current premises do not meet the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Jobcentre Plus are also considering moving delivery of Social Security services from Cinderford to this new Coleford office. We will be reviewing the delivery of Jobcentre Plus services as part of the roll out the new integrated offices throughout Gloucestershire by 2005&ndash;06. No decisions have yet been made on their location.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.3/5">All of these changes will be managed so as to ensure that high quality public services can be maintained throughout the transition to the new arrangements.</p>

HSE Infoline, a telephone public inquiry service, answers general inquiries, gives information about free and priced publications and directs callers to other sources of advice in HSE. Over 600 free publications are available from HSE's website (<a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk">www.hse.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".303W.2/4">HSE is also assisting Scottish Executive and other stakeholders in Scotland in setting up an occupational health and safety support service for small and medium sized enterprises and their employees across Scotland.

	<p pid=".305W.3/1">Equality of opportunity for all staff is a key feature of all Civil Service employment. As part of this, ageism is not tolerated. Our Diversity and Equality policy statement specifies age as an area where we ''will provide equality of opportunity''. This equality of treatment extends also to the new external recruitment system where potential recruits will be selected on the basis of competencies.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.3/2">The Department includes age as part of its equality proofing of policies and procedures. Our current HR Change Programme is continuously reviewing its recruitment, development, performance management and retention policies. Alongside this work we are implementing the outcomes of the Performance and Innovation Unit's ''Winning the Generation Game'' report.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.3/3">All applicants and employees are treated fairly to enable them to develop and fulfil their potential, valuing the contribution each person can make to the organisation. Vacancies are open up to everyone up to the age of 65 and a person's age is not taken into account at any stage of the selection process.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.3/4">In addition to its usual recruitment procedures the Department also recruits employees through the New Deal programme, both for Young People and 25 and 50 plus.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.3/5">All staff in the Department, below the Senior Civil Service, are able to choose to remain beyond 60, up to the age of 65. Staff over 60 are subject to the same terms and conditions as staff under 60 with no special reviews of performance applied. The Department's flexible approach to age retirement allows staff to continue to work in their current grade and, subject to business need, to seek promotion to a higher grade or voluntarily to downgrade. Subject to business need staff may also choose to work full or part time.</p>

We have a long-term goal of improving on this figure, as our experience of the new scheme increases.</p>

	<p pid=".310W.2/1">The double debt rule is designed to ensure that people do not become over indebted by borrowing additional amounts from the Social Fund until they have repaid a reasonable proportion of the original loan. Further loans are refused to applicants who have an outstanding budgeting loan debt of more than half the maximum amount available to them. Once their existing debt drops to less than half they can reapply, although the amount of further loan available to them could still be affected by any outstanding debt.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.2/2">It is estimated that the cost of abolishing the rule while broadly maintaining maximum amounts available, would be around #100m in the first year. The cost would fall to #25m in the second year and #10m in the third <sup>1</sup> .</p>

	<p pid=".313W.3/1">The Government, after careful consideration of its legal obligations under EC Regulation 1408/71 and discussions with the European Commission, concluded that certain people living in the EEA (or from winter 2002&ndash;3, Switzerland) could continue to get Winter Fuel Payments. I refer the hon. Member to the written answer I gave to my hon. Friend the member for Caephilly on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-19">19 July 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-07-19.599"><i>Official Report</i>, column 599w</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.3/2">The EC regulation applies to member states, French overseas departments (Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Reunion), the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. It also applies to Switzerland from <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-01">1 June 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.3/3">We estimate the annual cost of such payments to be around #10 million.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.3/4">Eligible people, generally EEA nationals (which includes UK nationals) who qualified for a payment in Great Britain before moving to another EEA country will be able to continue receiving Winter Fuel Payments whilst they are ordinarily resident in another EEA country or Switzerland, provided that they continue to satisfy the eligibility criteria.</p>

	<p pid=".313W.3/6" class="indentitalic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".313W.3/7" class="indent">Winter Fuel Payments can only be made to people living in Switzerland from this coming winter. This is because, while Switzerland is not a member of the EEA, a formal agreement between Switzerland and the European Community (EC) countries will enable the EU Social Security coordination regulations to apply between Switzerland and the EC countries. The agreement came into force from 1st June 2002 and therefore, for Winter Fuel Payments, applies from winter 2002&ndash;03, but not before.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.3/8" class="indent">However, the agreement does not extend to the three countries who are not part of the EC but who are part of the EEA, namely, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Therefore in some circumstances, Winter Fuel Payments may continue to be paid to people who are Swiss nationals who live in Switzerland or one of the EC countries, but not when they live in Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway. Similarly Winter Fuel Payments may continue to be paid to people who are nationals of Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway who live in an EEA country, but not when they live in Switzerland.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.5/1">The National Roadside Survey of Vehicle Excise Duty evasion which took place in June 1999 showed the level of evasion as 3.9 per cent. of revenue due which equates to #191 million in 2001&ndash;02. This was offset by #110 million recovered through enforcement activities. The number of unlicensed vehicles at any one time is around 1 million vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.5/2">We have introduced legislation which will make the registered keeper of a vehicle remain liable for it until a formal change of keepership is notified to DVLA. This system of continuous registration will help to improve the accuracy of the vehicle register which will lead to more efficient tax collection, and more effective enforcement. The legislation will be brought into force by regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.5/3">In addition DVLA is working closely with the police and local authorities to target unlicensed and abandoned vehicles. Last year, DVLA took successful action against 800,000 evaders recovering some #110 million in fines, penalties and re-licensing revenue.</p>

	<p pid=".319W.5/1">The Strategic Rail Authority has announced today a new approach to franchising. Under it the SRA will be much clearer what it expects from each train operating company. Train companies will not just be judged on whether trains run on time but also on the cleanliness of trains and stations, accurate travel information and passenger security.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.5/2">The nature of the franchising structure put in place at privatisation has contributed to the difficulties in the railway industry&mdash;especially poor performance and variable quality of service.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.5/3">Today, with the Government's support, the SRA has announced a new approach to franchising that puts passengers first. It intends to do so through: tighter specification of services, station standards, train cleanliness and journey quality; and robust incentives and penalties that will influence positively the behaviour of operators. These include: changes to the performance regime; quantified performance indicators for service and station quality, with payment by results; and a new approach to the award and management of franchises. The first franchise awarded under the new basis is expected to start operating in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.5/4">The SRA has also announced proposals to make better use of the railway by combining franchises at key London stations&mdash;from 3 to 1 at Liverpool Street, from 2 to 1 at Waterloo and from 3 to 2 at Paddington.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.5/5">Transitional arrangements are being put in place as it is not practical to award all of the franchises due to expire by 2004 simultaneously. The SRA has therefore made a number of detailed announcements on individual franchises today. These include: an invitation to Connex Transport UK Ltd and First Group/Keolis SA to proceed to detailed negotiations on Heads of Terms for the TransPennine franchise; negotiations with Arriva Trains Northern on an interim franchise to operate services until the Northern Rail franchise commences in 2004; a one-year extension to the current South West Trains franchise to February 2004; and the agreement of principles with Stagecoach Holdings plc for a new South West Trains franchise extending to 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.5/6">Further adjustments to franchise periods may be necessary to facilitate an orderly transition from the existing franchise regime to the new one. I shall be prepared to use my powers of direction under section 26 of the Railways Act 1993 for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.5/7">This announcement is another step towards delivering a reliable and safe railway and builds on the SRA's consultation on its Capacity Utilisation Strategy launched on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-05">5 September</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".328W.8/1">The food situation in Zimbabwe remains of serious concern. We, and other donors, are doing all we can&mdash;through the UN World Food Programme and Non-Governmental Organisations&mdash;to ensure that international aid reaches the needy regardless of their political views. There is credible evidence however that other sources of food, controlled by the ZANU PF regime, are being used in support of its political objectives. We deplore this, as well as the obstruction of the work of certain Non-Governmental Organisations, which also appears to be politically motivated.</p>

	<p pid=".329W.2/1">The prospects for foreign investment in Zimbabwe are poor. Figures show that it has declined by 99 per cent. since 1998. The reasons are obvious. Zimbabwe is one of the world's fastest shrinking economies. It has lost the support of major donors and international financial institutions. Its skilled labour force, faced with over 70 per cent. unemployment, food shortages and 140 per cent. inflation, is leaving the country. On top of this, the current regime in Harare has undermined the rule of law and the right to hold private property.</p>

	<p pid=".331W.0/1">At the request of the Association of Chief Police Officers, which believes that the improved accuracy of the L21A1 baton round means it is suitable for use in serious public disorder and also in dealing with individuals posing an immediate threat to life in circumstances where use of a conventional firearm may otherwise be necessary, we have sought and received a medical statement from the Defence Scientific Advisory Council on the use of the L21A1 baton round at ranges from 1 to 19 metres. This supplements their earlier assessment of the injury potential over longer ranges published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-02">2 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.0/2">The statement confirms that the probability of unintentional impact to the most vulnerable parts of the body remains low when the round is discharged at ranges of less than 20 metres and that there is no significant change in the probability of rounds striking the potentially vulnerable chest area. This means that the likelihood of serious injury or death occurring as the result of the impact of an L21A1 baton round is no greater at ranges between 1 and 19 metres than at the longer ranges which were the subject of the earlier statement by the Defence Scientific Advisory Council.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.0/3">I will today be placing a copy of the statement in the Library. The Association of Chief Police Officers is considering, in consultation with the Government, what, if any revision to its existing guidelines on the use of baton rounds may be appropriate in the light of this statement.</p>

	<p pid=".332W.2/1">The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the prevention of offending, and punishment of those pursuing a course of conduct which is alarming or distressing to another, or in the worst cases causes another to fear violence. The Government are committed to reducing this type of crime, as with all violent crime, particularly when it is perpetrated against vulnerable individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.2/2">Following the 1997 legislation we commissioned the guide ''Stalking and other forms of harassment: An investigator's guide'', written by Hamish Brown from the Metropolitan Police. This provides advice in the main for police officers about how to use various pieces of legislation to deal with those causing harassment but it also contains advice for victims.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.2/3">We have also conducted a number of research studies into various types of behaviour related to harassment. Research suggests that a substantial proportional of harassment is carried out by ex-partners. Domestic violence is a key priority across government. A cross-departmental Ministerial Group is currently looking at five areas for action: increasing safe accommodation choices for women and children; developing early and effective healthcare intervention; Improving the link between criminal and civil law; ensuring a consistent and appropriate response from the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS); and promoting education and awareness raising.</p>

I will be bringing forward new proposals in relation to any additional public authorities under Chapter II of Part I of RIPA following detailed public consultation. However, the RIPA does not provide for access to communications data for purposes relating to industrial action. A strict test of ''necessity'' must be met before any communications data is obtained under RIPA. An authorising officer must not only consider the communications data to be necessary but must also consider the conduct involved in obtaining the communications data to be ''proportionate'' to what it seeks to achieve. The grounds on which it is necessary, for example, include: in the interests of national security; for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or of preventing disorder.</p>

Due to current operational difficulties being experienced by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), it has been necessary to announce proposals to postpone mandatory checks under certain regulations arising from the Care Standards Act 2000. These would apply to voluntary organisations and to any other bodies which are subject to there regulations. The Government remain committed to introducing mandatory checks in these areas at the earliest possible opportunity. For the time being, even without the CRB check, the regulations and national minimum standards will help to improve standards and protect service users.</p>

	<p pid=".336W.11/1">At the Tokyo donor conference in January this year I pledged #200 million over five years to support humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Afghanistan. In 2002&ndash;03, we originally planned to spend #40 million through UN agencies, NGOs and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. I have since increased this amount by #25 million, to help meet the increased humanitarian needs over the coming winter, and to help clear Afghanistan's arrears to the International Financial Institutions so that they can receive new concessional credits from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. In addition, we have earmarked #1.8 million of our annual contribution to the UN Mines Advisory Service for Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid=".337W.2/2">But the situation remains fragile. Afghanistan is a desperately poor country and the south is facing its fifth year of drought and between 4 million and 6 million people are still dependent on food aid. The situation outside Kabul remains insecure, warlords control large militias and large parts of the economy are dependent on narcotics.</p>

	<p pid=".337W.8/1">Our commitment to strengthen the voices of civil society in developing countries was set out in the 1997 white paper ''Eliminating World Poverty&mdash;Challenge for the 21st Century'' and the 2000 White Paper ''Making Globalisation work for the poor''. We are now engaging directly with a wide range of civil society organisations in developing countries, to strengthen and build their capacity to help poor and excluded people to organise and get their voices heard.</p>
	<p pid=".337W.8/2">A significant number of DflD country programmes have developed programmes to help civil society to fulfil their role. Examples of larger programmes include:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".337W.8/5"> <th><i>Programme</i></th> <th><i>Country</i></th> <th><i>Value</i></th> </tr>

		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".337W.8/8"> <td>Poorest area civil society programme PACS</td> <td>India</td> <td>#27 M</td> </tr>

	<p pid=".337W.8/15">There is also an important role for UK civil society in strengthening civil society capacity within developing countries. The main channel of support to UK groups is through the Civil Society Challenge Fund which spends some #10 million a year. The aim is to support initiatives, implemented through an effective partnership with a developing country civil society organisation, which strengthens the capacity of that organisation to engage in local, national and international decision-making processes.</p>

	<p pid=".338W.2/1">During 2002 it is estimated that between 20&ndash;30 per cent. of the opium poppy crop was destroyed through a UK led eradication and compensation scheme. However a more permanent solution to the problem of poppy crop production will only come about once alternative livelihood opportunities have been identified for poor people, and the law is enforced against opium traders and other criminal elements. My department is working closely with the Afghan authorities to strengthen law enforcement, interdiction and eradication capabilities, and supporting a number of initiatives to improve security and the overall environment for the generation of alternative livelihoods. I also recently approved #1 million of support to a UNDP administered National Area Based Programme that is expected to generate thousands of jobs in rural areas, and #1 million of support to the Aga Khan Foundation for a rural support programme in Badakhshan, a major poppy producing province in Afghanistan.</p>

As part of a wider international effort we work directly with the Palestinian Authority and other Palestinian organisations, and through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. In the financial year 2001&ndash;02 originally planned programme expenditure of #18 million was increased to nearly #40 million. This financial year the original planning framework of #25 million has been increased to #32 million. We also contribute significantly through our share of EC funding.</p>

	<p pid=".340W.5/1">My Department is focusing its efforts on two broad objectives: improving the overall effectiveness of European Community development assistance and increasing its poverty focus.</p>
	<p pid=".340W.5/2">We welcome the positive steps that have been taken to reform EC development assistance in the past few years. These are beginning to show results in some areas, but significant improvements are still needed. We are pressing the EC to pursue its reform efforts vigorously in order to implement the November 2000 EC Development Policy, which for the first time makes poverty reduction the central objective of EC development programmes. Reform needs to produce speedier delivery, better impact and more capacity for policy dialogue in the field. Harmonising and simplifying the EC's cumbersome administrative and financial procedures is also a priority, along with work to establish a more coherent policy framework for EC aid.</p>
	<p pid=".340W.5/3">My Department is also working for agreement that a much greater share of EC aid should be allocated to low income countries where it will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In 2000, only 38 per cent. of EC aid was spent in low-income countries compared to 70 per cent. in 1990. This is far too low and indicates that EC aid is having a much less impact than it should on reducing poverty and contributing to building stability and prosperity worldwide.</p>

	<p pid=".341W.2/1">DFID, the UN, and other donors in Zimbabwe work in close unison, and share the fundamental principle that humanitarian assistance should be provided on the basis of need alone. Donor funded programmes are closely monitored, and where problems are found or reported, the UN and donors are working together to seek to resolve them through mediation and complaints procedures. In a few cases, food distribution has been suspended until agreements have been reached that allow programmes to resume according to plan. The UN's view is that so far, very little food has been lost or diverted from its intended beneficiaries. We have not had any problems of this nature in our bilateral programme.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.2/2">There is credible evidence however that food is being distributed or sold by the Government of Zimbabwe through the national Grain Marketing Board in support of political objectives. We deplore this, as well as the obstruction of work of some non-governmental organisations which also appears to be politically motivated.</p>

	<p pid=".341W.5/1">UK assistance to Kosovo began in June 1999, immediately after the NATO intervention. We delivered a #110 million programme of humanitarian assistance that included food supply, shelter, health care, mine clearance, support to the energy and water sectors, small and medium enterprise development and funding for international agencies. We also provided budgetary support.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.5/2">From 2000, we started to develop a longer term programme to help build the local capacity and institutions to tackle Kosovo's development and transition needs. Our Kosovo Strategy Paper, published in August 2001 covered support for civil and political rights, justice systems, economic restructuring, health care, social policy, public administration and minorities. We spent #12.5 million in 2000&ndash;01 and #11.7 million in 2001&ndash;02 on technical assistance and budget support; planning figures are #6.5 million in 2002&ndash;03 and #8 million in 2003&ndash;04 (figures are for Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo).</p>
	<p pid=".341W.5/3">Our main funding contribution to Kosovo is through our approximately 20 per cent. share of European Community programmes. This amounted to #170 million for 1999&ndash;2001 and is estimated at #110 million for 2002&ndash;03. We work closely with the EC to improve the effectiveness and impact of its programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.5/4">We have just completed our first review of the Kosovo strategy. This highlighted that while international aid had been successful so far in meeting humanitarian and reconstruction needs, new challenges were to help the elected provisional institutions of self-government to take on their full responsibilities under the framework agreement agreed with the UN, to create the right environment for growth and reform as levels of international aid decline and to establish mechanisms for Kosovo to access loans from the international financial institutions.</p>

	<p pid=".343W.2/1">None, but the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and enlargement on poor countries has been discussed extensively by relevant Government departments for many months. In July, my department took an initiative to invite representatives from all EU governments to discuss ''The impact of CAP reform on Developing Countries''. These discussions are continuing with the next meeting in The Hague in January.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.2/2">It remains clear that without CAP reform, we cannot deliver on the promise we made at Doha to improve trading opportunities for the developing world. The UK will continue to press for a Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the CAP, which should lead to a farming policy which promotes sustainable development, protects and enhances the environment, encourages high standards, guarantees safe food and enables us to fulfil our international commitments.</p>

Because of our concerns that this trade could lead to abuses in respect of bear bile, from last year, the UK banned <i>all</i> commercial trade in bear (<i>Ursidae</i>) bile or gall bladders (irrespective of whether or not they come from captive bred specimens), on the grounds that this trade is likely to be detrimental to the species.</p>

	<p pid=".351W.2/1">Energy conservation authorities have identified their own targets, based on the measures in their energy conservation reports. The reports show measures that, if implemented, have the potential to achieve an overall improvement of 30 per cent. over twelve years from 1996. These targets are not statutory and it is for authorities, working in partnership with others, to implement the measures in order to meet them.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.2/2">Authorities report progress towards their targets each year. A list of the latest progress by authorities was placed in the Libraries of the House following my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State's reply to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/808" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-19">19 June 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-06-19.371"><i>Official Report</i>, column 371W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.2/3">The overall average reported improvement in the first five years was 8 per cent. It is therefore clear that authorities are not going to make the improvements they originally hoped for. Decisions about the future role of local authorities in local energy efficiency are expected to be covered in the Energy White Paper, which the Government aims to publish early in the new year.</p>

This target will require the central Government estate to be performing better than the national average.

	<p pid=".354W.2/1">There have been a large number of home energy conservation projects since 1997, the large majority of which are outside the Government's direct control. These include projects by local authorities, gas and electricity suppliers, the Energy Saving Trust and voluntary organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/2">The Government's main programme in England for tackling fuel poverty through improving energy efficiency is the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, now marketed as the Warm Front Team. The scheme is funded by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs. Warm Front was launched in June 2000 and provides packages of insulation and heating measures up to #2,500 to private sector households, on certain benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/3">For the period June 2000 to June 2002, Warm Front assisted over 400,000 households and spent over #200 million on installing measures. The programme remains on target to reach our PSA requirement of assisting 600,000 vulnerable homes by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".354W.5/1">It would be helpful to be able to make better comparisons between comparable authorities' performance. But this could only be achieved by having a single monitoring method. Defra has provided software to all authorities in England, free of charge, to help them monitor improvements in domestic energy efficiency. This is just one of a number of energy efficiency monitoring tools available. We believe that authorities should have the choice of which software package or monitoring method they use. They do, however, have to provide evidence as part of their annual progress reporting that they are using a robust monitoring method.</p>

	<p pid=".359W.5/2">The GM Inspectorate has the authority to carry out testing for the presence of GMOs in two contexts: first, as part of inspection of authorised releases of GMOs into the environment, and, secondly, in support of the audit of seed importers and producers to ensure that non-GM seed stocks are free from unauthorised GM events.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.5/3">Testing as part of the inspection of authorised releases of GMOs is carried out whenever there is reason to believe that material in addition to that for which consent is held has been released or to confirm the GM status of volunteer plants and bolters. However, the issue of testing of released GMOs is being considered as part of the proposed review inspection and enforcement activities. Since June 2000, there have been 3 tests (comprised of 41 analytical tests) of seed prior to sowing to confirm its purity and 32 tests of volunteers and bolters. None of these tests showed the presence of unauthorised GMOs.</p>
	<p pid=".359W.5/4">Since June 2000 the GM Inspectorate has carried out a total of 86 audits of seed companies. These audits have monitored the precautions that seed companies have taken as regards the adventitious presence of GM events in seeds. As part of this process a series of tests (18) have been carried out to clarify results presented by seed companies. In no case was the presence of an unauthorised GMO detected.</p>

	<p pid=".363W.5/1">In Lancashire, in common with the rest of the country, the sustainability of many dairy farming enterprises has been adversely affected by low farmgate milk prices. The reasons for these low prices are complex, but include high levels of production earlier in the year combined with the effects of low world prices for dairy commodities. The average farmgate price of milk has recovered from its seasonal low in May, but it is still too low for many dairy farmers to be able to maintain the level of investment required to sustain their businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.5/2">The prices negotiated between farmers and purchasers, or indeed processors and retailers, are private commercial matters in which the Government cannot get involved. Nevertheless, I do welcome the recent price rises announced by major retailers and dairy processors and hope that these will help alleviate some of the difficulties faced by dairy farmers. The Government can influence the environment in which price negotiations take place through the mechanisms of the dairy CAP and, during the period of lowest prices, we actively supported measures taken in Brussels to support Community markets and encourage exports.</p>

	<p pid=".363W.8/2">The Department, the devolved administrations and the UK Environment Agencies have been, and continue to participate very actively in the development of the Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) of the Water Framework Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.8/3">This involvement has included leading or co-leading on development of guidance on estuarial and coastal waters, heavily modified water bodies and impact of human activity on surface and groundwater. In addition the UK has participated in all the working groups of the CIS, including the working group on integrated testing in pilot river basins. The UK is also actively involved with current discussions at Community level on the future development of the CIS and aims to play a full part in future work.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.8/4">Defra and the Environment Agency have not so far proposed any pilot river basin projects for England as part of the CIS. The Environment Agency intends to focus it's efforts on the actual implementation of the Water Framework Directive to ensure initial legal obligations are complied with relating to all river basins. Pilot studies are being undertaken or planned, including in England, to answer specific issues. The experience gained will be fed back to the integrated testing project.</p>

The last Municipal Waste Management Survey shows that in the year 2000&ndash;2001, 21 per cent. of municipal waste in England had value recovered from it. Of this, 12 per cent. is recycling and composting, and 9 per cent. energy recovery through incineration.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.3/21">Member States are required under European legislation to cross-check all animals subject to bovine subsidy against their cattle tracing databases. The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has accordingly cross-checked claimed animals against the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS Cattle Tracing System (CTS)). All cross checks have been completed and RPA has discovered a large number of discrepancies. Many of these arise because of the failure by cattle keepers to notify the CTS when animals are born, die or are moved. This has resulted in RPA being unable to meet the statutory payment deadlines in all cases on bovine schemes, although it is making every effort to ensure all outstanding payments are made as soon as possible. The RPA regrets the delays and the impact on farmer's cash flow, but cannot ignore the discrepancies discovered.</p>

	<p pid=".367W.2/1">In June, my Department issued the results of a risk assessment on the use of composting to dispose of catering waste and animal by-products. The objective of this study was to determine the risks to public and animal health from the land-spreading of the catering wastes after treatment by composting or in a biogas plant and to compare these with the risks from existing disposal routes.</p>
	<p pid=".367W.2/2">In summary, the project determined whether current composting processes give a sufficient degree of pathogen destruction such that the risks to humans and animals are acceptably low and the material may be safely spread to land. The composting route for catering waste potentially presents lower risks to grazing animals than disposal through land-fill. This is because composting offers extra control points. First, the raw catering waste could be delivered to enclosed receptions where birds and animals cannot gain access. Second, a no-grazing period could be enforced after application of the compost to land. Following the risk assessment, we hope to consult shortly on amendments to the Animal By-Products Order which would allow catering waste to be composted and used on land as a soil conditioner rather than going to landfill.</p>

	<p pid=".369W.5/1">The Government take the future of energy from biomass very seriously and considers that energy crops have the potential to make a significant contribution to renewable energy and climate change targets. We are providing support to develop the sector through the Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme and the Energy Crops Scheme. The funding available from the Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme could deliver about 100MW of generating capacity. Discussions are continuing on the future of ARBRE and there are a number of lessons from the project that can be applied to future high efficiency biomass plants. The project has shown that short rotation coppice can be established and grown at the scale required to form an important element of the fuel supply. Useful information has been learned on improving yields, the use of varieties to minimise pest and disease impact and on harvesting technology.</p>

In the case of crops to provide fuel for the ARBRE power station growers assigned the payments to ARBRE Energy and this Department and the Forestry Commission were asked to make the payments to the third party. 12 growers qualified for grants to plant crops to provide fuel for ARBRE under the Energy Crops Scheme. A further 46 growers qualified for grants under the Woodland Grants Scheme. The Energy Crops Scheme requires that crops are used for the production of energy but it is too early to consider any recovery of grant as discussions are continuing on the future of ARBRE. Should it become necessary the Department will work closely with growers to access one of the alternative energy markets.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.5/1">The UK has consistently opposed the registration of feta cheese as an EU protected food name on the grounds that we believed that the name ''feta'' had become a generic product and so not eligible for protection. However, in the absence of a contrary decision by the Council, feta was registered by the Commission as a protected food name on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-15">15 October</phrase>. While disappointed with this particular outcome, we are satisfied in general with the protected food name scheme and the procedures for registration of products. The scheme was highlighted by the Curry Commission Report on the Future of Farming Food as being a useful opportunity for UK producers to protect the character of their product and secure a premium price for it.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.8/2">Defra is working with stakeholders on a fundamental review of agri-environment schemes. A first round of public consultation was held earlier this year and a second round of consultation will begin shortly. A key objective of the review is to streamline the administration of the schemes, making full use of modern technology.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.8/3">One strand of the review is based on the recommendation by the Policy Commission on the Future of Food and Farming that the current schemes should be complemented by a new, simple entry-level scheme, open to as many farms in England as possible. Defra is designing a pilot for such a scheme which will be launched in four areas next year. The scheme would reward positive management of existing features as well as enhancement. Subject to success of the pilot, it is hoped that the new scheme could be rolled out nationally in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.8/4">Like the existing schemes, it would be co-financed from EU and national funds and would include compliance checks on a percentage of applicants in accordance with EU requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".375W.2/1">The Association of British Insurers have stated that all properties defended to at least a standard of 1.3 per cent. (1 in 75) annual probability, should be able to obtain cover. Properties currently protected to a lesser extent, but where defences to meet the above standard are planned for the next 5 years, should also be able to get cover. The ABI have assured us that undefended properties or ''exceptional cases'' will be assessed on an individual basis and consideration given as to whether some form of insurance cover can be given.

However, it must be recognised that insurance companies need to take a commercial decision as to what risk they will cover and on what terms. It is impossible to make a generalisation about areas where flood cover will be unavailable as in a competitive market as what is unacceptable to one company may well be acceptable to another.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-19">19 July 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/2">At the request of the department, The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) has, since November 2000, been considering the criticisms of the safety of Aventis' (formerly AgrEvo and now Bayer Cropscience) GM maize, T25, which has been raised at the hearing into the addition of CHARDON LL (a variety of T25) to the national list of seeds. ACRE subsequently requested advice from ACAF on the animal feed aspects of the criticisms.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/3">AgrEvo applied in 1995 through the French authorities for approval under EU directive 90/220 to place its GM T25 maize on the European market for cultivation and use as animal feed. In June 1995 France circulated the dossier to the other member states with the recommendation that T25 maize be given approval. After due consideration European Union member states approved the marketing of T25 maize in 1998. As part of this process ACRE considered the French opinion and dossier supporting the application and gave its advice to the government in June 1996. This was prior to the formation of ACAF. The chicken feeding study was not part of the original dossier submitted in 1996 and so was not considered by ACRE. A summary of the study was circulated by the French in 1997 as supplementary information on the nutritional qualities of the maize. The French authorities were of the view that the study did not add any significant new information to the dossier. Officials in MAFF considered the study, but as it was a nutritional rather than a safety study, it was not sent to ACRE.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/4">In reconsidering aspects of the T25 maize dossier ACRE has asked ACAF to look at the available data and advise on the substance of the criticisms raised at the CHARDONLL hearing in relation to animal feed and in particular the mortality rate in the chicken study. The growth rates in the two groups were broadly equivalent, but of the 140 fed T25 maize grain, 10 chicks (7 per cent.) died, whereas only 5 of the 140 (3.5 per cent.) died in the control group. In this type of experiment up to 8 per cent. would be expected to die. So the mortality rate is within the expected range. The question raised in the CHARDONLL is whether this is of concern and worthy of further investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/5">A copy of the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-05">5 September 2001</phrase> from ACAF to ACRE setting out the committee's views on the whole dossier and the chicken feeding study has been placed in the Library. A copy is also on the public register held by my Department in Ashdown House</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/6">In summary, ACAF is satisfied that, on the basis of the information presented by AgroEvo, there is nothing to indicate that T25 maize grain or its products pose any more risk to animals or humans than non-GM maize varieties if used in animal feed. I have asked ACAF for their reasons for this conclusion. However, ACAF advised ACRE that the data in the dossier are not sufficient to conclude at this stage, that T25 silage (rather than grain) is substantially equivalent to other maize varieties. Although it is unlikely that T25 maize silage is unsafe to feed to animals, its equivalence should be confirmed. The UK regulatory authority has subsequently written to Aventis to request further data on the composition of T25 silage.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.0/7">ACRE has given preliminary advice that nothing has been raised that warrants taking immediate action under the directive to withdraw T25 maize from the market. ACRE will shortly be issuing its advice on concerns raised during the CHARDON LL hearing, including criticisms of the chicken feeding study. This advice will also include ACRE's response to points raised at its T25 maize open hearing held in February 2002. At their hearing the Committee, in conjunction with ACAF, invited a number of witnesses and experts including Dr. Kestin and Dr. Knowles. Guided by the evidence taken at this meeting, any subsequent comments on the evidence from the public and the background information that is already available, ACRE will advise Ministers further on the validity of the T25 risk assessment.</p>

In particular Ofgem participated in the steering group for a study of the emergency preparedness of the transmission and distribution systems which we published in May. Following Sunday's storms I announced that we would be testing the conclusions of this study, which were generally positive, against the actual response in difficult conditions. I have asked for a review of how companies performed and for recommendations to help them ensure that future supplies to consumers are not affected to the same extent. Ofgem will be fully involved in the review.</p>

	<p pid=".381W.0/2">The aim of the study was to assess the role that motorsport could play in the promotion and development of energy efficiency automotive technologies. A follow up EEMS presentation was recently made by the MIA to the world governing body of motorsport to explore how the proposals of the study could be demonstrated in a motor racing context. DTI, RDAs and other involved in the EEMS initiative are planning an industry showcase event and other activities to encourage industry to implement its findings.</p>

	<p pid=".385W.2/2">Following the storms I asked for a review of how the electricity distribution companies performed and for recommendations to help them ensure that future supplies to consumers are not affected to the same extent. This review will cover the supply problems experienced, including in the Norfolk area, and the quality of information provided to the public by the companies. I hope to publish it during December. Our follow-up plan will certainly include discussions with the industry about what lessons can be learnt.</p>

	<p pid=".388W.0/2">Earlier this year I commissioned a study into the resilience of the electricity transmission and distribution systems in Great Britain. The study focussed on the measures that are in place to reduce the risk of an emergency from major supply interruptions and the ability to manage the restoration of supplies in the event of widespread disruption. One conclusion arising from the report was that the electricity companies are generally better prepared and equipped to handle emergencies than was the case a decade ago.</p>

	<p pid=".391W.2/2">Over the past 18 months, the Government have received a number of representations from Nordic countries about discharges of technetium-99 from Sellafield. My Department, jointly with the Department of Health, has responsibility for the regulatory regime under which such discharges are controlled.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.2/3">Representations have been received from both the Governments of Norway, Finland, Denmark and Sweden and organisations representing fisheries industries in Scandinavia. The representations have centred on concerns that technetium-99, which does not occur naturally but is discharged from Sellafield, can be detected at very low levels, in marine organisms off the coasts of Scandinavian countries. All radioactive discharges from a site such as Sellafield have to be made within the limits of discharge authorizations set by the Environment Agency. The current levels of discharge of technetium-99 are well within the relevant discharge limit. At Ministers' request, the Environment Agency has recently reviewed the discharges of technetium-99 and made recommendations about how its discharge limit could be further reduced. The Government is currently considering its response to the Agency's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.3/1">Specific childcare funding of #36 million is available through the Learner Support Funds (LSF) to all post 16 Further Education Institutions (FEIs). Students in colleges can access funding of up to #4000 for each child for each year of study. Students in school and college 6th forms have access to the same level of funding through a pilot scheme which is aimed at lone parents. FEIs also have the further flexibility to use their general LSF to top up childcare funding and to meet other additional costs, such as transport to childminders.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.3/2">A childcare grant was introduced in September 2001 to help full-time higher education student parents with childcare costs. The childcare grant covers the whole year, paying 85 per cent. of actual childcare costs for 40 weeks during term times and short vacations and 70 per cent. of actual costs for 12 weeks during the student's long vacation. In the academic year 2002&ndash;03, a student parent with one child may receive a childcare grant of up to #5,724 (with two or more children up to #8,480). This may be supplemented by other dependants grants and discretionary support.</p>

For this reason, and since very many of those 53,000 letters are multiple copies of the same letter sent by the same people to different Ministers, it is not possible to provide a more detailed analysis except at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".400W.5/2">Sixty per cent. of the grant is devolved to all maintained schools to raise levels of pupil attainment by funding activities in School Development, Post-Ofsted and Raising Attainment Plans. Fifteen per cent. of the grant is targeted at schools in special measures and secondary schools facing challenging circumstances to bring about urgent improvements. Five per cent. of the grant was to support direct interventions in schools facing challenging circumstances. The remainder is designed to achieve the priorities set out in local education authorities' Educational Development Plans.</p>

The remaining 59 plans in Wave 3 will be submitting proposals at the end of the year, and approved plans will begin operating from April 2003. Programmes bring together local voluntary organisations, statutory agencies, community and faith groups, children and young people and their families to deliver a range of locally co-ordinated preventive services for 5&ndash;13 year olds at risk. Examples of activities include bi-lingual home/school liaison projects, helping children with behavioural difficulties, managing the transition between primary and secondary school, tackling truancy and promoting community cohesion through developing positive perceptions about different cultures.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.8/2">The Children and Young People's Unit gather information on all services supported by the Children's Fund on a quarterly basis. The most recent information available from 38 out of 40 Wave 1 partnerships shows that 584 services were supported during April&ndash;June 2002 (Annex B). No information was gathered from Wave 2 partnerships for April&ndash;June 2002 because the majority of partnerships only received approval in April 2002. The CYPU is gathering service information on all Wave 1 and 2 partnerships for the period July&ndash;September 2002, and this information should be available later this year. It is too soon for the programme to provide an accurate indication of the direct impact on children and their families, but early feedback from children, parents, teachers and other professionals is positive. Individual programmes are already making a difference in improving school attendance, tackling behavioural problems and promoting positive parenting.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.8/3">The Children and Young People's Unit are in the process of selecting a contractor for a national evaluation of the Children's Fund, and work is expected to begin early in 2003. This will draw on the results of local evaluations of achievement against measurable targets which individual partnerships are required to carry out.</p>

All correspondence received at QCA is responded to and dealt with by the relevant team or division. It is therefore not possible to give the figures requested without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.0/3">The procedures for dealing with complaints fall within QCA's Customer Service Charter and are responded to within the 5-day turn-around time described in the charter. QCA replies to any general complaints under their Customer Service Charter. Where schools have concern about the quality of marking of their pupils' scripts and consider that they may have been awarded an incorrect level, a review of marking can be requested. The arrangements for seeking a review of marking are included in QCA's Schools' Guide, sent to schools each year. An application for a review of marking is considered by a panel of senior markers led by the Lead Chief Marker for the subject. Any re-marking that occurs as part of the review procedure is undertaken by a review or senior marker.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.0/4">The number of reviews of marking requested in 2002 is not yet available although early estimates have not shown any significant increase on previous years' figures. Figures for 2001 are available in the Standards Reports published by QCA and will be placed in the House of Commons Library. Figures for 2002 will also be placed in the Library when available.</p>

At this stage we are confident that there will be sufficient growth in demand from young people with the appropriate entry qualifications for higher education to enable us to reach the 50 per cent. target. Provisional figures suggesting a 2 per cent. increase in the number of home domiciled UCAS accepted applications this autumn to UK higher education institutions, shows we are continuing to make progress.</p>

	<p pid=".417W.5/1">In introducing the new system of LEA funding for 2003&ndash;04, we will implement the pledge that no local education authority will lose out in real terms in 2003&ndash;04. The Education Act 2002 incorporates a reserve power that allows the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to set a minimum budget for an authority's schools, if the budget proposed by an authority is seriously inadequate. Changes in the funding of individual schools depend very largely on changes in their pupil numbers. It is open to LEAs, if they wish, to include factors in their school funding formulae which have the effect of protecting individual schools from excessive year-to year reductions in their budget shares.</p>

Nevertheless, the figures indicate that between 40&ndash;45 per cent. of the 312 PRUs nationally reported average contact time for solely registered pupils of 20 hours or more per week. Of the 47 PRUs in London, over 50 per cent. had average contact times with pupils of 20 hours or more per week.

	<p pid=".420W.8/1">It would be inappropriate to undertake any such inquiry whilst the current police investigations into the deaths at Deepcut continue. In the meantime, I am fully aware of the concerns that have been raised about the circumstances surrounding the deaths of soldiers in Army barracks in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".420W.8/2">There are a number of issues being taken forward by the Ministry of Defence in response to the concerns that have been raised about deaths of soldiers in army barracks in the UK. This work includes an appraisal of initial training of non-Officer recruits in all three services. The Defence Committee has also indicated its intention to conduct an inquiry into the general conditions at Deepcut. Following the conclusion of the police investigations into the deaths at Deepcut, the Army will also convene internal Boards of Inquiry into the deaths of Privates Geoff Gray and James Collinson.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.2/1">The annual workforce censuses do not provide information for individual trusts. Oldchurch hospital is part of Barking, Havering and Redbridge National Health Service Trust, which was formed in April 2001. There is therefore no comparable historical information.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.2/2">The Department's vacancy survey collected information for the whole trust as at <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-30">30 March 2002</phrase>. The trust has been ensuring that the impact of vacancies on the quality of care provided to its patients is minimised by being one of the first trusts in London to use the NHS Professionals service. NHS Professionals is a NHS temporary staffing service aimed at reducing reliance on expensive nursing agencies. The trust is also very active in pursuing the <i>Improving Working Lives</i> initiative. A steering group, with cross-trust representation, including staff-side, has been meeting since April to take forward the <i>Improving Working Lives</i> action plan, aimed at achieving practice status early in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".433W.11/1">Where a child is suspected to be suffering, or likely to suffer significant harm, local authority social services departments are required by section 47 of the Children Act 1989 to make enquiries, to enable the local authority to decide whether it should take any action to safeguard or promote the child's welfare.</p>
	<p pid=".433W.11/2">Where, following the outcome of section 47 enquiries, the agencies most involved judge that a child may continue to suffer, or to be at risk of suffering significant harm, the social services department should convene an initial child protection conference. The aim of the conference is to enable those professionals most involved with the child and family to assess all relevant information; to make judgements about the likelihood of a child suffering significant harm in future; and to decide what future action is needed to safeguard the child and promote his or her welfare, how that action will be taken forward, and with what intended outcomes.</p>
	<p pid=".433W.11/3">If a decision is taken that the child is at continuing risk of significant harm, his or her name will be placed on the child protection register, and it will therefore be the case that safeguarding the child requires inter-agency help and intervention delivered through a formal child protection plan. It is also the role of the conference to formulate the outline child protection plan, in as much detail as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".435W.5/2">Area child protection committee (ACPC) expenditure and administrative policy support is a matter for local agreement. As a multi-agency forum, the ACPC should be supported in its work by its main constituent agencies, reflecting the investment of each agency in activities which are of benefit to all, in particular inter-agency training.</p>

	<p pid=".435W.5/4">The Government has welcomed the publication of this report. The Government recognises that there is still more to be done to ensure that the high standards of child protection are applied in every case. That is why it commissioned the Joint Chief Inspectors' report. It is also why my right hon. Friends, the Secretary of State for Health and the Home Secretary set up the statutory Inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming, into the circumstances leading up to, and surrounding, the death of Victoria Climbi&eacute;. The issues raised by Victoria's case are wide-ranging, in terms of both policy and practice, and it is therefore important that we do not do anything that would pre-empt the outcome of the Inquiry. The recommendations of the Joint Chief Inspectors' report and those of the Victoria Climbi&eacute; Inquiry will provide us with an authoritative basis for any reforms to child protection that may need to be made, and if radical reform is necessary we will implement it. The Government will respond to both reports after it has carefully considered them.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.5/1">The impact of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) has been taken into account with the planned expansion in the consultant workforce. The NHS Plan makes a commitment to 1,000 more specialist registrars by 2004. In addition, we have introduced a ''floors and ceilings'' flexibility to allow the National Health Service with an initial ceiling of an additional 540 posts for the period of 2002&ndash;2004 and this will reviewed later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/2">Many solutions to achieve EWTD compliance for junior doctors will involve other professions. Large increases in the nursing workforce and allied health professions have already been achieved and there is a commitment to maintain these levels of growth. These increases in the non-medical workforce will support the development of the non-medical practitioner roles required. The main impact of these practitioners will be in reducing the need to cover at senior house officer level.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/3">It will be inevitable that the changes needed to achieve EWTD compliance will significantly affect the working patterns of doctors in training and also change the traditional one-to-one relationship between a training grade doctor and their consultant.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/4">The Department is currently undertaking a consultation exercise on the Chief Medical Officer's report <i>Unfinished Business: Proposals for reform of the Senior House Officer grade</i>. The report provides proposals for reform of postgraduate medical training, taking into account that proposed reform would be introduced at the same time as implementation of the EWTD. The report argues that the EWTD and training reform are mutually dependent&mdash;the EWTD will require reform in training, which in turn can support implementation of the Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/5">A key proposal in <i>Unfinished Business</i> is that new and shorter higher specialist training programmes should be introduced which would lead to the award of an earlier certificate of completion of specialist training (CCST) for those satisfactorily completing training in the ''generalist'' elements of a specialty. This would have the effect increasing the flow of trained doctors.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/6">The Department will be working with the Deans and the Royal Colleges to ensure that NHS trusts are supported in delivering training with good advice on training models and as a first step the Conference of Postgraduate Medical Deans (COPMED) has produced a document <i>Liberating Learning</i>. This sets out approaches to providing training in the EWTD context.</p>

	<p pid=".448W.2/2">The simple classification of body mass index (BMI) for obesity in adults is not applicable to children. This is because the ratio of the rate of weight gain to height gain changes during normal growth, especially around puberty. Therefore, age and sex-specific reference data&mdash;centile cut-off points&mdash;are necessary to interpret the BMI measurement.</p>
