	<p pid="e.805W.3/4">The process, therefore, is designed to encourage applications from the widest range of candidates possible. This, together with the staff and resources that will be made available to it, will enable the CEHR to promote equality of opportunity and to work towards the elimination of unlawful discrimination on behalf of all those issues covered by the equality legislation, including belief.</p>

The FSA-managed regulatory regime currently covers first charge residential mortgages. Lifetime leases are a form of property transaction and as they do not involve the provision of finance, there are at present no plans to bring them under the regulation of the Financial Services Authority.</p>

Therefore when electoral registers are downloaded each year new juror numbers are allocated and voters do not retain the same juror number. As a result the database can only match between name, address and date of birth. If a voter has moved address since records began and has been summoned more than once it will not show as a match. Also it will not give details of jurors summoned to attend for service in a coroners court as coroners officers summon jurors locally and not through a central system.</p>

No decision has been made about how that amount will be shared between the various non-Olympic good causes.</p>

	<p pid="e.824W.0/19">The urban and rural classifications used in this table are based on those drawn up in 2004 by the Countryside Agency, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Office for National Statistics and the Welsh Assembly Government. The classification is based on population densities across the whole spectrum of 'settlements', or built-up areas, in England and Wales. Urban areas are defined as settlements with a population of 10,000 or more. Census output areas are described as urban or rural depending on whether the majority of the population falls inside a settlement of population 10,000 or more.</p>
	<p pid="e.824W.0/20">Secondly, the classification enables areas to be defined as predominantly urban or predominantly town and fringe, predominantly village or predominantly dispersed (which includes hamlets and isolated dwellings). The town and fringe, village, hamlet and isolated dwelling classifications are taken as being rural.</p>

Since Lord Laming reported, substantial consultation with local service managers, practitioners and the public, supported by evidence from local authority Trailblazer projects, has identified the benefits that arise from introducing an information-sharing index in terms of safeguarding children more effectively and efficiently. Three independent research reports during 2004 supported the business case and have informed index design.</p>

	<p pid="e.836W.2/1">For those commencing courses after the introduction of variable fees in the 2006-07 academic year we expect average student debt of around &pound;15,000. Debts arising from student loans are very different from those from commercial loan products. Repayments are linked to income and only calculated on earnings over &pound;15,000. This means a borrower earning below this threshold does not have to make repayments. For example, someone earning the average graduate starting salary of &pound;18,000 will repay &pound;5.19 per week regardless of the amount borrowed. The Government subsidises the rate of interest on these loans to ensure that borrowers only repay in real terms what they borrowed, however long it takes them.</p>

	<p pid="e.836W.5/1">There are two types of student loans, the first of which, the mortgage-style loans scheme, ceased for new loans in 1998. A range of measures are in place for accounts that fall into arrears. Attempts are made to contact the borrower by letter and telephone to establish borrowers' circumstances, assign or re-assign them to the correct status and treatment, and to re-institute repayments where due. If appropriate, SLC will assign tracing and collection agents and, where necessary, take legal action.</p>
	<p pid="e.836W.5/2">Income contingent loans, made since 1998, are collected through the tax system. The SLC works closely with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to identify borrowers to allow employers to make deductions, and HMRC to collect repayments through the self assessment process, when a borrower is earning over &pound;15,000. As part of this, the SLC regularly contacts those borrowers who are not currently repaying to confirm their details and check their employment status.</p>

We believe that China's family planning policies should be based on the principle of consent, and not coercion, as espoused by the International Conference on Population and Development. At the last round of the UK-China human rights dialogue in July, we raised the case of Chen Guangcheng, a lawyer who highlighted reports of enforced sterilisation and abortion in Linyi City, Shandong province. We also included Chen Guangcheng on a list of cases passed to the Chinese authorities during the visit of Chinese Premier Wen in September. We have not received an official response from the Chinese government. We will continue to raise relevant cases and our concerns about reports of enforced sterilisation and abortion both in our bilateral contacts and with EU partners.</p>

It also identifies priority sectors in which we should be able to make rapid progress in tackling unnecessary regulation. The initial focus is on the automotive, waste and construction sectors.

	<p pid="e.841W.3/1">In June, the European Council called for targets to reduce administrative burdens on Europe's businesses in spring 2007. We expect the European Commission to announce a target for burden reduction in the spring. Vice-President Verheugen, who has responsibility for enterprise and industry, has expressed a strong desire for this burden reduction target to be set at 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.841W.3/2">In October 2005, the Commission announced an ambitious rolling simplification programme listing 220 basic legislative acts to be reviewed over the next three years. We want to see faster progress in delivering against this programme and the UK is working with other member states and EU institutions to agree a process to fast-track simplification proposals. We are also putting forward proposals for further simplification.</p>

Since then it has met on several occasions to discuss administrative and procedural issues related to the establishment of the PBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development anticipate that initially substantive discussions on conflict prevention, conflict resolution and rebuilding on individual post conflict situations will take place in the 'country-specific' meetings.

	<p pid="e.843W.8/1">The UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) has yet to begin its substantive work. Discussions so far have focused on administrative and procedural issues. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of International Development have been working hard in New York, Burundi, Sierra Leone and within the EU to ensure the PBC is flexible, focused on priority peacebuilding issues and avoids the bureaucracy and politicisation that limits the effectiveness of some UN bodies. The provisional rules of procedure agreed by the PBC's organisational committee in June give the commission sufficient flexibility to achieve the goals set out for it in the world summit. However, a real assessment of its workings can only be made after substantive discussions on the first country cases, Burundi and Sierra Leone, have taken place on 12 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">13 October</phrase>.</p>

The Government consider that decision making on individual clinical interventions, whether conventional, complementary or alternative, is for local determination. The cost-effectiveness, efficacy and safety of treatments are all considered when these decisions are being made. There are no centrally held records of NHS referrals for homeopathic treatment.</p>

These reports are then sent on to the National Patient Safety Agency's national reporting and learning system where they are held on an anonymous basis.

	<p pid="e.856W.2/1">In a typical national health service private finance initiative contract, the NHS trust will grant a headlease or a license to its private sector partner under a PFI contract, but retain the freehold interest on the land to be developed. Ownership is a complex area in leased or licensed operations, but we interpret it to relate to the rights and responsibilities involved in providing services to the NHS trust over the concession period, not the underlying asset itself. Information on the private sector owners of the 83 PFI concessions signed with NHS trusts to date are held locally by each NHS trust; to collect this information centrally would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="e.857W.0/1">A pilot study was conducted in 2004 to test the feasibility of collecting radiotherapy episode statistics and the development of the RES system began from then. The RES project collects information on patient treatment and usage of radiotherapy machines from radiotherapy centres, and links this with hospital records data extracted from the national hospital episode statistics (HES) database, using information such as hospital length of stay, diagnosis and procedures performed.</p>
	<p pid="e.857W.0/2">The linked patient record from the RES system enables us for the first time to track the patient pathway for patients who are admitted for hospital care and episodes of radiotherapy treatment. It will allow us to see different patient care patterns, and develop and share national comparative information that has not been available before.</p>
	<p pid="e.857W.0/3">The RES information is collected voluntarily and we are currently standardising the content and definitions of the data collected, so that we can move to improved collection of information in spring 2007. Modifications to the software are also being introduced for the end of 2007. Currently the RES system is at a relatively early stage of development and it is not possible say at this stage say when results from the project will be available. At this time the RES system is unable to accurately measure waiting times for radiotherapy, but as the quality and completeness of information improves, it should be able to measure waiting times.</p>

	<p pid="e.858W.3/1">The Department has been developing a toolkit to help the national health service to implement the key points of the chief medical officer's tuberculosis action plan through effective commissioning and delivery of services. The toolkit will recommend that TB services should always follow the NICE clinical guidelines when treating patients including those with HIV or those who are otherwise immunocompromised. The NICE guidelines contain clear recommendations on the appropriate use of Mantoux tests and interferon gamma tests. Economic modelling was undertaken with various strategies from no action to a two-step strategy with either tuberculin skin tests (TST, which cover both Heaf and Mantoux tests) followed by interferon gamma testing, or serial interferon gamma tests. Of these options, the model provided most support, on grounds of cost-effectiveness, for a two-step approach with an initial TST, followed by an interferon gamma test to confirm positivity. The guideline development group members also supported this because of clinical utility and feasibility.</p>
	<p pid="e.858W.3/2">Based on this, the Health Protection Agency is developing more detailed practical guidance about the use of gamma interferon tests. It is expected that this guidance will be available to the NHS before the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.858W.3/3">The NICE guideline was published in February 2006 and it is too early to assess how widely its recommendations are being implemented. NICE plans to evaluate its implementation tools, including that for TB, shortly.</p>

	<p pid="e.859W.5/1">NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is responsible for managing blood supplies in England and north Wales as well as running the British bone marrow register. This is one of three registers in the United Kingdom. The national blood service, which is an operating division of NHSBT, recruits blood donors from the general public and potential bone marrow donors are recruited from the active blood donor populations.</p>
	<p pid="e.859W.5/2">Data are not collected on waiting times for bone marrow transplants. This is due to the way the bone marrow registers operate. The BBMR receives around 30 worldwide search requests per day, which equates to about 3,000 a year. However, using the search requests it is difficult to quantify how many people actually require a transplant since it is not known if these searches are for people awaiting a transplant or searches for patients who have no immediate need for a transplant, but who may do should their condition deteriorate.</p>
	<p pid="e.859W.5/3">However, for those patients who do receive a bone marrow transplant from a BBMR donor the average waiting time from the search to receipt of the bone marrow is 133 days. This delay is mainly due to the health of the patient and the transplant centre timetable.</p>

	<p pid="e.860W.2/1">There are currently three bone marrow registries in the United Kingdom and these are linked to an international register bone marrow donors worldwide (BMDW). BMDW is an internet-based database which is available to transplant centres to assess the potential number of donors and on which registry they are found. A search for a suitable tissue- match will take place across the bone marrow registries.</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/2">Once a suitable donor has been found (this involves tissue typing a number of potential donors to ensure as a good a match as possible), either the donor will be asked to attend an apheresis clinic for approximately a week, where they will receive injections (three injections are given at the donor's home prior to the final one at the apheresis clinic in a national blood service centre) to boost stem cells, prior to a stem cell donation. Alternatively, the donor will be invited to attend a British bone marrow register nominated hospital where the bone marrow will be collected under anaesthetic.</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/3">After the stem cells have been donated, they are given to the patient in the form of a stem cell infusion, in a similar way to which a blood transfusion is given. The stem cells migrate to the bone marrow where they form a new immune system.</p>

	<p pid="e.867W.3/1">Supervision orders that are issued in other countries or jurisdictions, including the Isle of Man, do not have effect in the United Kingdom. However, the provisions of part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 provide that, when someone is convicted of a sexual offence outside the United Kingdom, the police can apply to a magistrates court for a 'notification order'. A notification order has the effect of requiring the offender to register their details to the police as if they had been convicted of an offence in this country. To be made subject to a notification order, the offender must satisfy three conditions:</p>
	<p pid="e.867W.3/2" class="indent">(i) they have been cautioned for or convicted of an offence comparable to one in schedule 3 to the Act, i.e. an offence which requires registration in the United Kingdom;</p>
	<p pid="e.867W.3/3" class="indent">(ii) the conviction or caution was received on or after <phrase class="date" code="1997-09-01">1 September 1997</phrase> (the date on which the sex offenders register came into force). Or the offender received his conviction or caution before that date but on one September 1997 was still serving his sentence for the offence; and</p>
	<p pid="e.867W.3/4" class="indent">(iii) the notification period has not expired.</p>
	<p pid="e.867W.3/5">In 2004-05, the police in England and Wales obtained 22 notification orders from magistrates.</p>
	<p pid="e.867W.3/6">The current guidance issued to the police is that, where they know the conditions are met, they should apply for a notification order; they do not need to demonstrate that the order is necessary to protect the public from the risk of serious sexual harm. Furthermore, if the conditions are met, then the legislation states that the magistrate must issue the order. Becoming a registered sex offender will also ensure that the authorities are required to establish arrangements for assessing and managing the risk posed by that offender.</p>
	<p pid="e.867W.3/7">In addition, where a sex offender has been convicted overseas for a relevant offence or an equivalent offence and the police believe that they pose a risk of serious sexual harm to the public, the police can apply for a sexual offences prevention order which places restrictions on the individual's behaviour.</p>

This addresses not only the promotion of increased choice, but also the steps that might be taken to reduce the risk of an existing firm leaving the market, and to reduce the uncertainty and disruption in the event of an audit firm leaving the market. Further work is in hand and the FRC is planning to publish a progress report in the first quarter of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.870W.9/1">The Office of Fair Trading recommendations relate to credit card default charges. The OFT has stated that it believes that credit card default charges had been generally set at a significantly higher level than was fair and set a &pound;12 threshold for OFT intervention unless there were exceptional business factors. In response to this, credit card issuers have agreed to reduce their default charges&mdash;the majority by almost half.</p>
	<p pid="e.870W.9/2">As a result of these reductions in charges across the market, the OFT is satisfied that no further intervention is warranted in this area at this time and that this change has brought about substantial benefits for consumers. The OFT remains of the view that the broad principles do read across to the retail banking area and has decided to undertake further work on the application of these principles to bank current accounts. This fact-finding exercise is expected to take between three to six months, at which stage the OFT will consider whether a further detailed investigation of the fairness of individual bank default charges is needed.</p>

	<p pid="e.872W.8/2">Measures to counter fraud are built into the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vibration white finger compensation schemes. The external review conducted in 2005 concluded that these measures were sensible and proportionate. When appropriate, we refer fraud matters to the police. I would encourage hon. Members with evidence of potential fraud to do likewise.</p>

	<p pid="e.875W.8/1">At current cycle helmet wearing rates, making them compulsory would cause enforcement difficulties and without greater public acceptance could have an adverse effect on the levels of cycling. The Department believes that it is sensible for cyclists, and especially children, to protect themselves by wearing a cycle helmet, and we encourage them to do so. A review commissioned by the Department concluded that overall there is evidence that bicycle helmets can be effective at reducing the incidence and severity of head, brain and upper facial injuries and that they can be effective in reducing injury for users of all ages, though particularly for children. The report also concludes that there is evidence that compulsory helmet wearing may discourage some people from cycling, leading to decreased bicycle use.</p>

	<p pid="e.877W.3/1">The Government concluded that a requirement for an enhanced business review, in line with the requirements of the European accounts modernisation directive, is preferable to a requirement for a statutory operating and financial review for quoted companies. This is consistent with the Government's approach to company law reform of simplifying company law, reducing the regulatory burden on business and promoting effective shareholder engagement. The enhanced business review will meet key narrative reporting requirements and preserve the appropriate financial and other key reporting requirements of the OFR, specifically including information relating to employee and environmental issues, where these are relevant to an understanding of the business, while imposing considerably less cost than the operating and financial review. The new reporting regime demonstrates the Government's ongoing commitment to strategic forward-looking narrative reporting.</p>

Other MIDSS customers include: HM Treasury in their analysis and assessment of macro-economic developments; the devolved authorities for regional accounting purposes; the Bank of England in their analysis of IoS for the Monetary Policy Committee; and the Department of Trade and Industry for operational use and to help inform policy. MIDSS data are also required by Eurostat under the EU Short Term Statistics Regulation.</p>

	<p pid="e.883W.2/4" class="indent">Both the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Retail Prices Index (RPI) are based on the prices of a &quot;basket&quot; of around 650 goods and services that are purchased by the vast majority of UK households.</p>
	<p pid="e.883W.2/5" class="indent">Each product or service is weighted to reflect its relative expenditure with weights derived from a number of sources including the ONS Expenditure and Food Survey (in the case of the RPI) and National Accounts (in the case of the CPI). Each year the selection of products for the basket is reviewed and updated expenditure weights calculated with considerable care taken to ensure that the final selection is representative of UK household spending patterns and so the basket is kept up-to-date.</p>
	<p pid="e.883W.2/6" class="indent">Around 120,000 prices are collected each month. 110,000 prices are collected from retail outlets in around 150 shopping areas or out of town retail park areas throughout the UK. In addition a further 10,000 prices are collected centrally each month, typically for things like holidays, housing and air-fares.</p>
	<p pid="e.883W.2/7" class="indent">The index is &quot;chain linked&quot; to allow comparisons to be made over more than one year and by comparing the index at one point in time with the corresponding time point the previous year, an annual rate of change (often termed &quot;inflation&quot;) can be calculated.</p>

In such cases, where award notices are issued they are shown as a nil rate. As claims can only be backdated for three months, this ensures that people whose income is expected to be too high for there to be any rate of entitlement at the start of the year may nevertheless have full entitlement at end of the year if their income is subsequently reduced.</p>

	<p pid="e.890W.2/1">In December 2005, the PPF published an estimate of the total amount of levy that would need to be collected for the 2006-07 levy year. This estimate was &pound;575 million. The proportion of that total amount payable by an individual scheme is calculated on a scheme specific basis, based on the risk of that scheme entering into the PPF while also ensuring the cost to individual schemes is both affordable and proportionate. The PPF consulted on their proposals for levy calculation in 2005 and they were well received by industry. The PPF also included in their proposals incentives for schemes to reduce the amount of levy payable such as by putting contingent asset arrangements in place.</p>
	<p pid="e.890W.2/2">The PPF has also put in place a cap to ensure no scheme pays more than the equivalent of 0.5 per cent. of its liabilities. For individual schemes, the cost of a levy at &pound;575 million will be broadly comparable to the amount spent on administration costs or fund management charges.</p>

	<p pid="e.891W.3/1">The assumptions that underpin Figure 1.xiv of the pensions White Paper &quot;Security in retirement: Towards a New Pension System&quot; concerning the employer contributions paid after 2012 by employers who currently offer pension benefits are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="e.891W.3/2" class="indent">(a) For individuals who are already members of these schemes or who join by 2012 we have assumed: no change in membership; no change in employer contribution for employers that offer three percent or more; and that employers that offer less than three per cent will offer three per cent when personal accounts come into force.</p>
	<p pid="e.891W.3/3" class="indent">(b) For individuals who would not receive employer contributions without auto-enrolment but do receive these contributions as a result of auto-enrolment we have assumed that:</p>
	<p pid="e.891W.3/4" class="indent">(i) 3.3 million employees who work for employers currently running pension schemes with a three percent or more employer contribution will be automatically enrolled, whether into an existing scheme or a personal account. We assumed that around one-third will opt out, implying an increase in pension membership of 1.7 million. We have estimated the cost to employers based on a three per cent employer contribution.</p>
	<p pid="e.891W.3/5" class="indent">(ii) 7.5 million employees who work for employers that run pension schemes with contributions of less than three per cent will be automatically enrolled, whether into existing scheme or personal accounts. We assumed that around one-third will opt out, implying an increase of 5.3 million individuals receiving an employer contribution of three per cent and a further increase in pension membership of 3.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.891W.3/6" class="indent">(c) We assume that individuals who would join the schemes after 2012 even without auto-enrolment replace similar existing scheme members at constant cost.</p>

	<p pid="e.892W.3/1">There are currently a number of special rules within the benefit system to take account of the particular circumstances of people with terminal illnesses. For example, there are special rules to help terminally ill people who are not expected to live longer than six months to receive immediate payment of higher-rate attendance allowance or the highest rate care component of disability living allowance without the need to meet the normal entitlement conditions. These claims are currently processed in an average of five to six days</p>
