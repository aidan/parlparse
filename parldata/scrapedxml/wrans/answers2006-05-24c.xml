	<p pid="c.1772W.2/1">Classroom assistants are part of the Education and Library Boards' overall Job Evaluation exercise that commenced in 1995. Since that time, Boards have been conducting a range of job evaluations for some 25,000 staff in total. It was acknowledged at the start that this would be a complex exercise that would take a considerable amount of time. It was therefore agreed that the effective date of any re-grading would be <phrase class="date" code="1995-01-01">1 January 1995</phrase> so that no member of staff would be disadvantaged by having to wait for the evaluation of their post.</p>
	<p pid="c.1772W.2/2">Classroom assistants are the last major group of staff (some 7,000) for which Job Evaluation agreement remains outstanding and I am told that negotiations between the Education and Library Boards and the trade union side on the job evaluation process for classroom assistants are at an advanced stage. A total of &pound;25.7 million has already been made available to cover costs resulting from the evaluation exercise. My Department has made clear to the Boards, as employers, the importance of reaching a speedy settlement that is affordable within those sizeable resources already provided and awaits further details from them as to how this objective will be delivered.</p>

	<p pid="c.1772W.5/1">Chip and PIN has had a phased introduction into Northern Ireland, with some outlets offering the facility prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase>. After that date, the use of PIN became mandatory with some exceptions, including cases where cardholders had not received upgraded cards or where outlets had not yet introduced the appropriate technology.

	<p pid="c.1772W.5/13">There are many types of 'plastic card fraud' and while early indications suggest that chip and PIN has made an impact on 'Card Present Fraud' where a PIN is required, there could be a migration to other forms of card fraud such as CNP (Card Not Present). An example of CNP fraud is internet, mail order type transactions where a PIN is not required.</p>
	<p pid="c.1772W.5/14">In 2005, 'Plastic losses' (including ATM fraud such as skimming, account/identity takeover, fraudulent application fraud and compromised card use) amounted to approximately &pound;532,000; the level of cheque crime for 2005 was estimated to be &pound;4,128,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.1778W.6/1">The total cost of tsunami rehabilitation and recovery in Sri Lanka has been estimated at&pound;1.3 billion. Support in excess of &pound;1.7 billion has been pledged, plus a further &pound;800 million from non-governmental organisations. The Government of Sri Lanka's Development Assistance Database records most major recovery programmes and shows that to date approximately &pound;650 million has been disbursed on 686 projects and programmes. There will also be a range of programmes, particularly in the NGO sector, which are not recorded on the database. Within these figures, DFID has committed &pound;19.8 million for tsunami relief of which some &pound;18.8 million has been disbursed. In addition we have pledged some &pound;41 million for debt relief, of which approximately &pound;4 million has been spent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1780W.2/1">DFID has a rapidly increasing programme of development assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In 2001-02 the UK had a &pound;7 million programme of humanitarian aid. In 2005-06, the UK spent approximately &pound;57 million on a package of emergency humanitarian aid and longer term development activity. We have &pound;63 million available this financial year. Since October 2005, DFID has had a fully devolved office of 33 staff in the DRC (11 UK based and 22 staff appointed in country). The UK is committed to supporting poverty reduction and sustainable development in the DRC in the long-term.</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/2">Our current programme in the DRC is divided into four themes that reflect the transition context in the country&mdash;the first democratic elections for 40 years are due to be held this summer. As the DRC moves out of transition, the nature of our engagement will evolve accordingly. Where possible, we work in a collaborative or harmonised way with other partners and, as far as we can, in support of the Government's processes and systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/3">We are in the process of developing a full Country Assistance Plan for the DRC&mdash;which will be completed over the course of 2006, after discussion with the new Government. We will do this as much as possible in conjunction with other donors.</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/4">Our current transition programme follows the following themes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/5" class="italic"> Security and the Rule of Law</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/6">Support for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants through the Multi-Country Demobilisation and Re-integration Programme (MDRP), support to army integration, reform of the police and justice sector, and local level peace building and dialogue initiatives through non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/7" class="italic"> Functioning State</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/8">This includes support for the transition institutions (such as the Parliament, Electoral Commission and High Media Authority), the establishment of a professional and impartial media sector, and preparation for elections. The UK is the largest bilateral donor to the electoral process in the DRC.</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/9" class="italic"> Reconstruction</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/10">Support for infrastructure within the Government's reconstruction plan, especially transport links; the development of a poverty reduction strategy (PRSP); support to the social sectors (health, education and water) largely through NGQs; and the fight against HIV/AIDS through UNAIDS and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/11" class="italic"> Natural Resources and Enhanced Revenue Generation</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/12">We have funded research by Global Witness into the current state of natural resources management in the DRC. We are supporting the implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in the DRC and developing our plans for further support for effective and transparent natural resource extraction and the re-establishment of border control systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/13" class="italic"> Humanitarian</p>
	<p pid="c.1780W.2/14">Around half of our programme is spent on humanitarian interventions either through UN agencies or NGOs, to address the complex and chronic humanitarian emergency that has faced the people of the DRC since the war. Our funding is principally channelled to the UN's Action Plan for the DRC through its pooled donor funding mechanism.</p>

	<p pid="c.1782W.0/1">The UK Government believe that the question of patenting of plants and animals should be carefully considered by developing countries. The UK Government also strongly believe that the flexibilities contained in the Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement, Article 27.3(b), are important and should be used. The TRIPs agreement indeed allows the World Trade Organisation members to exclude plant varieties from patentability. However, the WTO members are required to provide for plant varieties protection either by patents or by an effective sui generis system or by any combination thereof. The TRIPS agreement also makes clear that WTO members have to provide patents for inventions involving microbiological and non-biological processes, which would include genetic modification technology.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.0/2">The UK Government agree that sui generis systems for protecting plant varieties may be a more suitable option for many developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.0/3">There are a certain number of issues to consider when restricting the application of patenting in agricultural biotechnology. The interpretation of the TRIPS provisions is one of them, as there is no agreed international legal definition of &quot;micro-organism&quot;. We believe that it is legitimate for the WTO member states to make a reasonable definition of &quot;micro-organism&quot; for themselves. The UK Government are also of the view that developing countries could consider in sui generis systems the use of exceptions to exclusive rights for research and plant breeding purpose, as well as to enable farmers to save and plant back seed, including the possibility of informal exchange and sale.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.0/4">The UK Government are supporting the rapid implementation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture which came into force in 2004. The ITPGRFA has the objective to facilitate access to genetic resources, and recognises the contribution of farmers in conserving, improving and making these resources available. It also covers the question of farmer's rights. DFID supported the International Plant Genetic Research Institute in advising the FAO on development of the ITPGRFA.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.0/5">DFID has funded analytical work that takes these issues into consideration. DFID provided support to the Secretariat of the independent UK Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, which reported in September 2002 and provided a breakthrough analysis of the implications of intellectual property protection for development. DFID has since provided funding for a UNCTAD&mdash;International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development joint project on intellectual property in Geneva, as well as work carried out by the Quaker United Nations Office in Geneva. These projects have produced highly valued analytical papers, technical dialogues and research cooperation projects with regional institutions, covering agricultural and plant variety patent protection.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.0/6">DFID has not provided any direct technical assistance or capacity building support to developing countries to help them define restrictions to the application of patenting in agricultural biotechnology in a manner consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. DFID's development assistance is recipient driven, and countries are defining their own development priorities. Should interested developing countries formulate future requests for assistance in these issues, DFID will consider how to answer such needs. Specialised international and national intellectual property agencies or offices are technically better placed to provide such assistance and the UK Patent Office has provided training and assistance to developing countries and less developed countries when requested.</p>

	<p pid="c.1783W.2/1">There is no international agreement on what constitutes state fragility: the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA) can be used to measure fragility. The CPIA measures countries performance and divides low-income countries into five categories. There is one &quot;unranked&quot; group of countries not scored in any given year. The lowest two categories plus the unranked group are used by DFID and other donors as a list of fragile countries. Of the countries listed, all except Pakistan fall into this proxy list.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/2">Poverty is widespread and particularly severe in fragile states. Aid that has been given has often been volatile, fragmented and poorly co-ordinated. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) cannot be achieved without more progress in fragile states.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/3">Following the publication of our policy paper 'Why we need to work more effectively in fragile states' in January last year, DFID has made a commitment to increase engagement in fragile states. We have, with our partners, been developing more appropriate ways of working together to improve the way the international system organises itself to respond and deliver aid. DFID has led work in the OECD's Development Assistance Committee including on agreeing 'Principles for good international engagement in fragile states'. These were endorsed in 2005 and are currently being piloted in nine countries. DFID is leading three of the nine pilots.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/4">Copies of the 2005 policy paper are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/5">Our engagement in the fragile states listed is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/6" class="italic"> Sudan</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/7">The UK share of EC and multilateral assistance was &pound;9 million in 2004. Total DFID Bilateral Aid in 2004-05 was &pound;84 million (of which &pound;77.7 million was humanitarian assistance). The Comprehensive Peace Agreement to the North- South conflict and the recently signed 'Darfur Peace Agreement' offer the people of Sudan genuine opportunities for political representation and security. DFID will spend &pound;109.8 million in 2006-07 helping to meet the humanitarian, developmental and conflict resolution needs inSudan, split roughly humanitarian: &pound;67 millionand development/conflict resolution: &pound;42 million. Furthermore, we are working closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to support the Abuja peace process and the African Union peacekeepers in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/8" class="italic"> Democratic Republic of Congo</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/9">The UK share of EC and multilateral assistance was &pound;31.3 million in 2004. In the last five years, DFID bilateral assistance to the DRC has risen rapidly, from &pound;5.6 million in 2001-2 to &pound;29.2 million (of which &pound;22.2 million was humanitarian assistance) in 2004-05. A fully devolved DFID programme was established in the country in late 2005. Expenditure of &pound;132 million is planned over the next two years. The increase in DFID's assistance reflects the UK's determination to support the people and the Government of the DRC to complete successfully the transition process, including the elections, and find a sustainable path to peace, prosperity and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/10" class="italic"> Cote d'Ivoire</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/11">DFID has no bilateral development programme with Cote d'Ivoire, but since the start of hostilities in 2002 we have provided &pound;900,000 in humanitarian assistance including displaced people and refugees of many nationalities. We are working closely with the international community to help bring about a swift and peaceful resolution. Our share of EC and multilateral assistance totalled about &pound;13.2 millionin 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/12" class="italic"> Zimbabwe</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/13">Since the crisis in Zimbabwe began in 2000 until 2004-05 (most recently published figures), DFID Zimbabwe has provided &pound;117.1 million to support poor people in Zimbabwe through our bilateral programme. Our share of EC and multilateral assistance was&pound;5.6 million in 2004. DFID has focused on humanitarian assistance, tackling HIV and AIDS and providing support to orphans and vulnerable children. DFID channels resources through the UN agencies and civil society: none of our funding goes through the Government of Zimbabwe. We work closely with other donors and international organisations in identifying and responding to the immediate needs of Zimbabwe's poorest people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/14" class="italic"> Chad</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/15">There is no bilateral development programme, but humanitarian assistance was &pound;2 million in 2004-05. Our share of EC and multilateral assistance totalled&pound;7.6 million in 2004. DFID continually monitors the humanitarian situation and undertakes periodic assessments in the east of the country. Humanitarian funding totalling &pound;4.million is planned this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/16" class="italic"> Somalia</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/17">The UK share of EC and multilateral assistance was &pound;4.2 million in 2004. DFID's programme has increased from &pound;1.7 million in 2001-02 to &pound;5.3 million in 2004-05 (of which &pound;3.5 million was spent on humanitarian activities) and is set to reach &pound;21 million in the financial year 2007-08. The majority of last year's spend was focused on emergency humanitarian activities due to the drought in early 2006. We work with a range of Somali partners, UN system and NGOS. The overall goal of the programme is a peaceful, politically stable, and economically viable Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/18" class="italic"> Haiti.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/19">DFID assists Haiti through multilateral contributions to the amount of &pound;15.3 million over the period 1999-2004 through the UK imputed share to the European Commission, United Nations, World Bank and others. We made bilateral contributions to humanitarian needs in 2004-05 of &pound;1.9 million. We are hoping to put a DFID placement in the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in Port au Prince to assist in donor harmonisation/aid effectiveness and humanitarian assessments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/20" class="italic"> Guinea</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/21">DFID has no bilateral development programme with Guinea, but our share of EC and multilateral assistance totalled &pound;6.4 million in 2004. DFID undertakes regular assessments of humanitarian need and has provided assistance totalling &pound;2.3 million over the period 2000-01 to 2004-05. Last year's programme (figures not yet available) included assisting people affected by conflict, and supporting an emergency immunisation programme. We are also planning support for conflict prevention activities to help minimise the risks of political transition.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/22" class="italic"> Liberia</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/23">DFID is working closely with the new government of Liberia to strengthen its capacity, particularly in anti-corruption and civil service reform. DFID has provided over &pound;17.4 million of bilateral aid from 2002-03 &mdash; 2004-05 (including &pound;12.5 million humanitarian assistance), and is also supporting the resettlement of refugees and reintegration of ex-combatants (&pound;3 million this year). The UK share of EC and multilateral support was&pound;3.5 million in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/24">DFID also has a significant engagement in:</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/25" class="italic"> Pakistan</p>
	<p pid="c.1783W.2/26">Which we would not class as a fragile state, where we spent &pound;31.4 million in 2004-05. UK share of EC and multilateral assistance was &pound;18.9 million in 2004. Last year DFID's bilateral expenditure increased considerably and &pound;236 million expenditure is planned over the next three years. In addition to all this, last year's earthquake relief is being followed up with&pound;70 million towards reconstruction over the next 3 to 5 years. DFID works closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in country to alleviate the causes of state fragility.</p>

	<p pid="c.1786W.2/1">DFID recognises the importance of traditional knowledge to communities, and especially poor farmers, in developing countries and to ensure their rights to, and benefits from this knowledge are protected. DFID has taken a number of steps to help achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/2">In relation to DFID funded research, all our contracts specify that the retention of intellectual property rights (IPR) should be freely available for non-commercial use by any organisation or individual. This ensures DFID research outputs cannot be captured in patents, and that traditional knowledge is protected.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/3">DFID has directly commissioned work on traditional knowledge. This included a survey on IPR and sustainable human development in 2000. This review investigated the suitability of IPR regimes for protecting traditional knowledge and concluded that patents are generally unsuitable, but that other IPR regimes required further investigation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/4">In 2003, DFID produced a briefing on TRIPS (the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement) and development. This investigated how IPR regimes could take greater account of developing country interests, and raised the concern that TRIPS does not cover traditional knowledge. We are working with the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) on this. This issue was again recognised by the Commission for Africa which my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development was a member. The Commission's Report stated that developed countries should increase technical support to Africa for the extension of IPR to indigenous innovation and knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/5">We also support the Centres of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research to conduct work on traditional knowledge and genetic resources. For example, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is conducting ethnobotanical research to identify where and how genetic diversity in crops is found and valued. The International Plant Genetic Research Institute (IPGRI) has developed an Indigenous Knowledge Journal to help empower knowledge holders. Under this farmers document their knowledge on a topic on audio tape, or any media, in their own language which can then be listed in scientific journals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/6">At the national level DFID has supported a range of initiatives on traditional knowledge. For example, in Indonesia we are supporting local NGOs in partnership with the Government to explore opportunities for supporting traditional forest management systems where communities directly benefit from their traditional knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/7">We supported the IPGRI in advising the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on development of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. DFID has not yet carried out any studies to assess the effectiveness of the Treaty as it only recently came into force in June 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/8">Alongside the Treaty the Global Crop Diversity Trust was established and this will set up gene banks to preserve existing plant material. The issue of the diversity in animal genetic resources is under discussion including the possibility of a new Treaty. DFID is financing studies on this to help inform discussion in the FAO.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/9">We have funded dialogues on traditional knowledge, for example through a joint project with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD). This project contributed to enhancing developing countries' engagement in World Trade Organisation (WTO) and WIPO discussions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/10">DFID has supported the work of the 2002 Commission on Intellectual Property Rights (CIPR). The Commission reported that traditional knowledge was an important area where intellectual property protection needed to be developed. The UK Government broadly endorsed the analysis of the CIPR.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.2/11">DFID officials participate in the intergovernmental discussions that take place under article 8j of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. There is a Working Group on Article 8j, which DFID officials participate in, this has worked on (a) improving participation of indigenous communities in decision making processes (b) mechanisms for maintaining traditional knowledge relevant to the conservation and sustainable use (c) promoting the wider application of this traditional knowledge, subject to the consent of communities concerned and (d) encouraging the equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of traditional knowledge.</p>

	<p pid="c.1788W.0/2">The UK has not allocated any aid to Uganda for the specific purpose of conducting public prosecutions. The trial of Dr. Kizza Besigye is funded from the Government of Uganda's budget for justice, law and order. A number of development partners, including the UK, provide budget support to Uganda. This form of aid is the best way to support the Government's programmes in education, health and in other areas essential to reduce poverty. A recent evaluation of budget support in Uganda concluded that budget support had led to a major increase in the Government's spending to reduce poverty and improved the efficiency of public expenditure and financial management systems.</p>

	<p pid="c.1793W.6/2">Pathways to Work and Employment Zones are already operating in many areas where Action Teams operate. The Action Team programme is due to finish later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1793W.6/3">The rationale for Action Teams as originally conceived&mdash;reaching out to those on benefit who would not otherwise have come into contact with our services&mdash;has now, to some extent, been superseded by the creation of Jobcentre Plus and the regime of compulsory work-focused interviews for almost all benefits recipients.</p>
	<p pid="c.1793W.6/4">We recognise, however, that some form of continuing outreach activity will be necessary to encourage the most socially excluded&mdash;some of whom will not even be claiming benefits&mdash;to make use of the support into work we can offer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1793W.6/5">The purpose of the Deprived Areas Fund is primarily to add value to current mainstream services offered by Jobcentre Plus and it is envisaged that this will build on the most effective elements of community based initiatives such as Action Teams, Working Neighbourhoods and Ethnic Minority Outreach. This will involve continued partnership working with local stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1793W.6/6">Our recently published Green Paper; &quot;A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work&quot; sets out proposals for piloting new initiatives to help local partners work together to improve economic regeneration through skills, employment and health.</p>
	<p pid="c.1793W.6/7">Each local area will be asked to develop a consortium comprising local partners with a shared interest in working together to raise local employment rates and improve the local economy. This may include local authorities, employers, learning and skills councils, regional development agencies, primary care trusts and Jobcentre Plus. The key aim of this initiative will be to provide a solution that offers the maximum degree of local flexibility, so that local areas can provide local solutions to local problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.1794W.11/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is the matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the right hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.1794W.11/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="c.1794W.11/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1794W.11/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many non-resident parents were non-compliant with the Child Support Agency in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1794W.11/5" class="indent">There are two ways in which non-resident parents can be non-compliant. Information on these is available in the Child Support Agency's Quarterly Summary Statistics (QSS), published on 27<sup>(th)</sup> April 2006. A copy of this document is available in the House of Commons Library. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="c.1794W.11/6" class="indent">Table 7.1 shows Case Compliance - the number of cases that have made a payment (either regular maintenance and/or arrears) via the collection service over the preceding quarter as a percentage of all open cases for which maintenance was charged.</p>
	<p pid="c.1794W.11/7" class="indent">Table 7.2 shows Maintenance Outcomes - the number of cases with a positive maintenance liability that have made a payment (either regular maintenance and/or arrears) via the collection service or have a Maintenance Direct arrangement in place over the preceding quarter.</p>
	<p pid="c.1794W.11/8" class="indent">Note that the Agency measures compliance on the basis of cases, rather than non-resident parents, the data therefore reflects this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1794W.11/9" class="indent">I hope you find this useful.</p>

	<p pid="c.1811W.5/1">In a decision welcomed by the Ministry of Defence, a Pension Appeal Tribunal (PAT) found that Gulf War Syndrome was a 'useful umbrella term' to cover accepted conditions which are causally linked to the 1990-91 Gulf Conflict but that Gulf War Syndrome does not exist as a 'discrete pathological entity', or in other words as a recognised disease. A written statement was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-11-24.128"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 128-29WS</phrase>, setting out our position on this issue. We do not hold figures for those claiming 'Gulf War Syndrome' but since the PAT decision the umbrella term has been applied in six cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1811W.5/2">The latest figures, as at the end of December 2005, show that about 3,025 veterans whose time in the armed forces includes service in the Gulf were in receipt of a war disablement pension for any condition for which an award would be payable. In addition, at that date, 2,515 such veterans had received a gratuity for disablement assessed at under 20 per cent. There will be some overlap between those figures, as some individuals will have received first a gratuity and then a pension. The figures include awards for both Gulf-related and non-Gulf-related injuries or illnesses, as our records do not distinguish the origin of the disablement (including awards where Gulf War Syndrome is appropriate as an umbrella term). The claimants are former members of the armed forces. Serving members of the armed forces are not covered by the War Pension Scheme but they and MOD) civilians are covered by other occupational schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1811W.5/3">In addition, some 2,000 veterans, dependents and civilians have notified the MOD of their intention to claim common law compensation for Gulf War Syndrome or Gulf illnesses but as yet the claimants' solicitors have served no writs or claims of sufficient detail for the Department to be able to start considering these claims.</p>

	<p pid="c.1812W.2/2">Saddam Hussein ended the Iraq nuclear programme in 1991 following the Gulf war. The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) concluded that although Saddam clearly assigned a high value to the nuclear work that had taken place up to the 1991 war, the programme had ended and the intellectual capital had decayed in the succeeding years. In the comprehensive report of the special advisor to the director of Central Intelligence on Iraq's WMD, issued in September 2004 and finalised in April 2005, the ISG identify two residual risks&mdash;the proliferation of equipment and material, and the proliferation of knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1812W.2/3">In the 1990s IAEA inspectors identified, collected or destroyed all the key dedicated equipment and materials remaining from the pre-1991 nuclear weapon programme. The ISG concluded that the remaining dual-use nuclear equipment does not pose a proliferation risk, provided the Government remains in control of such equipment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1812W.2/4">The ISG also concluded that the risk of (proliferation from scientists passing on information and knowledge is small. It emphasised that the numbers concerned are in fact far less than Saddam had previously led the international community to expect and that such individuals, despite Saddam's efforts, had not maintained their knowledge base/skills as a result of the sanctions regime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1812W.2/5">The UK Government agreed with the conclusions in the ISO report and, in response to the risk of proliferation from scientists passing on information and knowledge, has been holding workshops to help Iraqi scientists to apply for civilian employment.</p>

The HCR is far more extensive than the surveys on which most valuations are based. Lenders are already moving to automated valuation models. Even in cases where lenders believe additional information is needed we would expect the HCR to cut the costs of the valuation process.</p>

	<p pid="c.1822W.5/1">The EU Animal By-Products Regulation (ABPR) requires a range of animal by-products and substances derived from them (including tallow), to be disposed of as waste. Where the method of disposal is incineration or co-incineration (i.e. use as a fuel), the ABPR requires it to be carried out in compliance with the waste incineration directive (WID). Installations may burn tallow provided they comply with these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1822W.5/2">There is no specific incentive scheme for the burning of tallow although, as a form of biomass, tallow burning may qualify for renewables obligation certificates (ROCs).

	<p pid="c.1823W.5/1">Water companies have a duty to develop and maintain efficient and economical systems of water supply. Since 1996 Ofwat has assessed water company performance against leakage targets that balance the needs of customers and the environment. This approach has resulted in a reduction in leakage of around 29 per cent. since 1994-95.</p>
	<p pid="c.1823W.5/2">In 2001, following Thames Water's failure to meet their leakage targets, Ofwat suspended the company's leakage targets in favour of an action plan to improve its leakage monitoring and control activities. Thames Water is also required to provide quarterly reports on progress with its agreed leakage reduction plan. The aim is to restore leakage to its target level and achieve adequate security of supplies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1823W.5/3">The company is now carrying out 60 per cent. more repairs than two years ago, and a major upgrade of its water distribution network in London is under way. This involves the replacement of more than 1,200 km of water mains by 2010. In 2004-05 Thames Water reduced its overall leakage for the first time since 1999-2000.</p>

	<p pid="c.1825W.9/2">The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April</phrase>. The Centre is a world first and will play a decisive part, with police forces, offender managers, children's services and other stakeholders, in protecting children, young people, families and society from paedophiles and sex offenders; in particular from those who use the internet and other new technologies in the sexual exploitation of children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1825W.9/3">CEOP is different from traditional policing responses, with law enforcement officers sitting alongside industry and child protection experts. It is built around three core faculties&mdash;Intelligence, Operations and Harm Reduction&mdash;and will deliver a range of functions designed to empower children and parents through information and education, protect young people through better use of intelligence and better management of offenders and enforce the law both on and offline.</p>
	<p pid="c.1825W.9/4">The clear focus on intelligence about offenders and the direct input from the industry will drive CEOP's operational and harm reduction effort, as well as the support it can provide to its partners, in protecting children from those who seek to use new technologies to exploit them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1825W.9/5">The Centre is legally part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) but is operationally autonomous with a separate budget of nearly&pound;5 million. The Centre reports to Home Office Ministers and is accountable through SOCA's governance structure.</p>

As part of this work, Departments are assessing where the greatest benefits will arise through the use of the scheme and the consequences for their own systems. Indeed, not all services will require a high degree of integration between the ID Cards Scheme and other IT systems and in a number of cases, any necessary changes will be integrated in the usual planned cycle of system upgrades and technology refresh.</p>

	<p pid="c.1832W.5/1">There is no legislation or other requirement for foreign authorities to inform the UK Government when a prisoner is released from a foreign jail. There is an agreement between Consular Directorate (CD) and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), that CD will notify SOCA of the arrest of British nationals abroad for Serious Crimes. When a British consulate overseas is mad aware that a UK national is being deported or released from a foreign jail, details are passed from the consulate to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office who in turn inform SOCA.</p>
	<p pid="c.1832W.5/2">Law enforcement officers will determine if there is an operational need to interview the person on their return to the UK. The returnee is not required to attend such an interview unless the person is subjectto arrest and detention in connection with the investigation of an offence. The results of any interview are forwarded to the police force in whose area the returnee plans to reside. It is an operational matter for the chief officer of the force concerned whether further action should be taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.1832W.5/3">Where the police are aware that an individual has received a conviction or caution for a sexual offence overseas they are advised to apply for a notification order&mdash;which will make the returnee subject to part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (the sex offenders register)&mdash;regardless of whether they believe that the person poses a risk of sexual harm or not.

	<p pid="c.1843W.0/1">The exchange rate is determined in a fully flexible setting for foreign exchange and it is therefore difficult to determine the exact implications of an appreciation of the Chinese renminbi against the US dollar for British trade. An appreciation of the Chinese renminbi against the US dollar could result in an appreciation, depreciation or no change against UK sterling. However, the sterling effective exchange rate has been relatively stable in recent years. Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the volatility of sterling's effective exchange rate has been under half that of the euro and around a third that of the US dollar. At the same time, UK exports, including exports to China, continue to grow. UK exports have grown on average 4.4 per cent. per year from 1997 to 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.1847W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is currently working in partnership with four Local Authorities (LAs) to investigate whether there are local data sources that could be used to assist the compilation of the nationally produced population estimates. The four LAs are Barnet Derby Hammersmith &amp; Fulham and Welwyn Hatfield. These authorities were selected from four groupings of LAs which each scored highly on different characteristics associated with difficulties in estimating population accurately.</p>
	<p pid="c.1847W.2/5" class="indent">Initial meetings were held with the four selected LAs in December 2005 and January 2006. At these meetings each of the LAs agreed to work with ONS to gain a better understanding of how they use the population estimates, what other local information and data sources they use, what particular issues affect population estimates within their LA and what methods and local data sources they use to overcome these issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1847W.2/6" class="indent">A further round of meetings is currently underway to review progress and a final round of meetings will be held at the end of the studies in summer 2006. ONS will review the findings to see if any improvements can be applied to the mid-year population estimates processes or quality assurance procedures, either for all LAs or for groups of LAs. ONS will publish the outcome of the studies and evaluate their success, including a review of the criteria and approach for selecting LAs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1855W.5/1">There are no plans to change the system by which HM Revenue and Customs measures actual tax revenue receipts from the nations and regions of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="c.1855W.5/2">Systems for recording HMRC tax revenue receipts are dependent on the administrative arrangement for the various taxes. For example, some taxes are collected from businesses although the liabilities are borne by individuals (e.g. PAYE) and the location of the office making the payment may not be the same as the physical location of the business. One PAYE payment scheme can cover units located throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.1855W.5/3">Geographical information is therefore only routinely available for income tax in terms of the liabilities of individuals based on their tax records which include addresses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1855W.5/4">Although HMRC hold information on registered company addresses, companies normally operate in many locations and it is not possible to split each company's tax liability between their activity in different geographical areas. Furthermore, corporation tax is charged on total profits of a company, including income received from abroad, and a company may surrender tax losses to another company in the same group anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="c.1857W.0/1">The persecution of religious and ethnic minorities including the Ahmadiyyas, Hindus, Christians and indigenous groups is a serious issue in Bangladesh. Our High Commission in Dhaka is actively engaged in promoting human rights in Bangladesh, raises human rights issues with the Government of Bangladesh on a regular basis, and provides funding to non-governmental organisations for human rights programmes. We take all available opportunities to underline the UK's commitment to support human rights in Bangladesh during discussions with senior Government representatives, human rights campaigners and representatives of religious and ethnic minorities, and will continue to do so. During a visit to Bangladesh in November 2005, I underlined the UK's commitment to support human rights in Bangladesh during discussions with senior Government representatives, human rights campaigners and representatives of religious and ethnic minorities. We shall continue to seek out opportunities to raise our concerns.</p>

We continue to urge the Government and the opposition to engage in constructive dialogue on the key steps to ensure a level playing field, and free and fair and peaceful elections in January 2007 with full participation. We believe that a healthy democracy, improved human rights and a reduction in corruption offer the best route to combating extremism in Bangladesh.</p>

This figure is different from our estimate that there are approximately 13.1 million British Nationals (BNs) living overseas, based on estimates from each country received in our Consular Annual Return. The difference, 8.6 million, is the number of BNs who we estimate do not hold a British passport.</p>

	<p pid="c.1867W.3/1">At present the Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not offer any direct incentives to staff to encourage them to share vehicles. However, we do apply policies which contribute to staff using more sustainable methods of transport:</p>

	<p pid="c.1867W.3/3" class="indent">we provide cycle racks and changing facilities, with about 220 staff in the UK currently cycling to work;</p>
	<p pid="c.1867W.3/4" class="indent">we currently offer staff an advance of salary to purchase a bicycle for home to office journeys and are looking into upgrading this to a salary sacrifice scheme, enabling staff to obtain cycles at a reduced cost;</p>

	<p pid="c.1867W.3/6" class="indent">we provide a minibus service for junior members of staff living in Milton Keynes and Northampton to our rural site in Hanslope Park in Buckinghamshire as only a very limited public transport service is available to the site;</p>
	<p pid="c.1867W.3/7" class="indent">all taxi journeys out of the Hanslope Park site are shared, where it is operationally possible to do so;</p>

	<p pid="c.1867W.3/9" class="indent">within our flexible working policy we encourage staff to work from home thereby reducing the number of journeys;</p>
	<p pid="c.1867W.3/10" class="indent">we encourage the use of video conferencing facilities to limit non-essential travel.</p>
	<p pid="c.1867W.3/11">Overseas, travel policy is devolved to posts. Examples of good practice are the enhancement of bicycle travel allowance to encourage people to use bicycles rather than cars, and encourage staff to walk to meetings and to share taxis where possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.1870W.5/2">The requested information is not collected centrally. The child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) mapping exercise for 2004 found that just over 50 per cent. of new cases were seen within four weeks, an improvement on the 24 per cent. of new cases in 2002. Similarly, the number of cases waiting over 13 weeks has reduced from just over 50 per cent. to just over 30 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1871W.2/2">The new regulations permit the CSCI to inspect any adult social care service at any time, as long as every service is inspected at least once in three years. In the past, CSCI was required to inspect adult services at least twice a year (less frequently for some services). The changes will enable CSCI to work more efficiently, by focusing its efforts on services that need attention, while a small number of the very best adult services will notice a longer period between their inspections. There will be more unannounced inspections and more focus on the experiences of people using the services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1873W.5/1">The spine is the colloquial name given to the national database of key information about patients' health and care. It forms the core of the national health service care records service. It also supports other key programmes of the national programme for information technology, such as choose and book the electronic prescriptions service (EPS), and general practitioner (GP) to GP record transfer, each of them using the spine's messaging capabilities as part of their own services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/2">Choose and book daily registers in excess of 150,000 message transactions from almost 36,000 referring clinicians, and over 360,000 bookings have been made to date. Nearly 1.2 million prescriptions have already been processed through EPS. Almost 400 general practices are currently generating electronic prescription messages and over 800 general practices have had their systems upgraded in preparation for going live. About 1,500 pharmacies have now had their systems upgraded to enable them to receive electronic prescription messages.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/3">The spine has a number of applications, including:</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/4" class="indent">personal demographics service (PDS), which holds nationally demographic information for every patient covered by the NHS in England, accessible through local systems, and is currently processing message transactions at a rate of over nine million per month;</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/5" class="indent">spine directory services, which holds reference data such as users and locations. 220,000 users are now registered; almost 45,000 currently access the system on any given day;</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/6" class="indent">access control framework, which registers and authenticates users, including patients, and provides a single log-in and a record of each professional accessing a NHS care record;</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/7" class="indent">transaction messaging system, which processes and routes data messages, for example, from a GP to a hospital or from one GP to another.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/8">These four elements went live on time and to budget in July 2004 to support choose and book.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/9">Other planned applications are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/10" class="indent">secondary uses service (SUS), providing the NHS with high quality data to enable investigation of trends and emerging health needs which can inform public health policy. The data extracted will provide information to support performance improvement and assessment, clinical audit and governance, monitoring and benchmarking, surveillance, research and planning;</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/11" class="indent">personal spine information service (PSIS), providing personal health information for a patient, for example, drug allergies, details of operations and/or conditions, medication history, pathology, radiology and other results, as well as a summary of contacts with care providers;</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/12" class="indent">clinical spine application (CSA), allowing patient information on the spine to be viewed on a personal computer; users will be able to view and update patient information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/13">The first stage of SUS went live in June 2005 to support payment by results, and is already processing around half a million message transactions a month. PSIS and CSA are due for piloting in 2007, with rollout expected in early 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/14">Picture archiving and communications (PACS) implementations in 2007 include plans to integrate to elements of the spine such as PDS. Currently there are 31 live national programme PACS systems, with over 27 million images stored.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/15">A total of 5,647 GP systems, 253 pharmacy systems, and over 100 patient administrations systems are currently linked to and regularly using the spine. These systems have already achieved compliance, and around 70 or so systems are in test at various development stages across the programme. Interface standards are made available to all suppliers, as well as published more widely. The standards have been developed to reflect internationally-recognised standards, and in conjunction with the programme's major suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/16">Use of the spine will continue to develop over the life of the programme to deliver the full set of planned patient benefits and clinical improvements to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.5/17">Costs associated with the spine are accounted for by the NHS Connecting for Health agency of the Department which is responsible for delivering the programme and for managing programme contracts. Set-up (capital) costs are incurred in phases as functionality is added to the spine through staged software releases over the implementation period. They are expected to total &pound;335 million on completion. The ongoing service (revenue) costs average around&pound;45 million a year, although this falls in a range between &pound;30 to &pound;60 million in any particular year. These sums are in line with the contracted value of the work concerned, and represent an investment of roughly one pound per NHS patient per year over the life of the contract.</p>

	<p pid="c.1875W.2/1">Value for money has been ensured by running a robust and competitive procurement process, and by benchmarking procedure prices between contracts and comparing them with the national health service equivalent cost and the prices paid by the NHS to the independent sector under spot purchase arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1875W.2/2">The National Centre for Health Outcomes Development (NCHOD) published a preliminary report on four independent sector treatment centre schemes in October 2005. The NCHOD audit is based on some of the 26 key performance indicators that independent sector providers are contractually obliged to collect in order to monitor clinical quality, patient experience, and productivity of services. The preliminary report is available at the NCHOD's website at <a href="http://www.nchod.nhs.uk">www.nchod.nhs.uk</a>.

	<p pid="c.1876W.2/2">The national programme has been subject from its inception to the Office of Government Commence (OGC) Gateway process. Gateway reviews have been, and continue to be, undertaken at each of the standard stages throughout the development of every project within the programme, and of its cluster-based deployment activity from initiation to live running. A similar annual and ongoing programme of audit reviews has been and continues to be carried out by the Department's internal auditors. A National Audit Office (NAO) value for money study into choice at the point of referral which reported in January 2005, involved close scrutiny of the work of the national programme and specifically the choose and book programme. The report on a further NAO study into wider aspects of the programme has yet to be published, and this has included an independent review of programme management capability. In addition, the programme's own quality management function undertakes a broad range of reviews and audits of specific aspects of programme, cluster and supplier activity on an ongoing basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.2/3">A number of independent reviews have been commissioned under contract, including one commissioned from McKinsey to inform the approach before the start of the programme, and from other suppliers to establish the value for the national health service and taxpayer achieved through the contracts and to examine specific aspects such as disaster recovery. In addition, there is ongoing review by transparent discussion with key stakeholder groups including the British Medical Association and through consultation initiated by the care record development board.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.2/4">OGC Gateway reports and other reports have been provided in confidence in order not to impair the value of the advice they contain and to protect commercial confidentiality. We have no plans to publish the outcome of these reports. Given the number of reviews and audits concerned, extraction of recommendations in each case could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1883W.5/1">The guidance framework on the withholding of national health service treatment from violent and abusive patients was issued by the Department in 2001 following on from the cross-government zero tolerance campaign introduced in 2000, to tackle violence in the NHS. The guidance highlighted that the withholding of NHS treatment from violent and abusive patients will always be a last resort, but should be an option available to managers and staff working in all NHS trusts, with certain exemptions including those requiring urgent medical treatment or under the age of 16. The guidance made explicit that all NHS trusts develop local policies on withholding treatment from violent and abusive patients in consultation with independent legal advice on the terms and application of such a policy; and trusts must also have in place clear defensible policies and procedures outlining the circumstances where the withholding of treatment is justifiable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.5/2">Information is not collected on the number of prisoners who have had NHS treatment withheld as a result of NHS policies on protecting staff from violence and abuse.</p>
	<p pid="c.1883W.5/3">Since then the Government created the NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS) in April 2003. The NHS SMS has launched a comprehensive strategy, which has replaced work previously undertaken under the NHS Zero Tolerance campaign. The NHS SMS strategy places a particular emphasis on the introduction of preventative measures to stop violent incidents from occurring in the first place. In 2004, the NHS SMS issued guidance covering the application of this strategy in the context of tackling the whole issue of non-physical assaults on NHS staff.</p>
