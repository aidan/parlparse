	<p pid="b.484W.8/1">DFID directly and indirectly supports HIV and AIDS related activities across all its 16 priority countries in Africa. These are Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In well-developed states, DFID focuses on supporting national government decision-making processes and associated institutional reforms in line with the 3 ones&quot; principles&quot; and uses aid instruments such as general budget support. In fragile states&quot; where working with government has been more difficult, we have been supporting UN agencies and civil society organisations to provide a range of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.8/2">In Asia, DFID funds HIV and AIDS programmes in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Vietnam, Cambodia and China. Most are not stand-alone DFID programmes, but are jointly funded. Burma is funded through our support to the UN.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.8/3">In Latin America and the Caribbean, regional programmes cover a wide range of countries. In Latin America, the Brazil Sexually Transmitted Diseases/AIDS Programme provides technical support across the region. Focus countries are Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. In the Caribbean, the Regional Programme covers a wide range of island states, with a focus on six countries in the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts &amp; Nevis). A new project supporting the private sector response to HIV and AIDS is under way in Jamaica and Barbados.

	<p pid="b.485W.2/1">DFID published 'Increasing People's Access to Essential Medicines in Developing Countries: a Framework for Good Practice in the Pharmaceutical Industry' in March 2005, with widespread pharmaceutical industry support. The framework was developed in close consultation with the industry and with its stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and institutional investors. The framework, which recommends increased research and development into treatment and vaccinations for children, builds on the good work of many of the companies in the industry, and encourages pharmaceutical companies to go further by:</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.2/2" class="indent">Engaging in widespread differential pricing of essential medicines in developing countries, especially the world's poorest, with particular attention given to patented medicines.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.2/3" class="indent">Increasing research and development investment for diseases affecting developing countries, including through public private partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.2/4" class="indent">Working to support broader health and development goals in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.2/5" class="indent">and, increasing reporting and transparency around access to medicines activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.2/6">The first recommendation related to research and development encouraged increased investment in medicines and vaccines for children. This issue has been discussed with pharmaceutical companies on a number of occasions since the launch, including at a well attended meeting of pharmaceutical companies and Government Departments on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> last year. Another meeting was held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January</phrase> to discuss differential pricing to make medicines cheaper in developing countries. The next meeting of the group will focus on paediatric issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.2/7">The UK Government have also made significant progress on developing innovative financing to incentivise increased investment in research and development, including for paediatric formulations of medicines such as antiretroviral medicines. Research and development tax credits to increase investment in research and development for medicines and vaccines for AIDS, TB and Malaria were introduced in 2002. Last year the UK Government launched the international finance facility for immunisation, and announced plans for advanced market commitments to prompt the development of new medicines and vaccines for diseases affecting developing countries, including for paediatric formulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.2/8">DFID also supports specific research on health in developing countries, including work on communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health, maternal and paediatric health and HIV. DFID has funded research on the appropriate use of existing medicines in developing country settings including, clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in reducing mortality among children living with HIV and co-funding of the Development of Antiretroviral Treatment in Africa (DART) Trials with the Medical Research Council (MRC) exploring HIV treatment in resource limited settings, including for children and other vulnerable groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.487W.2/1">DFID's HIV and AIDS Treatment and Care Policy, published in July 2004 alongside the UK's strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world, focuses on supporting countries to develop and implement their own country specific policies using guidance from multilateral such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), organisations that receive regular DFID funding. Like the rest of the international community DFID relies on the WHO for technical guidance on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.2/2">In November 2004, the Medical Research Council's (MRC) clinical trials unit reported that using a widely available antibiotic drug could cut AIDS-related deaths in children after infancy by 43 per cent., by stopping infections associated with a weakened immune system. The outcome of the DFID-funded trial is that co-trimoxazole is now in the WHO paediatric treatment guidelines for children with HIV, and is now regarded as standard treatment even in the poorest countries. The treatment was also found to reduce the need for children's hospital admissions by 23 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.2/3">In December 2004, DFID and the MRC jointly funded (&pound;4.7 million) the Antiretroviral Therapy Research for Children (ARROW), run by the MRC clinical trials unit. The trial will address ways of providing antiretroviral therapy to children in resource poor settings and could both reduce costs of treatment as well as reducing side effects, and will begin in the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.2/4">The UK is co-hosting, with UNICEF, the Global Partners Forum for Children and AIDS on 9 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-10">10 February</phrase>. The forum will focus on key blockages to scaling up towards universal access to prevention, treatment and care for children. Paediatric treatment is one of the six key areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.2/5">DFID has regular meetings with the pharmaceutical industry to advance the framework for good practice in the pharmaceutical industry, published in March 2005. The next meeting of this group will be dedicated to discussions on paediatric treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.6/1">There are two measures of overcrowding&mdash;the statutory definition and the bedroom standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.6/2">Based on the bedroom standard, the number of children living in overcrowded households over the three-year period 2002&ndash;03, 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 was <i>(a)</i> 275,000 in London and <i>(b)</i> 880,000 in England. The total number of overcrowded households in England on this basis is estimated to be around 500,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.6/3">Information on compliance with the statutory standard is not collected centrally. Using data from the Survey of English Housing&quot; for the period 1997&ndash;98 to 1999&ndash;2000 and from the 1996 English House Condition Survey&quot; it was estimated that there were 25,000 households in England that were so overcrowded that the statutory standard was breached.

	<p pid="b.498W.3/2">The Government's Skills Strategy, 21st Century Skills: Realising Our Potential&quot; (July 2003) and Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; (March 2005), set out our plans for increasing opportunities for adults to develop their skills for paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.3/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.498W.3/4" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, where you ask what opportunities are made available by her department in Tamworth constituency to <i>(a)</i> retrain <i>(b)</i> reskill and <i>(c)</i> educate local adult residents to improve their chances of taking up paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.3/5" class="indent">Tamworth and Lichfield College is the principal further education (FE) college serving learners in the Tamworth district. Residents also have the opportunity to study in a number of other FE colleges within accessible travelling distance.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.3/6" class="indent">In 2004&ndash;05, some 9,500 adults enrolled on programmes of study at Tamworth and Lichfield College across a wide range of subject areas. Particularly large numbers (5,000 enrolments) were to programmes in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). These qualifications are adaptable to many employment sectors, and our regional and local market intelligence shows that, increasingly, employment opportunities will be in higher skilled and more technical jobs where ICT competencies will be an important part of the overall skills profile sought by employers,</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.3/7" class="indent">In terms of the total employment demand, the health sector is forecast to be Staffordshire's second biggest sector over the next 10 years. Over 1,800 adults enrolled to programmes in Health, Public Services and Care at Tamworth and Lichfield College in 2004&ndash;05. College provision, therefore, is supporting residents to take advantage of new and emerging employment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.3/8" class="indent">In addition to provision to support vocational training and upskilling, Staffordshire local education authority receives funding from LSC for the provision of non-accredited adult and community learning activities across the eight district councils in Staffordshire. The aim of the provision is to engage learners in learning programmes and activities to develop skills for life and personal development. Tamworth and Lichfield College delivers this provision on its Tamworth campus and an additional 17 community venues in the district. In 2003&ndash;04 the college enrolled 2,284 learners on 160 adult community programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.3/9" class="indent">Learndirect offer a range of flexible learning opportunities though e-learning. The study can take place at the learndirect centres, of which there are 5 in the Tamworth area, or anywhere a learner can access a computer with a good internet connection. Courses include literacy and numeracy, and many are free.</p>

	<p pid="b.499W.0/1">More people than ever before with self-declared learning difficulties and/or disabilities are now engaged in LSC-funded education and training with 579,000 learners across the post-16 sector in 2003&ndash;04 at a total cost of around &pound;1.3 billion. We want to work closely with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to continue to break down the barriers that people with disabilities face in accessing quality training. The Learning and Skills Act 2000 places a statutory duty on the LSC to promote equality of opportunity between persons of different racial groups, men and women, and between disabled and non-disabled. To support that work, the LSC has introduced equality and diversity impact measures as a planning tool to promote greater equality of opportunity in both fair access to and outcomes from publicly-funded training.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/2">Earlier this year, in our White Paper Skills Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; we outlined how the LSC is providing capital funding to support colleges and training providers in making the necessary changes to their accommodation, in order to improve access for disabled learners.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/3">However, responsibility for the planning and funding of skills training in Hartlepool, including skills for people with disabilities, is the responsibility of the LSC. Mark Haysom, the council's chief executive, has written to my hon. Friend with further information and a copy of his letter has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/4" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/5" class="indent">I am writing to you to follow up the Secretary of State's answer to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding increasing the skills levels of disabled people in Hartlepool.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/6" class="indent">I have set out below a summary of current activity with learners in the town:</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/7" class="indent">The main providers of post-16 learning in Hartlepool are Hartlepool College of Further Education and Hartlepool Sixth Form College. Both have been supported recently with funding in relation to improving access for learners with disabilities. All providers of Apprenticeships, Work Based Learning and Entry to Employment in Hartlepool have had an Access Audit to ensure that their facilities and premises are accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/8" class="indent">In excess of 1,900 people taking part in learning in Hartlepool are supported with Additional Learning Support Funding. This funding provides specific individual support in respect of learning difficulties and/or disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/9" class="indent">18 learners from Hartlepool with a learning difficulty/and or disability have achieved a Level 1 or Level 2 qualification through the Employer Training Pilot. This is 7% of those taking part.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/10" class="indent">73 young people from Hartlepool who consider themselves to have a learning difficulty and/or disability are currently on Apprenticeship programmes and improving their skills and employment opportunities at levels 2 and 3. 42 young people from Hartlepool who consider themselves to have a learning difficulty and/or disability are currently on entry to employment programmes and are improving their skills and employment opportunities leading to level 2 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/11" class="indent">Hartlepool College of Further Education is working with Catcote Special School in Hartlepool to increase provision for learners aged 19+ with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. This project is increasing personal, social and skills for working life for 14 adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/12" class="indent">Hartlepool Sixth Form College is running a Pathways project1 which supports 26 learners with multiple learning difficulties aged 26 to 63. Learners follow the Certificate in Personal, Social and Health Education.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/13" class="indent">We have recently approved funding for the Shaw Trust to deliver support to unemployed 19&ndash;24 year olds with learning difficulties and/or disabilities that I have previously had specialist support in a local provider, or have returned from a residential college. The project will support them in community and work based settings. Participants will benefit from improved social skills to encourage independent living and progression, making aspirations and employment goals attainable. 50 learners will be supported across the Tees Valley.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/14" class="indent">In addition to the examples given above, people with disabilities have full access to the extensive range of skills training available in the colleges and learning organisations within Hartlepool.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/15" class="indent">Budgets for investment in services for learners with learning needs and disabilities for 2006&ndash;07 will shortly be allocated to regions and local LSC's enabling them to plan support for next year. This will be in the context of our plans for significant budget increases for these learners over the next few years. We have increased the overall budget for learners with learning needs and disabilities from &pound;138 million to &pound;157 million for 2006&ndash;2007 and this will increase again to &pound;181 million in 2007&ndash;2008, rises of 14% and 15% year on year from 2005. These rises are significantly greater than the overall increase in our budget over the same period, which increases by 3% and 5%.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/16" class="indent">We are making this additional investment in response to the national review of support for learners with disabilities carried out for us by Peter Little. While the review is still out for consultation and we will need to agree nationally how the LSC's expenditure on learning is matched by what other agencies pay for by way of social and domestic support, we acknowledge that our own contribution must rise. This is because the overall number of learners with disabilities is rising as the effect of medical advances continues.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/17" class="indent">At a time when numbers of young people are falling and 80% of the workforce of 2010 is already in the labour market we regard it as essential that the aspirations and abilities of all learners are supported and developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.0/18" class="indent">I hope this information helps to support the answer to your parliamentary question.</p>

	<p pid="b.500W.2/1">By 2010 we expect all schools to offer access to a core offer of extended services, with half of all primaries and a third of all secondaries doing so by 2008. The core offer includes 8 am-6 pm wraparound child care; a varied menu of study support activities such as sport and arts clubs; swift and easy referral to specialist health and social care services such as speech therapy; parenting support; and wider community use of school facilities. How this develops in each community will vary depending on the needs of that community. Some will have greater need for more child care, others will be able to rely on working with existing providers. A survey of 4,000 schools has shown that many are already delivering parts of this offer, with the vast majority already providing some activities or care before or after school. There has been enthusiasm from local authorities and schools to engage with the extended schools support programme, with over 5,000 schools joining this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.501W.3/2">The Department does not collect annual data on adult literacy and numeracy skills and it is therefore not possible to provide estimates for 1997 and 2005. However, in 2002/03, the Department for Education and Skills conducted the 'Skills for Life Survey'. This is a national needs and impact survey of literacy and numeracy, which provides estimates of the level of basic skills within England among adults aged 16&ndash;65 years old.</p>
	<p pid="b.501W.3/3">The assessment levels correspond to the literacy and numeracy National Standards: these were introduced in 2002 to provide a framework for all adult screening tests, diagnostic tools, programmes of study and qualifications. Learners are assessed for levels of literacy and numeracy from Entry Level 1 to Level 2. Level 2 is broadly equivalent to a higher grade GCSE (A*-C).</p>
	<p pid="b.501W.3/4">The survey provides estimates for Learning and Skills Council areas and districts. Within the Learning and Skills Council area of Hampshire and The Isle of Wight, the Skills for Life Survey estimates that around 7 per cent. of adults had literacy levels below Level 1 (equivalent to a GCSE D-G) and around 43 per cent. had numeracy levels below Level 1 (Table 1 and 2).</p>

	<p pid="b.503W.5/1">We are committed to safeguarding a wide range of adult learning opportunities in every area, including provision for learners over 50, and we will ensure that adult learning provision in Surrey Heath is provided through the funding from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to further education colleges, local authorities and other providers. As this is an operational matter, Mark Haysom, the LSC's Chief Executive has written to the hon. Member with further information and a copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/3" class="indent">I refer to the written reply by Phil Hope to your Parliamentary Question. The Minister has asked that I write to you with further information.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/4" class="indent">Adult and Community Learning (now called Personal and Community Development Learning) is an important source of provision for older people. We are safeguarding funding for this provision for future years.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/5" class="indent">For other forms of provision, the LSC has agreed clear funding priorities with the Government as public resources are necessarily finite. Our highest priorities are to support increased participation and achievement of 16&ndash;18 year olds and to support adults without skills for life and full level 2 qualifications which are important for basic levels of employability. Many older people come within these latter priority categories and around a quarter of enrolments in LSC funded provision in Surrey are by people over the age of 50.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/6" class="indent">Surrey County Council, our Adult and Community Learning provider in the county, has developed provision for older people in two communities with high levels of multiple deprivation, one of which is in Surrey Heath. Building on earlier work by the Pre-Retirement Association, the purpose of these was to develop a transferable and innovative curriculum of recreational learning to encourage older people to regard learning and skills acquisition as a positive and natural accompaniment to growing older. Amongst other things, this led to the formation of an 'older and bolder club1 for health activities and recreation. The University of the Third Age has a presence in Surrey Heath to encourage lifelong learning for older people not in employment and relevant courses are also delivered by the WEA (with funding from the LSC.)</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/7" class="indent">To help shape future provision, the Surrey Lifelong Learning Partnership has run focus groups on our behalf, involving older learners, to identify provision of particular interest. Analysis of needs against provision on a geographic basis means that we can now identify where there is relatively high and low participation in learning for over 50s to provide a basis for review of future provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/8" class="indent">Our future provision in Surrey will also be influenced by our South East Region's annual statement of planning priorities in which we have a commitment to pilot curriculum opportunities for older workers to change their occupations or extend their careers&quot;. To this end, we are developing a project, with European funding support, to identify different ways of delivering learning to older people. This will include targeted information, advice and guidance and the development of courses specifically to meet the needs of older people seeking to extend their careers.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/9" class="indent">Looking further forward, demographic changes&mdash;with fewer young people entering the labour market and an expectation of longer working life&mdash;mean that, nationally, we will need to provide a broader programme of support for older people to keep their skills up to date. We will be working with the Department for Education and Skills to define and plan the nature of this broader support.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/10" class="indent">I hope this further information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.506W.2/1">A board of inquiry is an internal review conducted to investigate a matter and to report. It is not a court and it does not meet in public. The presence of families may inhibit the openness of witnesses, in addition to being impractical as boards of inquiry can last for months and necessitate travel both inside and outside the United Kingdom. In the case of an inquiry into a fatality or serious accident, we seek to ensure that the next of kin are fully briefed on the inquiry's progress and outcome.</p>

	<p pid="b.511W.3/1">Acquisition of non-Ministry of Defence (MOD) land always carries additional costs (legal, professional fees etc) as well as requiring an outlay of capital. There might also be disposal costs to be taken into account if the acquisition led to existing MOD land becoming surplus. It is for this reason that before considering such an acquisition to meet a new requirement, we always first look at the suitability of land and property already owned by the Department. This is consistent with the wider Government policy on asset management. We also need to ensure that our estate is no larger than is required for defence purposes and that it is efficiently used. If a privately-owned site were to offer specific advantages (for instance in terms of location, features or potential value for money) then an exception might be made, but this would be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.513W.2/1">When QinetiQ became a company in July 2001, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) put in place a range of measures to ensure that the company did not undertake activities that could cause an unmanageable conflict of interest affecting its ability to carry out work for MOD customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.513W.2/2">In addition, the MOD had a separate right to require QinetiQ to seek our specific approval if it wished to carry out certain defence manufacturing activities which might also cause a conflict of interest. In reviewing the operation of the compliance regime, the Department has concluded that the existence of this additional approvals process on top of the wider conflict of interest protections has caused some confusion, and that there is scope for simplifying the regime. Consequently, the MOD has agreed with the company that the separate defence manufacturing approvals process will be removed from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase>, by which date the MOD willbe in a position to open its research programme tofull competition, potentially providing greater opportunities for the rest of industry to bid for work and increasing the options available to MOD customers. This change will not affect the level of protection available to customers who will exercise their rights through the wider provisions contained elsewhere in the compliance regime.</p>

	<p pid="b.522W.2/1">In October, in the run-up to the 6th Ministerial meeting in Hong Kong, the EU made an offer on improved market access for agricultural products. Others, such as the US, did so too. An agreed feature of the market access negotiations is that all countries will be permitted to protect sensitive products, by applying less than the agreed reduction rates to the tariffs on these products. The EU suggested that up to 8 per cent. of a country's tariff lines on agricultural products should be deemed sensitive products. The US suggested 1 per cent., so there is a considerable divide here that, because the matter was not discussed or decided at Hong Kong, still needs bridging.</p>
	<p pid="b.522W.2/2">The Commission has not made any list of sensitive products available as yet; nor is it likely to do so before the figure for sensitive products is agreed. The EU may yet have to offer a lower figure than 8 per cent. in order to secure a Doha deal. In addition, agreeing the treatment of sensitive products is, of course, as important as agreeing the number.</p>
	<p pid="b.522W.2/3">The UK Government are not endorsing any product as sensitive until the number and treatment of sensitive products is agreed. In general, you will be aware that the UK Government wishes to see only a minimal number of sensitive products as we believe a large number would undermine the potential benefits of the Doha Round.</p>
	<p pid="b.522W.2/4">The representatives for the Egg Industry can lobby the Commission direct. The UK Government will review its own position when we know the parameters we have to work to.</p>

	<p pid="b.523W.8/1">The decision to control grey squirrel lies with individual landowners and we have no plans to carry out culling of grey squirrel on private land.

	<p pid="b.523W.8/2">The recently published Grey Squirrels and England's Woodlands: Policy and Action Statement set out specific areas for action by the Forestry Commission over the next three years. These are:</p>

They are still working with landowners in the buffer zones to ensure grey squirrels are also controlled in these areas. The Forestry Commission's English Woodland Grant scheme will enable incentives to be offered towards the cost of grey squirrel control.</p>

	<p pid="b.527W.2/1">Since 2000, DEFRA has funded the following relevant projects as part of the support available for farm diversification:</p>
	<p pid="b.527W.2/2" class="indent">one project funded through delegated grants under the objective 1 programme in Cornwall from 2001 to 2003</p>
	<p pid="b.527W.2/3" class="indent">one project funded through a Countryside Service Sustainable Development Grant in 2004&ndash;05 to assist the running of a private shoot; and</p>
	<p pid="b.527W.2/4" class="indent">a further project involving game processing for retail sale after the birds had been shot. This was funded through the rural enterprise scheme in 2003&ndash;04</p>
	<p pid="b.527W.2/5">ERDP (England rural development plan) schemes do not target specific sectors of the food industry, including people involved with pheasant rearing. It is up to individual applicants to come up with projects that meet the criteria of ERDP schemes. ERDP schemes are also competitive, and there is no guarantee that an entirely eligible application will receive funding.</p>

The tail docking of cattle is prohibited except in an emergency by a vet.

	<p pid="b.531W.8/1">Based on the assumption that this question relates to UK rural development programmes which will be developed in light of the new Rural Development Regulation (EC Regulation No. 1698 of 2005) and come into force from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, the overall budget for rural development in Europe has been set at &euro;69.75 billion for the period 2007&ndash;13.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.8/2">The agreement on the EU budget deal allows member states, including the UK, to begin the necessary preparatory work for the next round of rural development programmes to run from 2007. The allocation of EU rural development funds to member states has yet to be determined and will be subject to proposals currently being devised by the European Commission. The figure of &euro;69.75 billion is similar to current rural development expenditure, although the focus of this expenditure in the new financial perspective will be upon the new member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.8/3">Importantly, the agreed budget deal included a provision allowing member states, at their discretion, to transfer up to 20 per cent. of pillar 1 funds and make them available for expenditure on rural development measures. Decisions on the overall level of transfer needed will depend on the UK's share of EU funding for rural development, and on the overall size and content of the new rural development programmes to operate from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>. In England, we hope to launch a public consultation on the next rural development programme in February 2006.</p>

We will want to look both to the past and to the lessons that have been learnt and to raise awareness of the millions of people still living under contemporary forms of slavery. Around the world, the UK works in partnership with foreign Governments, international organisations and civil society to break the cycle of poverty and social exclusion that are at the root of most forms of contemporary slavery.

To put the above-mentioned number of asbestos fibres in context, the USA Environment Protection Agency has set a limit on the number of fibres allowed in drinking water at seven million (7,000,000) per litre. Moreover, it is the view of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that there is no consistent evidence that ingested asbestos is hazardous to health and thus it is concluded that there is no need to establish a health-based guideline value for asbestos and drinking water. The Department is guided by the WHO advice on the matter.</p>

The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) and Executive have a parallel and similarly stringent mechanism through Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1993 which has race as an equality category. However the Department has agreed with the Commission for Racial Equality that the Northern Ireland Office will operate on the principle that section 71(1) of the Race Relations Act and amendment Order applies to all of the Northern Ireland Office functions both in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It was further agreed that the Department' s equality related statutory duties will be reviewed as part of a wider review of the NIO's equality scheme under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The Commission for Racial Equality will review compliance when the reviewed equality scheme is completed.</p>

	<p pid="b.540W.5/1">District councils were made aware of the possibility of a reduction to the grant and closure of the Waste Management Grant Scheme during the summer of 2005. When this was confirmed in October 2005, councils made adjustments to their spending plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.540W.5/2">In light of pressures on the Northern Ireland budget, Ministers have had no option but to take a firm line on resource funding. Their approval to provide funding for the last year of the scheme, granted at the end of December 2005, was given with the condition that the money should only be used for capital projects as originally planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.540W.5/3">EHS was not in a position to advise councils while it pressed for a relaxation to the resource funding position, which it continued to do until mid-January. When it became clear that there was no prospect of change, the matter was raised at the NILGA meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.541W.2/1">I fully recognise the difficulties faced by local councils in meeting their waste management requirements, particularly those contained in the EU Landfill Directive. My Department is committed to working in partnership with councils to assist them with these responsibilities and to this end, we have set up a number of important working groups comprising representatives from central and local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.2/2">The Northern Ireland Landfill Allowances Scheme (NILAS) Implementation Steering Group was established in June 2005 with the aim of ensuring that Northern Ireland maximises the possibility of achieving the Landfill Directive targets for the reduction of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.2/3">One of the key tasks facing local councils is the provision of a network of new infrastructure to ensure that landfill diversion targets are met. In April 2005, the Department established a Waste Infrastructure Task Force to help councils with the planning and procurement of new waste management facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.2/4">The main work of the task force involves identifying appropriate structural arrangements for the procurement of waste infrastructure; the likely location, type and cost of the facilities; and a suitable procurement and funding package.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.2/5">From a financial point of view, the Department of the Environment's Environment and Heritage Service continues to support councils through grants for the treatment and safe disposal of fridges and end of life vehicles.</p>

Guidance for companies on the effect of the amendments was placed on the DTI website prior to that date. Regulations implementing the requirement of the Directive to produce a Business Review and introducing the Operating and Financial Review were made in March 2005. Guidance covering both aspects of the 2005 regulations was placed on the DTI website prior to that date. Following a decision not to proceed with the Operating and Financial Review the guidance has now been updated to relate solely to the Business Review and consultation is under way about what changes to the Businesses Review is needed as a consequence.</p>

	<p pid="b.548W.0/1">The Department has extensive contact with Ofgem, Energywatch and gas and electricity suppliers about a range of aspects of domestic gas and electricity supply, including erroneous transfers. DTI, Ofgem and Energywatch have been closely involved in the suppliers' Customer Transfer Programme, which began in June 2003. This is a very substantial project that is designed to improve all aspects of the switching process, including reducing erroneous transfers. Such transfers have already fallen significantly. In 2005 there were around 110 complaints per month about erroneous transfers of gas supply. In the same period, gas transfers were running at an average of 300,000 per month. This compares with 150 complaints per month in 2004, and 290 per month in 2003. I expect complaints about erroneous transfers to decline still further once the Customer Transfer Programme is completed in March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.549W.8/1">The Government have decided to widen their current consultation on company narrative reporting requirements. This will ensure that all points of view and relevant up-to-date evidence are taken into account while the current Company Law Reform Bill is going through Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.8/2">The Government took the decision in November 2005 to repeal the mandatory requirement on quoted companies to prepare an Operating and Financial Review (OFR) as contained in the OFR regulations so that they are required to prepare a Business Review instead. This decision was made in the light of the Government's strong commitment to sustainable development, strategic forward-looking narrative reporting and its policy of not imposing unnecessary burdens on UK companies, and taking into account the large body of evidence from previous consultations on narrative reporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.8/3">Chapter 6 of Part 15 of the Company Law Reform Bill contains provisions relating to narrative reporting by companies. The Government are now inviting comments on any considerations which Ministers should take into account in deciding whether, and if so how, to frame amendments to these or other provisions of the Company Law Reform Bill to ensure effective forward looking narrative reporting by quoted companies, including, where appropriate, on social, community, employee and environmental matters. The consultation is therefore extended to invite views from all stakeholders on the full range of options for reporting, including matters previously contained within Schedule 7ZA of the Companies Act 1985 and within the Accounts Modernisation Directive (2003/51/EC), and any other matters relevant to narrative reporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.549W.8/4">The Government will also consider in light of responses to this consultation whether existing business reporting requirements should be amended by regulations under secondary legislation as an interim measure before the new Bill comes into force. For the avoidance of doubt, however, no such changes would apply to financial reporting periods which had commenced before any new regulations had been passed. This is to ensure that companies have certainty as to their current legal reporting obligations and have adequate time to prepare for any changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.550W.2/1">The Company Law Reform Bill is part of a wider programme of Government and market-led reform to support enterprise, encourage investment and promote long-term performance in order to ensure that Britain remains one of the best places in the world to set up and run a business.</p>
	<p pid="b.550W.2/2">A key part of the Bill is the statutory statement of directors' duties. This will provide greater clarity on what is expected of directors. It will also recognise in statute that business prosperity and responsible business behaviour are two sides of the same coin: directors are required to promote the success of the company in the collective best interests of shareholders, having regard to wider factors such as the interests of employees, the community and the environment. Re-stating this requirement will help directors to understand that they need to look beyond the short-term financial bottom line, but company law is not the right vehicle for addressing specific social, environmental or community issues.</p>

As part of this legislative framework, HSE's HM Railways Inspectorate, on behalf of the Secretary of State ensure on a case-by-case basis that individual level crossings are compliant with the legislation and thereby ensure that essential safety standards are being met.</p>

	<p pid="b.559W.14/2">The Safe and Fuel Efficient Driving (SAFED) Scheme has been highly successful in the truck sector. The Department undertook research in 2005 to study the van sector, to adapt and develop the existing scheme to be appropriate for vans and to pilot the training course to determine how effective it would be. The results were published on our website on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January 2006</phrase>. A key stakeholder advisory group was formed to advise and steer this pilot project.</p>
	<p pid="b.559W.14/3">There was no formal public consultation on the scheme, though the stakeholder advisory group were key to developing the scheme and views on the concept were sought from the Road Haulage Forum. While the Government routinely consults on regulatory proposals, it should be stressed that this is not new regulation. There is no requirement on van drivers to undertake this training.</p>

	<p pid="b.568W.3/2">Current income-support and jobseeker's allowance rules offer generous treatment to awards of compensation made to victims of violent crime. Our general policy is to allow injured people to safeguard their long-term financial position without losing benefit entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.3/3">The normal and most beneficial way for an injured person to handle a large payment of compensation is to place it in trust. The capital value of a trust is entirely disregarded, as are any payments from it, provided they are intended and used for items other than everyday living expenses, for example, the injured person's special needs. Even when used for everyday living expenses, payments are disregarded if they are no more than &pound;20 per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.3/4">Following a recent review of the rules, a full disregard will apply to income derived from monies held in trust, as a consequence of a personal injury, from October 2006. This will align the income support and jobseeker's allowance rules with those in state pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.3/5">In addition, a new grace period of 52 weeks will be introduced, during which any lump sum personal injury payment, can be automatically disregarded without needing to be placed in a trust fund at the outset.</p>

It has been established that to date 541 DNA profiles of the 24,168 DNA profiles taken from persons under 18 years who had not been charged or cautioned for an offence have subsequently been 'matched' to DNA recovered from unsolved crime scenes stored on the National DNA Database, providing the police with key intelligence leads on the possible identity of the offender and assisting crime investigation and detection.</p>

It is then sorted into the relevant accommodation unit and distributed to the unit officer. Mail is opened by the detainees in front of the officer who ensures it contains nothing prohibited.

Where the items therein are not ones which the detainee can keep in his/her personal possession, he/she should be advised of the reason for this and informed that they will be held with his/her property held by the centre. The detainee must be given a receipt for the property and a record must be kept.</p>

	<p pid="b.570W.2/1">The Home Office has developed its current best estimate of the cost of using the ID cards scheme to support the services which it oversees and these costs have been incorporated into the business case.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.2/2">In deriving these estimates account has to be taken of current and planned levels of investment in similar or related technologies and the types of use required to support the particular services which the Home Office oversees. Not all services will require a high degree of integration between the ID cards scheme and other IT systems. For many, integration costs will be absorbed in the usual cycle of system upgrades and technology refresh. Therefore, these costs are not in our estimates and would be a matter for each department to consider based on their business case for using the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.2/3">We cannot release the detailed estimated costs for integrating IT systems within the Home Office and other Government Departments at this stage as these elements may be acquired from the market. The estimates are therefore commercially sensitive and to release them may prejudice the procurement process and the Department's ability to obtain value for money from potential suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.2/4">The current best estimates for the cost to the citizen were outlined in the regulatory impact assessment published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-25">25 May 2005</phrase>. The current best estimate for the cost of a passport and ID card package is &pound;93. In October 2005, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced that a stand alone ID card for British citizens would cost &pound;30.</p>

	<p pid="b.571W.2/2">However, the special issues research conducted in October and November 2004, comprised a number of focus groups which included a group of Hindu females and a group of Sikh males from Birmingham. This issues raised from these particular groups was the concern that Sikh men would not have to remove their turbans in order to be enrolled on the ID card scheme. The group of Sikh men were also concerned that they might have to carry their ID card with them at all times. Both the Hindu female and Sikh male groups expressed views that the ID card was a positive idea as it would allow people to prove their identity and would assist if someone had a car accident for example. The Sikh male group also expressed a preference that staff working in the enrolment centres in areas of high ethnic minorities should be bi-lingual. The Hindu female group also expressed concerns that information on the Register might be 'sold' to private companies. The Identity Cards Bill which is currently before Parliament includes no such provision.</p>

There are currently 1,340 trainee probation officers in the programme and the sum allocated for the training in 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;51.4 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.577W.2/2">One of the key objectives for the National Offender Management Service in the next year is to map out the need of offenders on a regional basis, using OASys and other assessment tools. This will enable regional offender managers to commission services on the basis of identified need rather than historic provision. For 2006&ndash;07, service level agreements will be based largely on existing service provision.</p>

	<p pid="b.587W.3/1">When probation trusts are established, most staff will transfer from probation boards to the new trusts on the same terms and conditions of employment. If, in due course, work transfers to an alternative provider, staff will generally transfer, with their pay, terms and conditions protected by TUPE and the recent extension of the Two Tier Workforce Agreement. Staff who do not wish to transfer will be free to terminate their contract of employment. The employment status of chief officers will change in the transition from boards to trusts: they will cease to be statutory office holders appointed by the Secretary of State and will instead be appointed and employed by the trust itself. If a chief is not appointed to the trust, he or she will be compensated accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="b.587W.9/1">The National Offender Management Service has a target to reduce re-offending by 5 per cent. by 2008 and by 10 per cent. by the end of the decade. The restructuring proposals are part of a broader programme of change, including the introduction of end-to-end offender management and improvements in IT systems, which will help to contribute to the achievement of that target. The consultation paper does not seek to quantify the extent to which the restructuring proposals alone will reduce re-offending. But experience elsewhere suggests that the introduction of competition in the delivery of services helps to drive up performance. Examples from the custodial sector are given in the partial regulatory impact assessment which was published alongside the consultation paper.</p>

	<p pid="b.591W.9/17">Forecasts of spending on benefits are based on estimates of those who will actually receive the benefit, not those who are entitled. This is in accordance with Government Accounting rules that require forecasts to be taut and realistic. Forecasts are generally based on trends in administrative data on people actually in receipt of benefits. This normally means take-up of benefits is implicitly assumed to remain at around current levels, although the anticipated impact of initiatives to increase take up will also be included. Forecasts do not make an explicit assumption about take-up.</p>
	<p pid="b.591W.9/18">Consequently, there is no saving, relative to spending plans, from take-up of benefits being lower than 100 per cent. If take-up of benefits was higher than is implicit in the forecasts, spending would be higher than planned.</p>

	<p pid="b.594W.5/1">The amount of child maintenance can be affected by the number of nights the child spends with the non-resident parent. However, this calculation is based on what is actually happening. The Agency therefore relies on the information provided by both parents, rather than a third party such as CAFCASS.</p>
	<p pid="b.594W.5/2">We do value working in partnership with stakeholders, and although there are no formal contracts between the Child Support Agency and CAFCASS at present, the Agency is committed to extending their relationship with stakeholders and will include CAFCASS in any future stakeholder communication.</p>

	<p pid="b.598W.2/1">The Government have set themselves the ambitious target of increasing the employment rate of lone parents to 70 per cent. by 2010. The target is measured using the labour force survey and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of employment which includes both full and part-time employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/2">Helping lone parents return to the labour market is the most effective way of ensuring their social inclusion and is the best route out of poverty for them and their children. Additionally, the increase in sustainable employment that results from this movement into work increases the productive potential of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/3">We have already made significant progress in achieving this target. There are now over 1 million lone parents in work, 318,000 more than in 1997; the lone parent employment rate has increased by 11 percentage points since 1997, currently standing at 56.6 per cent. and the number of lone parents claiming income support has fallen by around a quarter since 1997.</p>

This is inevitable in a dynamic labour market, but the evidence shows that new deal helps people stay in work longer than those in the general labour market.

I am replying in her absence. (46965)</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/4" class="indent">As a result of changes in society, which include increased mobility and different living arrangements, it is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate the size of the population. Substantial work has been done on the difference between mid-year population estimates and the 2001 Census. This work is summarised in the final report of the 2004 Local Authority Population Studies, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf</a> This document provides further links to other detailed reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/5" class="indent">Work undertaken includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/6" class="indent">An initial assessment of accuracy of the mid-year population estimates;</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/7" class="indent">A revised allowance for under-enumeration in the 1991 Census;</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/8" class="indent">The Longitudinal Study Adjustment for young men (and other minor changes); and</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/9" class="indent">The Local Authority Population Studies.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/10" class="indent">These studies confirmed that the 2001 Census had worked well in most areas, but there were a few cases where it was not able to adjust sufficiently for exceptional circumstances. This work, together with revised international migration estimates, accounted for a large proportion of the initial 1.1 million difference between mid year estimates and the Census; reducing the difference to a little over 0.2 million</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/11" class="indent">Further information on population estimates can be found in the detailed methodology guide to 'Making a population estimate in England and Wales'. This is published here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575</a></p>
	<p pid="b.609W.0/12" class="indent">ONS is now investing substantially in a project to Improve Migration and Population Statistics (IMPS). (More information on this project can be found here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a>). The key aims of this project are to reduce the size of the difference between population estimates and mid-year estimates for 2011 when the next Census is undertaken and to better understand any difference that does remain.</p>

	<p pid="b.616W.6/1">Nearly 13 million people have registered on the organ donor register (ODR), 22 per cent. of the United Kingdom population. The Department gives around &pound;1 million yearly to the NHS blood and transport (NHSBT) to run the ODR and to promote transplantation and also provides section 64 grants to a number of charities. Specific initiatives include funding through NHSBT to support hospital based initiatives. I recently wrote to all Members of Parliament to ask them to help raise awareness within their constituencies, and the Prime Minister also hosted a reception to celebrate the success of transplantation. Online registration initiatives include Oran-ise, an online game to encourage students to register, and nearly 50 web-based campaigns run by national health service organisations, further education establishments and professional organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.621W.5/1">A survey published by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in 2003 found that the mean level of mercury in canned tuna sold in the United Kingdom was 0.19 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). All the samples were below the statutory limit for mercury in tuna of one mg/kg. The only sample of canned yellowfin in the survey had one of the lowest mercury levels found in canned tuna (0.05 mg/kg). The FSA advice is that pregnant women and women who intend to become pregnant should limit their consumption of tuna to no more than four medium size cans per week or two fresh tuna steaks.</p>
