	<p pid="b.2802W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Rob Wye to Dan Norris dated: <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-25">25 July 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.2802W.5/3" class="indent">I am writing on Mark Haysom's behalf due to him currently being on annual leave, in response to your recent Parliamentary Question in which you asked the Secretary of State for Education and Skills &quot;how many students aged 16 to 18 years are in receipt of education maintenance allowance in each institution in <i>(a)</i> North East Somerset, <i>(b)</i> South Gloucestershire and <i>(c)</i> Wansdyke.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.2802W.5/4" class="indent">Information on the number of young people who have applied, enrolled and received EMA is available at Local Education Authority level, but not at constituency level. Attached is a breakdown by school/college of 16, 17, 18 and 19 year old students who have received EMA during the academic year 2004/2005 in the Local Education Authorities of Gloucestershire, Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, City of Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. If a young person attended and received payment from more than one institute then they will be counted more than once in this report.</p>
	<p pid="b.2802W.5/5" class="indent">During the Academic year 2004/2005 EMA was available to all 16 years olds across England who met the eligibility criteria and also to those 17, 18 and 19 years olds who reside in former EMA pilot areas (and meet eligibility criteria).</p>
	<p pid="b.2802W.5/6" class="indent">Although there were no pilot areas in Gloucestershire, West of England and Somerset Local Learning and Skills Council (LSC) areas the attached data shows some 17 and 18 years olds having received EMA payments. This is because either the young person travels across area borders to attend school/college (assessment is based upon residence of young person) or they have moved residence from a non-pilot area during the academic year.</p>
	<p pid="b.2802W.5/7" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful and addresses your question. If you would like further details please contact Chris Bradley at the LSC National Office on 0114 207 4512 or christopher. bradley@lsc.gov.uk</p>

From the point when the last centre goes live, the new control centres are expected to achieve, on average, a steady state saving of some 30 per cent. over existing arrangements, which will result in net savings to each fire and rescue authority. However, figures are not yet available for each authority, as the FiReControl business case only exists at national level.

	<p pid="b.2818W.11/1">It is not practicable to offer a Welsh language telephone service. Under the Department's draft Welsh Language Scheme those who call and wish to speak in Welsh will be given the option of writing in Welsh and receiving an answer in the same language or continuing the conversation in English.</p>
	<p pid="b.2818W.11/2">In recognition of its operational role and its delivery of services direct to the public in Wales, Her Majesty's Court Service, an executive agency of the Department for Constitutional Affairs, also has a Welsh Language Scheme. A public consultation on the Scheme finished at the end of June and it has now been approved by the Welsh Language Board and came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July 2005</phrase>. The Scheme can be found at: <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/3437.htm">http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/3437.htm</a> Under the terms of the Scheme, Her Majesty's Court Service will provide a Welsh telephone service to its users. This can be accessed direct by phoning any of the Service's offices in Wales or if phoning one of its offices in England the call may be transferred to the Service's Welsh Language Unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.2818W.11/3">Neither the Department nor Her Majesty's Court Service has any facilities for dealing with telephone inquiries in Scots Gaelic or Irish Gaelic.</p>

	<p pid="b.2820W.3/2">For Scots Gaelic speakers, if the person cannot converse in English, we would use the departmental telephone interpreting service, provided by Language Line, who can provide interpreters. Written Gaelic queries are extremely rare, but we could obtain translation from, and into, Gaelic, if the need arose. The same principle would apply to any contacts from Irish Gaelic speakers, but as responsibility for most social security, child support and pensions matters rests with the Northern Ireland Department for Social Development, this would be most unlikely to happen in practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.2826W.2/1">The 50db threshold for benefit payment was set following the advice of experts in audio logy and the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council who determined that this level of loss equated to 20 per cent. disablement in the Industrial Injuries Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.2826W.2/2">The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council advised that noise-induced hearing loss is only slowly progressive. Thus a person whose claim for disablement benefit has been disallowed is unlikely to suffer deterioration in their hearing loss due to noise to the degree that they fulfil the criteria for diagnosing occupational deafness (prescribed disease (PD) A10) in less than three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.2826W.2/3">A claim cannot be made less than three years after the previous disallowance of a claim. This is because the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council advised that noise-induced deafness is only slowly progressive. A person who fails to fulfil the diagnostic criterion of a 50dB loss is unlikely to suffer deterioration in their hearing loss due to noise to the degree that they fulfil the criteria in less than three years.</p>

	<p pid="b.2827W.2/1">The new deal is not a job creation scheme. It is designed to help unemployed and disadvantaged people into work or training. It has already been successful in helping more than 1.3 million people into employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/2">Research has been conducted on the macro-economic effect of new deal for young people (NDYP) and new deal for lone parents (NDLP). Information is not available on new deal 25 Plus, new deal for disabled or new deal for partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/3">A national audit office report <sup>1</sup> suggested that the average annual cost per additional person of any age in employment through new deal for young people is within the range of &pound;5,000-&pound;8,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/4">The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) undertook a detailed macro-economic analysis of NDYP until March 2002 <sup>2</sup> . NIESR calculated the net budgetary cost per job was &pound;7,000 per annum (excluding the environmental task force and voluntary sector options) or &pound;4,000 per annum when these two options are included.</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/5">NIESR calculated that by March 2000, NDYP had reduced unemployment among all age groups by 35,000. They also estimated that NDYP raised youth employment by 15,000 (excluding those on the environmental task force and voluntary sector options). Adding these two options raised this to 30,000 more young people in work due to NDYP.</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/6">Evidence on the cost effectiveness of new deal for lone parents (NDLP) comes from the cost benefit analysis of NDLP carried out by departmental economists. The findings were published in the NDLP evaluation synthesis report in June 2003 <sup>3</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/7">The unit costs of NDLP in 2000&ndash;01 were &pound;400 per participant. The gross cost per job was around &pound;860 and the cost per additional job was &pound;1,560.</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/8">A calculation of cost effectiveness takes into account the additional earnings from movements into work and the costs of running the programme in 2000&ndash;01. NDLP provided a significant net economic gain to society, with a net benefit of over &pound;4,400 from each additional job, and a total net gain of &pound;115 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/9">The net impact on public finance was also calculated. This included the cost of in-work credits and benefits such as the working families' tax credit. NDLP in 2001&ndash;02 resulted in a net exchequer saving of &pound;1,600 for each additional job entry; a total saving of &pound;41.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2827W.2/10">The assumptions made in the above calculations can be found in the listed reports, which are available in the Library.</p>

Friend, the Secretary of State, announced a Climate Change Communications Initiative worth &pound;12 million, to be spilt over three years (&pound;4 million per 2005, 2006 and 2007). The initiative aims to change attitudes within the general public at local and regional levels through communication projects. Research shows that getting attitude change is the best first step to behaviour change. Defra, working with partners (EST, CT, DTI, EA, DFT, UKCIP), NGOs and others, will begin implementing this communication initiative in 2005. A main component of the initiative is a Fund and grants from this to community and other groups will enable the establishment of local projects. This will be supported with a website, a communicators guide and local activities. The website will link with Defra's children's section which addresses climate change consistent with the main initiative.</p>

	<p pid="b.2832W.3/23">For carbon dioxide the main increase and decreases superimposed on the background trend are associated with the temporary peaks on 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2002, and the increase between 2002 and 2003. These were associated mainly with temperature fluctuations relative to the trend in temperatures. The underlying trend in emissions is determined by the interaction between economic growth, the mix of fuels in the economy and the energy needed per unit of economic output.</p>
	<p pid="b.2832W.3/24">The rapid decline in CH <sub>4</sub> emissions between 1993 and 1994 was mainly due to a large decrease in emissions from coal mining. Ch <sub>4</sub> emissions follow a gradual downward trend that can be attributed to the sum of reductions in emissions from energy, waste and agriculture. The underlying decrease is a result of changing waste disposal practices and a reduction in fugitive emissions from fuels. Agriculture emissions were reasonably steady until the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001 led to reduced livestock numbers and a subsequent reduction in enteric fermentation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2832W.3/25">The large decrease in N <sub>2</sub> O emissions between 1998 and 1999 was due to the introduction of abatement technology at a plant producing adipic acid for nylon manufacture. The more gradual rise from 1993 to 1997 can be attributed to an increase in the number of cars fitted with catalytic converters and to a slight rise in emissions from agriculture. The overall downward trend in N+O emissions is due to the gradual rise in emissions from energy being offset by a larger decrease in the industrial sector and general downward trend in agricultural emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.2832W.3/26">HFCs slow rise was dramatically cut between 1997 and 1999 with the installation of abatement technology.</p>

	<p pid="b.2833W.2/1">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, has regular opportunities to talk to her EU colleagues about a wide range of issues during the meetings of the Agriculture Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.2833W.2/2">A comprehensive import regime exists in European Community law to ensure that food of animal origin does not pose a health risk. Products such as meat, eggs and dairy products must come from approved establishments in approved countries and must be accompanied by official health certificates. Products may only be imported into the EU via approved Border Inspection Posts where veterinary checks are carried out to make sure they comply with the import conditions set out in law.</p>
	<p pid="b.2833W.2/3">Imported food, including food not of animal origin, must meet food safety and food standards requirements equivalent to those for UK-produced food, and can be subject to checks on the basis of risk assessment by local food authorities at UK ports and inland to ensure they comply.</p>
	<p pid="b.2833W.2/4">Emergency safeguard measures to further restrict or control imports may be taken where there is an outbreak of disease in an exporting country, or other circumstances likely to present a serious public or animal health risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.2833W.2/5">The importation of products of meat and dairy products by individual travellers in their personal luggage is judged to be a potential route by which animal disease could be introduced into the European Union. Following pressure by the Government, new, tighter EU rules were introduced in 2003 effectively banning personal imports of meat and dairy products (including bushmeat). The Government have increased the level of resource available to combat the illegal importation of such products.</p>

	<p pid="b.2835W.0/1">The original intention of the Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 was to impose a complete ban on former foodstuffs containing products of animal origin being sent to landfill from <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-20">20 May</phrase> this year, prior to a working group meeting in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May</phrase>, officials from my Department along with those in other member states received papers from the European Commission indicating a change in the Commission's approach to implementing the ban. Subsequently, at the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May</phrase>, the Commission announced its intention to allow pre-treated former foodstuffs that member states believe do not pose a risk to animal or public health to continue to go to landfill, under the control of the EU Landfill Directive rather than the Animal By-Products Regulation. The Commission has now tabled a draft amending Regulation to bring this into effect. The draft covers former foodstuffs that are not considered safe to be fed to livestock but which can safely be disposed of to landfill or treated in an alternative system; and, those that can be fed to livestock (bread, pasta, etc) or be disposed of to landfill. The measure does not apply to raw meat and raw fish which are already banned from disposal to landfill and which must be disposed of in accordance with the Regulation i.e. by rendering, incineration, composting or treatment by biogas.</p>
	<p pid="b.2835W.0/2">The Department did not ask the Commission to reverse the complete ban on former foodstuffs being sent to landfill. However, in the light of discussions with a variety of parties, we drew the Commission's attention to the difficulties they had with compliance, and particularly those that small retailers anticipated. We suggested to the Commission that these difficulties could be lessened if the requirements for commercial documentation and transport were brought more into line with existing environmental controls, and if alternative treatments were to be permitted providing livestock were not able to have access to the treated product. Nevertheless, we support the principle that as far as the Animal By-Products Regulation is concerned the ban on landfill should apply only to those former foodstuffs which present a risk to animal and public health. The Government is committed to reducing the UK's reliance on landfill, in order to reduce its environmental impact and because landfilling is a missed opportunity to recover value from waste. Therefore the Government will continue to adopt measures that will progressively discourage the landfilling of wastes including former foodstuffs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2835W.0/3">The Department has given regular guidance on the disposal of former foodstuffs during the course of business to waste management companies and there is detailed guidance on the current disposal rules on the Defra website. In addition, throughout the course of this year officials have held a number of meetings with the waste management sector on the disposal of former foodstuffs. Most recently, officials met a number of waste management companies and the Environment Services Association on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-13">13 April</phrase>, the UK Renderers' Association on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">21 June</phrase>, the Composting Association on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-27">27 May</phrase> and the Regulated Incinerator Operators on <phrase class="date" code="">21 June</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.2836W.5/1">Telephone inquiries received in Welsh are dealt with in accordance with Defra's Welsh Language Scheme which came into force in October 2002. This requires operators in offices dealing with the public in Wales to answer calls bilingually and to have a system whereby calls in Welsh taken by staff who cannot speak Welsh can be transferred to a Welsh-speaker. Defra does not currently have facilities for dealing with telephone inquiries in Scots or Irish Gaelic.</p>

	<p pid="b.2839W.3/1">A capacity planning exercise was conducted with strategic health authorities in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.2839W.3/2">The additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) capacity commissioned nationally from Alliance Medical Ltd. was designed to complement existing national health service services and to quickly bring on stream additional capacity to help meet rising demand for MRI examinations and to begin to address waits for MRI imaging services.</p>
	<p pid="b.2839W.3/3">Utilisation rates of NHS scanners are a matter for NHS trusts, in partnership with their local primary care trusts as service commissioners. While the independent sector has a key part to play, NHS providers of diagnostics services also need to ensure that they are using their diagnostic capacity to the full.</p>

	<p pid="b.2839W.6/2">The number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed on national health service patients has been increasing year on year to over 855,000 in 2003&ndash;04.

NHS bodies are under a duty to consult overview and scrutiny committees on any plans to make substantial variation to NHS services.

	<p pid="b.2842W.5/1">The merger of the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Healthcare Commission will support closer integration of social care and health inspection and form part of Government plans to streamline public service inspection by reducing the number of main inspectorates to four. It forms part of the Government's wider programme to modernise and streamline the inspection of public services. We will consider its regulatory impact as part of detailed work on the shape of the new organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2842W.5/2">The merger is expected to generate efficiencies and economies of scale which contribute to the delivery of savings to be attained across all of the Department's arm's length bodies (ALBs) as a result of the ALB review. Details of budgets and staffing levels of the new body will be developed as implementation planning progresses, following the wider review of regulation in social care and health now under way.</p>

The independent sector has an important role to play, which is why we are proceeding with a procurement of &pound;1 billion diagnostics services from the independent sector over five years from 2006&ndash;07.

	<p pid="b.2853W.5/1">Until April 2002, local councils regulated independent sector care homes and health authorities regulated nursing homes. Each council regulated the care homes in its area, based on national regulations using locally developed standards. This system led to inconsistencies between different areas and some services, like domiciliary care, were not regulated at all. The Government addressed this by introducing new regulatory arrangements to ensure consistency and improve the quality of life and level of protection for vulnerable people receiving social and health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.2853W.5/2">From April 2002 to April 2004, the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) registered and inspected all care homes and independent hospitals in England and started to extend regulation to other social care services. The Commission for Health Improvement was responsible for assessing the performance of national health service organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.2853W.5/3">Since April 2004, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) has been responsible for inspecting all registered social care and the Healthcare Commission (HC) has been responsible for inspecting all NHS organisations and independent healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="b.2853W.5/4">In addition, the Mental Health Act Commission is responsible for keeping under review the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1983 as it relates to patients who are detained or are liable to be detained in long-term care settings.</p>
	<p pid="b.2853W.5/5">In light of the Government's continuing commitment to lightening the burden of regulation, from 2008, there are plans to make further improvements through the merger of CSCI and the HC and to have just one inspectorate for all these services.</p>
	<p pid="b.2853W.5/6">Like other businesses outside the health and social care sectors, providers are also subject to other regulators, such as the Health and Safety Executive and the fire service.</p>

The Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, was able to include an adjustment for the growth area initiative in this round of allocations. The growth area adjustment informs the target position of PCTs within the growth areas. It is the PCTs' target positions that determine their fair shares of the revenue allocations.

	<p pid="b.2859W.2/1">There have been no formal assessments made on the level of abuse of methadone. However, the Department recognises the key role that effective substitute prescribing has to play in meeting our overall aim of offering high quality treatment to drug misusers. It is because of this commitment that the Department published <i>Drug Misuse and Dependence&mdash;Guidelines on Clinical Management (1999),</i> which is widely regarded as being extremely successful in assisting prescribers in offering appropriate treatment to their patients. Part of this also tackles the issue of diversion of methadone through advice on supervised consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.2859W.2/2">Building on this, the National Treatment Agency (NTA), which has a remit to improve the availability and quality of drug treatment, has just completed an audit of prescribing services in England which will be available shortly. The NTA will also be undertaking series of reviews of community prescribing services with the Healthcare Commission, later in 2005. The NTA has performance management structures in place to effectively tackle those drug action teams assessed as underperforming, as far as provision of drug treatment is concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.2859W.2/3">One of the key measures used to assess the quality of substitute prescribing, including levels of diversion, is the number of drug related deaths associated with its use. In 2003, the latest year for which figures are available, 167 deaths associated with the use of methadone were reported. This compares with 286 in 1999, a reduction of 42 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.2859W.2/4">As part of our ongoing commitment to continue to develop improved practise in substitute prescribing, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will, within a comprehensive package of work that it will be undertaking on drug treatment, do a specific appraisal on the clinical effectiveness of methadone in the treatment of drug misuse.</p>

	<p pid="b.2860W.0/1">It is not standard practice for the World Health Organisation (WHO) to consult member states about the compilation of the list of essential medicines. The WHO has an expert scientific advisory committee, which provides advice on maintaining and developing its list of essential medicines. It was through this process that mifepristone and misoprostol for use in medical abortion were included on the list It is for individual countries as to whether these medicines are authorised for supply. In the United Kingdom, these products have been authorised for use (on the basis of efficacy, safety and quality) by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.2860W.6/1">By 2007&ndash;08, we plan to deliver an unparalleled expansion in most diagnostic services to reduce waiting time for patients further. Most of this expansion will be delivered through increasing investment and productivity in the national health service, using the record levels of NHS funding for the next three years and making the best use of existing equipment and facilities. These plans are based on understanding and meeting local needs for diagnostic services, which have been developed through working closely with local health communities to understand their needs for extra capacity. While the independent sector has a key part to play, NHS providers of diagnostics services also need to ensure that they are using their diagnostic capacity to the full.</p>

	<p pid="b.2863W.5/1">NHS Direct now provides multi-media access to healthcare. I understand from the Chairman of NHS Direct that the number of calls to NHS Direct has increased from 110,000 in 1998&ndash;99 to over 29 million by 2004&ndash;05. In addition, there are now more than one million visitors each month to the online service. The NHS Direct self help guide is also available to 19 million households through the Thomson local directory. NHS Direct also provides access to healthcare through digital television and this will be extended to include cable and freeview throughout this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.2863W.5/2">Patients speak to an NHS Direct operator as soon as they are connected to NHS Direct. However, in June 2005, 10 per cent. of calls made to NHS Direct were not connected to NHS Direct as the caller abandoned the call. There are no data available to assess the reasons for abandonment or how many patients subsequently call again.</p>
	<p pid="b.2863W.5/3">Primary care trusts (PCTs) may choose to commission NHS Direct to provide general practice out-of hours call handling or nurse assessment. NHS Direct is currently involved in 45 out-of hours clinical integration schemes involving 99 PCTs across the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.2867W.8/1">The National Audit Office's report, &quot;Patient Choice at the Point of Referral&quot;, published in January 2005, accepted our estimate of &pound;122 million for the likely additional annual infrastructure costs and transaction costs for patient choice. The total spend on elective care in 2003&ndash;04 was &pound;8.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.2867W.8/2">Choice will lead to increased efficiencies in both primary and secondary as described in the National Audit Office's report. In hospitals, these efficiencies should include reductions in missed appointments and cancellations, meaning clinics can be run more efficiently. The cost of these in 2003&ndash;04 was approximately &pound;100 million for the 1.5 million missed first out-patient appointments that are most likely to be addressed by choice.</p>

The PEAT process is broad and considers more than hygiene standards, but cleanliness, including specific mention of wards, is weighted in the final score in recognition of its importance to patients. In addition to this national programme, many trusts undertake regular local inspections of their wards and other clinical areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.2871W.8/2">Standards for the patient environment have risen since PEAT began in 2000. Then, around a third of hospitals were rated poor or unacceptable. Today, 95 per cent. of national health service trusts are rated as acceptable or better.</p>
	<p pid="b.2871W.8/3">Most scientific evidence stresses hand hygiene and sound clinical practices as being particularly important in preventing healthcare associated infections (HCAIs). It is unlikely that a more stringent environmental inspection regime alone would significantly reduce HCAI rates.</p>

	<p pid="b.2874W.11/2">National Offender Management Service and the Prison Service have had connection to the Government Secure Intranet (GSI) and therefore secure e-mail for some time. The National Probation Service (NPS) have recently been granted access to the GSI which will increase the number of probation offices able to send and receive secure e-mail.</p>
	<p pid="b.2874W.11/3">All three organisations can, and do, exchange information already now, using their respective networks (GSI and GSX) as well as the secure e-mail facility.</p>
	<p pid="b.2874W.11/4">NOMS and HMPS are members of the GSI community which is accredited to handle material up to and including &quot;RESTRICTED&quot;. Currently the NPS is connected to the GSX which is not accredited to handle &quot;RESTRICTED&quot; material. This has placed some restriction on the nature and type of information which can be handled by the NPS electronically.</p>
	<p pid="b.2874W.11/5">However, the NPS application to join the GSI community has recently been approved, meaning that the NPS will soon be able to send information up to and including &quot;RESTRICTED&quot;. As a consequence this will mean that more information will be capable of being exchanged between the three organisations.</p>

With the announcement of the formation of the National Offender Management Service, this procurement programme (at the time known as STEPS 2) was put on hold until the requirements under the new organisation had become more clearly defined. In October 2004, the programme was resumed from the point at which it was put on hold, under a new name (OMNI) to reflect the change in the requirement. There have therefore been no wasted costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.2875W.8/2">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) formally came into being on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June</phrase>. A wide range of activities is already under way to support its principal aim of reducing re-offending. For example, an offender management model has been developed which will provide the focus for the implementation of offender management for both community and custodial sentences. A pathfinder in the north-west region has been operational since October 2004. The first evaluation report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>, and outlines the value of the north-west's testing of the model. The information gained is being fed into the implementation plans for prison and probation areas. A national offender manager and 10 regional offender managers have also been appointed. The latter will play the main role in commissioning and will help to build partnership working locally. A performance test for prisons on the Isle of Sheppey has been announced and consideration is being given to the best organisational design to support the NOMS reforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.2875W.8/3">The Secretary of State is currently considering advice on what more can be done within the existing framework and where legislation will be needed .

	<p pid="b.2878W.9/2">The West Midlands Route Utilisation Strategy was published by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) on <phrase class="date" code="">21 July</phrase>. The Strategy concluded that Coventry Arena station would present low levels of traffic for most of the week with occasional large event demands requiring train capacity far in excess of the current provision. The cost of rail provision to meet these high peaks in demand would be very high. Consequently a proposal to meet this demand had not been evaluated by the promoter and no business case for the station had been received. The SRA concluded that it was unable to support the inclusion of the station on the Coventry-Nuneaton route.</p>
	<p pid="b.2878W.9/3">The SRA wrote to Coventry city council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-24">24 August 2004</phrase> identifying a number of areas of concern with the outline business case. If the council wishes to pursue the proposal, it will need to address those concerns and submit to the Department a viable and funded business case.</p>

	<p pid="b.2884W.2/1">Spending on light rail varies from year to year according to the progress of schemes. Since the opening of Tyne and Wear Metro in 1980, Government have contributed some &pound;1.2 billion towards light rail schemes, including around &pound;0.7 billion since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.2884W.2/2">In 2004&ndash;05 the Department provided &pound;36 million to directly support light rail schemes outside London. This represents 0.3 per cent. of its Departmental budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.2884W.2/3">The Department does not directly fund light rail in London, therefore it is not possible to calculate precisely the percentage of the Departmental budget that is spent on light rail when taking London schemes into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.2884W.2/4">Transport for London&mdash;which receives approximately 45 per cent. of its income from grant provided by the Department&mdash;spent &pound;59 million on London light rail lines (including DLR, but excluding the tube).</p>
	<p pid="b.2884W.2/5">Assuming 45 per cent. of the costs for light rail in London were met by Departmental funding, the overall percentage for spend on light rail in 2004&ndash;05 would be 0.5 per cent.</p>
