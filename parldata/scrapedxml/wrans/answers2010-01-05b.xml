	<p pid="b.1W.3/1">This is a matter for the Members Estimate Committee; I am replying on behalf of the Committee. The Committee decided not to publish, as a matter of course, claims made under the additional costs allowance for 2004-05 by those hon. Members who left the House of Commons in May 2005. This was a pragmatic decision based on the difficulty of getting information to be published to the former Members for checking. The Committee has no plans to make it its policy to publish additional costs allowance claims for the period 2004-05 made by former hon. Members who are now prospective parliamentary candidates standing for re-election to the House. However, the House has responded to and will continue to respond to requests made under the FOI legislation for information about individual former hon. Members' claims.</p>

The Government Equalities Office (GEO) sponsors the annual Female FTSE Report, which benchmarks women's progress on the boards of FTSE 100 companies. The 2009 report found that women make up 12.2 per cent. of directors across FTSE 100 companies, but only 9.3 per cent. of directors across the five banks in the FTSE 100.</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.7/2">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is conducting a formal inquiry into the nature and causes of gender inequality and discrimination in the financial services sector. The EHRC is currently in the third stage of their inquiry, and is currently taking forward a series of round tables with the finance sector. In addition, the Treasury Select Committee will shortly report on their inquiry on women in the City. We will carefully consider the result of both inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.7/3">In giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, the Minister for Women and Equality set out our intention to create a strong partnership with business organisations, trade bodies and recruitment firms to encourage companies to commit to their own internal targets and actions to increase diversity in senior positions. GEO will be holding an event in the spring with business to agree a practical plan of action.</p>

	<p pid="b.16W.8/1">A case can only proceed to trial in the Crown court where the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has first decided that a defendant should be charged and which charges should be brought, by applying the two stage test of the Code for Crown Prosecutors: that the evidence supports a realistic prospect of conviction; and that it is in the public interest to proceed with a prosecution. Additionally, after a defendant is charged, each case is subject to a process of continuous review to ascertain that both the evidence and the public interest continue to weigh in favour of a prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.16W.8/2">However, while this process is intended to ensure, wherever possible, that weaker cases are identified and dropped before reaching trial, it is neither possible nor desirable that every prosecution should result in a conviction.

	<p pid="b.22W.2/1">Following a reduction in the University Officer Training Corps (UOTC) budget in October, cadet pay has been suspended until April 2010. This was one of a number of budgetary measures taken this year by the Army to enable resources to be better focused on the MOD's main effort in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.22W.2/2">A number of UOTC commanders have reported reduced attendance since the suspension of cadet pay. Attendance levels normally drop away at this time of year, as first year undergraduates decide which activities are for them. We will have a clearer picture of students' intentions once they have returned from their Christmas break. Our intention is to restore cadet pay in the next financial year and we hope that the majority of officer cadets will be able to ride out this temporary difficulty.</p>

Such information as is available, relating to initial procurement costs, is contained in the following table. The table excludes the costs of enhancements and modifications to aircraft originally procured before 1997.</p>

	<p pid="b.31W.2/10">Since 1997, MOD has also made payments for work performed by BAE Systems on the Typhoon aircraft. The Typhoon is procured by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), which manages the programme and funding arrangements on behalf of the four partner nations (UK, Germany, Italy and Spain). Payments for work on Typhoon are made to NETMA. Information on monies paid for work performed by BAE Systems therefore is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, total expenditure on the Typhoon acquisition programme since 1997 is &#163;9.3 billion.</p>

This will mean better and more efficient support to the front-line, and to soldiers and their families. Changes at 3 Star level have already been implemented in HQ Land Forces. The review will look at the detail below this level over the coming months. A key part of this will be the examination of the regional forces structures, centred on the Divisional Commands in Scotland, Aldershot, London and Shrewsbury, in the light of the new 3 Star responsibilities. It is too early to say when this work will conclude, what its outcome will be or what implications this may have for particular establishments or locations.</p>

Allowing the media to report the detail of family proceedings is being balanced by giving indefinite anonymity to the children and families involved. The legislation includes provisions to allow the courts to lift restrictions around the anonymity of children and families in specific circumstances, provided that it is safe to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.50W.2/1">The Government have stated their intention to realise &#163;16 billion in asset disposals over the period 2011-14 and will publish further details of opportunities to commercialise business assets in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.50W.2/2">The following table details the asset description and the book value of each asset that the Ministry of Justice has disposed of or plans to dispose of from 2009-10 to 2011-12. The expected revenue is detailed as an annual figure due to the commercial sensitivities attached to the expected revenue of each individual asset.</p>
	<p pid="b.50W.2/3">Plans for asset disposals in 2012-13 and 2013-14 have yet to be finalised and agreed, and are therefore not included in the list.</p>
	<p pid="b.50W.2/4">In March 2008, the Ministry of Justice published its asset management strategy, which will be pursued within the financial environment set by the Treasury. MOJ has developed a property asset management plan that will centralise, and significantly enhance, the management of the national and regional administrative estate, and has implemented its estates strategy to ensure the accommodation meets the business needs while providing best value for money.</p>

	<p pid="b.53W.2/2">The Ministry of Justice reports its sick absence on the basis of a 12-month rolling year. These figures are provided by the Ministry's payroll provider. To obtain this information on a monthly basis would require the Ministry to obtain separate reports from payroll which would incur disproportionate cost. We are unable to provide details of the cost of such absence for a similar reason, but I have asked officials for advice as to whether a reliable estimate of the cost of 12 months absence in aggregate could be provided and I will write in due course to the hon.

The Youth Justice Board received the first draft of the Final Intensive Fostering Evaluation report in December 2008, with a further chapter on costs submitted at the end of January 2009. Following comments from the Youth Justice Board a revised version was received from researchers in April and sent out to peer review in June 2009. Researchers considered comments from peer review, and submitted revised text in October; further comments and questions are currently being considered and resolved. The final evaluation report is expected to be published in the first quarter of 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.69W.2/1">Regional development agencies (RDAs) are financed through a single budget, a fund which pools money from all the contributing Government Departments. From this single pot, RDAs provided over &#163;11 million support for the businesses affected in their regions, as part of the wider &#163;136 million that Government made available to assist the affected regions and help those in greatest need. This includes funding for schools, transport and businesses. No specific funding was given to RDAs in respect of the 2007 floods.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/2">Spending on flood risk management across central and local government have increased from &#163;307 million in 1996-97 to over &#163;655 million in 2008-09, and is due to reach &#163;715 million in 2009-10 and &#163;780 million in 2010-11. This will bring the total spent by DEFRA, the Environment Agency and local authorities over three years to &#163;2.15 billion. &#163;20 million of the original &#163;800 million for 2010-11 was brought forward into this year's budgets as part of the fiscal stimulation package announced in the 2008 pre-Budget report.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/3">Since the 2007 floods, DEFRA has given funding to a considerable number of bodies to plan for and reduce the risk of flooding and its impacts and ensure that communities and the essential services which supply them are protected. The sums outlined as follows represent the most significant of these funding allocations.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/4">The majority of the funding is through the Environment Agency which allocates funding to regional flood defence committees for both new capital schemes and to maintain existing defences on the basis of national priorities to ensure that the funding is spent in the best way possible. Delivery is managed through the Environment Agency's regional offices.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/5">The allocation to Environment Agency regions was &#163;495.3 million in 2008-09 and &#163;548.6 million in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/6">In April 2006 the Environment Agency took on responsibility for the administration of capital grants payable to local authorities and internal drainage boards under delegation from DEFRA for all schemes promoted under the Land Drainage Act and for schemes under the Coast Protection Act from April 2008. In 2008-09 and 2009-10 &#163;64 million was allocated in each year for projects delivered by these bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/7">&#163;1 million has been made available to the Environment Agency to manage the intake of local authority trainees in September 2009 and to finance the trainees on the two-year Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Risk Engineering Foundation Degree. A further &#163;175,000 has been made available to fund an intake of local authority trainees in September 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/8">As noted in annex A of the Progress Report (published <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December 2009</phrase>) on the Government's Response to Sir Michael Pitt's Review of the summer 2007 floods, &#163;34.5 million is being allocated by DEFRA to delivery organisations to help cover the additional costs of taking forward the recommendations they are responsible for.</p>
	<p pid="b.69W.2/9">The following table shows how much has been allocated to date. It shows that a total of &#163;20.2 million has been allocated to individual agencies and bodies by DEFRA so far.</p>

To reduce the burden on the industry some companies with sites in different parts of the UK provide information on their total UK production. Also, particularly for livestock and livestock products, where something is produced does not necessarily reflect its origin. For example sheep slaughtered in England may be raised in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.85W.5/1">I am well aware of the importance of the Nephrops fishery in the Irish Sea to UK fishermen. I visited Portavogie earlier in the year, to see this at first hand and have since received a significant number of representations both from the relevant sections of the fishing industry and hon. Members either with constituency or policy interest. The Commission had originally proposed a 30 per cent. cut in the total allowable catch (TAC) for the stock and although it was not possible to argue away the cut altogether, working closely with Michelle Gildemew (Minister for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) and deploying more up-to-date science, we succeeded in limiting the reduction to 9 per cent. In the circumstances this was a very credible result. In the meantime, we will also be exploring the potential for supplementing the UK's quota with international swaps from other member states. However, for the future, it will be important to balance the short-term interests of the fishermen, with the longer term sustainable management of the stock.</p>

	<p pid="b.86W.2/1">The &quot;Electronic Duty of Care&quot; is a pilot project which is part of The Waste Crime Innovation Programme funded by DEFRA and managed by the Environment Agency. The project is supported by an industry-led advisory team.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.2/2">Work started in May 2009, with six waste companies volunteering to take part across South East England, and is planned to be extended in the new year. The pilot aims to test the effectiveness of waste tracking technologies and should deliver business benefits to waste companies, including substantially reducing regulatory compliance costs. With more accurate and timely data, business should be able to invest with greater confidence in infrastructure to recover and re-use wasted raw materials.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.2/3">The Environment Agency has recently sought funding through the European Union LIFE+ Programme to develop a national system from January 2011. This would support the rollout of a nationally integrated system for the electronic capture of waste transfer data. This will potentially displace a large proportion of the current paper-based system and considerably reduce the administrative burden to business, industry and Government. If successful we will use an open tender process to develop and maintain the waste monitoring database.</p>

	<p pid="b.87W.10/2">The operational efficiency programme final report was the product of work led by five advisers: Dr. Martin Read, Mr. Martin Jay, Mr. Gerry Grimstone, Lord Carter of Coles and Sir Michael Bichard. They worked without pay, but their expenses were recoverable. They were supported by a team based from HM Treasury. At its peak this team numbered 12. Given the cross-cutting nature of the review and the number of organisations involved, HM Treasury does not centrally hold figures showing the total cost, number of meetings or number of video-conferences held.</p>

	<p pid="b.88W.2/2">The recent White Paper &quot;Putting the Frontline First: Smarter Government&quot; pledged to reduce the number of arm's length bodies by over 120. The bodies that are affected, subject to the necessary legislation and consultation required, are as follows:</p>

The available data do not record what happened to vehicles whose registration mark was the subject of a cherished transfer. Some such vehicles would have been taken off the road, but others would have received a new registration mark and been relicensed.

	<p pid="b.114W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-30">30 November 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.114W.2/2">Equality 2025 is an advisory non-departmental public body established in response to a recommendation in the 2005 report by the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit &quot;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&quot;. It is sponsored by (but is not part of) the Office for Disability Issues, part of the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.2/3">I meet with the chair and deputy chair of Equality 2025 which meet on a quarterly basis; the most recent meeting took place on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November</phrase>. In addition, the chair and some members of Equality 2025 recently accompanied me to a number of events around the country. I also attended, and spoke at, Equality 2025's Annual Public Meeting in October 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.2/4">Meetings take place between Equality 2025 members and officials within the Office for Disability Issues and the Department for Work and Pensions on a range of matters, such as the UN Convention on Disability Rights, the Independent Living Strategy, the Hate Crime Strategy, the Equality Bill, and communication strategies. Equality 2025 members are also members of the ad hoc advisory groups supporting the Independent Living Strategy and Right to Control project.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.2/5">As a cross-government group, Equality 2025 also meets with Ministers and officials beyond DWP. The chair has a standing invitation to the Life Chances ministerial group which I chair and is attended by Ministers from each 'Life Chances' department. The group meets quarterly. Equality 2025 members also have bi-lateral discussions with officials across Government in support of the Equality 2025 Workplan and in response to requests for advice from Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.2/6">More formally, the Minister for Disability issues and I have recently been reviewing the work of Equality 2025 and its achievements over the last three years. With the agreement of Equality 2025, we are now taking the opportunity to further develop its strategic role as an 'expert group' and to streamline its size. Instead of running regional engagement events to find out disabled people's views, the group will build strong links with key disability organisations, umbrella groups and others across the United Kingdom. This will enable them to acquire a more representative picture of disabled people's views.</p>

	<p pid="b.115W.6/1">The quality of Future Jobs Fund bids is assessed in four stages: initially against minimum criteria, followed by a regional assessment against six qualitative criteria. The scores are then moderated by a panel including a trade union representative, before being agreed by the Regional Minister (or Secretary of State in Scotland and Wales). Finally, each bid's score is quality-checked by the central team, who moderate the scores across regions to a set of recommendations. A Central Assessment Panel consisting of officials from the Department for Work and Pensions (Project team, Finance and Commercial), Jobcentre Plus, HM Treasury, the Department of Communities and Local Government, Wales Office and Scotland Office then review the bids and make their recommendations to departmental Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="b.123W.5/1">It is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Definitions of low income households are set out in the annual National Statistics publication 'Households Below Average Income'. This reports numbers of individuals in households below or persistently below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median household income both before and after deducting housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.5/2">The public service agreement (PSA) 17, 'Tackle poverty and promote greater independence and wellbeing in later life', sets out indicators of pensioner poverty for which the Department for Work and Pensions is responsible alongside a range of other non-poverty indicators which are shared between the Department for Work and Pensions and other Government Departments. As no single measure captures all aspects of poverty, the PSA includes a range of indicators related to low income for pensioners. These are relative low income (below 50 and 60 per cent. contemporary median household income), and absolute low income (below 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices). Further information is given in the Government's PSA Delivery Agreement 17, which is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.5/3">The joint PSA 9 between the Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Children, Schools and Families to halve the number of children in poverty by 2010-11, on the way to eradicating child poverty by 2020, sets out indicators of child poverty. These are relative low income (below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income), absolute low income (below 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices), and combined low income and material deprivation (based on below 70 per cent. of contemporary median household income). The Child Poverty Bill includes targets on these three measures and, in addition, a target will also be set using a persistent poverty measure (below 60 per cent. of median income in three or four out of the last four years). The indicators of child poverty reflect the fact that income is a key aspect of child poverty. The combined low income and material deprivation indicator provides a wider measure of families' living standards. The latest version of the Child Poverty Bill (<phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December 2009</phrase>) is available from the Public Bill Office. Further information is given in the conclusions document of the Department's 'Measuring Child Poverty' consultation, which is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.125W.5/1">Pensioners receiving no more than the basic state pension have been defined as those individual pensioners whose total individual income was below the basic state pension threshold for each relevant year.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.5/2">The information that is available is shown in the following table. Figures are presented in 2007-08 prices in order to allow comparison over time. The information has been derived from the Family Resources survey and is presented as a three year average to help take account of small sample sizes that exist for subsets of the population.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.5/3">For context, the basic state pension threshold in 2007-08 was &#163;87.30.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.5/4">It should be noted that the data is based on individual incomes. As shown in Table 1 above, just 4 per cent. of the individuals' income in this group in 2005-08 provided the total household income. That is, 96 per cent. of this group live in households with other income earning adults and therefore their overall household income is likely to be much higher. The vast majority of this second group are female.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.5/5">When considering income, household income is most commonly used. This is because the living standards of an individual depend not only on his or her own income, but also on the income of others in the household. Consequently, considering an individuals income is often not indicative of that individuals overall living standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.5/6">The figures in Table 1 should therefore be used to signify the change in this income level, rather than as an indicator of the average level of income that an individual has to live on and consequently a gauge of living standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.132W.2/1">The Home Office has collected data on knife and sharp instrument offences since April 2007 via a special additional data collection. Data are therefore only available for two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/2">In 2007-08, the data collection covered the following offences: attempted murder, GBH and robbery. In 2008-09, the collection was expanded to include threats to kill, ABH, rape and sexual assaults. There were also changes in how both GBH with and without intent was recorded by forces following clarification of counting rules. Therefore, the figures between the two years are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/3">There is a further reason why the figures are not fully comparable. Some forces in 2007-08 included, for technical reasons, a number of 'unbroken' bottle offences, which is outside the defined scope of the collection. For 2008-09, the majority of forces within England could supply data excluding unbroken bottles, with four Home Office forces still unable to remove them from their returns.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/4">The data for each police force in both England and Wales are published in 'Crime in England and Wales 2008-09' at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="b.132W.2/6">Data for 2007-08 are shown in Table 7.11 and data for 2008-09 are shown in Table 7.12.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.2/7">These figures do not include homicide, as these are collected from the separate Homicide Index. The 1998-99 to 2007-08 homicide data for each police force in England are shown in Table A.</p>

	<p pid="b.134W.2/1">Cambridgeshire is divided into three basic command units (BCUs): central, northern and southern. These were set up in 2000-01, so data at this level are not available prior to this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/2">There was a major change in police recorded crime recording practices in April 2002 that means that figures from 2002-03 are not comparable with figures prior to that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/3">The introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002 brought in a more victim-focused reporting system, where victim accounts had to be accepted unless there was credible evidence to the contrary. In its first year, this was estimated to have artificially increased recording of violence against the person by 23 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/4">From <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> there were also changes in offence classification which for the first time collected separate information on grievous bodily harm (GBH) without intent (rather than as part of a broader 'other wounding' category) and a clarification in the counting rules for grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent. This led to a step change in the levels of most serious violence for some police forces. This means figures for 2008-09 are not comparable with those for earlier years.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/5">Data for GBH offences for each BCU in Cambridgeshire are given in Table A (1999-2000 to 2001-02) and Table B (2002-03 to 2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/6">Data for actual bodily harm (ABH) offences for each BCU in Cambridgeshire are given in Table C (1999-2000 to 2001-02) and Table D (2002-03 to 2008-09).</p>

This could be due to a number of reasons such as a faulty passport reader, a manufacturing fault in the passport chip or because damage has been caused by the holder to the biometric chip. If a customer encounters difficulties at UK immigration, the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) can have the passport checked by the manufacturer. However, if a customer has travel requirements while the passport is being checked, IPS will issue a replacement passport, free of charge, upon production of proof of travel. This is a change to previous IPS policy, which required customers to pay for a replacement passport if they needed to travel while the passport was being tested.</p>

There is no prescribed methodology. The valuation approach adopted is a matter of professional judgement for the valuer using his/her experience and skills (having regard to relevant case law), knowledge of potential purchasers and how the latter would approach the valuation of the subject property.</p>

The Government have set out a credible plan for delivering a sustainable consolidation in the public finances over the medium-term, including the requirement set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Bill that public sector net borrowing is reduced to 5.5 per cent. of GDP or less by 2013-14. The average 10-year yield on government bonds for the current decade (to 9<sup>( )</sup>December 2009) is significantly below the average in any of the previous three decades.</p>

This is intended to provide a reasonable contribution towards customers' mortgage interest liabilities in order to protect against repossession.

Last year we announced a temporary reduction in the waiting period from 39 weeks to 13 weeks, to provide additional support during the downturn. At the same time, we introduced a two-year time limit to Support for Mortgage Interest payments for customers claiming jobseeker's allowance. There is also a four week run-on for customers who have been in receipt of IS, ESA or JSA for at least 26 weeks to provide additional security when taking up a new job or entering work.</p>

	<p pid="b.199W.2/1">The UK abstained on the UN General Assembly resolution seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. We strongly support the Court, but believe that Serbia's primary motivation for the question was political and that the resolution was pushed through with insufficient debate on its substance.</p>
	<p pid="b.199W.2/2">The UK has participated actively in the Court's proceedings, making two written submissions and an oral statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.199W.2/3">The UK explained to the Court that the declaration of independence was not incompatible with either general international law or UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244. UNSCR 1244 set a framework for status negotiations; it did not predestine any particular outcome. The negotiating process was pursued with commitment by many, including the international community. However, these exhaustive attempts to achieve an agreed resolution ultimately failed. This led the UN Special Envoy for the Future Status Process for Kosovo to conclude that independence was the only viable solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.199W.2/4">A number of very particular factual circumstances, including the violent break-up of Yugoslavia, serious human rights abuses against Kosovo Albanians by Serbia, and the sustained involvement of the international community in the attempt to achieve a resolution make Kosovo a sui generis case which creates no wider precedent for developments elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.199W.2/5">To date, 64 countries have recognised Kosovo and it is now a member of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The clock cannot be turned back on Kosovo's independence-it is a reality.</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.2/1">The UK is very concerned about the human rights situation in North Korea. For action at UN level, our priority is for North Korea engagement in the Universal Periodical Review process underway and for them to acknowledge the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur, and allow him access to the country. We actively supported the renewal of his mandate at the last Human Rights Council in April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.2/2">We believe that the Universal Periodic Review and the Special Rapporteur mechanism remain the most effective way to seek to engage North Korea on their human rights records, rather than a commission of inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.5/1">We are not aware of any plans for the EU to adopt a new Common Position on North Korea. However, tackling North Korea's serious human rights abuses remain a top priority, as reflected in the EU East Asia Policy Guidelines which were agreed in 2005. The EU co-sponsors the human rights resolutions on North Korea at the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly. The EU also looks for every appropriate opportunity to engage North Korea practically on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.5/2">Most recently the EU Troika raised their concerns during their visit to Pyongyang in October. The EU continues to work for reinstatement of the Human Rights Dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, suspended by the North Korean side in 2003.</p>

Our embassy in Pyongyang also tries to engage practically where it can and this year provided assistance to a nursery, a hospital and an association for the disabled.</p>

As part of that review, the UK requested further information on a range of issues, including freedom of expression, religious freedoms and the death penalty.

Research in the late 1980s reported 4,332 registered greens in England, and further research in 2005 suggested an increase of about 115 in the number of registered greens between 1993 and 2005.

	<p pid="b.221W.2/1">CLG's New Dimension project (formerly a programme) was established in 2001 to enhance the capability of the Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) to respond to major incidents whether caused by terrorist attacks or natural disasters. The estimated budget for the project at that initial stage was &#163;318 million to procure, deliver and implement these new resilience capabilities within the FRS. This did not include ongoing resource costs to the FRS to support the continuing delivery of these capabilities which have already responded to several national events such as the Buncefield oil depot fire in 2005, the widespread 2007 floods and more recently the Cumbrian floods, as well as being mobilised around 200 times each quarter to local events.</p>
	<p pid="b.221W.2/2">At the end of financial year 2008-09, the Department had invested a total of &#163;425 million in the New Dimension project, although owing to a difference in view over the accounting used, the National Audit Office estimated costs as some &#163;30 million lower, in its value for money review in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.221W.2/3">The overall &#163;425 million cost includes an amount of continuation funding for FRSs including crewing costs which over recent years has amounted to around &#163;14-&#163;15 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.221W.2/4">In 2008, Ministers announced a funding package totalling &#163;80million over the current spending review period to enable the ongoing delivery of New Dimension capabilities by the FRS. The total New Dimension costs up until 2008-09 includes nearly &#163;24 million of this amount, with a further &#163;56 million allocated until the end of 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="b.226W.3/1">None, since it is not possible to say how much grant has been provided to each authority for concessionary travel.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.3/2">Government funding for concessionary travel currently comes from two sources: formula grant and special grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.3/3">Formula grant, which comprises revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and principal formula police grant where appropriate, is largely distributed using the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the authority, together with the number of band D equivalent properties within the authority's area. We apply the same formula to all authorities that provide the same services and we also use the best data that are available on a consistent basis across all authorities. We then ensure that every authority receives at least a minimum percentage increase year-on-year (the 'floor') on a like-for-like basis i.e. after adjusting for changes in funding and function. In order to pay for the cost of the floor, we scale back the increase above the floor for all other authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.3/4">Within formula grant, there is no specific formula for concessionary fares. It is an unhypothecated block grant i.e. authorities are free to spend the money on any service, provided they meet their statutory duties. For this reason, and due to the method of calculating formula grant, particularly floor damping, it is not possible to say how much grant has been provided for any particular service.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.3/5">From 2008-09, following the change to national free travel for concessionaires, concessionary travel authorities additionally receive a share of the &#163;212 million concessionary fares special grant from the Department for Transport.</p>

	<p pid="b.230W.5/1">Local authorities reported there were 392,000 businesses in England in receipt of small business rate relief (SBRR) as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-31">31 December 2006</phrase>, the only year for which this information is currently available. A recent estimate of the take-up of small business rate relief based on this information is available on the CLG website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.230W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/smallbusinessmethod">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/smallbusinessmethod</a></p>
	<p pid="b.230W.5/3">We estimate that around 575,000 small businesses are eligible for SBRR and that 68 per cent. of these (392,000) were claiming SBRR on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-31">31 December 2006</phrase>. We further estimate that about 92 per cent. of the total relief that would be granted if all 575,000 businesses claimed it was actually paid out in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.230W.5/4">Information on the number of businesses expected to claim small business rate relief in 2009-10 and 2010-11 is not currently available. Data on the rateable value of businesses claiming small business rate relief are not collected by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.230W.5/5">Relief granted to small businesses has been increasing since SBRR was introduced-from &#163;202 million in 2005-06 to &#163;298 million in 2008-09. This represents a real terms increase of 34 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.230W.5/6">We agree that it is important to make it as easy as possible for eligible small businesses to access the relief. We took action in 2008 to remove the requirement for claimants to re-apply each year, so that a small business only has to apply once in each revaluation period. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-18">18 September 2009</phrase> we announced that we would remove the requirement to re-apply for SBRR at revaluation in 2010, a move which has been welcomed by the FSB. The legislation to remove the requirement is contained in the Non-Domestic Rating (Small Business Rate Relief) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2009 which was laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.230W.5/7">We understand concerns to ensure that every eligible small business receives the relief by making it wholly automatic, with no requirement to fill in an application form. Unfortunately neither we nor local authorities hold the necessary data to determine which ratepayers are eligible. Automating SBRR would require us to change the eligibility criteria-meaning that large chains could benefit, and that the supplement paid by other businesses to fund the relief would increase.</p>

	<p pid="b.234W.2/9">Our reforms to empty property relief are principled and right for the long-term. They provide a strong incentive on owners to bring empty property back into use, helping to improve access to premises for businesses and so to exert a downward pressure on commercial rents.</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.2/10">However, we provided owners with real help to manage short-term pressures in a difficult property market by exempting all empty properties with rateable values up to &#163;15,000 from business rates in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.2/11">We have listened to the continued concerns of owners and are extending the temporary measure for a further 12 months-to cover the whole of 2010-11-and we are uprating the threshold to &#163;18,000 in line with the general movement of property values at revaluation.</p>

	<p pid="b.238W.2/62">The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and no more by ensuring the share of the national rates bill paid by any one business reflects changes over time in the value of their property relative to others. The 2010 revaluation will not raise a single extra penny for Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.2/63">Ratepayers occupying over a million properties-60 per cent. of total properties-will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation. The Government's &#163;2 billion transitional relief scheme will limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, ensuring that in 2010-11 no small property will see an increase of more than 3.5 per cent. as a result of revaluation, with increases capped at 11 per cent. for larger properties. This is on top of the wider support available as part of Real Help Now to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

We are doing this through, for example, the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) Scheme which has been extended by 12 months. In the West Midlands, as of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December</phrase>, lenders have logged 681 eligible cases with a value of &#163;68.49 million, of which, 643 EFG loans have been offered amounting to &#163;64.41 million. So far 538 EFG loans have been drawn down with a value of &#163;52.48 million. We also announced the extension of empty property relief for a further year, estimated to cover 76 per cent. of empty properties in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.8/4">We are also taking action to ensure the foundations for growth are in place as we emerge from the economic downturn. As a result of Government bringing forward capital expenditure, Advantage West Midlands (AWM) has been able to invest &#163;11.2 million to allow early commencement of work to redevelop Birmingham New Street Station, creating up to 400 new jobs and &#163;1.8 million to accelerate the redevelopment of the former MG Rover site at Longbridge Birmingham, enabling an early start to the relocation of Bourneville college, securing 250 construction jobs. Furthermore, 9 per cent. of orders under the vehicle scrappage scheme have been placed in the West Midlands, which is broadly in line with car ownership in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.8/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-10">10 November</phrase> we launched Partnerships for Growth: A national framework for regional and local economic development. The objectives of which include raising the rate of sustainable economic growth, increasing employment and increasing the economic performance of all English regions. AWM is already contributing to this agenda through, for example, delivering over 12,805 Business Link Health Checks by the end of November 2009 and jointly investing &#163;40 million with EMDA in the &#163;130 million world-class Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC)-a world-class research organisation to support companies and their supply chains in improving their manufacturing competitiveness. It is also providing investment in low carbon technology through its &#163;2.4 million support for the Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator project and its &#163;19 million support for the Low Carbon Vehicle Technology Programme, to accelerate the introduction of the next generation ultra low vehicle carbon vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.8/6">AWM provides a range of other measures to help business. It has, for example, between April and September 2009, made grants totalling &#163;736,000 to 15 companies for research and development and grants totalling &#163;3.8 million to 46 companies for business investment. Through its Advantage Transition Fund, which ended in November 2009, it has made loans of more than &#163;10 million. Arrangements are now being put in place for a successor fund, as part of a &#163;44.8 million business support fund which includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.8/7" class="indent">An Early Stage Equity fund of &#163;8 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.8/8" class="indent">A Growth Equity fund of &#163;9.2 million, matched by the same amount from the private sector, and;</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.8/9" class="indent">A Mezzanine fund of &#163;9.2 million, also matched by the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.8/10">Last year AWM was involved in a record number of inward investment success such as the expansion of Deutsche Bank, which now employs 500 people in the region. This year it has been involved in a further 21 projects creating 645 jobs, with others in the pipeline, which it is hoped will lead to over 900 further jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.8/11">UKTI in the West Midlands is supporting companies in a variety of ways to grow their businesses internationally. It has supported over 540 companies so far this year to increase their exports through a variety of supported programmes including Passport to Export, a scheme for novice exporters to help them to export strategically and Gateway to Global Growth, for companies with two to 10 years exporting experience. Using additional funding provided by Advantage West Midlands, UKTI has so far assisted 330 companies to increase exports, which has lead to 45 jobs being created and 91 jobs safeguarded.</p>

	<p pid="b.247W.6/1">I will answer this question as responsibility for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) falls to my Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.247W.6/2">On the first part of the question, the UK has not made any applications to the EGF. All current member state applications and their status can be viewed on the European Commission's EGF website at</p>
	<p pid="b.247W.6/3" class="indent"><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main">http://ec.europa.eu/social/main</a>.jsp?catId=582&amp;langId=en.</p>
	<p pid="b.247W.6/4">As part of the Government's response to the economic downturn, we have used the European Social Fund to the same effect as the EGF, investing in a combination of services that have proved to be effective in helping workers and areas affected by restructuring. The EGF can not duplicate use of other European funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.247W.6/5">On the second part, approved applications to the Fund have to date been financed from in-year transfers from areas of expected low implementation within the EU Budget, at no immediate impact to member states contributions. Unspent funds in one year, however, are used to finance the following year, thus reducing the amount of funding required from member states in that year. The UK's share of financing applications approved so far in 2009 is abateable, and the net cost to the UK over the 2009 and 2010 period of these applications would be around &#163;2.05 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.247W.6/6">As to the benefits, the Government will look positively at a specific case where it can be shown that the EGF would add value to national, regional or local measures and initiatives. In particular, it is important to marshal all resources available to help those struggling to find work so that they can move into jobs in growth sectors and be a part of the economic recovery.</p>

	<p pid="b.255W.8/1">There are two main reasons given by the Government of Israel for preventing entry of reconstruction materials into Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="b.255W.8/2">Firstly, Israel has expressed concerns that materials such as steel pipes or cement could be misused or misappropriated by Hamas and other organisations in Gaza to build weapons or defensive structures. We recognise that Israel has legitimate security concerns and that there is a risk some items could have a dual use. However, we believe with robust monitoring it is possible to address these concerns. The United Nations and other agencies have had extensive discussions with the Government of Israel over practical safeguards against diversion or misuse. Moreover, many items required to repair damaged homes and other infrastructure are not dual-use-such as plastic piping and glass. We have not received specific explanations from Israel of why the import of such items has been blocked or delayed.</p>
	<p pid="b.255W.8/3">Secondly, Israeli Ministers have noted that the continuing detention of Gilad Shalit and Hamas's refusal to renounce violence creates a wider political context for restrictions on movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza. The UK Government continue to call for the immediate, unconditional release of Gilad Shalit and for Hamas to renounce violence and recognise Israel's right to exist in peace and security. We do not accept, however, that access for humanitarian aid and aid workers should be linked to such considerations, nor that the import of materials needed to rebuild houses, schools, medical facilities and other critical infrastructure should be contingent on Hamas's actions.</p>

	<p pid="b.256W.2/1">With the onset of winter, the reconstruction or repair to houses of an estimated 60,000 families in Gaza has been identified by the United Nations as a humanitarian priority. However, the continuing restrictions imposed by the Government of Israel on access for construction materials (including cement, steel reinforcement bars, and glass) have effectively put these reconstruction efforts on hold. The UK Government continue to lobby the Government of Israel for the unrestricted import of these, and other, materials.</p>

If disability benefits for older people are reformed as part of the National Care Service, those receiving the affected benefits at the time of reform would continue to receive the same level of cash support.

Some people will choose to take their budget as cash, and pay for everything directly themselves. Others will prefer to let someone else manage the funding on their behalf-either someone from the local authority or a family member or friend.

	<p pid="b.266W.5/2">However, we said in our Green Paper &quot;Shaping the Future of Care and Support Together&quot; that we think we should create a new and better care and support system, looking at how we can make the best use of public money to provide a joined-up, consistent and fair care and support system. This would enable the greatest public support to go to those who will benefit from it most, both people who have developed low levels of need and people with high levels of need, and would ensure a fair and consistent allocation of resources. We want to make sure that people with low to moderate needs continue to get the support they need to live independently, building on the role that disability benefits play and considering how this might be best achieved in a new care and support system.</p>

	<p pid="b.269W.0/1">The information held by the Department is shown in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="b.269W.0/2">National health service organisations are responsible for the provision and maintenance of facilities to support the delivery of high quality clinical services. Therefore, the NHS will locally prioritise investment to reduce backlog maintenance based on risk assessment, reconfiguration planning and available resources. The majority of backlog maintenance relates to low priority work, which trusts will undertake through maintenance programmes. Where higher risks are present, work will be undertaken as a priority. While levels of backlog maintenance vary across the NHS, it is estimated that around 75 per cent. of the total costs to eradicate backlog maintenance are concentrated in 20 per cent. of organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.269W.0/3">The Department collects data on backlog maintenance and risk adjusted backlog maintenance annually from NHS trusts through its Estates Returns Information Collection (ERIC). The data provided are not amended centrally and the responsibility for its accuracy lies with the contributing NHS organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.269W.0/4">The collection of data on risk-adjusted backlog maintenance was first introduced in 2004-05 and therefore information prior to that reporting year is not available centrally. The 28 strategic health authorities were created in 2002-03 and re-organised in 2006-07 into 10.</p>

	<p pid="b.271W.2/1">The national health service locally and regionally is best placed to identify savings based on their circumstances and priorities. However, NHS staff have told us that they need support to make these changes. Drawing on the available evidence and on the ideas and experience of frontline staff, we will back major programmes of work to support commissioners and providers. These programmes will be locally led, but will have national support, and will ensure that innovation is spread rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/2">As part of these programmes, we are exploring a number of areas under the HM Treasury-led Public Value Programme, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/3" class="indent">commissioning;</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/4" class="indent">tariff;</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/5" class="indent">estates;</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/6" class="indent">long term conditions; and</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/7" class="indent">community services.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/8">We are also working actively with our arms length bodies, NHS organisations and others including HM Treasury and the Shareholder Executive to implement the recommendations of the Operational Efficiency Programme. Rather than initiating new projects, in many areas this builds upon significant progress made by the Department and the NHS in recent years. For example, the establishment of NHS Shared Business Services, which is now delivering shared back office services for over 100 NHS organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.272W.8/1">BT took over responsibility for the Cerner Millennium system at eight sites in the southern programme for information technology (IT) area, which were previously covered by a contract with Fujitsu Services Ltd, in July 2009. BT has been contracted to upgrade six of the trusts to an enhanced version of Cerner Millennium. BT first needs to transfer these systems from Fujitsu's data centre to its own, and is on schedule to complete this work before the end of March 2010. Timing of completion of the upgrades will depend on the outcome of ongoing discussion between the national health service locally and the company. Discussions are continuing with BT with regard to implementing Cerner Millennium at some further sites in the southern programme for IT area.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.8/2">The increase in the total lifetime value of the BT local service provider contract consequent on transfer to the company of elements of work in the southern programme area previously covered under contract with Fujitsu, assuming all the requirements are successfully delivered, is &#163;546 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.277W.2/1">It is very important not to conflate the funding for a national care service with the funding for the Government's Personal Care at Home Bill. The Bill is about putting more money into the system as soon as possible to help people with the highest needs live independently at home. The Green Paper is about building a sustainable system for the future. We have been consulting widely on how to best do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.277W.2/2">All the proposals outlined in the Bill are funded through efficiencies and reprioritisations in the Department of Health and in Local Government. The Bill will protect those who currently receive personal care services for free from changes in the future. It will also help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence. This intensive help, or &quot;re-ablement&quot;, will help people to regain their independence and prevent ill health. This means people will maintain their dignity and rebuild their confidence so that they can live at home for longer. As well as providing a free personal care service to thousands of people, the Bill will also benefit their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.277W.2/3">There are still huge challenges in the care and support system and the Green Paper sought people's views on how we resolve those challenges and create a sustainable system for the long term. But we cannot stand still in meeting the challenge of rising costs now. The Bill will help support those who are currently most in need of personal care in their own homes.</p>

The Government is shortly to publish a Full Government Response to the Review, aimed at providers and commissioners of services, which describes how professionals can work effectively together so that everyone in the wider children's workforce knows exactly where to turn when a child has emotional wellbeing or mental health needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.0/3">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is currently developing a clinical guideline on the recognition, referral and diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD).</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.0/4">The children's service mapping exercise in England in 2007-08 found that the number of children and young people supported with ASD had increased from 7,719 in 2006 (7 per cent. of caseload) to 10,231 in 2007 (9 per cent.). 685 CAMHS teams supported ASD children and young people and their families. Of these 108 CAMHS teams reported providing targeted work for children and young people with ASD. Additionally, of the 349 community paediatric services, 193 (55 per cent.) ran ASD clinics.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.0/5">There are Tier 4 services which cater specifically for children with ASD. Examples include the Hawksmere Children's Unit (Autism Therapy and Education Centre) in Hertfordshire, which is specifically for boys from the age of 13-18 with ASD, and Cygnet Springside, based in the north west and south west of England.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.0/6">The training of staff is for determination at a local level. Staff dealing with patients with ASD would be expected to be trained to deal with such patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.0/7">Within PSA12 (to improve the health and wellbeing of children and young people) the Government are committed to improving the mental and emotional health and wellbeing of children and young people. Four proxy measures are being used to monitor progress: the development and delivery of CAMHS for children and young people with learning disabilities; appropriate accommodation and support for 16/17 year olds; availability of 24-hour cover to meet urgent mental health needs; and joint commissioning of early intervention support. Services for children and young people with ASD are included in three of these proxies and those who additionally have a learning disability are included in the learning disability proxy.</p>

The Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) engaged in discussions with over sixty stakeholders and held meetings in October 2008 and January 2009. Stakeholders included the Department for Health, Department for Children Schools and Families, General Social Care Council, General Medical Council, General Teaching Council and the Royal College of Nursing. Civil servants were not involved in the development of the Process or the Guidance as barring decisions are a matter for the ISA. They were included in the consultation process. The Process and Guidance was developed with the close involvement of the Board's legal adviser who is provided by the Treasury Solicitor.</p>

	<p pid="b.287W.2/1">These are matters for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-09">9 December 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary questions have been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/4" class="indent">The Common Assessment Framework is a standardised approach, used at local level, to conducting individual assessments of children's additional needs and deciding how these should be met. The new system for assessing local authority children's services is the Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA), which came into place from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>.1 have assumed your questions relate to the latter.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/5" class="indent">Under the arrangements for CAA, all local authority children's services have been assessed by Ofsted and received an annual rating for 2009. The ratings, based on a four-point scale, have been published in a letter for each of the 152 local authorities, which is available to view on the Ofsted website. This annual rating of children's services will also form part of the joint inspectorate CAA area and organisational assessments for each of the 152 local authorities, which have now been published on the 'oneplace' website.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/6" class="indent">Ofsted also introduced unannounced visits to front-line social care services for children and young people from <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-01">1 June 2009</phrase>. As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-07">7 December 2009</phrase>, 29 reports have been published and the list can be found in full in Table A at the end of this letter. By the end of June 2010 all local authority children's services will have been subject to such an inspection.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/7" class="indent">In addition, a three-year programme of full inspections of local authority services for safeguarding and looked after children began in June 2009. As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-07">7 December 2009</phrase>, nine local authorities have been inspected. The local authorities are listed in Table B at the end of this letter and the reports have been published on the Ofsted website. Local authorities are given no more than two weeks' notice of an inspection and it would therefore be inappropriate to list the authorities due for inspection in the next six months.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/8" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Rt Hon Dawn Primarolo MP, Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="b.294W.5/1">These are matters for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to my hon. Friend and copies of her replies have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-11">11 December 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary questions have been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/4" class="indent">Contracts to Ofsted's three regional Inspection Service Providers were awarded in March 2009, following evaluation of competitive bids.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/5" class="indent">The evaluation criteria took into account the potential contractor's:</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/6" class="indent">capacity to be a credible partner</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/7" class="indent">ability to deliver requirements</p>

	<p pid="b.294W.5/11" class="indent">acceptance of baseline documentation</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/12" class="indent">These criteria accounted for 60% of the overall evaluation score, and price/financial terms accounted for 40%. During the prequalification stage of the competitive tender, references about each of the bidders were sought to inform the evaluations and these references were refreshed as part of the evidence for the consideration of the final tenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/13" class="indent">Under the criterion Delivering Requirements, potential contractors were invited to show how, when recruiting and training inspectors and staff, they would deal with the skills and experiences needed for different remits and how they would ensure that the practitioners meet requirements in all remits.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/14" class="indent">On the basis of the evaluation Ofsted was content to award contracts as specified to CfBT Education Trust to cover the contract area for the North, Serco Education to cover the contract area for the Midlands and Tribal Group to cover the contract area for the South. These contracts are in place for the period from the start of the 2009/10 academic year up to the end of the academic year 2014/15.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/15" class="indent">Each contract is evaluated regularly to ensure that key performance indicators are being met. These evaluations are formally reviewed by senior managers in Ofsted and shared with the Inspection Service Provider.</p>

	<p pid="b.296W.6/55">The revenue per pupil figures shown in table 3 as follows are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 (in tables 1 and 2 above) because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.6/56">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.6/57">To provide a comparison for 2008-09 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06 (the baseline); as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.6/58">Per pupil revenue funding figures for pupils (ages three to 15) for England, the South West Region, and each local authority in the South West of England between 2005-06 and 2008-09 are shown in table 3. As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding, a split between primary and secondary schools is not available. These figures are in real terms and are based on financial years.</p>

	<p pid="b.305W.4/2" class="indent">&quot;that grandfathering existing stations at 1 ROC/MWh while banding up new stations would be detrimental to a competitive market for the fuel stock ... [as] existing plants could not have reasonably anticipated the introduction of banding, and made any contingency for this. We ... therefore decided to allow existing plants to be banded up and receive the same level of support as new plants. ...

	<p pid="b.307W.0/2">We have drawn on analysis in various independent reports to calculate the scale of finance needed to tackle climate change in developing countries. The most recent, by Project Catalyst (a philanthropically funded project to develop analysis for the UNFCCC), put the total at &#8364;65-100 billion per year on average from 2010 to 2020 (&#8364;55-80 billion mitigation; &#8364;10-20 billion adaptation). The figure that the Prime Minister announced in a speech on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-26">26 June 2009</phrase> of around $100 billion by 2020 is within this range. However, we also recognised that we must distinguish between research studies and the actual finance that countries might need for their low carbon and climate resilient growth and development. Therefore, we have proposed $100 billion a year by 2020 as a working figure for the world to focus on.</p>

	<p pid="b.309W.14/1">There are 4,542 generating stations accredited and provided with support under the RO as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-14">14 December 2009</phrase>. Over 90 per cent. of these stations are not vertically integrated with electricity suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.14/2">Some industry stakeholders have raised concerns that the cap on the co-firing ROC market restricts competition and disproportionately penalises independent co-firers who, they felt, were forced to participate in a partitioned marketplace, meaning they had to accept significant discounts in price for their ROCs.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.14/3">We commissioned Oxera to look into these concerns. Their report suggested that in the long run the cap is unlikely to significantly affect the ROC market for co-firing. There were some short-term concerns but following consultation we considered these were outweighed by the potential detrimental effect on the ROC value for all renewables technologies. The Oxera Report suggests that not having a co-firing cap could lead to a decrease in ROC values which could impact investment and delay deployment of new biomass stations.</p>

	<p pid="b.310W.2/1">DECC set out the future of its energy efficiency schemes in the Low Carbon Transition Plan published July 2009, this included extending the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) (an obligation on energy suppliers to meet household carbon saving targets) to the end of 2012 before moving to a new framework post 2012. A consultation on the CERT extension will be published before Christmas and further details on delivery arrangements post 2012 will be published early in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.310W.2/2">The CERT is a GB-wide carbon saving obligation on energy suppliers so it is delivered at no cost to DECC. Ofgem reported in July 2009 that suppliers had made good progress towards their targets having achieved the following percentage savings against their individual obligations (the overall target is 185 million tonnes of lifetime CO2 savings) by the end of the first year of CERT:</p>

	<p pid="b.310W.2/14">Reporting is by measure and not by household. Together, suppliers delivered a significant number of energy efficiency measures by the end of the first year of CERT including around 850,000 cavity wall insulation jobs, almost 1.5 million loft Insulation jobs, 40,000 solid wall insulation jobs and some 200 million compact fluorescent lights.</p>
	<p pid="b.310W.2/15">The Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP) only commenced in September 2009, no households have yet received assistance. CESP runs to December 2012 and it is estimated that 90,000 households will benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.310W.2/16">In the 2008 Budget the Chancellor announced an increase in suppliers' collective expenditure on their voluntary social programmes to at least &#163;100 million in 2008-09, &#163;125 million in 2009-10 rising to &#163;150 million by 2011. Energy supplier's social tariffs are delivered at no cost to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.310W.2/17">Ofgem monitors the suppliers' social programmes on behalf of Government. In its latest report on suppliers' social programmes, published in August 2009, Ofgem confirmed that suppliers have each met the first year spend target as set by Government and that suppliers' collective expenditure totalled &#163;157 million, which exceeded the Government set target for the first year of the agreement by 57 per cent. &#163;130 million of this collective total expenditure was attributable to social tariffs. This report also detailed the number of customer accounts benefiting from a social tariff and the total savings to customers of these tariffs, per supplier, as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.310W.2/58">The Low Carbon Transition Plan also included an announcement that we will introduce social price support when the voluntary agreement ends in March 2011. We have since introduced clauses on social price support as part of the Energy Bill. We also announced in the pre-Budget report that we would require energy suppliers to make &#163;300 million available per year by 2013-14 for social price support. This is double what they have agreed to provide in the final year of the voluntary agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.313W.2/4">The introduction of FITs should significantly increase the scale and scope of the GB market for small-scale renewable energy technologies and ancillary products compared to the status quo. UK manufacturing firms and product installers will benefit directly from this increase in demand. An increase in the uptake of certain technologies, such as small wind, where the UK has a manufacturing base, will create a particularly positive impact on job creation. Installations will also require maintenance and servicing which may have a positive impact on jobs. Overall, FITs are expected to boost business and employment opportunities in developing and deploying renewable energy technologies. These impacts have not been quantified.</p>

	<p pid="b.318W.2/1">The Department of Energy and Climate Change is responsible for national programmes aimed at reducing fuel poverty. The combination of Warm Front, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), Community Energy Savings Programme (CESP), Decent Homes and local programmes delivered through local government, partnerships, energy suppliers, eaga and NEA (such as Warm Zones and the Community Energy Efficiency Fund (CEEF)) are all important in tackling fuel poverty across regions of England.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.2/2">The Warm Front scheme is the Government's main scheme for tackling fuel poverty and up to <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-30">30 November 2009</phrase> has delivered energy efficiency measures to 8,414 households in Preston since the year 2000. Additionally, over 438 benefit entitlement checks have been undertaken, identifying an average increase in income of &#163;23.63 for those entitled to additional benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.2/3">The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) requires energy suppliers to meet at least 40 per cent. of their obligation by promoting and installing measures in the homes of a priority group of vulnerable consumers in receipt of qualifying benefits or people aged over 70 years. Measures are only reported at GB level and details at constituency level are not available. However, the Government are developing a voluntary agreement with suppliers for them to report CERT main measures into the Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED) maintained by the Energy Saving Trust; the Government hope to conclude negotiations shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.318W.5/1">The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) is the Government's principal instrument for encouraging households to install insulation. However, CERT is not a Government managed scheme, but rather a carbon saving obligation placed by Government on energy supply companies with more than 50,000 customers. Suppliers meet their targets by promoting (typically through subsidised offers) and installing a mix of approved energy efficiency measures, including insulation measures. Energy suppliers each have their own contracts with insulation companies which are treated as commercial in confidence. A small amount of insulation activity is directly funded through the Government's flagship fuel poverty programme-Warm Front. However, no contractors have been removed in the last five years.</p>

	<p pid="b.320W.11/1">The Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier is one of a number of analogues reviewed as part of the Hydraulics and Geomorphology assessment within the Strategic Environmental Assessment of tidal power from the Severn Estuary. In 2008, at the invitation of the Severn tidal power feasibility study team, Dutch officials gave a presentation on the construction and subsequent impacts of the storm surge barrier.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.11/2">In addition representatives from Deltares (an independent research institute for water, soil and subsurface issues based in The Netherlands) have attended a number of workshops on Hydraulics and Geomorphology as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment. They presented and led discussions on the geomorphological implications arising from the construction of the storm surge barrier. This evidence feeds into the Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study.</p>
