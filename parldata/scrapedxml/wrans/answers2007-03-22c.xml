	<p pid="c.1034W.5/1">Health care for service personnel is provided by Defence Medical Services. Treatment aims to assist injured service personnel to recover the best level of fitness and mobility possible. If medical discharge is appropriate, it will only be used as a last resort. Once they leave the armed forces, responsibility for their health care passes to the NHS and there are processes in place to assist the smooth transition from DMS to NHS treatment. If a veteran is also a war pensioner, he or she will be entitled to priority NHS treatment for the accepted condition(s); priority is decided by the clinician in charge and is subject to clinical need.</p>
	<p pid="c.1034W.5/2">Those who are medically discharged from the armed forces are entitled to the full resettlement programme (FRP) offered within the MOD's resettlement package, provided by the Career Transition Partnership (CTP), irrespective of their length of service<sup>(1)</sup>. The FRP includes briefings, workshops, individual counselling, coaching, CV preparation and analysis of transferable competences, job finding, and conversion and skills enhancement training. All discharged personnel remain on the CTP books for two years after discharge. Thereafter, the Regular Forces Employment Association (RFEA) and the Officers' Association (OA) offer ex-service personnel support for the rest of their working lives. The RFEA and OA are particularly concerned with job-finding activities, and are sub-contractors on the CTP contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.1034W.5/3">To help achieve the Department's aim of a successful return to civilian life for ex-service personnel, whether medically discharged or not, the CTP offers at its resettlement training centre (RTC) at Aldershot around 40 job-related courses. Many courses result in recognised qualifications while others can lead to employment with companies which have established close links with the RTC. Such training is not mandatory for service leavers. Service leavers who do not choose the RTC route may make use of the individual resettlement training costs (IRTC) grant, currently a maximum of &pound;534, for training courses not offered by the RTC but available in the wider training market.</p>
	<p pid="c.1034W.5/4" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The FRP is normally only available to those who have served at least five years with the armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.1038W.7/1">The convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES) controls and bird registration controls relate to different activities and species. Where the controls are duplicated, as is the case with many species of diurnal birds of prey, assessing their relative effectiveness in tracing and identifying the provenance of individual birds is very difficult.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.7/2">In general terms, bird registration achieves nothing in identifying the provenance of individual birds as there are no legal powers to assess the captive bred status under section 7 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It does however give powers to trace where individual birds are kept.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.7/3">CITES controls provide the powers needed to inquire into breeding status, but do not enable the tracing of individual birds, unless there is a specific conservation reason to do so and an element of commercial activity is involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.1038W.10/1">In England, the principal method used to assess wild bird population levels is the analysis of trends for the wild bird indicators compiled for the England biodiversity strategy (EBS) and the farmland bird public service agreement (PSA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.10/2">Indices for individual bird species are based on the annual field counts of breeding birds compiled by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). These individual indices are then compiled to show the average population trends with separate indicators compiled for farmland, woodland, wetland and sea birds. The EBS indicator compiles indices for 96 species, 19 of which are used in the farmland bird PSA indicator.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.10/3">The assessment for the EBS indicator is based on the percentage change in the combined index since 2000 (and is currently assessed as stable). The assessment for the PSA indicator is based on the annual rate of change in the long-term trend&mdash;to which is applied a statistical technique that removes short-term peaks and troughs due to weather or gaps in the data. The farmland birds target will be met when the annual percentage change in the 'smoothed' long-term trend is positive. As with the EBS indicator, the trend was assessed as stable in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.10/4">Further information on the methodology and criteria used in the assessment for farmland bird PSA targets can be found in the following report: &quot;Freeman, S.F., Baillie, S.R. and Gregory, R.D. 2001.

If international aviation CO2 emissions are included, aviation contributed around 6.4 per cent. of total UK CO2 emissions in 2005. The proportion in 2030 and 2050 would be around 15 and 21 per cent. of UK CO2 emissions (including international aviation) respectively. These are based on the assumptions of continued strong growth in aviation using central projections in 'Aviation and Global Warming' (2004), and the assumption of attainment of the 60 per cent. CO2 emissions reduction target in the rest of the economy as outlined in the 2003 Energy White Paper.</p>

The information on the form includes details of the producer of the waste and the broker or dealer involved in the shipment, when these are involved. This information is passed on to the facility receiving the waste when the waste is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="c.1043W.2/3">The UK has raised with the European Commission the issue of the potential commercial confidentiality of some of the information on the form. The Commission is currently working to establish whether it is possible, while ensuring compliance with the legal requirements of the revised EC Waste Shipments Regulation (WSR), for any of the information that should accompany shipments of 'Green List' waste to be withheld or partially withheld.</p>
	<p pid="c.1043W.2/4">My officials are in contact with representatives of the metal recycling companies in the UK about this issue and will keep them informed of developments.</p>

	<p pid="c.1056W.6/1">The Government are working hard with the London 2012 Organising Committee and the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) to ensure a lasting legacy for all Olympic sports, including shooting, for London and the UK as a whole. The ODA and the Organising Committee venues team are looking carefully at the post-games uses of all proposed facilities being developed for the shooting competitions at Woolwich.</p>
	<p pid="c.1056W.6/2">The biggest legacy that we aim to achieve for shooting, working with the National Governing Body and International Federation, is for more people to have experienced the sport in person. Hosting the games in the UK gives us a unique opportunity to open up Olympic and Paralympic sports to new audiences and thus increase interest and participation in them.</p>

	<p pid="c.1056W.9/1">In 2004, DCMS published a baseline survey of live music staged in England and Wales. This looked at premises, including pubs and clubs, where live music performances typically take place in addition to the main business of the establishment. This research is available in the Library of the House and on the DCMS website:</p>

	<p pid="c.1056W.9/7">In addition, the independent Live Music Forum has been monitoring the early effects of the Act on the live music sector. I look forward to receiving its report in the spring.</p>

Test purchase failure rates will not be used as an overall generic indicator of performance, as the campaign specifically aims to target problem premises, selected at the discretion of local enforcement agencies.

The only additional funding which is currently available in return for securing Respect Area status, is access to up to &pound;125,000 from the Department for Education and Skills to help improve parenting programmes linked to tackling antisocial behaviour.

The 40 Respect Areas have been identified as having a track record in taking action to tackle antisocial behaviour and have demonstrated a commitment and capacity to do more.</p>

	<p pid="c.1065W.11/4" class="indent">&quot;All reports of incidents, whether from victims, witnesses or third parties and whether crime related or not, will result in the registration of an incident report by police&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1065W.11/5" class="indent">Following the initial registration, an incident will be recorded as a crime (Notifiable offence) if, on the balance of probability:</p>
	<p pid="c.1065W.11/6" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law (the police will determine this, based on their knowledge of the law and counting rules), and <i> (b)</i> there is no credible evidence to the contrary.</p>

	<p pid="c.1065W.11/10">If goods ordered over the internet (or by phone, mail etc.) do not arrive due to a fraudulent operation, then the following rules apply in order of priority:</p>
	<p pid="c.1065W.11/11" class="indent">If the location of the suspect(s) is either unknown or outside England and Wales, then the crime should be recorded in the force/BCD in whose area the victim is located when they place the order.</p>

	<p pid="c.1065W.11/13" class="indent">If payment is made electronically then the venue will be the address of the account holder into which the money is transferred or if no address then the address of the bank, provided this is not at headquarters or the site of a computer server.</p>

	<p pid="c.1069W.9/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.9/2">(i) The total costs of implementing the Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005 in the first year were estimated to be between &pound;117.0 million and &pound;202.6 million. Costs were estimated, in present value terms, to be between &pound;477.6 million and &pound;676.3 million over the first 10 years. Costs were estimated to be &pound;1.13 billion to &pound;1.94 billion over 40 years, in present value terms<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.9/3">The additional costs to health and safety regulators were not considered to be substantial. There were pre-existing regulations, implemented in 1989, and ensuring compliance with the new requirements would be subsumed into current inspection activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.9/4">(ii) The first year costs of implementing the Control of Vibration at Work Regulations 2005 were estimated to be between &pound;201 million and &pound;358 million. Over the first 10 years, total costs were estimated, in present value terms, to be between &pound;2,377 million and &pound;4,300 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.9/5">The initial costs to regulators were estimated to be around &pound;65,000 for training inspectors (mainly HSE) and around &pound;300,000 for conducting research into whole-body vibration exposures to assist industry by producing generic risk assessments for machines expected to cause higher exposures<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.9/6">Enforcing the regulations is unlikely to increase costs because enforcement action will be absorbed as part of the full range of inspection duties carried out by inspectors.</p>

	<p pid="c.1073W.5/1">The answer is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/2">(i) The cost to business, in present value terms, of complying with the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 was estimated to be some &pound;1.4 billion in the first year. Recurring costs were estimated to be in the region of &pound;13 million a year over 50 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/3">These figures should be balanced against the estimated &pound;3 billion benefits of the regulations. These arise from reducing the risks from asbestos and so preventing an estimated 4,700 asbestos related deaths over 50 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/4">(ii) Combining the costs to HSE and local authorities of enforcing the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002, the cost in the first year in which the regulations came into force was estimated to be in the region of &pound;8 million in present value terms. Over a 10-year period, enforcement costs were estimated at &pound;34 million. The information in this reply was drawn from the final Regulatory Impact Assessment for the legislation that is available in the Library or on the HSE website at: <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/ria/index.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/ria/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/5">The Government and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are committed to meeting the Better Regulation challenge. The HSE is constantly reviewing what can be done better to ensure that the right balance is struck between protecting people at work and avoiding unnecessary burdens on business.</p>

	<p pid="c.1074W.2/1">Customers wishing to obtain a new national insurance number are required to attend an interview. The jobcentres providing these services were selected on the basis of historical information on where the largest volumes of applications were made, also taking into account the suitability of premises available. Not all jobcentres have suitable premises to conduct these interviews or have had sufficient demand in the past for this specialist service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.2/2">Our policy on travelling time and distance is that a customer should be offered an appointment at the nearest location to their requested postcode (place of abode or place of work). In practice Jobcentre Plus specifically advises the customer if the interview is likely to be more than one hour travelling time each way, or if they are likely to be absent from home for over four hours. To assist the customer in these instances, Jobcentre Plus can offer special interview arrangements at a more suitable Jobcentre Plus site. Customers have the option, and some do choose, to travel for longer than one hour to attend an interview. Travelling time rather than distance is the measure on which the suitability of the appointment is determined as this takes into account local transport arrangements. Jobcentre Plus does have a facility to carry out home visits if customers have mobility problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.1080W.6/1">Evidence from the pathfinder local housing allowance evaluation to date suggests that claimants who are paid their benefit directly are more likely to report that they are looking for work, and the proportion of claimants paid directly has increased from 50 per cent. to 84 per cent. Increased financial inclusion can improve work readiness and 91 per cent. of tenants have a bank or building society account, with around a quarter of claimants saying that they opened an account because of the local housing allowance. Additionally, the transparency of the local housing allowance is reported to make discussions about work between advisers and claimants easier. Some of these effects of the local housing allowance, such as increased financial inclusion, will take time to impact on claimant behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="c.1088W.0/1">The latest quarterly progress report issued by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA)states that the Ministry of Energy and Water, in partnership with various donors and governments, has made considerable strides since 2003 to rehabilitate the provision of electricity throughout Afghanistan. It is estimated that 15 per cent. of the population now has access to some electrical power. This includes approximately 378,700 urban and rural households, 33,500 commercial establishments and 5,300 government institutions. However, access remains poor and is often unreliable. Furthermore, figures should be treated with caution as there are serious limitations in ability to measure some of the statistics. DFID is not directly engaged in this sector. Lead donors are the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="c.1088W.0/2">In October 2002, USAID committed support for a national irrigation and power rehabilitation programme in conjunction with Afghanistan's Ministry of Energy and Water. The programme is focused on the rehabilitation of the south east power system (SEPS), a 100 MW power generation and transmission network. It aims to provide low cost and reliable power to 1.7 million residents in Helmand and Kandahar provinces by the end of 2009. Central to this initiative is a commitment to rehabilitate the Kajaki multi-purpose dam, built by USAID in 1953 on the Helmand river.</p>
	<p pid="c.1088W.0/3">The programme is split into phases and will include rehabilitating and upgrading the dam, its power plant and associated transmission network by 2009. The first phase will increase Kajaki's generation capacity to 51 MW. Funding of $150 million has already been allocated for this work. The UK Government, through DFID, may fund smaller projects in the vicinity of the dam as part of a stabilisation programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.1089W.0/1">Corruption is a serious problem in much of Africa and the poor suffer most.

	<p pid="c.1089W.0/2">In most countries, DFID delivers aid in a range of ways and the choice of aid instruments depends on the circumstances of each country. DFID takes strong measures to protect our aid programmes from corruption. Strong procurement and management systems have been established to prevent corruption in projects and programmes directly administered by DFID. These systems are subject to independent and systematic audit and evaluation that provide high levels of assurance on the adequacy of systems of control and the processes for safeguarding assets. The external audit for DFID projects is carried out by the UK National Audit Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.1089W.0/3">When funds are granted directly to a partner government as Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS), direct responsibility for the use and auditing of those funds is passed to that government. Before a decision is made to provide budget support, DFID carries out a detailed Fiduciary Risk Assessment. This includes a specific assessment of the risk of corruption and enables us to decide whether the circumstances are appropriate for providing PRBS. DFID considers the risk of corruption in the formal public financial management systems, taking into account how these systems operate in practice and the wider governance and institutional context of the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.1089W.0/4">Where significant corruption or other fiduciary risks are identified, we consider whether the partner government has a credible programme of reform and whether any additional measures are needed to mitigate the risk. We may require additional measures such as independent audits, Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys or the use of donor procurement systems rather than government ones. Progress is monitored. PRBS is usually accompanied by technical assistance to help the government strengthen its systems.</p>

	<p pid="c.1090W.5/1">DFID does not maintain central records of our interaction with rural communities in developing countries. But we are committed to broad country ownership of national development plans and policy making. This includes poor and excluded communities. In many countries we encourage and support mechanisms that enable poor men and women to have a say in national and local planning and to monitor the services that government are providing.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.5/2">In Ghana, for example, we are supporting the disability movement so that they can influence national poverty reduction plans and budget decisions. In Uganda, the Kabarole Research Centre, with DFID support, monitors the quality of government service provision in rural areas and feeds that information back to local government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.5/3">In Tanzania, in the development of poverty reduction plans for the mainland and Zanzibar, we supported consultations with rural communities, including vulnerable groups such as the elderly, on policies to improve service delivery in rural areas. Now, through a grant-making foundation, we are building the capacity of rural organisations such as ageing and disability groups to monitor the quality of service provision. We are funding a 'Views of the People' survey through the Government's poverty monitoring system that will shed light on rural people's views of government performance in tackling rural poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.5/4">In Nepal, the rural roads programme involves structured consultation with communities to ensure that the needs of everyone&mdash;rather than just a vocal few&mdash;are taken into account. Communities also identify the poorest families amongst them to take part in road construction. Similarly in Ghana, the Department of Feeder Roads uses a road prioritisation methodology that gives rural communities an opportunity to identify and prioritise their need for rural roads. This approach, developed with DFID support, is being adopted in Ghana to prioritise funding from other development agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.5/5">In Ethiopia, numerous rural communities from 286 districts were consulted on implementation of the productive safety nets programme. Communities helped identify people who would be eligible for assistance as well as public works programmes that they would engage in.</p>

We discussed a range of issues including the use of the fund for special operations (FSO), debt relief for the regional heavily indebted poorer countries (HIPC), the President's &quot;Building Opportunities for the Majority&quot; initiative, and proposed work on climate change. On each occasion I confirmed our support for the President's reorganisation of the Bank, which DFID has been supporting, his work to help borrowing member countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region tackle poverty, inequality and respond to climate change, and work to improve the Bank's performance in making lending available to small enterprises. To date, DFID has approved &pound;18.3 million to support the IADB's work in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.2/2">I have also expressed to the President my concern over the details of the current IADB's debt relief initiative to cancel all the outstanding loans of the five HIPC countries in the region. We are concerned that it will constrain the Bank's ability to provide substantial and concessional financing to the poorer HIPC countries to finance the millennium development goals (MDGs). The UK has strongly supported the IADB providing additional debt relief to these HIPCs, but we are concerned about the way the deal is structured and the lack of additional financing for MDGs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1091W.5/1">DFID does not have a bilateral programme in Lebanon. However, the UK responded to the humanitarian crisis last year by contributing &pound;22.3 million at the international donors' conference in Stockholm in August 2006. This money was allocated to humanitarian relief (logistics, food, water, sanitation) delivered through aid agencies (e.g. Red Cross, United Nations (UN)); munitions clearance; bridging (providing and transporting temporary bridges to Lebanon) and funding that is channelled through multilateral funds, e.g. the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the European Commission (EC).</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.5/2">Over the next four years we will be continuing a further &pound;60 million (approximately) to Lebanon through contributions to the international system. Therefore, a key priority for DFID is to ensure the effective use of funding delivered through multilateral channels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.5/3">A difficult problem that we have been addressing in Lebanon is danger to civilians from unexploded bombs. On top of the &pound;1.5 million we had already committed to clearance of unexploded mines, we made available a further &pound;1.2 million to the UN Mines Action Service (UNMAS) and the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) for further munitions clearance work in Lebanon. This means DFID's total contribution to munitions clearance is now close to &pound;2.8 million. We have also asked the Government of Israel to hand over all relevant maps locating unexploded ordnance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.5/4">Improving the plight of Palestinian refugees remains a priority for DFID. At the Paris III conference on reconstruction in Lebanon in January 2007, we committed a further &pound;24.4 million to United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for 2011-12, on top of the &pound;76 million that will be provided to UNRWA over the next four years. Although funds are not ear- marked, UNRWA estimates approximately 20 per cent. of these funds will support Palestinians in Lebanon.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.5/5">The ripple-effect of conflict and instability in Lebanon holds significant risks for our bilateral programmes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Iraq. We therefore have an interest in addressing the causes of conflict in Lebanon and seeing a stable and prosperous state. In partnership with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) we work through HMG's Global Conflict and Prevention Pool (GCPP) to support the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and to contribute to peacebuilding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.5/6">With the UK embassy in Beirut we are also monitoring initiatives to promote democratic oversight of reconstruction spending and planning. This has the potential to address some of the issues underlying the internal conflict in Lebanon.</p>

	<p pid="c.1092W.2/1">Humanitarian agencies in Darfur are struggling to deliver in an increasingly difficult environment.

The topics under discussion were agreed in the 2003 multi-year programme of work, which operates in two-yearly cycles, with one review year and one policy year.

	<p pid="c.1093W.2/3">The UK will be working, through the EU, to secure action-oriented outcomes in each of the thematic sectors. In particular, the EU is looking to foster a transition to a global low-carbon economy, with diversified energy policies included in national sustainable development strategies and plans by 2010, and with priority to energy efficiency, renewable energies and improved access to sustainable and affordable energy services for all. The EU has also called for a basket of voluntary commitments on access to energy, energy efficiency and renewables, and a review mechanism to assess progress.</p>

Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment are poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 are also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> 2.

The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 4.

As the duration and nature of post-registration training varies greatly, and as service and training costs are closely related, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the total cost of training.</p>

	<p pid="c.1135W.0/1">Information on spending by national health service organisations on particular areas is not collected centrally. Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for providing health services to meet the needs of their local population, including services to tackle obesity, alcohol misuse and smoking. The 2006-07 and 2007-08 revenue allocations to PCTs separately identify &pound;211 million nationally in 2006-07 and &pound;342 million nationally in 2007-08 to support implementation of the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper. This funding has been targeted on the most deprived areas to support the delivery of some of the commitments in the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper. This will enable PCTs to deliver various initiatives including action on diet, activity and obesity, alcohol interventions and NHS stop smoking services. Revenue allocations to commissioning organisations in Lancashire, PCTs and previously health authorities, are shown in the tables.</p>

	<p pid="c.1137W.2/1">Our overall aim is to ensure that national health service professionals working with offenders have access to similar clinical information systems and services as those in the rest of the NHS in order to improve the quality of patient care and support system reform.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.2/2">The great majority of health professionals working in prisons have no specialist information management and technology support, and the task of developing and providing prison establishments with appropriate clinical information technology (IT) hardware and software has always been recognised as an integral corollary of the transfer of health care responsibility from the Home Office to this Department from April 2006. Within the Department, the provision of strategic IT systems is undertaken by the NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CfH) agency as a part of the wider national programme for IT in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.2/3">Planning is under way to extend compliant primary care systems to support prison healthcare. Mental health and limited secondary care functionality will be added at a later date as applications become available. The first practical step to achieving this goal is in the form of providing the necessary connectivity to the N3 network in the prison estate. This has two aspects: providing broadband connections to prison establishments, and developing a network infrastructure within establishments. In December 2006, &pound;3 million was specifically allocated through strategic health authorities to enhance prison health care IT infrastructure, with the majority of work due to complete this month. NHS CfH is liaising with the prison service and primary care trusts to oversee implementation of this phase of the programme, based on local costed plans.</p>
