	<p pid="b.385W.3/1">The Government and the Devolved Administrations published their response to the Independent Review of UK Avian Quarantine on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April</phrase>. This is available on the Defra website:</p>
	<p pid="b.385W.3/2"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/control/avianquarantine/pov-strategy/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/control/avianquarantine/pov-strategy/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.385W.3/3">The Government and the Devolved Administrations either accept, or accept in principle, 29 of the 32 recommendations. However, some of the responses are preliminary, pending further consultation with stakeholders or completion of further studies. For many of the recommendations, the European Commission would be responsible for taking forward any necessary action. Two of the recommendations require further consideration, and one recommendation regarding pet birds has been rejected. These are detailed in the Government response.</p>
	<p pid="b.385W.3/4">There is currently an EU ban on imports of captive wild birds, which is due to expire on <phrase class="date" code="">31 July</phrase>. A decision on whether to extend the ban will be taken at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in June.</p>
	<p pid="b.385W.3/5">The key elements of the Government response are currently being implemented and will be in place before imports resume. In addition, all approved quarantine premises will need to be reassessed against revised standards before they can accept any birds into quarantine.</p>
	<p pid="b.385W.3/6">In April 2005 the European Commission requested the European Food Safety Authority to carry out a review of the animal health and welfare aspects of imports of captive wild birds, which is due to report in October 2006. This will inform EU policy and we await their opinion with interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.386W.9/1">Final calculations about milk production are still being made, but Although it appears that wholesale milk production was lower in 2005&ndash;06 than 2004&ndash;05, it is too early to tell whether this is a long term trend or has been caused by weather, restructuring etc. The UK is more often under quota than over it and it must be remembered that quota is a limit on production and not a target.</p>

	<p pid="b.387W.5/1">The Government supported the conclusion of the Environment, Rood and Rural Affairs Select Committee in 2004, that there was no compelling evidence in favour of setting up a regulatory body to oversee the dairy industry. It is difficult to see how a regulator could determine a fair price other than by reference to a market price. A price regulator would almost certainly be incompatible with EU competition law and with the (common organisation of the market in milk and milk products.</p>

	<p pid="b.387W.8/1">Since the Department was established in 2001, we have put in place a considerable programme of reforms and improvements. For example, action on sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of achievements relating to these policy areas can be found at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm</a>. I am confident that the West Lancashire constituency will have benefited from these.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.8/2">In particular, the West Lancashire constituency has benefited from funding through the National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund as well as the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant to deliver household waste recycling levels that are currently well above the national average. Singly, or in partnership with other Lancashire authorities, West Lancashire has received more than &pound;7 million to support progress in this area in the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.8/3">Under the Nitrates Directive, around 80 per cent. of the West Lancashire constituency was designated as an Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2002; currently about 55 per cent. of England is designated. Farmers in NVZs are required to follow an action programme aimed at reducing the risk of nitrates loss; for example by limiting the amount of Nitrogen applied on the farm during the year and by not applying manure or fertilisers during certain times of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.8/4">Since 2003, local authority performance on street cleanliness has been measured through best value performance indicator BV199. This assesses the percentage of survey sites in each local authority area with unacceptable levels of litter and detritus. In 2003&ndash;04 West Lancashire scored 18.2 per cent. against a national average of 21.2 per cent., and in 2004&ndash;05 19 per cent. against a national average of 18.1 per cent. These results are for West Lancashire district, comprising the constituencies of West Lancashire and South Ribble. Data are not available at the constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.8/5">In March 2005 we announced that Lancashire would be one of eight rural pathfinders in England. The pathfinder initiative is a key part of the Government's Rural Strategy and reflects the Government's commitment to devolve decision-making and resources to the local level. The Lancashire rural pathfinder is helping to ensure greater co-ordination of rural delivery programmes, including testing new and innovative methods to bring about improvements in the delivery of services to rural communities and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.8/6">Lancashire has also proved to be a fertile ground for our Defra's Project Based Schemes which are generally available to farmers to help them develop new business opportunities and widen the skills they already possess. For example, Farmer Ted's Farm Park, located at Worral House Farm just outside Southport, was opened in 2003 with the help of funding from the Rural Enterprise Scheme. In the first 18 months it received over 38,000 visitors including 480 school trips. The attraction also contributes to the local economy by employing 10 full-time and 30 part-time employees.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.8/7">The RPA will be releasing details of payments made under the new Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in due course. It will publish an annual figure for payments to each recipient under the SPS drawn from its financial records. The information will be extracted and published on the RPA website later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.8/8">Indicators of environmental quality for West Lancashire district are given as follows, they are for water quality and waste and recycling. Data for other indicators are available only either at regional and/or national level and not local level, or for individual monitoring sites not within the area local to West Lancashire. For some indicators data for 1997 are not available and the nearest year for which data are available has been given.</p>

	<p pid="b.390W.2/2">The Government have sought to establish the facts about the extent of the alleged trade in domestic cat and dog fur in the UK. We have found no evidence that such fur is being imported into this country in significant volumes. The Government have also been working to establish a scientific test to make it possible to ascertain reliably from what species of animal any given fur sample has come.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.2/3">We firmly believe that action on this issue should and would best be taken at EU level as a harmonised approach would have greater impact, enhance animal-welfare standards within the EU itself and avoid obstacles to the operation of the single market. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs supported calls for the European Commission to investigate these allegations when the Agriculture and Fisheries Council met in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.2/4">In January 2006, the Commission published its Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals, which proposes action in the course of 2006 to address public concerns on the trading of cat and dog fur and derived products. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February</phrase>, Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner Kyprianou stated at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council that the Commission was planning to publish a proposal on the import of cat and dog fur within the next few months.</p>

	<p pid="b.395W.2/2">The full impact of the timing of 2005 Single Payment Scheme on the timetable for the 2006 scheme will not become clear until the vast majority of payments have been made and any corrective action identified. However, preparation for the 2006 scheme is well under way, with the vast majority of 2005 scheme claimants having received a claim form for this year's scheme. Business processes and IT systems required to process 2006 scheme claims are being developed and deployed on an iterative basis, and data capture of 2006 scheme claims will commence shortly.</p>

However, most of the meetings relating to Sakhalin II since May 2001 have taken place in the context of the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) due diligence and have been with Sakhalin Energy Investment Company (SEIC), in which Shell Sakhalin Holdings B.V. is the major shareholder, rather than with Shell itself.</p>

	<p pid="b.411W.2/1">The Government are proud of its record on employment regulation. This has given the UK a skilled and flexible workforce. We have given people decent rights at work without jeopardising their prospects for employment. Both employers and employees have rights and responsibilities towards each other and we strive to find the right balance and consult closely on all our regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/2">The Regulations behind the above statutory instruments are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/3" class="italic">SI 2001/2673</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/4">The Regulations behind Statutory Instrument 2001/2673 amended the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase>. They increased the adult minimum wage rate from &pound;3.70 to &pound;4.10 an hour and the rate for workers aged 18&ndash;21 (inclusive) from &pound;3.20 to &pound;3.50 an hour. They also made a number of other amendments relating to the level of the accommodation offset and workers taking part in accredited training. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is responsible for enforcing compliance with the national minimum wage legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/5" class="italic">SI 2001/2660</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/6">SI 2001/2660 introduced two technical changes to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to implement the Burden of Proof Directive&mdash;97/80/EC&mdash;the aim of which was to ensure that victims of sex discrimination are provided with effective access to justice, and in doing so promote equal treatment. This Directive applied to the employment field only. These regulations are enforceable through the Employment Tribunal system.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/7" class="italic">SI 2001/4010</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/8">SI 2001/4010 extended parental leave entitlement for parents of disabled children under 18 from 13 weeks' parental leave to 18 weeks' leave which can be taken up to their child's 18th birthday. SI 2001/4010 also extended the right to parental leave to parents of children under 5 on <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-15">15 December 1999</phrase>. These parents were able to take their parental leave until <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>. SI 1999/3312, which SI 2001/4010 amended, is enforceable through the employment tribunals system.</p>

	<p pid="b.411W.2/10">SI 2002/3128 introduced measures to protect young workers and provide fair minimum standards which ensure that young people are protected from excess working time leading to fatigue, risks to health and safety and possible damage to their education. These Regulations are enforceable and I have not been made aware of any difficulties with their operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/11" class="italic">SI 2003/3319</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/12">The Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 (Statutory Instruments 2003/3319) govern the private recruitment industry in the UK and seek to protect those using the job-finding services provided by employment agencies. It is enforced by the DTIs Employment Agency Standards (EAS) Inspectorate. The Inspectorate can prosecute an agency found to be in breach of the legislation and can also apply for a Prohibition Order preventing an individual from operating as an agency or employment business for up to 10 years. The EAS has a helpline; the number is 0845 955 5105.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/13" class="italic">SI 2003/1656</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.2/14">SI 2003/1656 amended the Equal Pay Act 1970 in three respects to reflect requirements of European Community law, specifically Article 141 of the Treaty of Rome (equal pay), as applied in a number of recent cases before the European Court of Justice and the domestic courts. It extended the previous two-year limit on the period over which an employment tribunal could award back pay in successful equal pay cases, extended the six-month time limit within which a woman must bring an equal pay claim before an employment tribunal in specific, limited cases, and introduced a new rule that enables equal pay claims to be brought during the period of a stable employment relationship or within six months of it ending. These Regulations are enforceable through the Employment Tribunal system.</p>

Between 1984 and 1992 a different interpretation ofICD-9 selection rule 3 was used to code underlying cause of death in England and Wales to that used internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications in 1984 and 1994*. The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with caution. An article specifically examining the effect of the change in classification for cancer trends was published in Health Statistics Quarterly 23**.

	<p pid="b.417W.2/1">The Office of Fair Trading has been investigating the question of credit card default charges. In April they produced a statement of the principles they think card issuers should follow in setting default charges in their standard contracts with consumers in order to meet the test of fairness set out in the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="b.417W.2/2">The OFT has made it clear that they expect all credit card issuers to recalculate their default charges in line with the principles set out in the statement and to take action where needed to reduce the level of credit card default fees. The OFT also noted that the principles also apply to default charges in other consumer contracts such as those for bank overdrafts, store cards and mortgages.</p>

	<p pid="b.424W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding (1) the size of the electorate and the registration rate in each local authority in (i) England, (ii) Wales, (iii) Scotland and (iv) Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years; (2) the percentage of those eligible to vote who were registered to vote in each local authority in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Wales, <i>(c)</i> Scotland and <i>(d)</i> Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years and (3) the total electorate for <i>(a)</i> the Vale of Clwyd and <i>(b)</i> Denbighshire in each of the last 10 years. (68582, 64195 and 65905)</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/4" class="indent">Firstly, please allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by different data being available for England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and for England &amp; Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate 'total electorate'. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from Denbighshire to collate the necessary data.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/5" class="indent">Historical UK Electorate by LA</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/6" class="indent">Electoral data are available on the number of people registered to vote in Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only available on a &quot;usual residence&quot; basis: the mid-year population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to calculate an estimate of the 'registration rate' using &quot;the percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&quot; as either Parliamentary or local/European electors).</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/7" class="indent">It is not possible to 'split' estimates of the usual resident population in order to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce such a 'split'.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/8" class="indent">The attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information, for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual 'usual resident' mid-year population; (ii) the size of the <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electorate and <i>(b)</i> local/European electorate; and (iii) the percentage of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electors and <i>(b)</i> local/European electors. These are labelled as 'registration rates' on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/9" class="indent">This 'registration rate' is not a published National Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local authorities where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated 'registration rate' calculated for Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate 'registration rates' on occasion in the manner outlined above.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/10" class="indent">The attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently available.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/11" class="indent">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to calculate these weighted comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/12" class="indent">Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/13" class="indent">We have also updated the data where there are known (small) errors in or updates to previously published data. This means that the attached data provide the best possible comparison.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/14" class="indent">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These factors may have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/15" class="indent">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/16" class="indent">In order to aid comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated 'registration rates' for all ten years. Table A shows these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European electors. However, any comparison of these data across years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/17" class="indent">A copy of the tables will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.2/18" class="indent">The tables provide as comprehensive as possible comparisons between historic local authority population and electorate numbers. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are also interested in the percentage of residents who are registered to vote on a Parliamentary constituency basis. Official Report number 82 column 1719, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase>, provides the best possible consistent UK comparison for Parliamentary constituencies. For England and Wales we hope to investigate the possibility of producing population estimates by Parliamentary constituency in the future using Small Area Population Estimates. For Northern Ireland, population estimates by Parliamentary constituency are already available from the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency (NISRA).

	<p pid="b.427W.0/1">The DFID bilateral programme in Angola has commitments of &pound;5 million for the financial year 2006&ndash;07. Expenditure is concentrated in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/2" class="indent">Relief and recovery. This includes support for bridge repairs that are necessary to allow humanitarian aid to reach affected areas of the country. Funding has also been provided for emergency operations to contain the outbreak of the Marburg virus in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/3" class="indent">Strengthening democratisation. Our work here focuses on decentralisation and supporting civil-society contributions to the elections process. We also work with the World Bank to try and improve governance in the country and support the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/4" class="indent">Urban poverty in Luanda. This programme has created space for local communities to organise and better engage with local government on a range of issues, such as local water supply. The programme will end this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/5" class="indent">HIV and AIDS. We are providing support for condom promotion, access to testing and behaviour change programmes, and are also providing anti-retrovirals.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/6">This year, Angola has also received approximately &pound;1.3 million from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACCP). ACCP funds are agreed on a yearly basis. In addition, DFID continues to support de-mining operations in Angola. &pound;1 million has been provided this year for de-mining in the country. A similar commitment is expected in 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/7">Angola will also be involved in regional programmes that DFID in Southern Africa is currently developing. This regional programme is a &pound;20 million per annum commitment, addressing regional peace and security, trade and growth, and resilient livelihoods concerns. As part of this regional commitment, we have recently approved an &pound;18 million UNICEF programme to address children affected by AIDS. Around &pound;3 million of this programme will be directed to Angola.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/8">All DFID bilateral resources are managed through third party civil society and UN organisations and not by the Government of Angola.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/9">Allocated bilateral expenditure from DFID is expected to be &pound;3 million for 2007&ndash;08. Angola also benefits from DFID contributions to European Union and the World Bank operations in Angola. The EU has committed &euro;146 million over the five year period from 2002&ndash;07. The World Bank's contribution this year is approximately US$30 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.428W.2/1">DFID staff continually monitor the humanitarian situation (including food needs) in Chad, and undertake periodic assessments in the east of the country. Of immediate concern, is the food situation of the estimated 50,000 Chadians who have been displaced as a result of attacks and violence in the border area with Darfur. The World Food Programme (WFP), along with other UN agencies and non governmental organisations (NGOs), are currently assessing needs and are launching programmes to assist these displaced and vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="b.428W.2/2">Another critical issue at this time of year is the pre-positioning of food aid for the 205,000 Darfur refugees in Chad prior to the start of the rains. The WFP has indicated that, despite the deterioration of security in April, this process is on-track. The UK provided the WFP with &pound;2 million for its operations in Chad last financial year, and we are considering providing further support.</p>

Each time staff log on to our computer network, they are required to acknowledge that they have read and agree to comply with the Acceptable Use of IT policy. Our system also alerts staff when logging in that their activity on the system may be monitored. The policy provides clear guidance that misuse of official equipment will be a disciplinary offence, and, subject to the particular offence, could lead to dismissal. The policy applies to civil servants working in the UK and overseas, and to our locally appointed staff overseas, who work under local contacts.</p>

We have flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 in certain circumstances if it is judged to be in the public interest, and similarly, exceptionally, staff below the senior civil service beyond 65. Currently there are three senior civil servants aged beyond 60, and three staff below the senior civil service aged beyond 65.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.3/2">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase>, the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations come in to force, introducing wide ranging provisions against discrimination on age in employment and vocational training. The Regulations introduce a default retirement age of 65. DFID is presently considering what its retirement age should be from October 2006. For the senior civil service, it will be 65, in line with the default retirement age. DFID retains its delegated authority to set the retirement age for staff below the senior civil service and will decide shortly whether to adopt the default retirement age of 65 or to have no retirement age at all. The Age Regulations also introduce a &quot;duty to consider&quot; procedure to ensure retirements at whatever age are fair. This will allow employees to request to work beyond the normal retirement age, and require discussions between DFID and the employee about when the employee will retire. Both parties will have to give adequate notice in order to ensure the retirement constitutes a fair dismissal in employment law.</p>

	<p pid="b.431W.2/1">All children, including those with disabilities or living in difficult circumstances, should have equal access to a good quality basic education. DFID is committed to working with the Governments of developing countries towards the education of all children, including those with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.431W.2/2">DFID's policy on social exclusion is laid out in its September 2005 policy paper entitled 'Reducing poverty by tackling social exclusion'. The paper sets out how DFID will build on the work that is already under way and some practical actions that DFID is taking to tackle social exclusion and make a real difference to the lives of excluded people.</p>
	<p pid="b.431W.2/3">Also, DFID's strategy paper of last year, 'Girls' education: towards a better future for all' recognised that certain groups of girls are more likely to be excluded from school on the basis of caste, ethnicity, religion or disability and that disabled children, and among them disabled girls in particular, constitute a significant group that is denied access to education. The challenge is to support governments to provide quality education for excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.431W.2/4">It is not possible, without incurring a disproportionate cost, to identify a comprehensive list of projects supported by DFID which include supporting disabled children's right to education. DFID's approach is to support developing country governments' own education plans rather than directly manage discrete projects. In India, for example, DFID has supported through its country programme, the District Primary Education Programme, which promotes inclusive education, and some states have been successful in integrating disabled children into mainstream schools. In Vietnam, DFID has co-financed with the Government of Vietnam, the World Bank and other donors the Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children programme, a &pound;243 million project which was launched in October 2003 and includes a strong focus on primary education for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="b.431W.2/5">DFID also provides funding through UK non-governmental organisations to support projects that benefit disabled people and advocate for disabled people's rights. DFID has partnership agreements with a number of organisations that support disability-focused activities, such as World Vision, HelpAge International, Save the Children and VSO, among others. In addition, through our partner Action on Disability and Development, with whom we have a six-year Programme Partnership Agreement, we work to promote greater participation and inclusion of disabled people and their organisations in decision-making processes, particularly on partner governments' Poverty Reduction Strategies.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.2/1">Agriculture in India is generally a success story. India is self sufficient in staple grain crops in most years and stores a substantial surplus. The so-called 'green revolution' has been the main driving force behind this success, promoting the use of improved crop varieties and fertilisers in areas with access to irrigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.2/2">However, the benefits of new technologies have not been equitably distributed. DFID's focus has been on improving the livelihoods of farmers and other rural people in rain-fed areas which are not suited to the particular packages of improvements offered by the green revolution. The focus on livelihoods, rather than agriculture, recognises that poor people are often landless and depend on a diverse range of activities to support themselves. However, DFID-supported projects have developed and tested appropriate new agricultural technologies and tools in these areas that have resulted in increases in production and income, more efficient and sustainable use of soil and water resources and reduction of hard manual labour, particularly for women. Some examples are treadle pumps for small scale irrigation, seed drills, paddy rice transplanters, which have made work easier as well as contributing to improvements in production.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.2/3">Consistent with this approach, DFID has concentrated on micro-credit rather than agricultural credit. DFID is working with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to develop the capacity of micro-finance institutions to on-lend to individuals or groups. Approximately 45 per cent. of these loans are for agriculture, livestock, fisheries or related activities. DFID's rural livelihoods projects incorporate revolving funds at the village level to support agriculture, livestock and micro-enterprise activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.5/1">DFID reviews the effectiveness of all bilateral projects over &pound;1 million at least once a year. This includes money which DFID country programmes channel through multilateral agencies since according to international convention this aid is classified as bilateral. DFID has a public service agreement target to achieve a sustained increase in the quality of DFID's bilateral projects. DFID reports progress towards this target in the Departmental Report and the Autumn Performance Report. This year's Departmental Report will be published on 9th May.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.5/2">This monitoring system cannot track core contributions to multilateral agencies because these funds are pooled. However, DFID uses a Multilateral Effectiveness Framework and other assessments to evaluate the performance of the multilateral agencies. During 2004, DFID used the Multilateral Effectiveness Framework to assess 23 multilateral agencies against their objectives. These objectives were agreed jointly with DFID and set out in an Institutional Strategy Paper. These institutional strategies are publicly available. DFID uses the results of the Multilateral Effectiveness Frameworks and other mechanisms to inform decisions around funding for the multilateral agencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.436W.2/1">There is a close relationship in action to improve reproductive health and family planning, maternal health and to make progress on HIV and AIDS. Closing the gap in unmet needs for family planning would make a big contribution to helping to lower maternal mortality. Sexual and reproductive health services are vital in ensuring that women have a choice about if and when to have children, and play a key role in helping them avoid sexually transmitted infection including HIV, including through condom provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/2">HIV Pregnant women with HIV and AIDS are four times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than un-infected women. Women with HIV need care and services in pregnancy to help protect their own health and to help prevent transmission of HIV to their babies. The United Nations Secretary General's progress report on the 2001 Declaration of Commitment in HIV and AIDS, released in April, estimates that only 9 per cent. of HIV positive women in low and middle income countries currently receive antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV. In countries with weak health systems this falls to less than 1 per cent..</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/3">DFID is working to support stronger health systems, with more adequate staff, equipment and drug supplies that are needed to improve access to HIV treatment, as well as to provide women with the care needed in pregnancy, especially when complications arise. Sustained improvements in maternal health and AIDS prevention, treatment and care will in large part depend on strengthening basic health services. Access to sexual and reproductive health and family planning services must be an essential part of this effort, and we are working to ensure that the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS in June gives a clear and strong message on the importance of sexual and reproductive health to efforts to make progress in HIV and AIDS.</p>

	<p pid="b.438W.2/1">DFID provides some support to sub-Saharan African countries for the development and facilitation of their national policies on trade, and specific issues like tourism, through its bilateral programmes. Much of DFID's support on trade to Sub Saharan Africa is provided regionally through programmes such as the Capacity-Building for Trade Policy and Negotiations and the Southern Africa Trade and Poverty Programme, and multilateral through institutions like the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.2/2">Governments can access funds for trade delegations to the UK and other destinations from a variety of sources, many supported by DFID funds, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trust Fund for Least Developed Country Travel managed by UNCTAD. This information is not held centrally and would involve a disproportionate cost to collect. For example, a delegation of developing country trade negotiators including from sub-Saharan Africa came to the UK at the end of last year.

	<p pid="b.442W.3/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) will put a greater emphasis on practical cooking skills in the review of the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3. QCA is also revising the criteria for food related GCSEs to put a greater emphasis on diet and health, consumer awareness, food safety and hygiene and food preparation skills. The Training Development Agency is aiming to increase the number of food technology training places in initial teacher training. We have invested &pound;1.5 million in professional development for primary teachers through our Food in Schools programme. However, in each school, Headteachers and governors set priorities for professional development and it is for them to decide whether further food education provision is needed for their staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.3/2">In addition, our aim is for all schools to be working towards Healthy Schools status by 2009. The programme now includes a compulsory healthy eating strand. Schools develop whole school food policies, linking what is taught across the curriculum with the food children eat at school, to ensure that consistent messages about healthy food choices run throughout all aspects of school life. Healthy Schools co-ordinators are being trained to support schools, including on healthy eating.</p>

Comprehensive data on subsequent disposal of assets at Fresh Start schools, and therefore income, is not centrally available. However, since 1998, disposal of areas capable of forming a sports pitch has needed approval from the Secretary of State, and there is no recorded instance of such an approval at a Fresh Start school.</p>

	<p pid="b.444W.0/1">The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires all maintained schools to have a wholesome supply of water for domestic purposes, including drinking water. The local authorities together with school governors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Regulations. The Secretary of State can, under Section 497 of the Education Act 1996, take action to enforce compliance with the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.0/2">Independent Schools are subject to The Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations 2003, which quote The Education School Premises Regulations 1999 in respect of water supplies. The Independent School Standards are the Regulations to which independent schools are inspected under Part 10 of the Education Act 2002. The Independent Schools Registration Authority will consider the inspectors report and can take enforcement action.</p>

	<p pid="b.445W.2/1">The Government are investing over &pound;1&frac12; billion in the five years up to 2008 to deliver the first comprehensive national school sport strategy, which went live in April 2003. The strategy's prime objective&mdash;a joint Department for Education and Skills and Department for Culture, Media and Sport PSA target&mdash;is to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum, to 75 per cent. by 2006 and 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition&mdash;by 2010&mdash;is to offer all children at least four hours of sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.445W.2/2">Spearheading action is the creation of a national network of sports colleges and school sport partnerships. There are currently 411 live school sport partnerships incorporating 80 per cent. of schools in England. All maintained schools will be within a partnership by September 2006. Good progress is being made towards the PSA target. The 2004/05 school sport survey found that 69 per cent. of pupils in the 11,4000 schools taking part were spending at least two hours in a typical week on high quality PE and school sport, an 11 per cent. increase on 2003/04. Copies of the survey reports for 2003/04 and 2004/05 have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.446W.0/1">The Department is encouraging schools to put the guidance on participation into practice in ways that are meaningful to children and young people. As a key outcome for all children, local partners including schools and local authorities have to listen to children and involve them in planning and delivery of services. We have ensured that inspection arrangements make the views of children and young people an important part of assessing how local areas are doing, and of school inspections. In addition, we have changed the law so that school governing bodies can now appoint pupils as associate members allowing them to attend governing body meetings and become members of committees.</p>
	<p pid="b.446W.0/2">Printed copies of the guidance were sent to all schools and local education authorities and are available online. Since then 10,853 additional copies have been requested. Evidence from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority monitoring and the National Foundation for Educational Research longitudinal reports shows that more schools than ever before have set up school councils as a way of involving pupils in decision-making processes.</p>

In most local authorities, the funding of school meals has been delegated down to schools, and therefore the Order passes the local authority's duty in providing meals on to schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.449W.0/1">The joint Department for Education and Skills and Department for Transport &quot;Travelling to School&quot; action plan aims to increase the proportion of pupils travelling to school by sustainable means.

	<p pid="b.449W.0/2">The Education and Inspections Bill includes provisions to improve home to school travel and transport arrangements in three main respects:</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.0/3" class="indent">By placing a general duty on local authorities to assess the travel and transport needs of all pupils, and to promote sustainable travel to school;</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.0/4" class="indent">By extending entitlement to free home to school transport for low income families (for secondary aged pupils to any one of the three nearest suitable schools, where the distance travelled is between two and six miles; and for primary aged pupils aged over eight, to their nearest school where this is more than two miles from their home); and</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.0/5" class="indent">By enabling a small number of local authorities to propose Pathfinder schemes to test innovative approaches to home to school transport to support school choice, reduce the distances pupils are expected to walk to school, and increase the proportion of pupils travelling by sustainable means.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.0/6">The Department will support these improvements with additional funding as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.0/7" class="indent">&pound;4 million per annum to support the new general duty on local authorities from financial year 2007/08;</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.0/8" class="indent">revenue funding building to &pound;40 million per annum to support the extension of rights for low income groups from financial year 2008/09; and</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.0/9" class="indent">&pound;4 million pump priming and annual revenue support building up over several years to &pound;12 million for school travel Pathfinder schemes, which we anticipate will start in September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.0/10">The Department will seek formal expressions of interest in Pathfinder schemes only after these proposals have been enacted.</p>

	<p pid="b.450W.9/1">The Institute of Employment Research and Cambridge Econometrics have recently published two sets of UK skill scenario projections, investigating skills profiles up to 2014 <sup>1</sup> (commissioned by the Learning and Skills Council and the Sector Skills Development Agency), and separately up to 2020 (commissioned as part of the Leitch Review of Skills <sup>2</sup> ).</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.9/2">These analyses suggest that between 2004 and 2014, just over 12 million jobs will need to be filled (through a combination of new employment growth and replacing workers leaving employment). We do not know exactly how many of these will need graduates, although around 6 million are expected to be in 'managerial', 'professional' or 'associate professional' occupations (high-level jobs that are most likely to employ graduates).</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.9/3">The 'baseline' projections <sup>3</sup> up to 2020, broadly using the same approach, suggest that around 18 million jobs will need to be filled, with around 9 million expected to be in these high-level occupations.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.9/4">The research needs to be viewed as showing possible trends in the skills needs of the future workforce. The work makes assumptions about how past trends in occupational change will continue; about future macro-economic performance; and how business decision-making will react to changing skill profiles.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.9/5">More detail is available in the individual reports. No projections up to 2025 have been conducted.</p>

	<p pid="b.458W.6/1">My Department has a retirement policy which explicitly states that if a member of staff below senior civil service level wishes to work beyond the normal retirement age of 65 we will normally agree to such a request subject to the normal standards of health, efficiency, conduct, performance and attendance being met. Individuals may not work beyond the age of 70 except in exceptional circumstances. The normal retirement age in the senior civil service is 60. However, the Department retains members of the senior civil service if it is judged to be in the public interest to do so and it is satisfied as to the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties. This flexibility allows the Department to meet its business needs, retaining valuable knowledge and skills, while giving staff as much choice as possible about when they retire.</p>

	<p pid="b.459W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding (1) the size of the electorate and the registration rate in each local authority in (i) England, (ii) Wales, (iii) Scotland and (iv) Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years; (2) the percentage of those eligible to vote who were registered to vote in each local authority in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Wales, <i>(c)</i> Scotland and <i>(d)</i> Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years and (3) the total electorate for <i>(a)</i> the Vale of Clwyd and <i>(b)</i> Denbighshire in each of the last 10 years. (68582, 64195 and 65905)</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/5" class="indent">Firstly, please allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by different data being available for England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and for England &amp; Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate 'total electorate'. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from Denbighshire to collate the necessary data.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/6" class="indent">Historical UK Electorate by LA</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/7" class="indent">Electoral data are available on the number of people registered to vote in Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only available on a &quot;usual residence&quot; basis: the mid-year population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to calculate an estimate of the 'registration rate' using &quot;the percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&quot; as either Parliamentary or local/European electors).</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/8" class="indent">It is not possible to 'split' estimates of the usual resident population in order to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce such a 'split'.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/9" class="indent">The attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information, for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual 'usual resident' mid-year population; (ii) the size of the <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electorate and <i>(b)</i> local/European electorate; and (iii) the percentage of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electors and <i>(b)</i> local/European electors. These are labelled as 'registration rates' on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/10" class="indent">This 'registration rate' is not a published National Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local authorities where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated 'registration rate' calculated for Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate 'registration rates' on occasion in the manner outlined above.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/11" class="indent">The attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently available.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/12" class="indent">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to calculate these weighted comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/13" class="indent">Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/14" class="indent">We have also updated the data where there are known (small) errors in or updates to previously published data. This means that the attached data provide the best possible comparison.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/15" class="indent">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These factors may have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/16" class="indent">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/17" class="indent">In order to aid comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated 'registration rates' for all ten years. Table A shows these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European electors. However, any comparison of these data across years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/18" class="indent">A copy of the tables will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/19" class="indent">The tables provide as comprehensive as possible comparisons between historic local authority population and electorate numbers. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are also interested in the percentage of residents who are registered to vote on a Parliamentary constituency basis. Official Report number 82 column 1719, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase>, provides the best possible consistent UK comparison for Parliamentary constituencies. For England and Wales we hope to investigate the possibility of producing population estimates by Parliamentary constituency in the future using Small Area Population Estimates. For Northern Ireland, population estimates by Parliamentary constituency are already available from the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency (NISRA).

	<p pid="b.464W.2/3">There are no specific rules regarding liquidation, bankruptcy or placing in administration of registered political parties in the Act. Whether individual members have liabilities, and the insolvency procedures applicable to a political party, are not matters governed by electoral law. Rather such matters will depend on how the particular political party has been set up, and its legal status in the general law: for example, some parties may be registered companies, and therefore would be subject to the specific requirements of companies' legislation.</p>

This gives an idea of the depth of poverty and it is simple to interpret. Indeed, the incorporation of two different relative low income thresholds into our new child poverty measure (60 and 70 per cent. of median income), together with the absolute tier, further ensures that different depths of poverty will be looked at separately.</p>

	<p pid="b.468W.2/4" class="indent">As noted in Table 1 of the Agency's Quarterly Summary Statistics (QSS), the old scheme caseload reduced from 965,000 in March 2005 to 923,000 in March 2006. There are three reasons for this fall:</p>
	<p pid="b.468W.2/5" class="indent">i. Some cases will have been closed or withdrawn either at the request of the parent with care or because the youngest child in a case has reached an age at which he or she no longer qualifies for child support, and any outstanding arrears on that case have been paid by the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="b.468W.2/6" class="indent">ii. Some cases will have had relevant links to new schema cases and been reactively converted onto the new scheme during the period in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.468W.2/7" class="indent">iii. The old scheme no longer has any intake-any new applications received by the Agency from 3rd March 2003 onwards are treated as new scheme applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.468W.2/8" class="indent">The above means that the old scheme caseload can be expected to reduce steadily over time. It should be noted that the Agency's new scheme caseload increased by 144,000 over the same period, from 452,000 to 596,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.469W.2/1">DWP operates the civil service wide arrangement for senior civil servants, with retirement at age 60. The head of the Department and Agency chief executives have the flexibility to retain SCS staff beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out their duties. We have one SCS member of staff working beyond age 60 out of a total of 247 SCS members.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/2">DWP policy provides the opportunity for staff in grades below the senior civil service to request to work beyond our retirement age of 65. We have 220 people out of a total of 116,965 working over age 65.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/3">There are no special arrangements to identify work opportunities for people over 65. They are treated the same as all other employees.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/4">We have successfully operated the arrangements for staff below SCS since October 2003, which is three years ahead of the implementation in October this year of the DTI Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. The regulations will prohibit age discrimination in employment and vocational training.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/5">We have reviewed the effectiveness of this policy and from <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase> we will have no mandatory retirement age at all for staff below SCS.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/6">By removing the retirement age of 65, we are giving people more choice about managing their working lives and planning for retirement. DWP positively encourages older workers, and recognise the benefits of experienced and committed staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/7">This change to our retirement policy is another positive measure in the Department's progress in championing diversity and further demonstrates our commitment to ending discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="b.472W.2/5" class="indent">The establishment of DCS as an Agency on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-01">1 November 2004</phrase> marked an increased focus on understanding the needs of its customers through early and proactive consultation with customer representative organisations. As changes have been made to some of the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) claim forms over the last year, DCS has undertaken specific consultation activity with the DCS Advisory Forum and where appropriate the wider lobby. The DCS Advisory Forum is the Disability and Carers Service's (DCS) main mechanism for consulting with the Voluntary and Community Sector. The forum was originally established in 1998 to provide advice and guidance to officials of DCS and the Department on the impact of change initiatives on disabled customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/6" class="indent">We are currently reviewing the DLA National claim form. This will be issued to the DCS Advisory Forum in May. Full consideration will be given to any comments received and full responses to those comments will be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/7" class="indent">In July 2005, we consulted with the DCS Advisory Forum on the proposed DLA Adult Claim form to be used within the Customer Case Management (CCM) test taking place at Manchester and Bootle Disability Benefit Centres (DBCs). At special events in July and September 2005, we also consulted with a high number of local voluntary and community organisations within the Manchester and Bootle DBC catchment areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/8" class="indent">In January 2006, we returned to the DCS Advisory Forum to consult with them on the proposed second version of the CCM claim form.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/9" class="indent">As a result of this consultation activity, a number of suggestions were submitted, many of which we have been able to incorporate. This has led to improvements being made to the form which will make it easier for customers to understand and answer the questions; provides customers with the option to describe the help they need and the difficulties they have at the end of each question; the layout, format and wording have also been improved and makes the form visibly clearer and easy to read.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/10" class="indent">When a suggestion has been made but not acted upon, for example where the suggestion would unfairly advantage one group of disabled people at the expense of other groups, reasons were given to the Forum to explain why the suggestion was not taken up.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/11" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>, the provision for customers to make e-claims via the internet for a range of DWP benefits was introduced, including DLA and AA. DCS took the lead on consulting on behalf of the Department with Interactive Demonstration and Preview events of the DWP e-Services taking place in Manchester and Birmingham in November 2005. These events provided customer representative groups with early sight of the DLA, Attendance Allowance, State Pension UK, Jobcentre Plus, and Child Support maintenance application e-forms. The DCS Advisory Forum, Jobcentre Plus Key Stakeholders and the Pension Service Partnerships Against Poverty Group were invited to attend these events, with representation from wider customer representative organisations also attending on the day. As a result of the comments received at these events, improvements to the DLA e-claim form are to be made. Steps are now being taken to include the provision for customer representatives to include their details, an option to provide Textphone details and increasing the size of text boxes.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/12" class="indent">Our consultation approach via the formal DCS Advisory Forum, the wider lobby where appropriate, and via customer feedback channels allows for continuous dialogue and suggestions from our customers or their representatives as to how our claim forms can be improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/13" class="indent">I hope you find this information helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.473W.2/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 placed new duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people, 'the Disability Equality Duty'. This Department (DWP) has taken the following steps to meet the Disability Equality Duty:</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/2">DWP is host to the Office for Disability Issues (ODI), which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase> to take forward the Government's strategy for improving the life chances of disabled people. One element of this work will be to overset the effective implementation of the Disability Equality Duty. The ODI is working in partnership with the Disability Rights Commission to support and encourage Departments to commit to meaningful actions that will improve their policies and services and realise the potential of their diverse workforces.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/3">The Department is already working towards the publication of its disability equality schemes by <phrase class="date" code="">4 December 2006</phrase>. The process was formally launched in April 2006 and will mean both central units and agencies involving disabled people in developing action plans for tackling problem areas and identifying positive actions to address these. We have also already begun planning for the Secretary of State's report due in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/4">DWP is currently revising its existing guidance on accessible communications with a view to introducing a new standard for information accessibility. This set of standards will form part of the disability equality scheme referred to earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/5">We have commissioned public access audits of all its premises used by the public during 2003. A total of 1,735 buildings were surveyed, and a programme of public access improvement works commissioned on 1,032 sites which are scheduled for completion in June 2006. The existing public access provisions are subject to annual review and any future additional requirement is built into the annual maintenance work programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/6">The Department wants staff to understand and embrace diversity and an important part of achieving this has been the development of a diversity toolkit which makes all our diversity and equality policy and information easily accessible in one place on an internal website. The toolkit also is now being used by around 70 other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/7">The Department is keen to ensure we meet the workplace needs of disabled staff and potential staff and recently DWP has run two pilot exercises on a revised process for delivering reasonable workplace adjustments for staff. The development of the new process was partly in response to the length of time it took to assess and put reasonable adjustments into place, and partly to ensure that the recommended adjustment was the most suitable for that individual. A third pilot is due to start shortly. This will be followed by a formal evaluation exercise. On completion of the first two pilots, and subject to the evaluation, we will commence planning for national implementation across the Department and agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/8">DWP encourages all business units to consider the potential impact of policy and services on all equality groups, ahead of future legislation. For example, at least three impact assessments have been completed to date by the Disability and Carers Service, taking into account disability, with a number of additional assessments in the process of being completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/9">The Department has been working in partnership with the Employers' Forum on Disability in order to address the needs of its disabled customers. In particular, it has contributed, along with other public and private organisations, to the interactive &quot;Disability Confident&quot; training resource pack which uses both video and DVD format. This addresses the key principles of dealing with disabled people in general, and particularly communications issues relating to those with specific impairments. This earned a special commendation in the prestigious 'World of Learning Awards'.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/10">Both the Minister for Disabled People and senior officials participate in an annual series of meetings with disabled customers and those with disability interests to explain current and planned policy, and to gain a better knowledge of people's views and concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/11">DWP consults with staff on disability issues through a National Disability Staff Network Group. The Department has recently reviewed all of the staff network groups with the intention of raising their profile and enabling them to contribute to successful diversity outcomes for the Department. Representatives from all of the groups have met with the recently appointed Permanent Secretary twice and he has committed to meet with them on a quarterly basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.2/12">DWP also analyses, and acts upon, staff perceptions on diversity issues in the annual staff attitude survey; and meets regularly with trade unions side to consider disability along with other diversity issues. In addition, staff can raise diversity issues at regular staff forum events held around the country and via a site on the DWP intranet.</p>

	<p pid="b.475W.2/1">The department has undertaken substantial in-house analysis to determine both the trends and the reasons for the change in the number of those claiming incapacity benefit for mental and behavioural disorders.</p>
	<p pid="b.475W.2/2">The rise in the number of people with mental and behavioural disorders claiming incapacity benefits mirrors a rise in the overall number of individuals in the population with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.475W.2/3">Claimants with mental and behavioural disorders as a primary diagnosis now make up an increasing proportion of the overall caseload accounting for almost 40 per cent. of the total caseload, compared with 25 per cent. in the mid 1990s; although growth in the proportion of the caseload with mental and behavioural disorders has been slowing in recent quarters. This is both because they make up an increasing proportion of inflows and because they have lower off-flow rates than other groups. It follows that, people with mental health conditions are, on average, much more likely to become long-term claimants.</p>

	<p pid="b.478W.3/1">Information on the Assets Recovery Agency's progress on completed cases and the value of realised receipts is shown in Tables 1 and 2. It is not possible to break down the Agency's figures further by region. The Agency is currently finalising its Annual Report 2005&ndash;06 which will set out progress in meeting its targets. The Report will be sent to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary who will lay it before Parliament. Information on the current performance of police forces, including Regional Asset Recovery Teams, in obtaining orders for the recovery of criminal assets is set out in Table 3. The regional teams are not part of the Assets Recovery Agency; they are funded separately by the Home Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.482W.2/1">The Government welcome the 2005 annual report of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), published in March 2006, and congratulates the IWF and their partners on their achievements. The IWF report an increase in the number of reports made to their hotline, from 17,255 in 2004 to 23,658 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.2/2">This resulted in 6,128 reports being made to law enforcement agencies and other national hotlines around the world. The report also highlights the fact that only 0.4 per cent. of potentially illegal child abuse content identified by the IWF in 2005 was hosted in the UK. This represents a major improvement from 18 per cent. in 1997, and demonstrates the commitment of the IWF, the UK industry, and others, to work collaboratively to remove potentially illegal child abuse content wherever in the world it originates. The IWF report that there were no instances of either criminally obscene content or criminally racist content hosted in the UK during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.2/3">The Government also pay tribute to the IWF for supplying a list of websites to ISPs, mobile operators, search providers and filtering companies so they can play their part in protecting UK internet users from being inadvertently exposed to potentially illegal child abuse content by various blocking techniques. The fact that the IWF's core funders have grown in number to over 60 is evidence of their strengthening reputation. The IWF is seen as a highly successful model of cooperation and one which other countries seek to learn from and replicate.</p>

There are also evidential assumptions at section 75 of the Act which, if proven, will mean that the complainant is taken not to have consented and these include the use and threat of violence and unlawful detention of the victim.

	<p pid="b.485W.2/2">There is no statutory definition of 'pornography' in UK legislation. Under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 it is a criminal offence to publish any article which is considered to be 'obscene': that is, an article, if its effect when taken as a whole, is such as to tend to 'deprave and corrupt' persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.2/3">In the Government's recent Consultation Paper on the Possession of Extreme Pornographic Material, material which is explicit and has been solely, or primarily produced for the purpose of sexual arousal is considered to be 'pornographic'. By explicit we mean material in which the activity can be clearly seen and is not hidden, disguised or implied. In terms of regulation, we consider the harm that any type of material (whether pornography, violence, portrayal of drugs use, etc.) is likely to cause to the vulnerable, particularly children.</p>

	<p pid="b.489W.3/1">The UK's project assistance priorities have been aligned with the spirit of the UN human rights recommendations in Colombia since the latter were first published in 2003. We also take into account UK Project Programme Priorities, other donors' activities in Colombia and areas where the UK can add particular value through experience or expertise. In Colombia, current priorities for UK project assistance include the protection of child rights, improvements in the rule of law, protection and promotion of freedom of expression and human rights defenders, security sector reform and conflict resolution. We aim to support sustainable institutional reform, as well as the most vulnerable communities in Colombia. The Department for International Development also supports non-governmental organisations' projects in Colombia on sustainable economic development for vulnerable communities, health and education, environment, strengthening civil society and projects to help reduce poverty and inequality.</p>
	<p pid="b.489W.3/2">The EU has long provided the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) office in Colombia with both political and financial support. The EU budget is currently supporting three projects that directly help respond to the needs highlighted in their recommendations, covering capacity building of state and municipal institutions responsible for human rights. Each year the EC delegation in Colombia review the UNHCHR's office's fresh recommendations in order to be able to adapt EU co-operation projects in general, especially in the human rights field.</p>

Following the flawed Presidential elections on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> the Belarusian regime has moved to crack-down on the opposition and to stifle any dissent. Demonstrations have been broken up and the main opposition leaders and their key supporters have been arrested or detained. The independent press remains muzzled or has been driven underground. Non-governmental organisations are subject to harassment and their funding severely curtailed.

	<p pid="b.491W.6/1">The UK believes the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the framework for nuclear disarmament. As relevant today as it was in 1965, the NPT offers the best hope of achieving a world free from nuclear weapons. That is why the UK has consistently worked to sustain the objectives and strengthen all three pillars of the treaty.</p>

	<p pid="b.515W.2/1">We expect public consultation on the national framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare to begin in the near future and will last for three months. It would be inappropriate to give any target date for publication of the final national framework until the consultation has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.2/2">The national framework will not change the existing legal basis for the provision of NHS Continuing Healthcare. Fully funded NHS Continuing Healthcare will continue to be provided for all those individuals whose primary need is a health need. This is based on an assessment of need and if individuals' needs have not changed there is no reason to expect them to lose their entitlement to NHS Continuing Healthcare. However, it would be inappropriate to give a guarantee that every individual would continue to receive NHS Continuing Healthcare after re-assessment if their needs have changed.</p>

The Government are also funding an additional 170 training places per year from 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.5/2">From April 2006, the NHS implemented major reforms to dentistry to build upon this success. New contracts for dentists have abolished the traditional fee per item remuneration system and support new ways of working with a greater focus on preventative care. Evidence from personal dental services pilot schemes is that these new ways of working free up significant capacity that dentists can then use in part to see a greater range of patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.519W.5/1">New disability equipment such as mobility aids, environmental controls, communication aids, posture management, pressure management and moving and handling systems which are classed as medical devices and have been placed on the European market since June 1998 are required to meet the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC. This directive is brought into United Kingdom law under the Medical Device Regulations 2002 (amended 2003). Such medical devices must carry the CE mark indicating conformity to the directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.519W.5/2">Before applying the CE mark the manufacturer must ensure that all risks are removed or minimised and any residual risks constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefit to the user and are compatible with a high level of protection of safety. If it is not possible to reduce these risks by means of inherently safe design or construction whilst providing benefit to the user then the manufacturer must inform users of the residual risks by means of labelling on the device and/or warnings contained in the user information.</p>
	<p pid="b.519W.5/3">On behalf of the Secretary of State for Health, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) acts as the competent authority for the UK Medical Device Regulations. The MHRA has a specialist unit covering all aspects of assistive technology which includes disability equipment. Proactive and reactive investigations involving medical devices including assistive technology are carried out. Where appropriate the MHRA also works with or refers cases to other regulatory bodies in the United Kingdom such as Trading Standards and also liaises as necessary with other competent authorities within Europe and also with the United States of America, Canada, and Australia.</p>
	<p pid="b.519W.5/4">The requirement for all medical devices placed on the market in the United Kingdom to carry an appropriate CE marking applies equally to products advertised on the internet, regardless of their country of origin. However, the regulation of the sale of medical devices available on the internet is more problematic than with sales from more conventional outlets. The MHRA advises the public to be wary when purchasing any medicinal or healthcare product from an unknown source, such as the internet, as it is not possible to guarantee the efficacy or safety of such items.</p>

I am aware that their performance regarding licence and variation approval times during the past months has been affected by a combination of adverse factors including increases in work load, difficulties in recruiting professional assessment staff, especially medically qualified staff, and transitional implementation problems during the introduction of a new information management system. The MHRA is taking a number of steps to improve service levels. These include organisational restructuring, additional recruitment, re-training of staff, voluntary schemes for extended working hours, and information system performance enhancements. The MHRA's new information management system will provide the potential for greater efficiency within the MHRA and also provide a number of additional benefits to the industry, such as the ability to make electronic applications, and track progress of outstanding applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.522W.2/14">The MHRA is committed to developing regulation which is proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted and is currently considering how unnecessary regulatory burdens, primarily in relation to over the counter (OTC) medicines, could be eased. To take this important initiative forward, the MHRA is leading the better regulation of OTC medicines initiative.

	<p pid="b.525W.0/3">The commissioning policy framework will be published in the summer of 2006. This work is being led by the Department's Policy and Strategy Directorate, with the support and advice of an external reference group drawn from a wide range of stakeholder and partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.0/4">PCTs are responsible for commissioning the choices offered at referral in consultation with patient groups. The Isle of Wight PCT has commissioned services from seven providers, four of which can be reached within approximately one hour 30 minutes travelling time. Some patients will need assistance with travel to hospital. PCTs are responsible for ensuring that there is provision of ambulance services (which could include patient transport services) to such extent as they consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. It is, therefore, for the local NHS to decide who provides patient transport services for eligible patients in their area. In addition, patients on a low income may be entitled to reimbursement of their travel costs under the hospital travel cost scheme. This applies to any of the hospitals on their PCT's choice menu.</p>

	<p pid="b.526W.3/1">Clause 29 of the Health Bill inserts two new sections, sections 72A and 72B, into the Medicines Act 1969 in relation to the responsible pharmacist. The Government believe that the general rule should be one responsible pharmacist, one pharmacy, if the responsible pharmacist is to discharge his or her responsibilities for the safe and effective running of the pharmacy. For the vast majority of pharmacies, we expect each to have its own responsible pharmacist. However, we also believe that there should be provision to consider any exception to this rule, where circumstances justify such an exception. Section 72A(2) provides for a pharmacist to be responsible for more than one pharmacy at any one time only in circumstances to be specified in regulations and where there is compliance with certain conditions set out in the regulations. Our intention is to consult, in due course, with all interested parties on what these circumstances and conditions might be.</p>

Once Ministers have considered the CMC's recommendations, the Government will publish a comprehensive action programme responding to the outstanding recommendations of the Shipman Inquiry and to the linked recommendations in the Ayling, Neale and Kerr-Haslem inquiries.</p>
