	<p pid="a.442W.6/1">The picture across the sector is mixed, but many organisations have performed excellently in tough economic conditions. London theatres demonstrated very positive returns for 2009, in large measure attributable to the excellent quality of the artistic product.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.6/2">There are concerns over a decrease in business investment and in income from charitable trusts and foundations. To mitigate this, Arts Council England's sustain fund has made awards totalling &#163;41 million to support 135 arts organisations through the recession. Government support including the Future Jobs Fund and funding for creative use of empty retail space, also supported by Arts Council Lottery funding, is significant in limiting the impact of this shortfall.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.6/3">Local authorities will determine funding priorities according to local circumstance but I am confident that enlightened councils will continue to support the arts in recognition of their value and importance to local communities across the country.</p>

In addition, local authorities have discretionary powers to disregard some or all of income from war pensions, including service attributable pensions, once the mandatory disregard of &#163;10.00 has been made. It is a matter for each authority to decide the extent to which they apply the additional disregard.

No public funding has been allocated to the Board.

	<p pid="a.459W.11/1">The Highways Agency has a comprehensive road resurfacing programme to reduce the potential for potholes and other surface defects but there is no doubt that the severity of the recent weather conditions has led to an increase in defects to the road surface. The Highways Agency is confident that the regime for identifying these defects and the resources necessary for undertaking repairs is sufficient to keep England's motorways and trunk roads in a safe and serviceable condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.11/2">There is no automatic right to compensation. The law makes it quite clear that highway authorities cannot be blamed for everything that happens on their roads and provided that they can demonstrate that they took all reasonable steps to ensure that the highway was safe, they will not be found negligent. Unfortunately, incidents do occur but very few are actually attributable to negligence on the part of the highway authority. The majority of claims brought against the Highways Agency are successfully defended.</p>

	<p pid="a.466W.2/1">The submarine dismantling project is considering possible sites for both the initial dismantling of out of service submarines and the interim storage of the resulting intermediate level radioactive waste. The analysis of the various options will take account of a wide range of factors, including the output from a strategic environmental assessment (SEA). The options analysis and the SEA will be key elements of the planned public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.2/2">Further analysis work is still required and, until public consultation is complete, no decisions will be taken on the sites for either submarine dismantling or waste storage. Public consultation is currently planned to take place during 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.482W.3/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The NHS Constitution contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18 weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and an NHS health check every five years for those aged 40 to 74 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Blaydon constituency. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/3">Figures for November 2009 show that in Gateshead primary care trust (PCT):</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/4" class="indent">96 per cent. of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/5" class="indent">98 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/6" class="indent">In September 2009, at Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust, 99 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/7" class="indent">Between September 2007 and September 2008, the number of consultants at Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust has increased from 101 to 114. Between September 2007 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 1,048 to 1,095.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/8" class="indent">Between September 2001 and September 2008, the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 within Gateshead PCT has increased from 62.8 to 77.7.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/9" class="indent">93.8 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/10" class="indent">Gateshead PCT opened its GP-led health centre in June 2009 in Blaydon. Blaydon GP led health clinic offers longer opening hours, meaning that any member of the public will be able to see a GP or nurse between 8 am and 8 pm, seven days a week, 365 days a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/11">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Blaydon will have also benefited from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/12" class="indent">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms, with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/13">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/14" class="indent">Subject to parliamentary approval, the &quot;Personal Care at Home Bill&quot; will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/15" class="indent">&quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together Green Paper&quot;, published in July 2009, sets out a vision of a National Care Service for all adults in England that is fair, simple and affordable.

	<p pid="a.482W.3/20" class="indent">Since 1998, there are now 2.4 million fewer smokers in England as a result of the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which has a measurable impact on reducing smoking prevalence.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.3/21" class="indent">Child obesity levels are reducing due to the efforts of families across England, supported by the Government's obesity strategy. In 2008, 13.9 per cent. of children (aged two to 10) in England were classified as obese, compared with 17.3 per cent. in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.5/5" class="indent">98 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/6" class="indent">In September 2009, at Northern Lincolnshire and Goole hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 98.8 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/7" class="indent">Between September 2002 and September 2008, the number of consultants at Northern Lincolnshire and Goole hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has increased from 120 to 141. Between September 2002 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 1,646 to 1,826.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/8" class="indent">Between September 2001 and September 2008, the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 within North East Lincolnshire PCT has increased from 55.9 to 62.6.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/9" class="indent">97.9 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to Northern Lincolnshire and Goole hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/10" class="indent">North East Lincolnshire CTP opened its GP-led health centre in July 2009 in Grimsby. Quayside Open Access Centre offers longer opening hours, meaning that any member of the public will be able to see a GP or nurse between 8 am and 8 pm, seven days a week, 365 days a year. It also has a partnership agreement with Open Door practice which provides a specialist service for patients unable to access traditional health and social care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/11" class="indent">A publicly funded &#163;12 million new women and children's unit opened at the Diana Princess of Wales hospital in February 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/12">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Cleethorpes will have also benefited from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/13" class="indent">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms, with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/14">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/15" class="indent">Subject to parliamentary approval, the &quot;Personal Care at Home Bill&quot; will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/16" class="indent">&quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together&quot; Green Paper, published in July 2009, sets out a vision of a National Care Service for all adults in England that is fair, simple and affordable. The Department has consulted widely on this reform and is currently analysing the responses, which will feed into a White Paper later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/17" class="indent">&quot;The National Carer's Strategy&quot;-Carers at the heart of 21<sup>(st)</sup> century families and communities-launched in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/18" class="indent">The first National Dementia Strategy was published in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/19" class="indent">&quot;Valuing People Now&quot;-a three year strategy for people with learning disabilities-was published in January 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/20" class="indent">&quot;New Horizons: A Shared Vision for Mental Health&quot; was launched in December 2009 to maintain improvements in mental health services, combined with a new cross-Government approach to promoting public mental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/21" class="indent">Since 1998, there are now 2.4 million fewer smokers in England as a result of the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which has a measurable impact on reducing smoking prevalence.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/22" class="indent">Child obesity levels are reducing due to the efforts of families across England, supported by the Government's obesity strategy. In 2008, 13.9 per cent. of children (aged two to 10) in England were classified as obese, compared with 17.3 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.5/23" class="indent">Overall, life expectancy at birth for men has increased from 74.5 years (1995-97 data) to 77.7 years (2006-08 data) while for women, life expectancy at birth has increased from 79.6 years (1995-97 data) to 81.9 years (2006-08 data).</p>

The MOJ has been reporting its performance to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) since November 2008. The performance reported to BIS covers the core Department and its agencies and does not distinguish between small and medium-sized enterprises and all creditors. To attempt to break the performance down further between SMEs and all creditors by Department and its agencies would incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.6/2">In the five months from November 2008 to March 2009, my Department's performance against the 10-day target ranged from 55 per cent. to 67 per cent. of all creditor invoices being paid within this timeframe. From April 2009 to December 2009 I am pleased to be able to report that performance has significantly improved ranging from 82 per cent. to 93 per cent. of all creditor invoices now being paid within 10 days. The payment processes operated across the MOJ and its agencies are now operating to a level of consistency that has seen the Prime Minister's target being achieved for the last four months of 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.494W.0/1">The drug treatment and testing order (DTTO), a community sentence aimed at breaking the link between drug misuse and offending, was rolled out to courts across England and Wales from October 2000, following successful pilots under the management of Merseyside, South-East London and Gloucestershire Probation Services from <phrase class="date" code="1998-10-01">1 October 1998</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-31">31 March 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.494W.0/2">From April 2005, the drug rehabilitation requirement (DRR) gradually replaced the DTTO as the primary means for adult offenders to address their drug misuse as part of a community order or suspended sentence order. The number of DTTOs and DRRs made in each probation area, including London, and across England and Wales in each year since 1998 is shown in the following table. It is not possible to provide data for each police force area. These figures have been drawn from administrative data systems which may be amended at any time.

	<p pid="a.498W.8/1">The Government implemented a range of measures in the Electoral Administration Act 2006 (EAA 2006), to encourage voter registration. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/2" class="indent">placing electoral registration officers (EROs) under a duty to take all necessary steps to maintain the electoral register, including sending the canvass form more than once, inspecting records that the ERO is allowed to inspect, and making house to house inquiries;</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/3" class="indent">establishing a funding mechanism to support novel and innovative projects and activities which EROs and returning officers take in line with their duty under section 69 of the EA Act to encourage electoral participation. The projects have used a variety of innovative methods aimed at encouraging people to register to vote;</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/4" class="indent">providing for the Electoral Commission to introduce a performance standards framework for EROs. The standards provide a framework within which the performance of EROs can be assessed, and targeted work undertaken to drive up performance where necessary. The first assessments against these standards were published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-21">21 April 2009</phrase> and are available on the Commission's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/5">I understand that the Electoral Commission is currently planning to run a voter registration campaign from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April</phrase>-<phrase class="date" code="2010-04-19">19 April</phrase> (1-<phrase class="date" code="2010-04-13">13 April</phrase> in Northern Ireland). If the general election is held on the same date as English local government elections on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May</phrase>, the campaign will coincide with the final few weeks to register to vote (registration deadline would be <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-20">20 April</phrase>). If the election is held after <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May</phrase>, the Commission will run a second burst of advertising in the days leading up to the registration deadline.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/6">The campaigns will be weighted to target under-registered groups including:</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/7" class="indent">Young people aged 16-24</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/8" class="indent">Recent home movers</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/9" class="indent">People living in privately rented accommodation</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/10" class="indent">Certain black and minority ethnic groups,</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/11" class="indent">Students</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/12">If the election is called earlier, the Commission will launch the campaign earlier, and have plans in place for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/13">The Electoral Commission has also made available a range of materials for local authorities to use in their own public awareness work in the run-up to the general election. These include advertisement templates and press release templates. The Electoral Commission's Do Politics site, which is used by local authorities in planning their public awareness work, has case studies of work that EROs have undertaken to encourage under-registered groups to participate in the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.8/14">The Government are also keen to find ways to enhance registration rates among service personnel to support their participation in the general election. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-26">26 January 2010</phrase>, a statutory instrument was laid in Parliament which extends the service voter declaration period from three to five years. This is intended to facilitate higher levels of registration among service personnel. In addition, since 2005, the Electoral Commission has worked in partnership with the Ministry of Defence on annual campaigns to provide information to armed forces personnel and their families about registration, voting and elections.</p>

Guidance is offered to the board by the Secretary of State's Directions and, procedurally, in the Parole Board Rules 2004, as amended by the Parole Board (Amendment) Rules 2009. In addition, the board provides its members with intensive training upon their appointment and at regular intervals during their appointment; and publishes internally, guidance on risk assessment and procedural issues.

	<p pid="a.504W.9/1">For a charity in England or Wales to amend its charitable objects, it would usually require the Charity Commission's consent or a legal scheme of the court or Charity Commission. The Charities Act 2006 has recently modernised charity law, including the process under which alterations can be made to charitable objects. It is important that mechanisms exist with appropriate safeguards which enable charities to amend their charitable objects either to keep pace with changes to the environment in which they operate, or to enable them to expand their charitable activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.9/2">A statutory review of the Charities Act 2006 is due to begin in 2011, and will report to Parliament. This will include examining the changes made by the Charities Act 2006 in relation to alterations to charitable purposes.</p>

Other figures showed that 12.5 per cent. of people of that age were economically active and so were in the labour force.

	<p pid="a.522W.2/3">The 1,700 surplus staff in these offices who have not yet found alternative posts are now eligible to be considered for voluntary redundancy on compulsory terms; the best terms available under the Civil Service Compensation Scheme. Individual financial entitlement is dependent upon pay, grade and time in service. Whether an individual decides to accept these terms is a personal decision for them to make; an average cannot be calculated until these decisions have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/4">HMRC remains committed to avoiding compulsory redundancies wherever possible and will make every effort to redeploy people who wish to remain in the Department.</p>

The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and no more and will not raise a single extra penny for Government. Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation.</p>

It is only fair to all ratepayers this is reflected in rate bills. The Government have put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>
