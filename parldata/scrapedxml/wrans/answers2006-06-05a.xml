	<p pid="a.121W.12/1">The Department currently has no plans to increase its audio description targets for digital television. The Communications Bill gives Ofcom a requirement to produce, publish and from time to time review, a Code relating to provision for the deaf and visually impaired and the means by which such services should be promoted. Ofcom are in the process of reviewing the code, and have suggested in their consultation that it would be better to review the statutory target for audio description when it is clearer how many potential beneficiaries will use it.</p>

It will be part of theTrust's role to secure and demonstrate continuing improvements in the BBC's efficiency, increasing the return provided by its commercial services and bearing down on the costs of proposed investments. The Government also welcome the proposal of the current Chairman of the BBC that the Trust should ask the NAO to consider the extent to which future &quot;self-help&quot; targets are being met and that the results of this work will also be reported to Parliament.</p>

This clear separation will be achieved through the distinct and different roles of the Trust and Executive Board. The Trust's overarching responsibility will be to represent the interests of the licence fee payer. The new system will also deliver effective oversight of the Executive Board's activities by the Trust, in the public interest; at the same time, it will prevent micro-management of the executive Board's activities by the Trust in a way that would distract from the Trust's strategic role.</p>

	<p pid="a.127W.5/2">The Gambling Act 2005 sets out the definitions of different types of gambling activity, and provides that it is a criminal offence to offer facilities for gambling without authorisation. It would be inappropriate for the Gambling Commission to duplicate these provisions through the introduction of licence conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.127W.5/3">The Commission does, however, have powers under section 79 of the Act to impose conditions on operators which relate to the manner, nature and circumstances of licensed activities (including lottery style betting games), should the Commission consider that there is a regulatory need to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.6/1">The Government believe that society lotteries and the National Lottery can co-exist happily. Both types of lottery play an important role in raising money for good causes, and it is our policy to ensure that appropriate and proportionate regulation applies in each case. Society lotteries are required to abide by strict limits on proceeds and prizes, currently up to&pound;2 million and &pound;200,000 respectively in any single lottery. We are supporting the work of society lotteries by introducing a range of deregulatory measures through the Gambling Act 2005, and by strengthening the protection for society lotteries from illegal lotteries that purport to be prize competitions in certain media outlets. The National Lottery continues to be regulated under separate legislation.</p>

The administrative merger is now effectively complete, though some minor costs will be incurred in effecting the legal merger, if the National Lottery Bill is passed. Savings of &pound;3.5 million a year on costs have already been achieved and overall the merger will lead to savings of 10 to 20 per cent. of pre-merger costs, which equates to around &pound;6 to &pound;12 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="a.139W.2/1">I am very pleased that the National Sports Foundation has made its first award. This was to the Lords Taverners for &pound;177,500, to support their excellent work to promote the growth of grass roots cricket through the provision of cricket equipment bags to junior cricketers. This funding, which will help ensure that we capitalise on the explosion of interest in cricket among our young people following last summer's Ashes series, was matched by a donation from the England and Wales Cricket Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.2/2">I understand that the Foundation is in continuing discussions with potential sponsors as well as sporting organisations and they are hopeful that further awards will be announced shortly.</p>
