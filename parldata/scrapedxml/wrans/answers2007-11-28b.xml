	<p pid="b.437W.6/4">The listed places of worship grant scheme, which makes grants equivalent to the VAT incurred in making repairs to listed buildings in use for worship, will continue to operate until March 2011, unless a permanent reduced VAT rate for such repairs is agreed by the European Commission in the interim. Under this scheme, all eligible applications are met, and the funding made available will depend on the number of applications made.</p>

This enabled the Department to move most staff from existing outlying properties into the single building which had been refurbished. The Department has closed two outlying properties plus additional floors in its two other remaining properties.

	<p pid="b.446W.5/3">My right hon. Friend, the Prime Minister's statement mentioned two specific projects which will build on the measures already in place to protect the rail and underground networks from terrorist attacks: passenger screening and physical protection against vehicle bomb attacks.</p>
	<p pid="b.446W.5/4" class="italic"> Passenger Screening</p>
	<p pid="b.446W.5/5">Last year, the Department for Transport undertook a number of trials at London Underground and National Rail stations, to test the effectiveness of passenger screening equipment and explosives sniffer dogs in an operational environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.446W.5/6">The department is planning with the British Transport Police (BTP) and other stakeholders how we might increase and improve the screening of passengers and bags, in the light of the evidence from these trials and elsewhere. The aim of such passenger screening would be threefold: deterrence, detection and public reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.446W.5/7">We anticipate that this would involve the flexible deployment of dogs and/or portable screening equipment by BTP across the rail network, with a focus on the busiest stations, both overground and London Underground. The exact locations and timing of these deployments would be an operational decision for the British Transport Police.</p>
	<p pid="b.446W.5/8" class="italic"> Physical protection of stations</p>
	<p pid="b.446W.5/9">There are already security measures in place at major railway stations to control normal vehicle access, such as deliveries and staff parking.</p>
	<p pid="b.446W.5/10">Permanent physical vehicle restraints have been installed at the recently-refurbished St. Pancras International station, from which Eurostar now operates. There are agreements in place for similar measures at other key overground and London Underground stations that will be undergoing major redevelopments as part of 'designing in' security. For other significant stations, programmes of work are under active consideration.</p>

	<p pid="b.447W.2/1">The Government have asked the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership to carry out a feasibility study into a possible sustainability labelling scheme for biofuels. The work is under way and we will publish our findings as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/2">The rapidly increasing global demand for palm oil and other agricultural commodities for use in the food and other sectors has a number of environmental and social consequences. The biofuel sector currently accounts for a very small fraction of total global demand for these products. Current high cereals prices are due to global factors, including two successive lower world wheat harvests, low global stocks and increased demand for cereals from the food, feed and fuels sectors. Growing global demand for biofuels can be expected to increase crop prices but also the supply of crops in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/3">The Government take very seriously the potential risks associated with unsustainable biofuel production, including deforestation, reduction of biodiversity and any more particular threats to endangered species. We have developed a comprehensive carbon and sustainability reporting mechanism as an integral part of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) which is due to come into effect in April 2008. This is designed to encourage transport fuel suppliers to ensure the sustainability of their biofuels. We are also pressing the European Commission to introduce a robust mandatory sustainability framework for biofuels as a part of its forthcoming Renewable Energy Directive. We have said that we will not support any higher targets for future biofuel use until we are satisfied that effective sustainability standards are in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/4">From April 2008, we will ask the Renewable Fuels Agency to report on a quarterly basis on the sustainability impacts of the RTFO. This will allow us to monitor very closely any adverse impacts of biofuel production. The Government will monitor how markets are affected by growing biofuel demand and will tailor policies accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="b.448W.2/1">Before announcing in November 2005 that it would introduce a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), the Government carried out extensive public consultation and a detailed feasibility study into the practicality, as well as the likely costs and benefits, of such a scheme. Copies of the study were placed in the House Libraries, and are available via the Department's website:</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.448W.2/3">As part of the feasibility study, the Government commissioned various reports from experts, including on whether and how greenhouse gas and broader environmental and social assurance schemes should be linked to an RTFO. The Government also took into account a wide range of scientific evidence on the costs and benefits of biofuels as part of the development of policy on the RTFO. This included Government-funded studies by Sheffield Hallam university and the Central Science Laboratory considering the lifecycle benefits and impacts of biofuels. Research published by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in association with the European Council for Automotive Research and Development (EUCAR) and the Oil Companies' European Organisation for Environment, Health and Safety (CONCAWE)) on biofuels and other potential future transport fuels was also taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.2/4">The Government will continue to take into account new scientific evidence on the impacts of biofuels as it becomes available, and will continue to tailor their biofuel policies accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="b.453W.2/1">The role of defence attach&eacute;s is principally to promote the Government's policies in the area of international security co-operation and to give support to current or potential UK operational commitments. Therefore, most defence attach&eacute;s spend a small proportion of time dealing with defence exports. There are separate staff employed in UK embassies to promote defence exports, where it is necessary. We do not expect an adverse impact on defence sales arising from the redeployment of defence attach&eacute;s.</p>

	<p pid="b.456W.8/1">The following table provides information on neonatal, infant and under-five mortality rates in all the states of Sudan in 2006. Child mortality rates tend to be highest in the Three Area region (specifically South Kordofan and blue Nile) and Southern states, reflecting the poor coverage of maternal and other health care services in these states. Despite the conflict in Darfur, child mortality rates in Darfur states tend to be below the average in Sudan, although this is not the case for West Darfur. This is due to the extensive provision of healthcare services by humanitarian agencies. Post neo-natal and infant mortality rates are also higher for females than males.</p>

There has thus been no operational reason coming from within his own Department for the Treasury Solicitor to collate and monitor these payments. As there has been no call from client departments to produce figures, the Treasury Solicitor has not been able to justify the commitment of public funds to that end. For this reason, the figures requested are not held by the Treasury Solicitor's Department in the form requested and to attempt to gather them now could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

The research concluded that random MDT provides a good measure of drug misuse in prisons over time. It also suggested that more reception MDT on entry to the prison system might be a better way of detecting and directing users into treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/2">Prisons have discretion to use reception MDT for one of two reasons&mdash;to assess the drug misuse problem (and identify need) coming in from both new receptions and prison transfers or to send out a clear message that drug misuse will not be tolerated. So far in 2007-08, 66 prisons have undertaken a degree of reception MDT. However, all local prisons undertake clinical health assessments on reception and indicative drug testing plays an important part in that process. Those declaring a drug problem at the point of their reception may be asked to provide a sample for a drug screen. The result of this clinical drug test is available immediately and is used as part of a clinical substance misuse assessment, prior to the commencement of any prescribed treatment for the management of drug misuse. Not everyone with a drug problem will test positive for drugs on reception into prison. A full clinical assessment therefore is much more effective and immediate in identifying drug treatment need than on-reception MDT.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/3">MDT is a proportionate response to the threat posed by drugs within prisons and hence compatible with human rights legislation. The particular problems arising from misuse of drugs within prisons include disorder and violence, risks to health, and the intimidation and bullying of prisoners and their families to supply drugs. This undermines the rights and freedoms of those prisoners who wish to stay away from drugs. The National Offender Management Service has a duty of care to those held in custody. The extent of MDT undertaken within a prison must be maintained at a level proportionate to the problem experienced with drugs. Prisoners must not be subjected needlessly to drug tests. MDT is compatible with the Human Rights Act as long as it is proportionate and carried out in accordance with the policy and procedures laid down in Prison Service Order 3601. Despite some attempts by prisoners to challenge MDT at the European Court of Human Rights, none has progressed beyond the admissibility stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.503W.8/1">We have recognised that nanotechnology underpins a number of key technology areas where the UK has a strong industrial base, including in the areas of advanced materials, bioscience and healthcare, electronics, and advanced manufacturing. The Technology Strategy Board is currently reviewing its strategies for these technology areas as well as for emerging technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.8/2">DTI funded two public engagement activities, Nanodialogues and the Nanotechnology Engagement Group (NEG), the final reports of which were launched in June 2007. The cross-Departmental Nanotechnology Research Coordination Group (NRCG) is evaluating the findings from that work to determine what further public engagement is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.8/3">DIUS and GO-Science are also taking forward the activities begun by the DTI to gain expert, stakeholder and public views on future scenarios for science and technology development, including elements related to nanotechnology. The results of this work are now being assessed with a view to prioritising areas for future public engagement work.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.8/4">Additionally, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) is implementing a programme in nanoscience through engineering to application, in order to build on the platform of earlier investments and to realise the benefits of the technology for society and the economy. The programme has identified doctoral training centres as a key way of enhancing the skills base in this area. EPSRC is also in the process of changing its collaborative training accounts into knowledge transfer accounts and it is possible that these will support training in the nanotechnology area aimed at users.</p>

	<p pid="b.508W.2/1">No suitable, inactivated vaccines are currently available for bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8), the strain of bluetongue currently in circulation in the east and south-east of England.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.2/2">However, we are aware of at least three vaccine companies which have a BTV-8 vaccine in development. Production at one of those companies, Merial at Pirbright, was temporarily halted after tests revealed a possible link between the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak and Pirbright, and the use of live virus at Merial was suspended. Following detailed inspections at the site, we are now satisfied that they have in place all the necessary measures to ensure strict biosecurity throughout the site. On <phrase class="date" code="">6 November</phrase>, we permitted Merial to begin using FMD and bluetongue viruses for vaccine production at the site. However, this has not prevented Merial from continuing development of vaccine as their Pirbright site is primarily a production, rather than research, facility; Merial conduct the majority of their research elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>, my Department issued a tender to all three companies to supply between 10 and 20 million doses of vaccine. This tender closed on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase> and an order will be placed as soon as possible, once we have fully assessed the bids submitted. This should ensure that a vaccine will be available for use by next summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.2/4">In keeping with the principles set out in the Bluetongue Control Strategy, which was developed in partnership with the farming industry, livestock keepers will be offered the opportunity to purchase vaccine from the bank. Once a decision on the order has been made, we will provide an estimate of the cost of the vaccine and other associated costs to livestock keepers.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.2/5">The BTV-8 vaccine we have tendered for will not offer any cross-protection against the other 23 bluetongue serotypes. Currently, there are suitable, inactivated vaccines available for bluetongue serotypes 1, 2 and 4. Live attenuated vaccines are available for other serotypes but there are significant potential risks associated with their use; so they would therefore not normally be considered as an initial control measure, in line with our policy of disease containment.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.2/6">We are developing a detailed plan with bluetongue scientific experts, representatives of the farming industry and others as to how a vaccination programme would work. Discussions are also taking place with the European Commission and other member states about possible approaches to vaccination.</p>

	<p pid="b.510W.8/2">Comments from the UK government on the draft text of the IPCC Synthesis Report of the 4th Assessment Report were sent to the IPCC prior to the meeting as part of the IPCC's consultation process.</p>

	<p pid="b.510W.8/4">The report shows unequivocally that the climate is warming and that humans are largely responsible for recent climate change. Climate change will continue to grow and its impacts are projected to become increasingly severe over the coming century if we do not take urgent and sustained action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The report shows that technologies already exist to make such deep cuts in emissions and that this can be done at a modest cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.8/5">The report is highly relevant and timely. It is a clear call for urgent international action. We hope it will be given full and detailed consideration next week in Bali, when formal negotiations will be launched to achieve a global agreement to tackle climate change by 2009.</p>

Budget 2007 announced that the Government would review the classes of equipment that qualified for enhanced capital allowances (EGAs) for 'good quality' combined heat and power (CHP) schemes to ensure that all the equipment necessary for CHP schemes to utilise SRF was included. The review of the equipment list is now complete and an order will be laid before Parliament shortly revising the energy technology criteria list within the CHP scheme arrangements. Further information will be available shortly from the EGA programme or HM Revenue and Customs websites.</p>

This has led to a significant increase in the volume of such data being received for processing by the Marine Fisheries Agency (MFA) during 2006. New procedures have been introduced and resources within the MFA have been reallocated to help deal with this increased workload while ensuring that the key performance target continues to be met.</p>

	<p pid="b.514W.2/2">In line with the latest scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the UK is proposing a modest increase of 15 per cent. in the North sea cod total allowable catch (TAG) for 2008. We believe this will reduce the scale of discarding, while the days at sea limitations under the EU's cod recovery plan will ensure that there is no additional targeting of the stock.</p>
	<p pid="b.514W.2/3">At the same time, the Government are developing with the UK industry a series of alternative measures designed to reduce fishing mortality. These include the piloting of a real-time closure mechanism in Scottish waters, where vessels are required to move grounds if the proportion of smaller fish in the catch exceeds a pre-determined maximum. Additionally, more selective fishing practices, developed in consultation with the fishing industry, are being commercially trialled with a view to more widespread application if successful.</p>

	<p pid="b.515W.5/2">We are acutely aware of the difficulties facing the industry at this time. Compensation is paid at the market value for animals and goods, which are seized and destroyed for disease control purposes. However, it is a long established principle that the Government do not meet the costs of consequential losses, which must be borne instead by the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.5/3">To help the industry at this difficult time, we announced on <phrase class="date" code="">8 October</phrase> a package of assistance worth &pound;12.5 million. This is to support those livestock farmers most severely affected by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD), including those in the restriction areas and hill farmers. Support has also been included for meat promotion and farming charities, and this will benefit all farmers. The process of implementing the support package is well under way and some elements have almost been completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.5/4">The most effective and sustainable way to improve the position for farmers is a speedy resumption of exports. A new European Commission Decision this week will allow much of Britain to start exporting meat again under normal community rules, and with appropriate certification. We are doing all we can to obtain FMD free status at the earliest possible date in January.</p>

	<p pid="b.520W.5/1">I announced a new UK list of priority species and habitats on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-28">28 August 2007</phrase>. Action plans for many of these, such as the otter and lowland heathland, have already been in place for a number of years which has resulted in significant recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.5/2">The development of action plans for new priority habitats is a devolved matter and each country will carry this out to their own timetable. However, recent discussions between the countries indicate that Habitat Groups and lead partners will be appointed during 2008, with the preparation of objectives/targets by early 2009 and the completion of habitat management guidance (to take account of relevant species needs) by the end of April 2009. Implementation of the existing priority habitat action plans will continue in parallel with this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.5/3">Baseline information on the status of the priority species and habitats was taken from experts to show the degree of threat and rate of decline in habitats and species in the UK to substantiate the listing. Good information was available for some, but for others, it was more limited. Information gaps will be addressed through a UK surveillance strategy being developed by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Experts also provided information on the importance of the species and habitats from an international perspective.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.5/4">The next reporting round under the Biodiversity Action Plan will take place in late 2008 and will assess progress on the original list of priority species and habitats. Subsequent rounds will report progress on the new list and we will need to consider with the devolved administrations how UK progress is to be assessed in the light of deliberations currently being undertaken at the country level.</p>
	<p pid="b.520W.5/5">Not all species will need discrete plans as the UK Biodiversity Partnership is adopting the ecosystem approach which focuses on causes rather than symptoms. There is no specified timetable for the completion of the action plans but experts across the UK Biodiversity Partnership are already being consulted on which species would require individual management action and which would benefit from collective action. Natural England, as lead delivery body in England, will then prioritise the species found in England and identify lead partners where appropriate. Similar arrangements are being put in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with joint working between countries where this will assist in securing conservation benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.523W.2/1">The Government's aim is to work in partnership with the Overseas Territory Governments to assist them in achieving, among other things, the objectives set out in individual Overseas Territories Environment Charters. In doing so the Government provide access to funding to improve species conservation from a variety of sources, for example: the Overseas Territories Environment Programme (OTEP), jointly managed by the FCO and DFID; the Darwin Initiative; the International Sustainable Development Fund (ISDF); the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP); and the Flagship Species Fund, administered by Fauna and Flora International, but supported by DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.523W.2/2">On non-native invasive species, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation, has undertaken a review of non-native species in the UK Overseas Territories. This review is being used to guide various projects relating to invasive species in Overseas Territories. In June 2007 JNCC also hosted a workshop on invasive species in the Overseas Territories bringing together a range of stakeholders to share information, and to discuss future collaboration in this area of work.</p>
	<p pid="b.523W.2/3">Elsewhere, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, (a DEFRA sponsored body) has undertaken a number of separate initiatives, including a programme of seed collecting initiated in four Territories (British Virgin Islands, St. Helena, Ascension and Falkland Islands), and DMA banking of the Flora of South Georgia.</p>

With regard to marine turtles, in 2001 DEFRA and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) jointly commissioned the Marine Turtle Research Group (MTRG) to undertake a research project on the Status and Exploitation of Marine Turtles in the UK Caribbean Overseas Territories (TCOT). The resultant report, published in 2004, outlines the diversity of legislation relating to the protection, harvest and sale of marine turtles.</p>
	<p pid="b.523W.5/2">In relation to the British Indian Ocean Territory, the UK is a signatory to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of Marine Turtles in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (IOSEA). The MoU puts in place a framework through which States of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asian region, as well as other concerned States, can work together to conserve and replenish depleted marine turtle populations for which they share responsibility. Since 2002 the Government have provided voluntary contributions totalling around &pound;150,000 to fund projects that fall under the MoU.</p>

	<p pid="b.525W.2/1">The Government have no current plans for a plastic bags tax, although the Chancellor keeps all taxes under review. Any decision on a levy on plastic bags would be for the Treasury to make.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/2">We are interested in reducing the environmental impact of all single-use carrier bags, not just plastic bags. The Waste Strategy for England 2007, launched in May, aims to make single-use carrier bags a thing of the past, and we are actively working on the best ways to achieve this objective.</p>

I announced more detailed proposals on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>, which for the first time, will allow approved authorities to recognise more effectively the efforts of those householders who reduce, reuse and recycle their waste, and provide an incentive to those who currently do not.</p>
	<p pid="b.529W.2/3">A maximum of five local authorities will be able to pilot schemes and councils will be able to come forward with their own plans to fit local circumstances, for approval by the Secretary of State. This approach will allow us to monitor the impacts of incentives in England and report back to Parliament before a decision is made as to whether to roll this power out more widely.</p>

	<p pid="b.530W.2/1">Market values for recovered materials depend on the supply and demand conditions in end-use markets (which may be overseas) as well as factors including volume, the price of substitute materials (including virgin materials), energy prices and other commodity prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/2">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) produces a monthly Materials Pricing Report, available on its website, which focuses on prices for recovered materials. This indicates that higher prices are achieved for materials which have been effectively sorted into economically valuable components. For example, the market value of recycled aluminium cans is around &pound;700-&pound;750 per tonne compared to &pound;150 per tonne for mixed cans.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/3">WRAP's advice is that, at the present time, kerbside sorting delivers better quality materials to the marketplace and with lower levels of contamination compared to co-mingled collections of recyclables. This improved quality may not currently be reflected in market prices. However an advantage of kerbside sorting is that the benefits from the sale of materials tend to accrue directly to the local authority selling the materials while co-mingled schemes involve the payment of gate fees for additional sorting.</p>

	<p pid="b.531W.3/1">Since 2000 the UK has committed around &pound;500,000 to tiger conservation. This is through our membership of the Global Tiger Forum, where we are the only non range state member, and through support to '21st Century Tiger', which is a wild tiger conservation partnership between the Zoological Society of London and Global Tiger Patrol.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.3/2">In addition, the Government funded and organised a wildlife crime workshop in India in 2006 in support of the UK-India Sustainable Development Dialogue. Law enforcement officers and conservationists from the UK and India identified poaching and illegal trade as a major cause of the sharp drop in tiger numbers. The workshop recommended that each state government draw up and implement an action plan to end poaching through better surveillance and imposition of tough penalties. To assist in this process the Government have provided financial assistance to the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) to conduct a series of training and capacity building sessions to officials from state forest departments, police and customs. Around 270 officials have been trained on issues in relation to trade in endangered species, such as the tiger.</p>

	<p pid="b.538W.8/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-28">28 November 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question on economic activity and the labour market in the Peterborough parliamentary constituency. (168765)</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/4" class="indent">Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the main summary indicator of economic activity in the UK. Because data collection, estimation and reporting are not structured according to demographic groups, the national accounts framework does not however make it possible to identify the direct contribution of immigrants to the measured levels of economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics for labour supply indicators for local areas from the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/6" class="indent">The data for analysing migrant workers comes from the above surveys. The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women), and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/7" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important also to bear in mind that the LFS and APS are not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/8" class="indent">The annual LFS and APS estimates at this detailed level are only available consistent with the UK population estimates published in February and March 2003 and are not comparable with the estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase>, which are based on latest population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/9" class="indent">The table attached, shows fie numbers of employed, unemployed and economically active persons of working age who were not born in the UK and were resident in Peterborough constituency, for the twelve month periods ending in February for 2001 to 2004 from the annual LFS, and for the twelve month periods ending in March 2005, March 2006 and December 2006 from the APS (the January to December 2006 APS dataset is the most recent for which information on country of birth is currently available). The table also shows the numbers of non-UK born economically active persons as percentages of all economically active persons of working age, in the area. Data on country of birth are not available on annual LFS datasets before 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/10" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. Estimates of change over time should be treated with particular caution.</p>

	<p pid="b.541W.0/1">The Government's forecast for North sea tax revenues take into account an assessment of the expected impact of decommissioning. Overall estimates of the cost of decommissioning vary, however the eventual monetary and tax cost is likely to be significant. This will in due course give rise to a downward impact on North sea revenues. However the impact of this will be spread over a large number of years and with the significant remaining potential of the North sea the UK will continue to benefit from our national natural resources for a considerable time.</p>

	<p pid="b.544W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">26 November 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.544W.5/2"><i> </i>In December 2001 the Department published the &quot;Diabetes National Service Framework&quot; (NSF). This set out 12 National Standards for diabetes in the areas of prevention, identification, education and treatment and was put in place to raise the quality of services for people with diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.5/3">The standards were followed by the &quot;National Service Framework: Delivery Strategy&quot;. Published in January 2003, the Delivery Strategy provides a vision of what services should be in place by 2013, and what steps will be necessary to deliver those services.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.5/4">The national diabetes support team (NDST) was established in 2003. This has been a successful mechanism for the delivery of the NSF, providing support to local services through its regional programme managers and developing tools and resources that can be used nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.5/5">Dr. Sue Roberts was appointed national clinical director to lead on implementation of the National Service Framework. Dr. Roberts works closely with colleagues in the Department and the NDST to spread good practice and provide professional leadership at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.5/6">The introduction of the new Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) as part of the general practitioner contract had led to the diagnosis of around 200,000 extra people in the last two years. This means that these people are now able to access the care, advice and treatment they need to enable them to manage their diabetes more effectively and reduce their risk of complications. The QOF also measures achievement of key clinical indicators for people with diabetes, such as HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This has also shown improvements in the management of diabetes over the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.5/7">The Department works together with the NDST and other organisations such as Diabetes UK to provide the national health service with tools and guidance to support them in improving local services for people with diabetes. This includes a Diabetes Commissioning Toolkit, care planning guidance and a report on improving services for children and young people with diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.5/8">Patient education is key to empowering people with diabetes to be partners in their own care. The number of sites offering good quality structured education is increasing, but the 2007 &quot;Healthcare Commission survey of people with diabetes&quot; showed that only 11 per cent., of people with diabetes have accessed patient education. We are supporting the spread of these programmes through our patient education guidance, which outlines the elements necessary for developing high-quality patient education programmes and highlights best practice to enable local services to meet the recommendations in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance and NSF.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.5/9">The fourth NSF progress report &quot;The Way Ahead: The Local Challenge&quot; was published in March 2007 and highlights progress made in the four years following the publication of the delivery strategy. The report highlights the progress that frontline NHS staff have made in improving diabetes services, and provides examples of best practice. A copy has been placed in the Library and is also available at:</p>

It is for local health commissioners, both primary care trusts and practice-based commissioners, to determine which local services - including services provided by GPs with a special interest will best meet the needs of their local populations within the resources available to them, and to fund these services accordingly. The development of GPs with special interests has expanded the range of options available to local commissioners.</p>

Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i> Data Quality</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Main Operation</i> The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for 'all operations' count of episodes give a more complete count of episodes with an operation. OPCS 4.2 codes used: W37,W38,W39,W46,W47,W48<br/> <i> Time Waited (days)</i> Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension. <i> Source:</i> (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.558W.5/1">The current listing of stoma and incontinence appliances in part IX of the Drug Tariff is very broad.</p>
	<p pid="b.558W.5/2">The November 2006 consultation set out proposals which classified the 5,000 plus stoma and incontinence items into 288 sub-categories of appliances deemed by healthcare professionals to meet similar medical need.</p>
	<p pid="b.558W.5/3">Responses were reviewed by representatives from the original group of healthcare professionals and a wider group. This allowed two groups of specialists to be set up: one to review urology items and one to review stoma. As part of the review process, the panels again considered whether items met similar medical need&mdash;and product features such as size and material.</p>
	<p pid="b.558W.5/4">Based on the recommendations from these healthcare professionals, the Department now proposes that there should be 228 sub-categories of items as opposed to the 288 that were consulted on in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.558W.5/5">The cost of the review is part of the Department's ongoing operational budget. Deloitte are acting as advisors to the Department on this review.

	<p pid="b.562W.5/2">There are 23 fixed site wave 1 independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) in operation and six walk-in centres with a commuter focus. There is also a mobile ophthalmology service, a mobile MRI scanning service and a chlamydia screening service in Greater London for 16 to 24-year-olds. Five phase 2 ISTC schemes are operational, three offering elective procedures and two offering diagnostics. This includes the West Midlands diagnostics scheme which will stop providing services in February 2008. Through phase 2, services are currently being delivered through 103 fixed and mobile sites (including interim site solutions) and it is expected that an additional 13 sites will come on-stream in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="b.562W.5/3">Three phase 2 schemes have been approved to move to financial close and a further seven are in procurement. Services are expected to be delivered from a number of sites, which provide greater accessibility for patients, through phase 2 schemes in procurement. As part of the mobilisation process, through wave one there are two ISTC sites and through phase 2 there are three ISTC sites which are currently under construction.</p>
	<p pid="b.562W.5/4">At the end of October 2007, the cost of the procurement of wave 1 and phase 2 was approximately &pound;157 million including all assessment, scoping, procurement and associated management, professional advisory and support costs. This figure includes the cost incurred during 2007-08 (to date) of &pound;11 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.562W.5/5">The Department will conclude decisions on the remaining schemes by the end of March 2008. At this stage, in terms of year by year spend in establishing (procuring, mobilising and managing) the phase 2 ISTCs schemes in procurement, it is not possible to break down the costs further, as budgets have not been agreed for coming years.</p>
	<p pid="b.562W.5/6">The Department will work with preferred bidders in a systematic way to consider any compensation claims that may be brought on a case by case basis, with regard to withdrawn schemes. No specific funds are allocated for this, however, the overall budget does include general contingencies for unforeseen events.</p>

	<p pid="b.565W.2/2">The Department has not quantified the amount of medicines classified as waste in 2006 nor assessed the potential contribution of medicines packaging design to drugs wastage. However, we have recently invited organisations to submit outline proposals on how to investigate the scale, costs and causes of medicines wastage.</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.2/3">The Department has not issued guidance to general practitioners on over-prescribing. However, primary care trusts employ prescribing advisers, often pharmacists, to encourage and secure rational and cost-effective prescribing and provide a source of advice and support for prescribers in their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.2/4">The new contractual framework for community pharmacy supports a range of initiatives to help patients get the most from their medicines and reduce the amount of medicines wasted. Repeat dispensing is an essential service provided by all community pharmacies in England which allows prescriptions to be dispensed in instalments. Before dispensing the next instalment, the pharmacist must check with the patient that it is still needed. Medicines use reviews, an advanced service provided by accredited pharmacists in accredited premises and locally commissioned pharmacist-led full clinical medication reviews should also help to identify medicines that may no longer be required but they may also identify additional treatments that may be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.2/5">There is no legal limit for how many times a repeat prescription can be issued for a given medication before a patient review must take place. This is a decision for the prescriber to make in conjunction with their patient.</p>
