It is a priority in our departmental business plan to support and develop farming to build capacity for sustainable production both in the UK and globally, which will help our food supply be resilient to shocks and crises.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.6/3">International trade also has an important role in providing food security. We are a trading nation in a global market and the UK is a significant exporter of wheat, lamb, dairy products and breakfast cereals. Our own food security depends on access to the world market; and our domestic food industry needs to be able to compete on the world stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.942W.2/1">The dispatch of the majority of live animals by post is prohibited by both animal welfare legislation and post operator guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.2/2">Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 it is an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal that is under the control of man or for an owner or keeper to fail to provide for an animal&#8217;s welfare needs. Ultimately it would be for a court to decide, but it is realistic to assume that sending a tortoise through the post without taking appropriate care to secure the health and welfare of the animal, would be an offence under the 2006 Act. The maximum penalty under the 2006 Act for causing unnecessary suffering is a fine of &#163;20,000, or six months imprisonment, or both.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.2/3">Royal Mail and Parcelforce do not carry live animals. Many courier companies that do their own hand deliveries also operate a total ban on the transport of live animals. Any postal operator or courier that does transport live animals needs to comply with EU welfare during transport legislation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005). The regulation is implemented in England by the Welfare of Animals (Transport) (England) Order 2006 (WATEO) and by parallel legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.2/4">It is an offence under this legislation to transport animals or cause animals to be transported in a way likely to cause, injury or unnecessary suffering to that animal. Animals must be transported in a receptacle or means of transport that has appropriate space, ventilation, temperature, security, liquid and oxygen for the species concerned. Primary responsibility for enforcement of welfare during transport legislation rests with local authorities. Transporters found to be in breach of Regulation 1/2005 or WATEO could be subject to enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.2/5">All tortoises are covered by the convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES) and as such commercial trade would generally be subject to a strict licensing system except where that trade is within the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.2/6">Local Government Regulation (formerly LACORS) produced an overview in 2008 of the rules relating to the dispatch of living creatures by post. This can be seen at:</p>

	<p pid="a.945W.9/1">It is important that children and young people from across the UK are actively encouraged to participate in the wide range of opportunities created by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.9/2">Over 17,000 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games' (LOCOG) education programme Get Set.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.9/3">It is hoped that the majority of primary and secondary schools will be signed up to Get Set over the next few months, and use its resources to ensure London 2012 is championed in and around our schools. Currently 27 schools in Carmarthen are registered with Get Set and 22 schools in Pembrokeshire have also registered. &#8216;Young Ambassadors&#8217; is a London 2012 programme managed by Youth Sport Trust with the London 2012 Inspire mark for education. It involves young people being recruited to be ambassadors, working in their schools and communities to champion sport and the values of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. There are ambassadors for Carmarthenshire who act as role models and use the power of London 2012 to inspire other young people to choose sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.9/4">Pupils from Ysgol Tre-gib, Carmarthenshire, (supported by Cold YA Emyr Jones) entered a competition on Get Set to design their ideal break time activity. They were selected to represent Wales at the UK final in June 2011. Schools in Glanymor and Amman Valley, Carmarthenshire, are working on the &#8216;International Inspiration&#8217; project.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.9/5">A Sport Pembrokeshire and Pembrokeshire Leisure working group have created an agreed &#8216;Olympic Legacy&#8217; action plan which outlines several projects which will aim to inspire young people to participate in sport. One of the projects which received &#163;1.67 million of part funding from the Legacy Trust is The Power of the Flame, designed to use the 2012 games as a catalyst to inspire young people to achieve their very best in their chosen field. It embraces Wales's unique heritage sites, the history of sportsmen and women, disabled young artists, and Eisteddfodic traditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.9/6">Two Cauldrons and Furnaces events taking place in Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire during 2012 will involve 1,870 young people; and the Laugharne project which will involve 870 primary and secondary school children.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.9/7">In addition, I launched the &#8216;Places People Play&#8217; programme, which will bring sporting legacy to life in communities across the country. This will be achieved by transforming the places where people play sport, inspiring all to make sport happen at a local level and creating sporting opportunities that give everyone the chance to become part of the mass participation legacy.

	<p pid="a.948W.2/1">The selection of Work Programme prime providers was conducted in a fair and open competition, which attracted 177 bids from 30 organisations. Seven bids were received for the two contracts covering Scotland. Although there is disappointment that the Wise Group did not win a contract, the Government recognise the contribution the Wise Group can make and has highlighted this to the preferred bidders for Scotland. As a framework provider, we expect the Wise Group to be in a good position to take advantage of any further commercial opportunities that arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.948W.8/1">The oil and gas sector has benefited from significantly higher prices than anticipated by the industry. Pre-tax profits in 2011 are forecast to be &#163;24 billion, and up 50% in two years, so it is fair that companies make an extra contribution at this time. The tax will fall in a staged and affordable way if the oil price falls below a pre-set trigger price on a sustained basis. We will continue to discuss measures with the industry, including field allowances to encourage ongoing investment in more marginal fields. Overall, we do not expect this change to have a significant impact on investment or production in the coming years. Average post-tax profits per barrel will be higher in the next five years than the last five.</p>

This information should be treated with some caution because the &#8220;Other personal reasons and dropped out&#8221; and &#8220;Other&#8221; fields are used extensively.

	<p pid="a.958W.12/1">Because the Ministry does not yet know the final outcome of the proposed reforms of civil service staff pensions (following on from the Hutton review on public sector pensions), accurate forecasts about the proportion of Ministry's budget allocated to staff pensions for each of the next five years are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.958W.12/2">The proportion of Ministry's budget allocated to staff pensions is also dependent upon the staff profile of the department. Employer pension contributions (know as Accruing Superannuation Liability Charges) are based on five salary bands. Each band has a different percentage charge and they can be found on the civil service web site at:</p>

	<p pid="a.958W.12/4">As the Ministry implements organisational changes and reforms in response to the spending review announcements, the staff profile of the Department will change over the next five years. As a consequence, the future proportion of the Ministry's budget allocated to staff pensions can only be known once those changes and reforms have been implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.959W.2/2">The measures taken to implement judgments, and the costs and benefits of such measures, can vary considerably depending on the circumstances of the case, and some can be included in wider changes to policy or legislation.

	<p pid="a.965W.2/2">The contract for the operational management and delivery of the Playing for Success (PfS) programme ran for a three-year period beginning in April 2008. It expired at the end of March 2011. Central funding to support Playing for Success study centres in England, therefore, came to an end at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/3">The level of funding made available to support Playing for Success in each of the three years of the last spending review period was approximately &#163;14.5 million, including the contract and support to individual centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/4">Four independent national evaluations were carried out over the course of the Playing for Success programme, all of which focused on the impact on academic achievement. There has been no assessment of the effectiveness of the programme in increasing attendance at school or in reducing offending by participants. The evaluations have all found improvements in literacy and numeracy levels, information and communication technology (ICT) skills, attitudes to learning, and self-esteem. The evaluation in May 2007 looked at the long-term impact of PfS in terms of pupils' performance in national curriculum assessments (NCAs) and found a more mixed picture. While there appeared to be a positive impact on under-achieving pupils, which was the programme's target group, it concluded that PfS is not an inoculation against underperformance, and continued progress should be a shared responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/5">In the programme's final year of central funding, the Department supported the contractors Rex Hall Associates to work with a selected number of study centres to gather more information about the impact of the programme on pupil engagement, motivation, achievement, and progress, as well as seeking the views of parents, teachers, and PfS centre managers. The information that was gathered from this exercise was used to support schools, local authorities, and clubs in deciding how they might continue to develop and sustain the programme into the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/6">Ministers have not visited any Playing for Success study centres since May 2010. Rex Hall Associates have maintained responsibility for working with centres, and undertaking regular meetings and visits to advise and support them as central funding has come to an end.</p>

An estimated 68% of Burma's population is at a risk of contracting the disease.

	<p pid="a.979W.9/1">We are very aware of the potential implications for electricity infrastructure of severe space weather or an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). National Grid, as operator of the GB&#8217;s electricity transmission network, has taken steps to reduce the risks, including daily monitoring of space weather information, and ensuring that operational procedures are in place to mitigate the potential impacts. Furthermore, National Grid&#8217;s specification for purchasing supergrid transformers requires a level of resilience based on the space weather event of 1989. DECC officials meet regularly with representatives from the energy industries to discuss a wide range of hazards and threats to energy networks. We are now working closely with National Grid to understand better the probability and impact on electricity networks of more severe space weather events than the networks in the UK have previously experienced. Robust scientific and technical evidence is needed before any decisions can be taken on further measures and associated costs to protect against electromagnetic hazards and threats. Further advice from National Grid is expected by the summer.</p>

The final report is available on the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.981W.3/5">To complement and build upon the Business Link service, DEFRA is providing the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) with &#163;35 million in 2011-12 to help businesses, communities and individuals become more sustainable, through the provision of more targeted and specialist advice and support on material resource efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.3/6">DEFRA also provides guidance on how businesses should report on their environmental impacts in their company reports through the Environmental Key Performance Indicators and specific guidance on how organisations should measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

No subsidies are involved or are being considered for this project. The Department has had no discussions with any other operators on licensing similar projects in the Morecambe Bay area.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.6/2">Gas platforms in the Morecambe Bay area do not export any gas directly to other countries. I cannot comment on the quantity of remaining natural gas reserves in the South Morecambe Bay area as this is commercial matter for the operator involved. DECC has made no estimate of the contribution of offshore gas industry in the Morecambe Bay area to employment.</p>

	<p pid="a.987W.8/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.8/2"><i>(a)</i> In the financial year 2010-11, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spent &#163;286,879 on recruitment agency fees. This represents a 75% decrease over the last two years due to rigorous tendering processes for every recruitment campaign. The FCO uses recruitment agencies to attract the widest possible range of talented applicants. For specialist campaigns, agencies are better placed to target applicants with the most relevant skills within that sector. The use of agencies has proven to be more cost-effective than using in-house recruitment resources for those aspects of campaigns, and is common practice throughout Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.8/3">The FCO is fully compliant with the Government-wide recruitment freeze and is only recruiting in exceptional circumstances, as set out in the policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.8/4"><i>(b)</i> In financial year 2010-11, the FCO spent a total of &#163;26,325 on outplacement agency fees for displaced and redundant staff. This includes outplacement support and the running of Career Transition Workshops.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.8/5"><i>(c)</i> The Human Resources Directorate of the FCO spent approximately &#163;8.66 million on training in financial year 2010-11, including approximately &#163;3 million on language training. A number of other Directorates within the FCO run specialist training courses for their areas of activity. Expenditure on this type of training is not centrally recorded.</p>

	<p pid="a.990W.2/1">As Amnesty International's report of <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-04">4 May 2011</phrase> illustrates, North Korea imprisons large numbers of people for their political and religious beliefs. Through our embassy in Pyongyang, and in meetings with North Korean officials in London, we regularly raise human rights and also press the North Korean regime to allow the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in North Korea access to their country. We called for this most recently in the UN Human Rights Council Resolution on the human rights situation in North Korea in Geneva in March 2011. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 2010 Human Rights Report, which was presented to Parliament in March 2011, also raised our concern about these camps. We will continue to press them on our concerns and urge them to allow independent verification of the situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.993W.2/1">We have taken a number of steps to tackle this problem, targeted enforcement action led to 155 arrests last year and the dismantling of several organised facilitation groups. We are working closely with registrars and clergy, and have agreed procedural changes with the Church of England to allow greater scrutiny. We will publish a wider consultation on family migration later this year to strengthen further our approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.1004W.2/11">From 2013 we will introduce a new benefit, personal independence payment, to replace disability living allowance for people of working age. Key to personal independence payment will be a more objective assessment of individual need. We have been developing our proposals for the new assessment in collaboration with a group of independent specialists in health, social care and disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.2/12">The assessment will take account of needs arising from physical, sensory, mental, intellectual and cognitive impairments. We believe it is right for the assessment to look at disabled people as individuals and not just label them by their health condition or impairment. That is why it is being designed to consider an individual's personal circumstances and the support they need, rather than basing eligibility on any medical condition. I can assure the hon. Member that we want to get this right and before finalising the assessment criteria we will be testing them and assessing their likely impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.0/6">For information, a recent survey on ESA (&#8220;Employment and Support Allowance: Findings from a face-to-face survey of customers&#8221;) recorded that around 41% of participants who left ESA before completing assessment, and 13% of participants who left having been assessed as fit for work, had then moved into some form of employment. However, this is not broken down by health condition. See sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1 of the survey report for further details:</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.3/1">The procurement rules preclude us from favouring any sector or stipulating quotas for particular groups, either for prime bids or within the delivery chain, in respect of Work programme contracts under the Employment Related Support Services Framework.

	<p pid="a.1010W.3/2">As part of the evaluation, DWP has closely scrutinised each bidder's partnership proposals within their tenders, particularly when considering the supply chain and service requirement criteria, to ensure that the level of community and voluntary sector involvement is commensurate with the needs of Work programme customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.3/3">Across all the bids there were varying levels of input from the voluntary and community sector, numbering well over 300 in total. In addition to these there was also a wide range of SMEs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1019W.3/1">Responsibility for data regarding past employees lies with Remploy. I understand that they do not routinely hold information about their ex-employees. It is therefore not possible to provide detailed information about the proportion of people formerly employed at Remploy factories taking voluntary redundancy over the last 10 years, who have found full-time or part-time employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.3/2">The majority of employees who took voluntary redundancy from the company in the last 10 years did so under Remploy's Modernisation Plan in 2007 and 2008, which was agreed and set up by the previous Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.3/3">In 2008 Remploy conducted a survey among the 1,800 former employees who had taken voluntary redundancy, to which 650 responded. As this represents only around one-third of the total, the results cannot be used to draw conclusions about the group as a whole. This showed that 19% of those who responded were in work.

	<p pid="a.1019W.3/4">33% were actively looking for work;</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.3/5">42% had taken retirement;</p>

We have also announced during the Commons Committee stage of the Welfare Reform Bill that we intend to discuss with stakeholders the options for delivering this within the existing financial envelope for child care costs in the current tax credit and benefit system. The maximum allowable child care costs under different options will be a key factor in those discussions, which will take place over the coming weeks.</p>

New strategies have recently been approved on ICT, centralised procurement and major programmes which will see greater efficiency and collaboration across Departments to help support the &#163;83 billion cost reductions required over the CSR period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1032W.6/1">None of the disposal regimes for local authority land contain special provisions for the disposal of historic buildings. The only special provisions for particular types of land is for open space, where prospective disposals have to be advertised in advance and the local authority must take any representations received into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.6/2">There are three regimes for the disposal of local authority land. The general one is under section 123 Local Government Act 1972, which says that local authorities may dispose of land in any manner they wish. The Secretary of State's only role is to give or withhold consent if the disposal is at less than the best consideration reasonably obtainable. There is a general disposal consent if the undervalue of the disposal is less than &#163;2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.6/3">The disposal power for land held for planning purposes is section 233 Town and Country Planning Act 1990. This is similar to the Local Government Act regime except that there is no power to issue a general consent. This means that all disposals at less than best consideration must receive a specific consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.6/4">The disposal of land and buildings held by local authorities for housing purposes is governed by consents issued by the Secretary of State under section 32 of the Housing Act 1985 and section 25 of the Local Government Act 1988. A general consent issued under section 32 allows (among other things) local authorities to dispose of properties to individuals at market value. A general consent issued under section 25 allows for disposal at undervalue to registered providers of social housing. For disposals that fall outside these general consents, local authorities currently need to approach the Secretary of State for a specific consent and each application is judged on its merit. Usually a special consent will be provided if it is considered that the application is in line with the local authority's strategic plans for the provision of social and affordable housing, the regeneration of the local area and we are satisfied that any tenants involved have been fully consulted and do not oppose the proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.1039W.2/5">&#8220;The policies proposed in the White Paper and the Bill will put patients at the heart of the NHS, giving patients, carers and the public a stronger collective voice, greater choice and control, and more involvement in decisions about their care, supported by an information revolution that aims to transform how information is provided. They will bring about a greater focus on improving outcomes, so that the NHS focus on what matters most to patients: high quality care. They will also empower clinicians, free providers and professionals from bureaucracy and central control and make NHS services more accountable to patients and communities. Removing unnecessary layers of bureaucracy will simplify the existing structure of the NHS, driving efficiency in the short-term and helping to ensure that the NHS is both sustainable and self-improving in the longer-term.&#8221;</p>

Indeed, the Blood Safety and Quality Regulations 2005, as amended, require the UK blood services, which includes NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), to encourage voluntary and unpaid blood donations. There are no plans to change this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/2">Long-serving donors receive milestone awards such as a badge and certificate, and those giving the greatest number of donations are invited to an awards dinner.

	<p pid="a.1041W.2/17">NHS Blood and Transplant report that the increased costs shown from 2008-09 are in part a result of less favourable exchange rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041W.2/18">Since 1999, plasma for the manufacture of fractionated plasma products, such as immunoglobulins and clotting factors, has been obtained from non-United Kingdom sources. There is a global market for the main plasma products and most companies were largely unaffected by the changes resulting from vCJD as they source plasma from non-UK donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041W.2/19">Bio Products Laboratory Ltd (BPL) is the Department-owned fractionator which supplies part of the national health service demand but only a very small proportion of global product (2% to 4%). BPL historically used plasma from the UK blood services and was therefore directly affected by the change in policy. BPL's fractionated products are used in the UK, and are also sold abroad. A cost estimate for importing the plasma that is used to manufacture BPL products that are used in the UK is not readily available, but I will place an estimate in the Library by the end of June 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1042W.0/1">There have been three cases of clinical variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and one case of infection (without development of clinical disease) presumed to be associated with blood transfusion. These have occurred in people who have received blood transfusions from donors who themselves went on to develop clinical vCJD after they had made the blood donation. None of these patients were transfused since 1999. The vCJD infection in these four recipients only came to light in 2003 and later because of the incubation period of vCJD.</p>

	<p pid="a.1047W.0/1">The majority of Commissioning Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) goals are locally agreed and commissioners can already choose to use the CQUIN framework to reward providers for ambitious improvements in nutritional care. Examples of locally agreed CQUIN schemes as well as a list of exemplar CQUIN goals are available on the NHS Institute&#8217;s website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/2">Despite a number of initiatives by the last Government there is a lack of data against which progress can be measured. No routine collections were commissioned to provide:</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/3">Data on the number of people resident in a care home who were admitted to and discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of malnutrition in England;</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/4">Specific data on the prevalence and costs of malnutrition or the local arrangements that are in place to carry out nutritional screening in England; and</p>

	<p pid="a.1047W.0/6">The Health and Social Care Information Centre is able to extract some information pertaining to nutrition from Hospital Episode Statistics data. Annual inspections of food quality and service are undertaken by Patient Environment Action Teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/7">&#8216;Never events&#8217; are defined as serious, largely preventable patient safety incidents that should not occur if the available preventative measures have been implemented by health care providers. The last Government identified eight &#8216;never events&#8217; the coalition Government undertook to extend the list and following an engagement exercise with NHS organisations, patients, the public, clinical bodies, clinicians and others with an interest expanded it to 25. Failure to prevent a patient becoming malnourished was not included in the expanded list published in February. The list will be kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/8">The decision to close the Better Hospital Food Programme (BHF) was taken by the last Government in April 2006, formal monitoring of the programme ceased in 2004. Funding previously allocated centrally was passed directly to the NHS to allow it to develop local services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/9">The BHF legacy includes a series of resources which are available on the Hospital Caterers Association website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/10">The Government set out their ambitions for developing a library of quality standards in their White Paper, &#8220;Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS&#8221; published in July 2010. The NHS Operating Framework 2011-12 published in December 2010 set out the Government&#8217;s plans to commission the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop quality standards on nutrition in hospital, intravenous fluid therapy and pressure ulcers. A full list can be found on the NICE website. NICE has not yet published a timetable for the development of these quality standards; however, we understand that it intends to prepare them over the next two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1048W.8/2">All nursing students undertaking pre-registration nursing programmes will learn about nutritional care, including the assessment and monitoring of nutritional status.

	<p pid="a.1055W.3/1">The regulation of cosmetic surgery has already been tightened up since the fieldwork carried out by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death. Since October 2011 all cosmetic surgery providers, whether in the national health service or in the independent sector, have been subject to regulation by the Care Quality Commission against requirements set out in regulations. The Commission has tough enforcement powers and can take prompt actions where providers fail to comply with the safety and quality requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.3/2">In addition, individual doctors are now subject to the oversight of a &#8220;responsible officer&#8221; in respect to all aspects of their clinical practice, including any cosmetic procedures carried out in the private sector. When medical revalidation is introduced, all doctors will be periodically assessed for their competence across the whole area of their clinical practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1056W.2/1">The Public Health White Paper highlighted the development of a suite of documents which would set out in more detail the Government&#8217;s approach to tackling key determinants of poor health and health inequalities, one of which would cover sexual health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/2">The Department is currently working closely with stakeholders and experts in the field in developing a new sexual health policy document. This document will look at holistic sexual health needs across the population while still allowing a focus in on specific issues relating to those who are at higher risk of poor sexual health. We expect to publish the document later this year.</p>
