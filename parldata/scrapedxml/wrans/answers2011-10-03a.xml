	<p pid="a.1374W.2/4">Furthermore, the information would also exclude contracts and payments made to SMEs by the Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s prime contractors through their supply chains, which are extensive and include a high proportion of SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1374W.2/5">However, noting this context, and based on an approximately 10% sample of the circa 6,000 new contracts placed directly by the MOD in 2010-11 across the UK, we estimate that 2,370 have been awarded to English-based SMEs, 50 to those in Scotland, 20 in Northern Ireland, and 60 in Wales. There is no central store of data which would allow the calculation of a separate estimate for agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1374W.2/6">Our Equipment, Support and Technology Green Paper recognised the innovation and flexibility that small businesses bring to Defence and Security and sought views on ways to improve their access to contract opportunities. Our response will be set out in a White Paper before the end of the year but we have already established an SME forum to provide small companies and their representative bodies with regular and direct access to Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1377W.8/2">It is mandatory for all service leavers to receive a resettlement assessment prior to discharge. Service leavers do not receive a further mandated resettlement assessment during the first six months after leaving but are entitled to access support during that period, which may include a resettlement assessment. For those who have served four or more years, support includes personal one-to-one consultancy advice on career and job finding for up to two years after leaving. For all service leavers, lifetime post-resettlement support is available from the Regular Forces Employment Association (RFEA) and Officers' Association (OA). Furthermore, all service leavers who use the Career Transition Partnership (those having served four or more years) are invited to complete resettlement questionnaires six, 12 and 24 months after leaving, depending on their length of service.</p>

	<p pid="a.1381W.3/3">The revised statement on the Quality of Apprenticeship Delivery Models, published by NAS in August 2011, gives increased clarity on what is acceptable in terms of the employment status of the apprentice, minimum hours worked, funding of wages and the length of apprenticeship programmes. It also includes a statement that the length of stay for an apprenticeship must be sufficient for the apprentice to have time to embed their understanding of the job role and be competent in applying the skills required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1381W.3/4">Working alongside NAS, the Skills Funding Agency works closely with training providers, colleges and employers to monitor delivery of the apprenticeship programme and ensure standards set by NAS are met.

Our most recent meeting focused on maintaining existing record levels of growth and ensuring a high quality experience for both the employer and the apprentice. At this meeting NAS described their work to ensure that quality standards and requirements for funding were clear and fully understood by the sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.1387W.0/1">All eight Plugged-In Places projects are now up and running. The programme has more than trebled the number of recharging points in the UK. Over 4 million (15%) of drivers in Great Britain now live in local authority areas that have PIP-funded publicly accessible charging infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.0/2">Projects have made a number of major breakthroughs including installing the UK's first publicly accessible rapid chargers that can recharge vehicles in as little as 30 minutes. A number of the projects have also recently launched their membership schemes eg 'Source London', 'Source East' and the Northern Ireland scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.0/3">In addition, thanks in part to market priming through the Plugged-In Places and a number of enabling steps set out in our June Infrastructure Strategy, a number of UK enterprises have recently announced plans to roll out additional infrastructure at sites across the country (eg Charge Master; and Ecotricity in Conjunction with Welcome Break).</p>

This combines the 2009 emissions factors with national fleet and traffic data to produce estimates of total UK emissions. The CO2 emissions figures are derived from DEFRA's greenhouse gas reporting guidelines, these use the 2009 emissions factors (along with fleet and traffic data) plus improved data on HGV CO2 emissions from DFT freight surveys.</p>

Compensation arrangements between Network Rail and Train Operating Companies are governed by the track access agreements between the parties. Compensation payments relate to the overall level of performance over a period, and depend on the extent to which delays during that period were caused by Network Rail or train operators. The regime for compensating passengers depends instead on whether delays on a particular service exceeded the relevant threshold, and does not depend on the cause of that delay.

	<p pid="a.1392W.8/1">The trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow, which I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase>, is currently being designed by the airport operator, BAA, under the supervision of the Civil Aviation Authority. BAA will engage with relevant local authorities, communities and stakeholders on the details of the trial once this process is complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.1392W.8/2">The results of the trial will help define the circumstances in which the measures are deployed, including the requirement for safeguards and restrictions if the regime were to proceed beyond the trial stage to be adopted on a long term basis. The results will also form the basis for a consultation with local communities which will in due course inform the Government in deciding whether an operational freedoms regime should be adopted at the airport.</p>

The proposed policy contains a number of safeguards to ensure that culling does not lead to a detrimental impact on local badger populations. These include having a 'closed season' over the badgers' breeding season during which no culling can take place, and limiting both the number of licences that may be granted in any one year and the number of badgers that may be removed in each licensed area. DEFRA will also commission independent monitoring that will assess annually badger activity in each licensed area. If badger activity is found to be very low, mitigation measures can be put in place to ensure there is no local disappearance in any licensed area (eg stopping activity under the licence for the remainder of that year, or stipulating areas of land where culling would not be permitted).</p>

In addition to these sources of information, applicants for culling licences would be required to provide Natural England with information regarding the number of main setts on the land which forms part of the application. From these, Natural England will be able to advise applicants on the estimated range of the number of badgers they would be expected to remove during the six-week intensive cull.</p>

	<p pid="a.1398W.8/1">DEFRA has not initiated any such investigations. However, we have supported some TB-related slaughterhouse surveys carried out by a small number of Trading Standards teams in 2010 and 2011. The surveys provided evidence that a small minority of farmers had been swapping official cattle ID ear tags so that they could retain TB reactors and send other less valuable cattle to slaughter in their place. It was because of these findings that we introduced in April 2011 an additional safeguard&#8212;DNA tags applied to TB test positive cattle&#8212;to ensure infected animals are not kept on farms.</p>

	<p pid="a.1400W.0/2">I understand that some people consider that hot branding should be prohibited. The reason for the exemption is that there are instances where ponies are left to remain in a semi-feral existence and do not react well to handling, such as on Dartmoor, New Forest and Exmoor. In these circumstances it is better to be able to read the identification mark externally rather than to scan the animal which would involve handling it and causing distress. We realise that the pony would need to be handled when it is branded and at certain other occasions but these are kept to a minimum and when it is necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.1400W.3/1">We are working to secure liberalisation of international trade which, as the Foresight project on the Future of Food and Farming states, will help dampen price volatility by allowing a production shock in one region to be more easily compensated for by output and trade adjustments in others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.3/2">As part of this work, in June 2011, the UK secured a number of significant results in the final text of the &#8220;Action Plan on food price volatility and agriculture&#8221;, which was agreed at the G20 Agriculture Ministers' meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.3/3">The plan represents the first steps towards a clear and positive response to the challenges highlighted in the Foresight report and, if implemented quickly, will go some way towards creating a more predictable world for food producers and consumers in both developed and developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.3/4">The plan recognises that market fundamentals&#8212;supply and demand&#8212;are the key causes of price volatility in wheat, corn, maize and soya and that both increasing production sustainably and reducing shocks to supply such as those caused when policymakers respond to poor quality information, are the means to ensure a healthier relationship of supply to rising demand. During discussion of the plan, we emphasised the need to trade openly and remove distorting measures, and that export bans in particular should not impede calls for humanitarian aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.3/5">We have established an Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) to improve market information and transparency in order to encourage major players on the agri-food markets to share data, enhance existing information systems, promote greater shared understanding of food price developments, and to further policy dialogue and cooperation. The G20 countries committed to disclose reliable, quality, accurate and timely data for this initiative. The first meeting of AMIS will take place in Rome on 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-16">16 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.3/6">We also agreed to establish a senior officials' group to act as a &quot;Rapid Response Forum&quot;, to share views and plans for immediate actions in order to prevent or mitigate world food price crises. Taken together with the improvement in market information which we anticipate that AMIS will bring, this improved coordination should reduce the extent to which G20 members are themselves the source of avoidable supply shocks in future, as happens for example when panic buying takes place or export restrictions are imposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.3/7">The plan will now be submitted to the G20 summit in November 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1404W.2/1">In the Project Appraisal Report for the Ouse Washes Habitat Creation project (OWHCP), it was recognised that the 1,008 hectare habitat requirement under the Birds and Habitats Directives would not necessarily be met by the OWHCP alone. It states that</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/2">&#8216;there is the potential for the sites to be expanded at a later date by other organisations and not part of this project&#8217;</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/3">(PAR section 2.7.4). Thus there is a role for third party habitat creation sites within the Fens in addition to the minimum to be delivered under the OWHCP. However, those currently planned or under way are not necessarily in the most appropriate location, of sufficient extent or habitat type suitable for the target bird species that are associated with habitat loss since the 1970s.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/4">The Secretary of State considered the legal implications of the Habitats Directive in consultation with other members of the Ouse Washes Steering Group. The document &#8220;Key principles of the EC Wild Birds and Habitats Directives as they relate to the Ouse Washes&#8221; was circulated to that group in the course of consultation. It sets out the conclusion that alternative habitat needed to be provided; a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/5">The Ouse Washes Steering Group assessed the amount of compensatory habitat required under the Birds and Habitats Directives as 1,008 hectares in the appraisal document &#8220;Assessment of Avian Functional Loss Attributed to Changing Flood Patterns on the Ouse Washes&#8221;; a copy has been placed in the Library of the House. The Project Appraisal Report for the Ouse Washes Habitat Creation project included three options to deliver this full habitat extent, together with a fourth option of delivering a smaller total of 500 hectares. The Project Appraisal Report concluded the project 'minimum success criteria' should be 500 hectares of new habitat, which is the option now being delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.1405W.6/1">The Government have listened to the view of the House and are sympathetic to the motion for a ban. We will continue to look carefully at how this could be introduced, but there are unavoidable legal difficulties that cannot be ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.6/2">The Government have received legal advice that if the Government were to introduce a ban now, it could be challenged in both British and European courts.

	<p pid="a.1405W.6/3">As it would ultimately be taxpayers who would foot the bill for defending a legal challenge, the Government have to verify the legal status of any policy before going ahead as well as listening to the views expressed in the House of Commons debate.

	<p pid="a.1408W.2/1">The Department does not collect this information but a number of reports have been published by other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1408W.2/2">For example, the &#8220;Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in Great Britain, 2004&#8221; (Office of National Statistics) reported that 9.6% of children aged five to 16 years had a clinically recognisable mental disorder. Of these: 5.8% had a conduct disorder; 3.7% had emotional disorders (anxiety and depression), 1.5% had hyperkinetic (hyperactive) disorders and 0.3% had eating disorders The same survey showed that among children aged five to 10 years 10.2% of boys and 5.1% of girls had a clinically recognisable mental disorder. In the older age group, 11 to 16-year-olds, 12.6% of boys and 10.3% of girls had a clinically recognisable mental disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.1408W.2/3">Information on the number of children that self harm is difficult to collect as often they do not tell others or seek medical assistance. &#8220;Children and adolescents who try to harm, hurt or kill themselves&#8221; (ONS, 2001) reported that around 1.3% of five to 10-year-olds had ever tried to harm, hurt or kill themselves. Higher proportions were found among boys than girls (1.7% and 0.9%) and 8 to 10-year-olds had twice the rate of five to seven-year-olds (1.7% and 0.9%). The lowest rate, 0.4% was found among five to seven-year-old girls rising to the highest rate of 2.1% of eight to 10-year-old boys. Other reports, including &#8220;Truth Hurts&#8212;Report of the National Inquiry into Self-Harm among Young People&#8221; (The Camelot Foundation and Mental Health Foundation, 2006) which indicated a prevalence rate of between one in 12 (8.3%) and one in 15 (6.7%) across the United Kingdom for young people, aged 15 to 25, report higher prevalence rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.1410W.0/1">&#8216;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8217;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January</phrase>, sets out a range of measures to improve cancer survival rates in England. It shows how we intend to tackle preventable cancer incidence, improve the quality and efficiency of cancer services and deliver outcomes that are comparable with the best in Europe. The strategy sets out an ambition to save at least an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014-15 through earlier diagnosis of cancer and improved access to screening and radiotherapy. To support earlier diagnosis of cancer the Government have committed over &#163;450 million over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1410W.0/2">&#8216;Improving Outcomes in Upper Gastro-intestinal Cancers&#8217;, published in 2001, makes recommendations on the treatment, management and care of patients with upper gastro-intestinal cancers including pancreatic cancer. The Cancer Outcomes Strategy makes it clear that the improving outcomes in cancer guidance (IOG), published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, will continue to be a feature of all commissioned cancer services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1410W.0/3">The strategy also sets out our commitment to work with a number of rarer cancer-focused charities to assess what more can be done to encourage appropriate referrals to secondary care for earlier diagnosis. Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including a pancreatic cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis and to discuss potential solutions. This will inform our future work in this area.</p>
