	<p pid="a.977W.6/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>, the ODA employed 212 members of staff. This consists of permanent staff, fixed term contract staff, and secondments. The overall management costs budget for 2008-09 is based on an ODA headcount of 276. The agreed total budget for ODA management costs for 2008-09 is &pound;24,223,000.

	<p pid="a.977W.6/2">The ODA currently has 128 members of staff working in project management roles across a number of ODA teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.977W.6/3">The ODA is leading the first phase of legacy which is focused on cleaning, clearing, and creating the park and the development of new infrastructure, utilities, and venues. The second phase is led by the LDA and is focused on what the park is used for after the games. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of those ODA staff that are exclusively working on legacy planning roles as every project within the programme is considered with legacy in mind, ensuring that legacy requirements are incorporated into design briefs, specifications and business plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.977W.6/4">The ODA currently has 15 employees working in the Finance and Business Planning Team who work closely with the delivery partner on the financial oversight of the programme. In addition the ODA has engaged Ernst and Young to provide an internal audit service.</p>

	<p pid="a.978W.3/1">In June this year we published the Legacy Action Plan (LAP) which sets out the long term benefits we hope to stimulate through hosting the Olympic games and Paralympic games in 2012, and how we plan to achieve them. This is unprecedented as no other host city has ever been at this stage of planning, nor so committed to a broad and sustainable legacy this early in preparations.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.3/2">The LAP sets out the Government's priorities for UK-wide legacy as defined by our five legacy promises, published in Our Promise for 2012 in June 2007. This includes a target to help get two million people more active through sport and physical activity by 2012. Sport England will seek to get one million more active through sport; they will do this through new engagement with national governing bodies and through county sport partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.3/3">Further to the announcement in June, Government have now set out further details of the &pound;140 million cross-Government free swimming scheme. The scheme is designed to encourage as many local authorities as possible to participate in making swimming free for over 60s and under 16s in their local communities, but also to stimulate ambitious authorities to maximise and sustain uptake through other initiatives such as free lessons for adults who cannot swim, the introduction of swimming coordinators and to provide incentives for the most ambitious to move further towards a universal free swimming offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.3/4">The LAP also includes initiatives to stimulate economic and social benefit by increasing tourism and improving access to skills and business opportunities. This includes, for example, the London 2012 Business Network giving business across the UK access to the 75,000 contracts in the London 2012 supply chains worth &pound;6 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.3/5">Facilities in the London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide which will be published in Beijing will also have the opportunity to attract inward investment and showcase their local area on an international stage. UKTI are also developing programmes to use the games as a springboard for export.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.3/6">In addition to the LAP, each of the English regions and nations has its own plan for legacy initiatives at a local level that complement this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.3/7">As Members of Parliament we should do everything we can in our constituencies to ensure the opportunities and long term benefits generated by the games are realised at local level across the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.983W.6/1">The independent Post-Project Review of the Cromwell Green Visitor Reception Building, undertaken by Roy Davis Associates LLP, has now been received by the Clerk of the House. It was reported to the Commission at its recent meeting, and will be reported to the House of Lords House Committee in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/2">The review presents a thorough analysis of the project. The Cromwell Green entrance opened on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-21">21 April 2008</phrase> and has been operating successfully since as an important enhancement of visitor reception at Westminster. But its construction was subject to exceptional delay and significant cost overruns. The main findings of the Review are:</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/3" class="indent">until autumn 2007 the governance of the project was poor, and it is questionable whether the Houses were advised in sufficient detail to make balanced decisions;</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/4" class="indent">the initial project delivery date of September 2006 drove the project but was not achievable;</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/5" class="indent">once on site, delays occurred due to the complexity and uniqueness of the design, the fact that it was incomplete and uncoordinated, which required it to be extensively reworked during construction, and the lack of resolution of critical issues;</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/6" class="indent">the requirements of major parts of the project brief were ignored;</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/7" class="indent">the management of the design and the construction was undermined by the split responsibilities of project managers and the lack of ownership of the project; and</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/8" class="indent">both the cost management and advice and the procurement and production of contracts for consultants and the contractor were poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/9">The repeatedly escalating costs and continued slippages in this project have raised serious questions about project management competences in the House service. A number of key steps have already been taken. As part of a reorganisation following the review by Sir Kevin Tebbit it was decided to create a reunified Parliamentary Estates Directorate and recruit senior managers with appropriate skills. The Directorate is now under the direct responsibility of a Director General of Facilities. As part of their recruitment, both new postholders have been required to demonstrate competence, and personal track records of delivery, in the areas of estates and works matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/10">Further improvements relating to transparency and control of projects are under way, and these will take account of recommendations for future practice from the Post-Project Review. The Commission will receive a progress report from the Clerk of the House in the autumn on the establishment of the revised management arrangements and the effectiveness of the new controls over projects. It supports the Clerk of the House in his determination to ensure that full lessons are learned from this major failure in project management.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.6/11">A copy of the Post-Project Review has been placed in the Library and on the parliamentary website.</p>

	<p pid="a.989W.3/1">The UK Government remain firmly committed to tackling child vulnerability in Africa, including those affected by HIV/AIDS. Over the last three years the Department for International Development (DFID) has provided over &pound;120 million for support of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Africa. This includes supporting National Plans of Action for OVC and expanding support for the needs of the most vulnerable children in health, education, social protection and HIV prevention and treatment programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.989W.3/2">Over the next three years, the UK Government will expand their social protection programmes and increase spending to over &pound;200 million. DFID will work in at least eight African countries to develop social protection policies and programmes, with governments and NGOs that provide effective predictable support for the most vulnerable households&mdash;ensuring access to social services and protection from abuse. DFID will also work with others to provide better diagnostics and treatment of children infected with HIV and living with AIDS. A copy of the updated strategy 'Achieving Universal Access&mdash;the UK's strategy for halting and reversing the spread of HIV in the developing world' and supporting evidence paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

	<p pid="a.992W.8/1">The UK Government have been working closely with the major international organisations (World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN agencies and International Food Policy Research Institute) in order to assess future price trends and cereal production. Increased cereal production and the removal of export bans have brought about a calming of markets, and prices have fallen back from the very high levels seen earlier this year. But the consensus remains that the underlying demand for food remains strong, and this is likely to keep prices high for some years yet, with the trend price for grains stabilising at around 10-25 per cent. higher than 2001 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.8/2">Many countries have experienced serious social and economic consequences of the recent surge in food prices, aggravated by similar movement in fuel prices. The macroeconomic impact on developing countries varies according to the degree of dependency on food and fuel imports. Some countries (e.g. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Mozambique) are experiencing significant food price rises; some (e.g. Kenya and Zanzibar) are experiencing clear food shortages; countries in West Africa (e.g. Nigeria and Niger) are heavily affected due to their reliance on imports from international markets; some (Malawi and Zambia) are relatively insulated from global price movements, while others (e.g. Vietnam) are benefiting. The poorest are hardest hit, with some families spending up to 90 per cent. of their income on food. The UK Government are pressing for a global partnership to address both the short term impact of surging food prices, and the longer term challenges of promoting food security for the 850 million people who continue to face hunger.</p>

	<p pid="a.995W.2/1">The humanitarian situation in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is already serious, with high levels of violence and insecurity, and very little provision of basic social services. Department for International Development (DFID) staff are unable to travel to the Niger Delta for security reasons, so we have been unable to make a direct assessment of the current humanitarian situation. DFID is in regular contact with the Office for Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), Save the Children (SCF) and Oxfam, and none of them reported any change to the humanitarian situation in the Niger Delta.</p>

	<p pid="a.998W.6/2">The number of vehicles of all ages being abandoned is one of several indicators monitored by the Department since implementing the end-of-life vehicles directive. We believe that a combination of factors has contributed to the significant reduction in the numbers of abandoned vehicles recorded in recent years. Those factors include the introduction of the End-of-Life Vehicles Regulations 2003 and the End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulations 2005, improvements in the accuracy of the vehicle register, various Government and local campaigns to tackle abandonment, and the continuing high value of scrap metal. It is difficult to isolate the individual impact of any one of these factors.</p>

Specific support includes the Bioenergy Capital Grants Scheme, which supports the installation of biomass-fuelled heat and combined heat and power projects in the industrial, commercial and community sectors in England. We have also recently announced a new &pound;10 million programme to support the construction of new anaerobic digestion demonstration plants, and we are doubling the incentive to generate energy through AD by changes to the renewables obligation.

	<p pid="a.1003W.6/1">In 2003 the Environment Agency commissioned a report on the Prioritisation of Flame Retardants for Environmental Risk Assessment. The aim of the study was to assess the use of and risks associated with flame retardants, in particular to identify substances that might require detailed consideration in terms of their possible impact on the environment. It also considered issues concerning substitution of flame retardants. The study noted that little was known about the effects of many of the substances, including those sometimes proposed for use as environmentally-friendly substitutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.6/2">The new European Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (known as REACH) places on industry the responsibility to assess and understand the potential human health and environmental impacts of the substances they produce in accordance with the principle of &quot;No Data, No Market&quot;. REACH also has the aim of replacing substances of very high concern, as defined by criteria in the regulation, with suitable alternatives. Industry will have to justify their continued use. These provisions will drive substitution of harmful substances and also provide the assurance that the substitutes are less harmful than the substances they replace. On current evidence decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) does not meet the criteria of a substance of very high concern.</p>

	<p pid="a.1004W.6/1">There are currently no regulations or statutory instruments which place a direct requirement on farmers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, a number of measures have an indirect impact on agriculture GHG emissions, such as measures under the nitrates directive and conditions under cross compliance. There are also a number of voluntary initiatives which can help to reduce GHGs from farming, including the Environmental Stewardship schemes and various grant schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.6/2">DEFRA has a programme of research dedicated to agriculture and climate change issues which includes research into reducing emissions from livestock, manure and fertiliser application, as well as measures to protect carbon stores in soils. We are working closely with relevant stakeholders, including through the Rural Climate Change Forum and the Farming Futures communications project, to help ensure that farmers have the information and advice they need to take practical action to reduce GHG emissions. As such, we are promoting anaerobic digestion to reduce methane emissions from manure, slurry and other organic material.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005W.3/1">Natural England will consult with landowners before making proposals on the most appropriate positioning of the coastal route. The amount of private land affected by the creation of the coastal corridor will depend on local decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/2">The draft Marine Bill makes no provision for compensation to be paid to private landowners for the creation of the coastal access corridor. Natural England's report to Government recommended that there should be a working presumption against paying compensation for the new right of access in view of the fact that legislation would be simply creating access rights over land rather than depriving landowners of property. The legislation has been drawn up so that implementation will take account of the interests of landowners and minimise any impact on businesses. Natural England will consult with landowners on any necessary conditions on access, for example for land management purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.3/3">Natural England has estimated a cost of &pound;50 million over 10 years for implementing the coastal access corridor. This figure includes the costs of Natural England and local authority staff, the costs for establishing the coastal access corridor on the ground, and for ongoing maintenance during the implementation period.</p>

This was largely due to a higher farm gate milk price in 2007-08, although higher input costs, particularly feed, dampened down the size of the expected increase. This compares with the average income across all types of farms, including dairy farms, which was expected to have increased by 20 per cent. from &pound;37,600 to &pound;45,000 in 2007-08.

	<p pid="a.1008W.2/1">Cetacean abundance has been assessed recently in European waters through two large international survey projects: Small Cetacean Abundance in the North sea in 2005 (SCANS-II) and Offshore Distribution and Abundance&mdash;2007 (CODA). The first project assessed abundance of both species on the continental shelf of the European Atlantic and North sea and the latter in the offshore environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.2/2">The estimates from SCANS-II were compared with those from an earlier survey (SCANS) in 1994 and there was no significant difference found between population size for harbour porpoise. The final report has recently been submitted to the EU and will shortly be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.2/3">The CODA project focuses on cetaceans in offshore waters of the European Atlantic and began in November 2006. Shipboard surveys to assess abundance were carried out in July 2007 and the data are currently being processed. Publication of the results will follow the project's completion in September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.2/4">Common dolphins are widely distributed, with the number of animals in the continental shelf area varying substantially from year to year. There is no known sub structuring of the common dolphin population in UK waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.2/5">For bottlenose dolphins there is some substructuring. Genetic studies have indicated that the <i> Tursiops. truncatus</i> occurring in the offshore waters of the North Atlantic belong to a large oceanic population. Conversely, and although coastal populations around the UK are not genetically isolated, there is some evidence for geographic structuring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.2/6">In 2007, Favourable Conservation Status assessments were undertaken for both species under the requirements of the Habitats Directive. The bottlenose dolphin was reported to be in a favourable condition, while the status of the common dolphin was unknown, due mainly to our lacking of knowledge in the offshore abundance. CODA was in part initiated to provide this information. The UK FCS assessments are available from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.2/7">The two SCANS surveys (1994 and 2005) estimated common dolphin abundance in the Celtic sea area. However, the 1994 estimate was not corrected for animals missed on the transect line or for responsive movement, and this is now known to generate significant positive bias. Therefore, it is unknown whether the differences in the abundances obtained were indicative of an actual change in abundance or were related to the different methodology used. Additionally, these two surveys only covered the continental shelf area. This species is known to move widely between inshore and offshore areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.2/8">The subpopulation structure of North East Atlantic harbour porpoises has still not been elucidated fully. However, two subpopulations are recognised in UK waters. The first in the North sea and through to western Scotland; and the second in the Celtic and Irish sea area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.2/9">The abundance estimates from SCANS-II were compared with those from an earlier survey (SCANS) in 1994 for the North sea. There was no significant difference found between population size for harbour porpoise over this decadal period. The final report for SCANS II has recently been submitted to the EU, following which the work will be published.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.2/1">Under section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA), local authorities can issue residents with a notice specifying requirements as to the collection of household waste receptacles. These requirements may include the specifics of how and when to present the receptacles for collection, or the articles which must be placed in the receptacles. It is an offence for somebody to fail to comply with these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.2/2">Section 47ZA of the EPA allows local authorities to issue fixed penalty notices for offences under section 46. These fixed penalty notices can be issued by the following people:</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.2/3" class="indent">(a) an employee of the authority who is authorised in writing by the authority for the purposes of giving notices;</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.2/4" class="indent">(b) any person who, in pursuance of arrangements made with the authority, has the function of giving such notices and is authorised in writing by the authority to perform that function; and</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.2/6">DEFRA's guidance on fixed penalty notices explains that where local authorities authorise contractors to carry out enforcement activities, they should ensure that background checks are carried out to determine their suitability and capability. It is important that contractors receive adequate training and have a full understanding of any locally set procedures or policies before they begin to issue fixed penalties. The published guidance can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid="a.1011W.5/1">The Environment Agency receives requests from planning authorities for comments on planning application consultations, development plans and pre-application consultation requests from developers. The Environment Agency replied to 49,432 planning application consultations in 2007-08. In the first quarter of 2008-09 the Environment Agency replied to 11,279 planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011W.5/2">Planning application consultations sent to the Environment Agency are initially dealt with by Planning Liaison teams, but they may also require additional input from Environment Agency technical experts in issues such as flood risk, pollution, water, waste and wetland biodiversity.

	<p pid="a.1011W.5/3">There is no current 'backlog' of requests. The current live workload is 3,072 items of 'casework', which includes planning applications, inquiries and other consultations. The average response time for planning applications in the first quarter of 2008-09 was 15.8 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011W.5/4">In the Environment Agency's most recent report (2006-07, December 2007) on replies to planning application responses within the statutory 21 day time limit (or other period as agreed in writing with the applicant), 89 per cent. of consultations (on 40,168 planning applications) were determined within the time period.

	<p pid="a.1017W.6/2">Certain hormonal weed killers have the potential to remain in plant material from treated land and pass into the manure of livestock which eat such material. Susceptible crops may be adversely affected by the residues in the plant material. Labels of certain products which contain particular hormonal week killers therefore include warnings not to use manure from livestock which have eaten grass from treated land, or fodder derived from such grass, on susceptible crops or on land intended for growing such crops, until all plant material has fully decomposed. As with all plant protection products, users should always read and follow the label instructions; this is a statutory requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.6/3">Some cases of damage to susceptible crops which appear to involve the weed killer aminopyralid have arisen recently. In such cases, the label precautions on the use of manure may not have been followed when manure has been supplied to allotment holders and gardeners. The manufacturer has indicated that they are withdrawing products which contain aminopyralid from sale and PSD is formally suspending their authorisations while they investigate the options for preventing a recurrence of this problem. A key issue in their consideration will be whether the conditions of use regarding manure are sufficient, or sufficiently well known.</p>

	<p pid="a.1018W.5/1">The River Mimram lies outside the area of contamination. Sampling has shown that groundwater between the plume and the Mimram contains no bromate. Given this data and the generally stable nature of the plume the Environment Agency is confident that the Mimram is not, and will not be, subject to contamination by bromate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.5/2">Contamination of the chalk aquifer in Hertfordshire extends 20 km from Sandridge to the Lee Valley between Ware and Turnford, which includes Hoddesdon and Broxbourne. One borehole has been taken out of use for public supply. The contamination has restricted the use that can be made of seven other public supply boreholes and three private boreholes. The three private boreholes are all close to Sandridge. Concentrations of bromate and the size of the plume show no change with time.</p>

	<p pid="a.1026W.2/1">The Forestry Commission's statutory remit under the Plant Health Act 1967 charges them with the responsibility for the protection of forest trees and timber against attack by pests. This statutory remit does not specifically extend to monitor amenity and urban trees in relation to pests and disease. In practice the Forestry Commission occasionally does this, either by individually financed surveys aimed at detecting specific pest problems, or by monitoring the issues raised in calls for advice through the Tree Health Diagnostic and Information Service operated by Forest Research. I have asked the Forestry Commission to consider whether there is a need to extend their remit to include a more targeted approach to amenity and urban trees.</p>

	<p pid="a.1026W.5/1">The Government believe local authorities are best placed to make decisions on the waste management strategy for their communities.

	<p pid="a.1026W.5/2">The authority can specify the number, size, construction and maintenance of receptacles, what can be placed in each, where and when they are to be placed for collection and can require the waste to be treated prior to placing it in a receptacle (usually washing or rinsing containers).</p>

So far, over 300 local authorities have benefited from WRAP's local authority advisory service on their collection programmes for kerbside, civic amenity and bring schemes.

	<p pid="a.1030W.2/10">On <i> (b)</i>, court conviction datasets do not contain background information in relation to offences committed; it is therefore not possible to identify separately the number of convictions for all offences where a knife was involved. For instance, if a knife was used in murder, this information would not be recorded. Prosecution and conviction data are also collated on the principal offence rule; so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included in the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030W.2/11">I welcome the recent agreement between the PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service that people caught in possession of a knife in a public place with no reasonable excuse can expect to be prosecuted. The re-launch of the PSNI's knife campaign on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-21">21 July</phrase> will help to reinforce this message and help to raise awareness of the dangers of knives more generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030W.2/12">I have recently announced a range of tough new sentencing powers to tackle knife crime. The commencement of provisions in the Criminal Justice Order on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-16">16 July</phrase> means the maximum penalty for carrying a knife in a public place, including school premises, is now a four year custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030W.2/13">I intend to consult on a number of other proposals including a retail licensing scheme, a retail code of practice and a test purchase scheme to enforce the age limit on the sale of knives. All these initiatives will be underpinned by new research to obtain up-to-date local information on the attitude of young people in Northern Ireland to knives.</p>

As part of this, it took account of matters such as the different types of biofuel feedstocks likely by 2020 to be used in different regions (including the EU, USA and China), and the different land requirements and impacts of these feedstocks. Matters such as current and projected levels of subsidies for biofuels and the impact these might have on different markets were outside the scope of the review.

	<p pid="a.1044W.5/1">Where the particulate emissions limit is sufficiently strict as to oblige manufacturers to use a diesel particulate filter, as the future Euro VI standard proposed by the European Commission may be, the associated fuel consumption penalty would be likely to be between 2 and 3 per cent. if no offsetting improvements to engine or vehicle technology were made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044W.5/2">In principle, because carbon dioxide is a direct consequence of the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, the imposition of a carbon dioxide emissions limit for lorries would, if it were lower than the current average emissions rate, reduce fuel consumption proportionately. The imposition of a carbon dioxide emission limit for lorries, would be technically very difficult and deliver limited environmental benefits.</p>

Additional signs were installed on the M6 to give advanced warning to motorists of queuing traffic and yellow box markings and 'merge in turn' signs were installed at the junction itself, to help regulate traffic movements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1046W.2/3">Currently the HA is investigating significant further measures for longer term improvement, and a number of options are currently under public consultation. Subject to the necessary statutory processes being completed and the availability of funding, work could start in summer 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.2/13">The changes are against a background of an increase in disposable income of 105 per cent. between 1979 and 2007 and 27 per cent. between 1997 and 2007. The decline in the real term cost of travelling by car reflects the significant impact of the decline in real terms cost of purchasing a vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.2/14">While the cost of motoring has fallen in real terms, the overall UK expenditure on motoring has increased over this period as, the estimated number of cars per household has increased from 0.75 in 1979, to 1.02 in 1997 and 1.15 in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.2/15">According to the available data from the Expenditure and Food Survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics, motoring costs were 10 per cent. of household disposable income in 1978, 14 per cent. in 1997-98 and 12 per cent. in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.2/16">Fares and other travel costs were 3 per cent. of household disposable income in 1978, 2 per cent. in 1997-98 and 2 per cent. in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.5/2">The Department recommends all appraisals use the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' shadow price of carbon (SPC) when valuing greenhouse gas emissions. These estimates are used across Government appraisals and, in transport, across the different types of intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.5/3">DEFRA's recent release&mdash;&quot;The Social Cost of Carbon and the Shadow Price of Carbon: What they are, and how to use them in Economic Appraisal in the UK&quot;&mdash;documents the assumptions underpinning the current estimate and the approach used in its calculation. It is conceptually different to the market price for carbon, so the EU trading price of carbon does not enter into DEFRA's assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.5/4">Carbon impacts will vary depending on the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory the world is on. If emissions fail to fall at the rates targeted, the higher will be the trajectory for carbon concentrations and the more damage from climate change. The SPC calculation undertaken by DEFRA is based on Nicholas Stern's analysis of this aspect.</p>

The average of targets placed on MDHUs and the actual performance against these targets since 2006-07 and 2007-08 are shown in the following table.

Areas exceeding the target time are those experiencing high operational tempo (RRUs situated near to or within garrisons with a large numbers of troops returning from deployment); waiting times in these cases can be up to 15 days.

	<p pid="a.1055W.2/1">We have not carried out a specific comparison with the Decent Homes Standard for either Service Family Accommodation (SFA) or Single Living Accommodation (SLA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.2/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has its own well defined criteria for assessing the condition of its properties. For the majority of SFA, this consists of a list of over 100 individual attributes that are assessed to arrive at an overall Standard for Condition (SfC) score for the property. SfC scores are banded into categories, S1fC the highest to S4fC the lowest. SfC assessment includes aspects such as the structure of the property, its energy efficiency, health and safety features, security arrangements and sanitary items as well as an assessment of the kitchen and bedrooms. On that basis, the majority of SFA is already at either S1fC or S2fC. This includes over 12,800 properties that have been upgraded to S1fC since 2001. By the end of this financial year, no Service family will have to live in S4fC accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.2/3">We are confident that the current SfC system used by the Department fully takes into account the four basic tenets of the Decent Homes Standard. Rather than simply conforming to a minimum acceptable level of accommodation, MOD aspires to provide accommodation to a higher standard; and this is reflected in the criteria that must be met to achieve S1fC. (All eight categories must score at Standard 1 for the overall Standard for Condition to be 1).</p>

In addition, it lays down rules for in-service conformity, durability of pollution control devices, on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems, measurement of fuel consumption and accessibility of vehicle repair and maintenance information.

	<p pid="a.1062W.2/4" class="indent">The Nimrod Integrated Project Team within Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) is carrying out a detailed manual analysis of fuel leak data in order to answer your questions. Unfortunately, this is proving to be a time consuming process because the work has been disrupted by the corruption of the relevant database at RAF Kinloss. I am sorry that this has led to the delay in answering your questions, but I expect this analysis to be complete within the next four weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/5" class="indent">In November 2006, after the loss of Nimrod XV230, DE&amp;S introduced new mandatory fuel leak reporting procedures (known as 'Leaflet 70 reports') on all leaks associated with fuel tanks within the fuselage, the fuel system and any residual fuel found in specific areas of the aircraft (such as the bomb bay). So far our analysis indicates that since the introduction of these procedures, 111 fuel leaks (of varying degrees of severity) have been recorded under Leaflet 70. Of course, once the outcome of the ongoing detailed analysis of fuel leak data by DE&amp;S is known, I will write to you again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/6" class="indent">I should point out that following a recent request by the Oxfordshire Coroner relating to fuel leaks reported under Leaflet 70 we have provided the same information to him. In light of this, I was keen to ensure that you received this information as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.5/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, (Official Report, Column 990W) and <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase> (Official Report, Column 181W) about fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/4" class="indent">The Nimrod Integrated Project Team within Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) is carrying out a detailed manual analysis of fuel leak data in order to answer your questions. Unfortunately, this is proving to be a time consuming process because the work has been disrupted by the corruption of the relevant database at RAF Kinloss. I am sorry that this has led to the delay in answering your questions, but I expect this analysis to be complete within the next four weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/5" class="indent">In November 2006, after the loss of Nimrod XV230, DE&amp;S introduced new mandatory fuel leak reporting procedures (known as 'Leaflet 70 reports') on all leaks associated with fuel tanks within the fuselage, the fuel system and any residual fuel found in specific areas of the aircraft (such as the bomb bay). So far our analysis indicates that since the introduction of these procedures, 111 fuel leaks (of varying degrees of severity) have been recorded under Leaflet 70. Of course, once the outcome of the ongoing detailed analysis of fuel leak data by DE&amp;S is known, I will write to you again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/6" class="indent">I should point out that following a recent request by the Oxfordshire Coroner relating to fuel leaks reported under Leaflet 70 we have provided the same information to him. In light of this, I was keen to ensure that you received this information as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/7" class="indent">I am copying this letter to Ian Liddell-Grainger and Sir Nicholas Winterton, who have expressed an interest in this subject.</p>

	<p pid="a.1063W.2/1">The theoretical phenomenon known as &quot;popcorning&quot; is a process whereby a series of accidental detonations of a number of warheads' conventional explosives could lead to some nuclear yield. This is extremely unlikely and could occur only if the warheads were located in close proximity to each other without mitigation. Warheads are designed such that there cannot be a nuclear detonation without authorisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.2/2">Warhead handling, transit and storage facilities, and processes are designed to reduce the risk of popcorning to 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' levels by, for example, separating stored warheads and having physical shielding between them. Similarly, moves of warheads are planned and executed to minimise the proximity of warheads to each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.2/3">Safety in the nuclear weapons programme is of paramount importance. There are well-rehearsed generic response plans in place to protect workers and the general public in the unlikely event of an accident; all measures are taken to ensure acceptable levels of safety throughout the life cycle of the Trident warhead.</p>

	<p pid="a.1063W.5/1">The Defence Training Review Package 1 Project has a requirement for service families accommodation in the St. Athan region from 2013. An Assessment Study has been commissioned by MOD to identify the best value for money options to procure housing for servicemen based at the Defence Technical Academy. This is likely to increase demand for housing in the area in the future. The MOD is therefore working alongside the Vale of Glamorgan, as the planning authority responsible for ensuring demand capacity can be accommodated, to examine how our housing requirements might be met.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072W.3/1">Young people aged under 16 are legally able to consent to medical advice and treatment, including abortion, if a doctor or other health care worker judges them competent to do so. As such, they are entitled to the same duty of care and confidentiality as older patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.3/2">For those young women seeking an abortion, guidance from the Department of Health emphasises that health professionals should discuss the benefits of the young women involving her parents. Where she cannot be persuaded to do so, every effort should be made to find another adult to provide support, for example another family member or specialist youth worker.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.3/3">The duty of confidentiality is not absolute. There will be instances when information needs to be shared with social services and/or the police without consent&mdash;where the young person is engaged in an abusive or coercive relationship, or there is another over-riding public interest to do so such as the prevention or detection of serious crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.3/4">The High Court ruled in 2006 that the guidance is fully in line with the law.</p>

Data Quality<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts, and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of Independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 5. Assessing growth through time<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/>  Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/>  6. Uncrossed Data<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1080W.8/1">The Transforming Community Equipment and Wheelchair Services Programme (TCEWS) was set up on 2006 to design a radial new model for delivery of both community equipment and wheelchairs in England. The remit of the programme was to place service users and carers at the heart of any new service model and build on the strengths of the third and private sector. The overall aim was to develop a new high quality system for delivering equipment which would give those supported by the state the sort of choice and control they have not previously enjoyed. Responsibility for assessment if need remains with local health and social care commissioners.</p>

It will also set out a vision for NHS dentistry in five years time. The evaluation is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

The 2007 report &quot;Making Every Young Person with Diabetes Matter&quot; (copies of which have already been placed in the Library) gives support and guidance on managing the transition period, as well as other aspects of diabetes care for children and young people. Implementation of this guidance will be continually reviewed and will also be assessed through the Child Health and Maternity Services mapping exercise, which aims to create an inventory of all dedicated child health services provided in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.2/2">In the 2007 Child Health Mapping returns, of 242 general paediatric services, 207 (86 per cent.) provided services for children and young people with diabetes, 148 of which had protocols in place for transition to adult diabetes services, and 134 provided a diabetes transition key-worker on all, or most, occasions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1088W.5/1">The commitment given was that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) would be &quot;tough and independent&quot;. This is fulfilled by the Food Standards Act 1999 which set up the FSA and by the code of conduct governing the conduct of its board members. The Act requires, and the capability of the agency's board depends upon, the independence and a wide range of skills and experience of members, who together act in the public interest without regard for their own financial or other interests which could prejudice the exercise of their duties. The balance of skills and experience of the whole board is reviewed at the time of each new appointment to ensure that appropriate independence of the board is maintained.</p>

Where relevant to the topic, those interests are also declared in advance of discussion at all board meetings. The process of appointment of members also ensures that potential conflicts of interest are thoroughly explored.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-07-22a.214043.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-07-22a.1090W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="1090W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080722/text/80722w0024.htm#08072356002250">
	<p pid="a.1090W.0/1">The key elements of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 were as follows. The Act made provision for the creation of national health service foundation trusts (FTs), accountable to local communities rather than the Secretary of State; placed a duty on NHS bodies to monitor and improve the quality of healthcare that they provide; gave the Secretary of State power to publish standards in relation to healthcare; created a Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (usually referred to as the Healthcare Commission (HCC)) and a Commission for Social Care Inspection; and made new provisions in relation to primary dental services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.0/2">There are now 103 NHS FTs in place. NHS FTs have demonstrated their ability to establish strong finances and deliver high quality services; the Healthcare Commission's Annual Healthcheck for 2006-07 showed that FTs are delivering better care and improved finances compared to non-FTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.0/3">The Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, or HCC, reports directly to Parliament on the state of healthcare in England, and on the quality of NHS and independent healthcare, and its value for money. The assessment of individual providers of NHS healthcare takes into account the standards for healthcare published by Secretary of State. By bringing together the expertise of previous health inspection bodies, the HCC is helping to reduce the fragmentation of inspection, easing the burdens on front-line staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.0/4">Similarly, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is an independent body, which provides a comprehensive picture of the quality of social care services and the performance of local authorities in meeting social care needs in their areas. It gives a star rating to councils annually and, from 2008, a quality rating to care services. The CSCI regulates, inspects and reviews all adult social care services in the public, private and voluntary sectors in England. It does so on the basis of regulations and standards issued by the Secretary of State. It makes an annual report to Parliament on the state of social care that gives a comprehensive overview of the social care sector in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090W.0/5">The following amendments were made to this Act following the granting of Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-20">20 November 2003</phrase>:</p>

In response to the research, the Department&mdash;in consultation with Gypsy and Traveller communities and NHS organisations&mdash;has embarked on work to improve the health status of community members. As part of the Department's Pacesetters programme, designed to address health inequalities that arise from discrimination and disadvantage, the 18 participating trusts are trialling ways to improve access to the NHS for Gypsies and Travellers. In addition, DH intends to take forward work to develop a primary care commissioning framework for Gypsies and Travellers as part of wider work for transient populations. Results of both pieces of work will be disseminated widely throughout the NHS over the next 12 to 24 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.1095W.2/1">The guidelines on the quality of herbal medicinal products prepared by the European Medicines Agency largely reflect good practice identified by the herbal industry. In its regulatory impact assessment of the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) estimated that typically the costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed. The MHRA would expect some rationalisation in the manufacturing of herbal medicines reflecting the fact that to carry out this activity to systematic standards within a regulated environment requires specialist expertise. However, there is no basis on which to make specific estimates and feedback to the MHRA from individual companies suggest that many are still developing their plans. So far 14 companies have submitted applications to register one or more product in the United Kingdom under the THR scheme and we therefore anticipate that there will be a competitive market.</p>

	<p pid="a.1097W.8/1">The retail model developed for community equipment met with overall approval from the sector. The outline business case was sufficiently robust to support developing the outline model to operational status. This has been undertaken through a shadow running process in the north-west with local authority and health partners in Cheshire, Manchester and Oldham.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097W.8/2">Through shadow running, users and their carers have been able to take an equipment prescription for simple aids to daily living to an accredited retailer and receive in exchange the prescribed equipment. The users own the equipment. They were also able to top up this prescription to a product that better suited their lifestyle and pay the difference to the retailer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097W.8/3">The shadow running process demonstrated improvements in the user experience and efficiency of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097W.8/4">Cheshire and Oldham have decided to implement the model locally. This confirms that, in their areas, the new prescription processes have been demonstrated to be effective and are capable of being scaled up to support full implementation of the retail model.</p>

	<p pid="a.1099W.8/1">No such estimate has been made. However, the 2001 census was the first time information on the numbers of carers was available on the basis of a detailed count. The 2001 census indicates that there are some six million people providing unpaid care in the United Kingdom. Some of these cared for people will have mental health issues. However, this figure does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals being cared for, as there is not a one to one ratio of carers to care-recipients.</p>

	<p pid="a.1100W.3/1">In September 2007 the Department, in collaboration with the National Treatment Agency for substance misuse (NTA) published guidelines for the clinical management of drug treatment services, &quot;Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.3/2">The guidelines note that patients prescribed methadone</p>

	<p pid="a.1100W.3/4">The guideline goes on to note that during assessment clinicians should inform patients of the</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.3/5" class="indent">&quot;risks to children of ingesting prescribed medication and the importance of safe storage must be emphasised at the first appointment and repeatedly thereafter. Assessment of compliance with these safety measures should form part of the decision-making concerning dispensing and supervision arrangements&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.3/6">of methadone prescribing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.3/7">In January 2007, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published the &quot;Technology Appraisal&quot; &quot;Methadone and buprenorphine for managing opioid dependence&quot;, which recommended the use of both methadone and buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.3/8">This Appraisal notes the risks that the use of methadone (or buprenorphine) has for non-drug users, especially children who may be at risk of accidental ingestion, and that</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.3/9" class="indent">&quot;the responsible clinician, in consultation with the person, should estimate the risks and benefits of prescribing methadone or buprenorphine, taking account of the person's lifestyle and family situation (for example, whether they are considered chaotic and might put children and other opioid-na?ve individuals living with them at risk)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.3/10">Local clinical governance protocols for drug treatment would normally require recording of any serious incidents concerning the 'misuse' of prescribed methadone so that appropriate action can be taken to ensure that any risk or harm is minimised and is not repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.3/11">Earlier this year the NTA launched a consultation on clinical governance in drug treatment, with the aim of publishing guidance later this year. This will help commissioners and service providers shape the local implementation of clinical governance systems in this important area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1101W.5/1">The NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS) was created in April 2003, with policy and operational responsibility for security management within the national health service. A comprehensive strategy has been implemented detailing the preventative proactive and reactive action that is to be taken both nationally and locally to tackle this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/2">A network of local security management specialists (LSMS) supported nationally by the NHS SMS guidance, has been introduced. LSMS are tasked with ensuring that security work within their individual health bodies is effective. In particular they are guided to ensure that every incident of violence against NHS staff is reported, acted upon and evaluated so that measures can be adopted to prevent repeated incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/3">In 2006 the NHS SMS signed agreements with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), outlining how the NHS, CPS and police will work together to drive down assaults and ensure tougher punishment for offenders. It commits the police, CPS and NHS to pursue every reported incident of violence and abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/4">Mandatory conflict resolution training has also been introduced for all frontline NHS staff, with over 450,000 staff trained by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/5">A national physical assault reporting system (PARS) has been developed to monitor and respond to incidents of assault against NHS staff. Using a clear definition as to what constitutes a physical assault, figures for the number of reported assaults against NHS staff 2006-07, released on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-05">5 November 2007</phrase>, indicate there were 4,676 fewer than 2004-05. The number of criminal sanctions against those perpetrating violence against NHS staff, also released in November 2007, rose to 869, a 17-fold increase from 2002-03 when figures were first collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/6">New measures to tackle nuisance and disturbance behaviour on NHS premises have also been introduced in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. As well as reducing the impact of this behaviour on the delivery of health care, this legislation gives health bodies the power to remove an individual displaying this behaviour before an incident may escalate into violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/7">A project to identify the best available alarm device technology to protect vulnerable lone workers is currently under way. The project will centrally fund the allocation of up to 30,000 devices and introduce a purchasing framework whereby health bodies can purchase any further requirements at the best price possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.5/8">Training for all frontline staff in preventative skills remains a commitment as does the development of the network of LSMS in health bodies to ensure that all effective action is taken to prevent and deter violence against all NHS staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.1103W.3/1">My right hon. Friend The Secretary of State would grant closed directions under section 7(2) of the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1967 in respect of staff transferred under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) to qualifying social enterprises. A qualifying social enterprise is a business with primarily social objectives whose surpluses are principally reinvested for that purpose in the business or in the community. The following legal forms will be acceptable; a registered charity, a community interest company or an industrial and provident society. The terms of the direction would mean that staff would be able to remain members of the NHS Pension scheme. The direction would be specific to the staff named on the direction, the organisation applying for the direction and to them remaining working wholly on the contract in respect of which they were transferred or other national health service contracts. If staff are subsequently transferred to another social enterprise or organisation qualifying for a direction, then a further direction would be granted in respect of those transferring staff. Directions will not cover a member of staff recruited individually in the open market from the NHS or elsewhere.</p>

The first five to 10 areas covered in 2008-2009 will be able to bid for additional funding over each of the next three years to support local improvements. The total investment over the next three years is subject to finalising PCT allocations for 2009-10 and 2010-11, which will be set later this year.</p>

We have already met large numbers of adult protection co-ordinators and safeguarding leads and sought their views as part of our early consultation events. We will continue to do this. We are also identifying safeguarding leads in the national health service in order to look at the issue more closely in a health context. In addition, we have commissioned a review of the lessons learned from serious case reviews.</p>

	<p pid="a.1108W.8/1">A small number of representations have been made in recent weeks from a small minority of establishments who have had difficulties meeting the deadline; additional help has been available to them over the course of the last year and support and advice is still being provided to make sure that they operate within the requirements of the law; the vast majority of mental health units have not encountered difficulties and indeed are benefiting from an end to the smoking den culture in mental health establishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.8/2">The Government commissioned the Tobacco Control Collaborating Centre (TCCC) to provide support to mental health service providers in the lead up to the implementation of the smokefree legislation in residential mental health units on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-01">1 July 2008</phrase>. Over the past year the TCCC wrote to all foundation trusts, national health service trusts and independent providers asking about their smokefree policies and inviting individual trusts to request additional support, such as visits. The TCCC has also worked with regional stop smoking leads to organise local workshops to address implementation issues. This initial contact was followed up by sending mental health providers smokefree resources, accompanied by a further offer of support to trusts on an individual basis. To date 24 mental health service providers have been visited.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.8/3">Due to the one year gap between wider implementation of smokefree legislation and implementation in mental health units it is too early for comparisons to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.8/4">Currently, the Department has made no assessment of advice given on giving up smoking to patients with a mental health problem by either general practitioners or clinicians in secondary care and nor has an assessment been made of the beneficial effects of smoking on coping with symptoms of mental distress. However, the Government are committed to review the impact of the smokefree law in its entirety within three years of implementation.</p>

Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 5. Data Quality&mdash;HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 6. Assessing growth through time&mdash;HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be accounted for when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be accounted for when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 7. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&mdash;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> 8. Ungrossed Data&mdash;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Figures for FCEs do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.</p>
