It is therefore not possible to identify how much individual authorities receive specifically for concessionary travel.</p>

	<p pid="b.878W.0/2">London 2012 official sponsors have the right to activate their sponsorship, including for mass participation initiatives. There are no plans to allow other commercial organisations to associate directly with the games, which would undermine the exclusive association for which the official sponsors have paid. In exceptional circumstances, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic games and Paralympic games and the International Olympic Committee may approve a project which has non-Olympic commercial support, provided they have absolute confidence the company will not gain any association with the 2012 games.</p>

	<p pid="b.882W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) does not collect this information. Independent research was commissioned from the University of York by MOD and its colleagues in the Ex-Service Action Group on Homelessness (ESAG). The research found that the percentage of veterans among London's homeless population was 6 per cent. in 2007 compared with 22 per cent. in separate research in 1997. We are exploring opportunities for further research to find out the extent of veterans homelessness in the rest of the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.884W.5/1">The cost of moving 42 Engineer Regiment (Geographic) and its headquarters from Hermitage, together with 14 Sqn of the Regiment, located at Ayrshire Barracks, Moenchengladbach, Germany, is estimated to be &pound;18.9 million (net present value over 25 years). A decision on the date for the start of the project is expected by March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.884W.5/2">The intention is for the Royal School of Military Survey to collocate with other intelligence training organisations at Chicksands, Bedfordshire. As the project is still in its initial stage, with the investment appraisal still to be completed, no confirmed date or cost is available. Any announcement on a date for relocation is unlikely before October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.884W.5/3">The relocations will not only improve operational effectiveness by collocating intelligence capabilities at RAF Wyton and intelligence training at Chicksands, but will enable significant long term savings in estate management and support costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.884W.5/4">The MOD will work to minimise the impact on civilian staff at Hermitage by providing any assistance it can to those who may be affected, relocating personnel and avoiding compulsory redundancies wherever possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.900W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.11/2">The Government have introduced a comprehensive programme of work to prevent and tackle cyberbullying. We introduced legal provisions in the 2006 Education Act which gave school staff new powers to confiscate mobile phones, and to discipline pupils for bad behaviour outside the school gate, including cyberbullying. We published detailed guidance for schools on how to prevent and tackle cyberbullying in September 2007, and have more recently produced a resource pack for school staff which includes a DVD and a booklet for teachers. We ran a digital information campaign on cyberbullying last year aimed at 12 to 15-years-olds, and re-launched the campaign as part of this year's Anti-Bullying Week. We are currently working with the Cyberbullying Taskforce including industry representatives, law enforcement agencies, the teacher unions and children's charities to produce new guidance to prevent and tackle the cyberbullying of school staff, which we plan to launch in spring 2009. We have asked the Anti-Bullying Alliance and National Strategies to work with local authorities and schools to ensure the cyberbullying guidance is effectively implemented on the ground, and that schools make effective use of the other materials.</p>

To apply the reduction would incur costs in re-printing publicity material and revising contracts with third-party ticket partners. Wherever possible, prices will be held at December 2008 levels and planned rises postponed. Where prices are increasing, these will be modest and in line with other market forces.</p>

VisitBritain will publish its strategic review on tourism support in February 2009 and we are confident this will improve their ability to market Britain internationally and England at home. Recently, VisitBritain and VisitEngland launched a &pound;6.5 million 'Value for Money Campaign'. This will build on the current domestic and international Enjoy England Campaign, which positions England and Britain as good value destinations.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.9/1">As we did in Thailand following the blockade of Bangkok airports, we will use Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Travel Advice and the local diplomatic mission's website to provide practical, objective, accurate and up-to-date information to British nationals caught up in similar protests and blockades. We also encourage British nationals to register their overseas travel through the FCO's online travel registration system called LOCATE. British nationals can use LOCATE to tell us where they are travelling and register their contact details. It only takes a few minutes to register with LOCATE and the facility can be found on the FCO's website, alongside our Travel Advice pages. If a British national registers with LOCATE and an incident similar to the airport blockades in Bangkok occurs, our diplomatic mission in the country and crisis response teams in the UK can use the listed contact details to keep people fully informed.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.9/2">During the disruption in Thailand we have been in close contact with airlines that have the majority of British ticket holders and have consistently encouraged them to lay on additional flights and honour their responsibilities to their ticket holders. As and when additional emergency flights were scheduled during the blockade, we passed on details of those British nationals who had contacted us to the flight organisers. We understand that many British nationals were able to leave Thailand as a result. Given a similar situation in another country we would expect to take all appropriate and necessary action to ensure British nationals are given similar assistance if required.</p>

	<p pid="b.909W.5/1">The Government have set a deliberately stretching target that all new homes must be zero carbon by 2016. The stamp duty land tax relief (SDLT) for zero carbon homes was introduced to help kick-start the market for new highly efficient technologies in homes, both for the fabric of the building and in the use of microgeneration, and sets a gold standard for green homes. Few currently exist, but the purpose of the relief is to act as a signal. We have always made it clear that the SDLT relief for zero carbon homes would evolve and we expect to see more of these homes built in the future. Eighteen homes have qualified for the zero carbon homes relief since October 2007, broken down by month and stamp duty band as follows. The total amount of relief given since October 2007 is around &pound;70,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.918W.6/1">The Department, and its agencies, use 42 0845 telephone numbers to provide a range of services to the public. These include IT support for online enquiries, customer service inquiries, contact with the jury summoning office and a small number of courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.6/2">The 0845 numbers were introduced because, at the time, calls from anywhere in the UK were charged at a local rate making it cheaper for people to make contact rather than using the exchange number. With the expansion of the telecommunications markets, call charges are now set by the individual phone companies, often as part of wider service packages. The charges vary, and are outside the control of the Department. Where possible, customers are also given the exchange number, as depending on the individual inquirer's telephone plan, 0845 may not now be the cheapest option.</p>

	<p pid="b.922W.5/1">Through the White Paper &quot;Care Matters: Time for Change&quot; and the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 the Government have put in place a range of measures to improve the educational support and placement stability of looked after children.

Determination of these budgets will be a local matter for both local authorities and partnering PCTs. There are however some local authority grants from Government which pilot areas may wish to incorporate. We will indicate in guidance to pathfinder areas that we would like them to explore how the Area Based Grant and the Aiming High for Disabled Children block within the Sure Start Early Years and Childcare Grant can be utilised within individual budgets.

	<p pid="b.924W.5/1">Improving standards of children's writing is a major priority for this Government, and will be vital in ensuring we reach our Public Service Agreement targets in 2011 for 78 per cent. of children to be reaching the expected level in English and maths.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.5/2">Since September 2008 we have been piloting Every Child a Writer, a commitment from our Children's Plan, with funding of &pound;25 million over three years. This programme aims to improve children's writing through leading teacher support for class teachers and intensive one-to-one tuition in the areas of writing children find hardest to master. Every Child a Writer is being piloted in nine local authorities and is due to scale up to reach all local authorities by 2010/11. From next year a further 60 local authorities will enter the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.5/3">In September we also launched new materials called Support for Writing for teaching children to write across Key Stages 1 and 2. This guidance and exemplification is available online through the Primary Framework, and is based on effective teaching strategies in the areas we know children find hardest about writing at the moment. The materials focus on ensuring children make good progress in their writing through outlining incremental small steps in learning within the year and specific classroom examples of how teachers might chose to approach each step.</p>

	<p pid="b.925W.3/1">The &quot;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives&quot; strategy, published in January 2008 set out the Government's comprehensive plans to reduce obesity&mdash;initially focusing on children. Every child should grow up eating well and enjoying being active and we want parents to have the knowledge and confidence to make this happen. There is no single, simple solution to reducing rates of overweight and obesity and therefore Government are taking action on a number of fronts.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.3/2">The updated Child Health Promotion Programme was published in March 2008 and prioritises obesity prevention and physical activity through positive parenting during pregnancy and the early years of their children's lives while supporting families facing particular risk factors attributed to causing obesity. We are working to support as many mothers as possible to breastfeed and to continue to breastfeed for longer&mdash;helped by schools, children's centres, health and other services, all promoting healthy weight. The introduction of the Early Years Foundation Stage for 0 to 5-year-olds means that all early years education providers must promote the good health of children, by providing healthy, nutritious food and active play. The Play Strategy, launched in December 2008, sets how Government will invest &pound;235 million over 2008-09 to 2010-11 to develop play facilities for children of all ages.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.3/3">Once children start school they can benefit from school food which must meet statutory nutritional and nutrient-based standards. Nine out of 10 children aged five to 16 now take part in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport each week, compared to one in four in 2002. Nearly all schools are currently participating in the National Healthy Schools Programme with over two-thirds with full National Healthy School Status, having demonstrated they have in place the minimum evidence for 41 criteria across four themes: emotional health and well-being; healthy eating; physical activity and personal, social, health and economic education.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.3/4">The National Child Measurement Programme, which weighs and measures children in reception year and year 6 is now in its fourth year and has a participation rate of 88 per cent. From 2008, primary care trusts can routinely feed back the results to parents. All this is supported by the Change4Life campaign which aims to help families eat well, move more and live longer and which is initially focused on families with young children.</p>

We will shortly be collecting data on the number of deaths reviewed by each LSCB in 2008-09 and the number of these deaths which boards assessed as having been preventable.

Lord Laming's work will address key features of good safeguarding practice and whether they are being universally applied across the country, including the development of the professional work force, inter-agency working and effective means of public accountability. Lord Laming will also look at what specific actions should be taken by national Government and other agencies to accelerate improvement across the country.</p>

The Department's advertising spend and that of its predecessor (DfES) since 2004 is set out in the following tables, with a breakdown of individual campaigns. All figures exclude VAT.

	<p pid="b.930W.9/1">Grandparents who care for their grandchildren are entitled to the same help from services as any other relative.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.9/2">Education legislation makes no distinction between parents and other carers with whom the child is living with regard to service entitlement. Grandparents are also entitled to the same family support services as any parent. Family support services may be provided by a local authority under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need in their area, including promoting the upbringing of such children by their families. These services may include financial help if that is the most appropriate way to meet the child's needs. If grandparents or any other relative are caring for a child who is looked after by the local authority, they will be approved as local authority foster carers and entitled to the same financial allowances and support services as any other foster carer.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.9/3">We are also seeking to improve services and supports to relative carers through a number of measures as set out in the &quot;Care Matters&quot; White Paper. The Children and Young Persons Act, which received royal assent in November 2008 makes it easier for relative carers to obtain an order giving them parental responsibility for the child and to receive financial support on a longer term basis where this is seen to be the most appropriate way to safeguard and promote the child's welfare.</p>

These give fostering providers a framework for their foster carers' training and professional development. CWDC are currently working with stakeholders to develop a professional development framework for social care workers, this will incorporate the foster care training support and development framework. CWDC are also developing core standards specific to residential care workers that will raise the quality of care and support a child can expect to receive in the home. We will be linking this work to the National Minimum Standards (NMS) as part of our review of the NMS. We will be consulting on changes to these during 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.942W.5/1">Provisional figures show that in 2007 there were 190 accidental dwelling fire deaths in England, down 18 per cent. from the 2006 figure of 233 accidental dwelling fire deaths. This is the lowest figure for accidental dwelling fire deaths in England since 1981.</p>
	<p pid="b.942W.5/2">The fire safety campaign has been running under the Fire Kills brand for the last 10 years and has been a pivotal part of the Government's success in reducing domestic fire deaths. The success of the Fire Kills campaign has been largely due to a series of national advertising campaigns, focused on the use and maintenance of smoke alarms. There is strong evidence that the public respond positively to the campaign's messages, and have bought smoke alarms as a result of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.942W.5/3">The most recent campaign, 'Pull Your Finger Out', first ran from January to March 2008. The smoke alarm industry reported a significant increase in sales during this period, while pre- and post-tracking research has shown that the percentage of people who could recall fire safety advertising without being prompted rose from 46 to 64 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.943W.8/1">We allocated over &pound;200 million to local authorities and the voluntary sector between 2008-09 to 2010-11 to tackle homelessness effectively. This is the biggest ever cash injection for homelessness and rough sleeping services. The latest statutory homelessness statistics were published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-11">11 December 2008</phrase>, and includes statistics up to the July to September quarter. This showed that local housing authority homelessness acceptances fell compared to the previous quarter and year, with 14,340 during the quarter, and the number of households placed in temporary accommodation has continued to fall, for the twelfth consecutive quarter, to 72,130 by the end of September.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.8/2">We also recently announced a &pound;200 million Mortgage Rescue Scheme to help vulnerable homeowners. This scheme is available to all local authorities and will aim to help up to 6,000 of the most vulnerable households avoid the trauma of repossession and possible risk of homelessness over the next two years. This scheme is now operational.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.8/3">Alongside this, the new Homeowner Mortgage Support Scheme, which was announced in the Queen's Speech, will enable households that experience a significant and temporary loss of income as a result of the economic downtown to defer a proportion of interest payments on their mortgage for up to two years. The Government will guarantee the deferred interest payments in return for banks' participation in the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.947W.8/1">Local authorities are responsible for the collection and disposal of waste in their local area. Communities and Local Government has not produced guidance on whether unauthorised developments and encampments should receive waste collection services. However, 'Guidance on Managing Unauthorised Camping', published in 2004, gives guidance on dealing with waste and fly-tipping when managing an unauthorised encampment, including the use of Codes of Expected Behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.947W.8/2">Local authorities may want to consider whether the provision of means to enable Gypsies and Travellers on unauthorised encampments to dispose of their rubbish and waste, for an appropriate fee, is appropriate in individual circumstances. Such action was recommended by the Independent Task Group on Site Provision and Enforcement and could help to minimise costs to the authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.958W.9/2">The development of the National Fraud Reporting Centre will be to perceive the nature of frauds as they develop. It will put together intelligence packages that it will then distribute to try to help businesses to spot the fraud before it happens, and to disrupt it in order to ensure that people are well informed of the tactics used. The SFO investigates serious and/or complex fraud against whomever it is aimed.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.9/3">I recognise the particular need to do what we can to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the current economic climate.</p>

	<p pid="b.963W.6/1">The national Scores on the Doors (SotD) schemes (one for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and one for Scotland) are being established by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.6/2">The most significant costs of implementing the SotD schemes are those of the FSA. These costs are for providing support to local authorities operating the scheme, a communications strategy, and for establishing a web-based information technology platform for disseminating scores to consumers. These costs are estimated to be between &pound;3 million and &pound;5.7 million over the first three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.6/3">Costs for local authorities and the food industry will depend on the number of local authorities that choose to implement the SotD schemes. For businesses covered, there will be a one-off cost for familiarisation which is estimated at &pound;16 per business. For local authorities there will be time costs associated with the FSA-funded training that are estimated at &pound;125 per officer trained. There will also be annual costs per authority of an estimated &pound;3,000 for printing and issuing of certificates, and an estimated &pound;600 for handling appeals. There may also be costs for re-inspection or re-visits for the purposes of re-scoring for which local authorities may charge, along with costs associated with any legal challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.6/4">It is estimated that there will be an economic saving of around &pound;12.3 million over a three year period associated with a one per cent, decrease in food-borne illness resulting from operation of the SotD schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.964W.3/1">The national health inequalities public service agreement target (PSA) aims to reduce inequalities in health by 10 per cent. by 2010, as measured by infant mortality (by socio-economic group) and life expectancy at birth (by geographical area).</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.3/2">Since the 1997-99 baseline the infant mortality gap has widened, and latest 2005-07 data show the infant mortality rate among the Routine and Manual group was 16 per cent. higher than in the total population. However, the gap has narrowed in recent years and if the rate observed since 2002-04 continues, the infant mortality element of target will be met.</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.3/3">Life expectancy in England and in the Spearhead Group (the 70 local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators, and the 62 primary care trusts mapping to them, and a focus of action for this element of the target) is at record levels. If the rest of England still had the life expectancy it had in 1995-97 (the target baseline), Spearhead areas would not just have narrowed the gap by 10 per cent., they would have closed it completely. However, the increase in Spearhead areas is not as great as in non-Spearheads so the gap has not narrowed. The latest 2005-07 data show that the percentage gap in life expectancy between the Spearhead Group and the England average has increased to 4 per cent. above baseline for men and 11 per cent. above baseline for women (the target is a 10 per cent. narrowing for both).</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.3/4">The health inequalities target was deliberately set to be ambitious. Some progress has been made. However, we acknowledge that more remains to be done. &quot;Health Inequalities: Progress and Next Steps&quot; (June 2008), a copy has already been placed in the Library, reaffirmed our commitment to tackling inequalities, and meeting this PSA target. Our focus now is to provide tailored, intensive, support to the Spearhead areas, and areas with high infant mortality, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.3/5" class="indent">an additional &pound;34 million in spending for inequalities programmes in 2008-09;</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.3/6" class="indent">investing more in the National Support Team for health inequalities to reach all Spearheads by summer 2009, enhancing the National Support Team for Tobacco Control, and establishing new National Support Teams for Alcohol and Infant Mortality; and</p>

	<p pid="b.965W.2/14">England has one of the best uptake rates of the flu jab in Europe for those aged 65 and over.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.2/15">This year the Department has reminded health professionals of the importance of protecting younger patients in other risk groups and we will look carefully at the results when final vaccine uptake data for 2008-09 is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.2/16">In 2008 research was carried out with adults in at-risk groups. It identified that there are a number of challenges to improving vaccine uptake in younger at-risk groups and that because the use of the term 'flu' and 'cold' had become almost interchangeable, flu was not regarded as a serious concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.2/17">The Department is planning to introduce a new flu vaccination advertising campaign for the 2009-10 flu season. One of the aims of the new advertising approach is to improve targeting of the message to people aged under 65 with long-term conditions, while maintaining uptake rates among those aged 65 and over. These research findings are being fed into the development of the new campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.2/18">Uptake among health care workers is low in most developed countries and this is a concern that is not specific to the UK. To address low uptake in health care workers, the Department held a flu conference in June 2008 for flu leads working in PCTs and also in occupational health. The conference focused on sharing ideas for improving vaccine uptake among health professionals.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.2/19">We also launched a new flu vaccine leaflet for health care workers and are currently working on a communications strategy that will provide support to occupational health departments in delivering all occupational health vaccinations, because immunising health care workers with the flu vaccine is the responsibility of the employer.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.2/20">The poultry workers programme has a slightly different focus to the other seasonal flu programmes. Its purpose is to reduce the risk of a poultry worker being exposed to an avian flu virus at the same time as they were infected with seasonal flu virus. It is theoretically possible that the two viruses could mix to produce a new strain of flu virus which could possibly lead to a pandemic. This programme is primarily aimed at reducing the risk of a pandemic virus emerging in this country.</p>

From April 2009, the comprehensive area assessment (CAA) will bring together assessments of performance across each local area and these may apply to anything done by local authorities acting alone or in partnership. It will place particular emphasis on delivery against identified LAA priorities for the local area. The first findings under CAA are likely to be reported in autumn 2009. Data which is used to measure the performance of different places with respect to key Government targets will be available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.966W.2/3">Individual targets were monitored by Government offices for the regions and strategic health authorities but no comprehensive assessment was made against the health targets in the previous rounds of LAAs in place since 2005-06. To do an assessment of the thousands of health-related targets in these LAAs would involve a disproportionate cost to the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.969W.6/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether the two major projects on child maintenance debt referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General in July 2008 have now been completed; what their main findings were; and if he will place in the Library copies of each project.</p>
	<p pid="b.969W.6/6" class="indent">In response to the annual audit of its client funds accounts the Child Support Agency commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to lead two reviews of how the Agency reported child maintenance debt in its Annual Report and Accounts. The first review concerned the accuracy of the reported debt balance and the associated receipts and payments. The second review concerned the collectability of the child maintenance debt balance as reported in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.969W.6/7" class="indent">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, which is now responsible for the Child Support Agency has yet to receive the final reports.

Fixed length sanctions are sanctions of two weeks (four weeks if repeated within 12 months, and 26 weeks if already received a four week sanction within last 12 months) imposed for refusal, without good cause, to attend an employment programme or carry out a Jobseeker's direction.

	<p pid="b.978W.2/4" class="indent">We offer a wide range of support for people facing redundancy. This includes helping support employers to retain their staff through retraining; and encouraging staff to gain vocational qualifications to prepare for the economic recovery rather than having to make staff redundant. We work with partners such as Business Link (who have reduced many of their fees for Small and Medium Enterprises) and directing employers to Train to Gain for a business check-up and funding for training.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/5" class="indent">We also offer advice on how employees can claim benefits and support employers where they need to go into short time or temporary stop working and we are tailoring our advice to meet the their needs. We will also visit employees facing redundancy at their place of work to explain the support and benefits available to them. Employees can also access the vacancies we hold nationally by visiting our website at <a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk">www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk</a> or by telephoning us on 0845 6060 234 and by using the jobpoints at their local Jobcentre.</p>

The service is being promoted through relevant press and online. The pre-Budget report announced a further doubling of Rapid Response Service funding&mdash;&pound;12 million will be available in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/7" class="indent">Through the Rapid Response Service, Jobcentre Plus has access to funds to enable those individuals made redundant to receive the necessary help to get them back into work. Such measures could include:</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/8" class="indent">Skills Transfer Analysis (to help identify an individual's transferable skills and training needs relevant to the local labour market);</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/9" class="indent">Job-Focussed Training (to assist individuals with appropriate training and certification linked to employment or self-employment linked to the needs of the local labour market).</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/10" class="indent">We work with partners such as Response to Redundancy who have access to funding via the East of England Development Agency to assist employees with re-training and CV writing. We can also arrange for a Business Link representative to advise staff on self-employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/11" class="indent">We have recently decided that our customers in Essex can have access to CV writing, Jobsearch advice and support through our Programme Centres immediately rather than waiting six months. We have also produced a leaflet for employers and partner organisations such as Business Link and local authority Economic Development Officers to ensure they are aware of the support we can provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/12" class="indent">In November we contacted 13 businesses to offer our assistance and support following notification of possible redundancies. Eleven accepted our assistance while two had already made provision for their staff to be redeployed within their own companies. Our staff visited and talked to five of these businesses and we sent copies of our Job Kits to the remaining six companies. Our Job Kit provides practical help and advice to employees when applying for jobs. We also issue employees with a leaflet that describes how to claim benefits, find work and re-train.</p>

	<p pid="b.986W.0/1">The available information relates to offences recorded by the police and data is given in the tables for 1998-99 to 2007-08. A number of changes have been made to recorded crime in response to suggestions in the two reviews of crime statistics. One such change is that the term 'violent crime' is no longer used in connection with the recorded crime statistics and we now provide figures for violence against the person.</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.0/2">In 1998-99, the recorded crime coverage was extended and substantial revisions were made to the counting rules. Figures prior to that date are therefore not directly comparable and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.994W.3/2">The Government are determined to do all they can to prevent funds from reaching terrorists. Operators located in Great Britain who wish to offer gambling through internet websites must apply for a Remote Operating Licence from the Gambling Commission. The Gambling Commission undertakes a strict examination of an operator's suitability before determining their application.</p>
	<p pid="b.994W.3/3">Furthermore, operators licensed by the Gambling Commission who offer casino games through websites form part of the regulated sector covered by the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. These regulations implement the terms of the Third EU Directive on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, and include a duty to verify the identity of customers. A breach could constitute a criminal offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.994W.3/4">The Gambling Commission is the supervisory authority for casinos and operators must act in accordance with the Gambling Commission's guidance on anti-money laundering, The Prevention of Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism&mdash;Guidance for remote and non-remote casinos'. This guidance is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.994W.3/6" class="indent">and a copy will be placed in the House Library. The operators of all gambling websites should ensure their staff are made aware of their duties under the Terrorism Act 2000 for the reporting of suspicious activity relating to terrorist finance offences.</p>
