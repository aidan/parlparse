	<p pid="a.283W.3/1">DFID's unearmarked &pound;50 million support, along with the resources of other contributing donors, are managed by the World Bank in a pooled trust fund which reimburses Government for any expenditures that meet certain eligibility criteria. This puts the government of Afghanistan in the lead, in setting and implementing its development priorities. As these resources are pooled, specific expenditures cannot, by definition, be ascribed to any one donor.</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.3/2">The ARTF is split into two windows, the recurrent window (which meets the essential recurrent costs of the Government) and the investment window (which provides financing for development activities under Government National Priority Programmes). This year $280 million of donor contributions were allocated to the recurrent window. Of these resources, 69 per cent. of expenditures were spent on salaries (predominantly for teachers), 6 per cent. on pensions and the remaining 25 per cent. on operations and maintenance costs (e.g. fuel and electricity for Ministries). Split by Ministry, the largest share (39 per cent.) went to the Ministry of Education. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Public Health, Labour and Social Affairs, Higher Education and Martyrs and Disabled all received approximately 5 per cent. each with other Ministries also receiving smaller sums.</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.3/3">The remaining $120 million, including DFID's earmarked &pound;5 million for each of the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) and Microfinance Investment Service Facility Afghanistan (MISFA), was allocated to the following 11 national priority programmes through the investment window:</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.3/4" class="indent">Technical Assistance Feasibility Studies</p>

A further &pound;10,000 development assistance was provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo in 2003-04, and cannot be further disaggregated. Similarly, it is not possible to disaggregate further the British share of assistance provided through multilateral channels such as the EC, the World Bank and the United Nations.

On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, the DCA was restructured and assumed responsibility for the magistrates courts and at that time reviewed and republished its RES in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, DCA took on responsibility for the tribunal service this paved the way for the Department to revise and harmonise its RES and this was published in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/3">Our revised Race Equality Scheme lays out in detail how we have implemented the Race Equality Duty. This includes information on how we:</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/4" class="indent">assess, and consult on, the likely impact proposed policies will have on promoting race equality;</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/5" class="indent">monitor policies for any adverse impact on promoting race equality;</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/6" class="indent">publish the results of assessments, consultation, and monitoring;</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/7" class="indent">make sure the public have access to information and services; and</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/8" class="indent">train staff to carry out the general duty and the specific duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/9">A copy of our Race Equality Scheme is available at</p>

	<p pid="a.293W.2/11">Throughout the process of reviewing the scheme, DCA have consulted external stakeholders, business areas within the DCA, its associated offices and agencies. As part of the monitoring and evaluation progress DCA will continue consult as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/12">Since 2001, staff have received awareness training in relation to their responsibilities under the race legislation. In September 2006, senior managers attended workshops that raised awareness about how to continually embed equality and diversity into the business. As to achievements the Department has a management development programme for black and minority ethnic staff, positive action training which gives assess of information to the community which assists participates to realise their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/13">DCA is part of the Race and Diversity Action Group (RADAG), which requires all criminal justice agencies in London to demonstrate how they implement the Race Relations and Disability Discrimination Acts&mdash;RADAG is chaired by Lee Jasper, Race Advisor to the Mayor of London.</p>

	<p pid="a.300W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.2/2">The 2004 English House Condition Survey estimated that district or communal heating systems supply heating to 250,000 homes in the social sector, around 150,000 of these being local authority stock, the rest registered social landlord stock. These homes have an average energy efficiency rating of 75 compared to 58 for the two sectors as a whole (homes rated using the SAP 2001 methodology).</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.2/3">We do not have information on actual energy use by the occupants. The average SAP suggests district heating systems are generally very efficient. The decent homes standards requires homes to provide thermal comfort through having both efficient heating and effective insulation. Our guidance for delivering decent homes sets out the means by which landlords can meet this thermal comfort criterion, and also recommends that they seek to go further to improve energy efficiency, for example by replacing inefficient boilers, or installing extra insulation or double glazing.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.2/4">Under the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC), electricity and gas suppliers are required to achieve targets for the promotion of improvements in domestic energy efficiency which includes social sector homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.300W.5/2">DEFRA has issued extensive guidance to livestock and bird keepers. This includes guidance to hobby farmers on biosecurity measures to protect their birds from avian influenza, which is also available on the DEFRA website. It is crucial that keepers follow these measures at all times, not just during a disease outbreak. We have stressed to the industry that they should take a major share of the responsibility for improving animal health standards.</p>

We have also issued guidance on methods of keeping domestic birds separate from wild birds, if housing is not practical, by feeding and watering domestic birds under cover where possible. Bird feed and any standing water should be kept free from contamination by wild birds and other animals. Poultry owners should make sure that hands, clothes and footwear are clean before and after contact with birds. Owners need to be vigilant and monitor their birds frequently.</p>

	<p pid="a.302W.2/1">The most recent objective report by the Central Science Laboratory, &quot;Rodent infestations in domestic properties in England 2001&quot;, was published in July 2005. The report was compiled from data collected during the 2001 English House Condition Survey (EHCS) and included comparisons with data from 1996. The report concluded that the rates for both mice and rats inside dwellings were similar for 1996 and 2001, while the rate for rats outside dwellings was higher in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/2">Factors found in the report to be related to infestation levels included dwellings where pets or livestock were kept in the garden, the degree of unfitness of the dwelling, the size of the plot and the level of problems in the area (such as dereliction), vacant properties and unkempt gardens.</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/3">In January, the National Pest Technicians Association published its &quot;National Rodent Survey Report 2006&quot; based on figures provided, voluntarily, by local authorities. The report suggested that the increase in reports and treatments of rat infestations by local authorities may be linked to a range of factors. These include charges by local authorities for pest control, treatment of local sewerage systems, overfeeding birds and an increase in fast-food related litter and fly-tipping.</p>

	<p pid="a.306W.5/1">Special advisers, who are temporary civil servants, can attend the annual party conference in accordance with their terms and conditions of employment. Permanent civil servants cannot attend the annual party conference in an official capacity except when their presence is required for carrying through essential departmental business unconnected with the conference. The number of occasions on which civil servants may have attended the annual party conference for the purposes of carrying out essential departmental business is not held and would involve disproportionate cost as it would involve reviewing the personnel files of all civil servants who have worked in the Cabinet Office and No. 10 Downing street since May 1997. As has been the case under successive Administrations, the Prime Minister is accompanied to party conference by the usual security and telecoms staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.312W.8/1">No formal assessment of land banking has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.8/2">However, land banking of sports facilities, such as playing fields, is not currently considered a widespread problem due to the increased protection that the Government have provided. This includes playing fields not being categorised as previously developed land under planning guidance (PPG3) which makes planning permission for housing on these sites much harder to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.8/3">Moreover, the majority of playing field sites are in local authority ownership or club ownership, and therefore a search of the land registry would only identify a small percentage in developers' hands.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.8/4">In addition, the Government have provided clear planning guidance to local authorities (PPG17) that no playing field needed by their communities should be lost.</p>

I have also received no representations for new mine protected vehicles. All requirements are kept under constant review. We regularly receive and action requests for a wide range of equipment. Some of these we can address through existing resources; other emerging requirements are met through the urgent operational requirement (UOR) process. The UOR process is an effective means of providing new capabilities or pieces of equipment for use in theatre; since the latest campaign started in April 2006, 261 UORs have been approved, of which 108 have already been delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.313W.6/1">Service patients requiring prosthetic limbs will usually be treated at first in an NHS hospital, where they will be fitted with an initial basic limb. At the appropriate stage in their recovery they will be transferred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court, Surrey.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.6/2">DMRC is run by the armed forces and contains the Complex Rehabilitation and Amputee Unit, which became fully operational on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June 2006</phrase>. Here, an individually moulded and appropriate prosthetic limb is manufactured on site and tailored to the specific patient. MOD also has a contract with an external prosthetics provider, whose personnel attend DMRC and contribute to the assessment of the individual, A range of technicians and therapists will be involved in the day-to-day care and treatment, including those employed by the prosthetics contractor.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.6/3">A high priority is given to enabling personnel to return to service duty in the same or a similar role if at all possible. During their continuing service career, any routine maintenance of officially-issued prosthetics is provided by the Defence Medical Services at no additional cost to the individual. The costs for this are not recorded centrally, but provision is made in the overall Defence Medical Services budget for all such ongoing treatment and care.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.6/4">If it is not possible for the individual to be retained in the armed forces, or if the individual chooses to leave, they will receive treatment, including therapy and rehabilitation, at Headley Court until they are deemed to have reached a steady state of fitness. They are then taken through a transition from military to NHS care, which will include setting in place the appropriate ongoing medical support at their local NHS regional centre. The cost of such support becomes the responsibility of the: NHS when the individual leaves the service.</p>

There have been no major modifications to CS 95. A number of changes have, however, been incorporated to the design including the replacement of sewn on buttons by taped buttons.</p>

	<p pid="a.320W.3/1">Mr. al-Jedda is held as a security internee by UK forces because he is suspected of membership of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. It is assessed that he poses a threat to the lives of Multi-National Forces (MNF) servicemen and women, Iraqi security personnel and Iraqi civilians.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.3/2">His detention is pursuant to UNSCR 1546 which, read together with the letters annexed to it, authorises the MNF to detain persons where this is necessary for imperative reasons of security. This has been reaffirmed by subsequent resolutions (UNSCR 1723, November 2006), and effect is given to it by Iraqi Coalition Provisional Authority legislation. Although Mr. al-Jedda has not been charged with a specific offence or brought to trial, both the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal have held that his detention is legal.</p>

	<p pid="a.324W.7/1">For the period to December 2005, 47 per cent. of ASBOs were breached. The effectiveness of the Government's antisocial behaviour policies has been assessed in two key independent reports published last year, by the National Audit Office and by the Youth Justice Board. Both confirmed that our twin track approach of support and enforcement is effective in protecting communities from antisocial behaviour. This is bringing results&mdash;nationally, the percentage of people who perceive high levels of antisocial behaviour has fallen from 21 per cent. in 2002-03 to 17 per cent. in 2005-06. This is the true measure of our success.</p>

	<p pid="a.327W.3/1">Information on the number of prisoners serving sentences for violent offences released on the Home Detention Curfew release scheme (HDC) can be found in Table 10.19 in the Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2005 which can be found at the following website:</p>
	<p pid="a.327W.3/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1806section10.xls">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1806section10.xls</a></p>
	<p pid="a.327W.3/3">It should be noted that serious violent offenders serving extended sentences for serious violent offences are statutorily ineligible for release on HDC. Eligible prisoners are not granted HDC unless they pass a careful risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.327W.3/4">These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system, and although shown to the last individual, the figures may not be accurate to that level.</p>
	<p pid="a.327W.3/5">As noted in the footnote to table 10.19, investigations suggest that around 5 per cent. of offence types recorded on this system do not relate to the offence they were released on HDC for, but relate to offences committed after release from prison and before the licence expiry date for their sentence. Our inquiries have shown that this is the case with the two offenders classified as sexual offenders in table 10.19.</p>

	<p pid="a.335W.2/1">Advocating anorexia and/or suicide is not necessarily illegal. Nevertheless, the Government take this difficult problem seriously and are taking a range of non-legislative steps to tackle it, including raising awareness of the potential dangers of suicide websites being accessed by vulnerable people; encouraging search engine companies to ensure that search results give prominence to sites offering help and support to people contemplating suicide. The Department of Health is also continuing to explore what more non-legislative action might be possible in the context of their Suicide Prevention Strategy. The Government have no plans to discuss this issue with the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.335W.2/2">Positive co-operation exists between internet service providers and law enforcement agencies. One example of that is the acceptable use policies in place in most service providers. These vary between companies but may enable service providers to remove material from their site not only if it is illegal but also if it is distasteful or otherwise unacceptable. Anyone who is concerned about the content of a website should approach the internet service provider in the first instance.</p>

The 2000-06 programme will fund existing and new activity until mid-2008. Funding in 2007 will be at broadly the same level as previous years.

	<p pid="a.352W.5/2">The key reason for the decline in expenditure on incapacity benefit over the period specified is the continued reduction, since April 1995, in the number of claimants who receive protected and higher amounts of invalidity benefit; invalidity benefit was the predecessor to incapacity benefit. This is an ongoing and gradual process, occurring as people have flowed off the benefit over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.5/3">In 1995-96, 85 per cent. of expenditure on incapacity benefits was on the protected ex-invalidity benefit. This proportion had fallen to around 50 per cent. in 2001-02 and was around a third in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.5/4">In 1995-96, over 80 per cent. of incapacity benefit recipients received invalidity benefit payment. By 2001-02, this proportion had halved, and by 2005-06 the figure was 28 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.353W.2/1">The available information is in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.2/2">To measure progress relating to children in workless households (CIWH), the Department uses the Household Labour Force Survey. However it is not possible to disaggregate this data below Government office region.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.2/3">The information in the table uses administrative data to provide the number and proportions of children dependent on workless benefits in Newcastle-upon-Tyne local authority. Data is not held for 1997 so 2004 has been added for comparison.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.2/4">The official definition of a CIWH is a child aged under 16 in a working age household where no adult works. The administrative data is an inexact proxy for this as it charts all children under 16 in a working age household who have at least one parent claiming workless benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.2/5">The administrative data fails to incorporate in its definition workless adults who do not claim benefits. It also differs from the standard CIWH definition in that it includes children in households with both working and non-working adults, as opposed to a household with no working adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.2/6">The information on those claiming an income-related social security benefit is not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.362W.2/1">Estimates of eligibility, and therefore of take-up, are not available below the level of Great Britain, and it is not therefore possible to say what the take-up of Pension Credit in Scotland is.</p>
	<p pid="a.362W.2/2">The latest estimates of the number of pensioners in Great Britain entitled to pension credit were published in 'Pension Credit Estimates of Take-Up in 2004-05'. A copy of the report is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.362W.2/3">Pension credit has been highly successful in reducing pensioner poverty and now, for the first time in a period of sustained economic growth, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole.

	<p pid="a.362W.2/4">We continue to make every effort to ensure that pension credit goes to those who are entitled to it. The latest estimates showed that 2.7 million households were receiving pension credit, and this includes 283,480 households in Scotland.</p>

This information, which is unverified and has not been provided by all schemes, suggests that there might be at least 106,000 non-pensioner members in schemes that have qualified to the end of December 2006. This would appear to be in line with our assumption that once all schemes have qualified there will be around 120,000 non pensioners in total who have suffered losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.362W.5/2">For pensioners, the same data suggests that there are 46,000 in schemes that have qualified to the end of December 2006. Of these, we estimate that only around 5,000 might have suffered losses because they are higher up the priority order and their pensions are more highly protected than non-pensioner members.</p>

	<p pid="a.366W.0/1">This is based on projections using the Department's Pensim2 dynamic microsimulation model. It represents an estimate, after taking account of the proposed reforms to state pension provision, of the proportion of pensioner households in 2050 who might face an initial 100 per cent. reduction in pension credit entitlement in respect of an increase in private pension income. Of these, around three-quarters will be in receipt of premia taking them above the standard guarantee level for example because they are severely disabled or are carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.366W.0/2">In practice, very few pensioners who face a 100 per cent. withdrawal rate at some point will do so over the whole of their retirement; by 2050 just 2 per cent. pensioners will receive the guarantee credit only when they first reach state pension age. Even then, we would expect many to be able to reduce the interaction between additional private saving and benefit entitlement by taking some or all of their private pension income as a lump sum. 'Less than 10 per cent. of pensioner households' can therefore be considered a cautious estimate.</p>

There has been no specific budget set aside for this review, beyond the salary costs of the small team in the Department that is supporting his work. David Freud has been speaking to a number of organisations as part of his research for the review, and is also participating in a number of seminars organised by the Department.

	<p pid="a.370W.11/1">The Spending Review 2004 Public Service Agreement (PSA) Target 1b is to reduce the proportion of children living in workless households in Great Britain by 5 per cent. between the second quarter (Q2) of 2005 and Q2 2008. This is measured using the Household Labour Force Survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.370W.11/2">In 1997 the proportion of children who were living in a workless household was 18.7 per cent. The latest data for Q2 2006 shows that the proportion of children in workless households was 15.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.370W.11/3">To date the number of children in workless households (CIWHs) has fallen by 443,000 since Q2 1997. Meeting the SR04 target will require a further reduction in the proportion of CIWH to 14.9 per cent. by Q2 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.370W.11/4">The target is measured using the Household Labour Force Survey (HLFS) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of employment. Importantly there has been a move away from using the seasonal quarter HLFS over to using the new calendar quarter HLFS. This has resulted in a small change to our headline numbers previously published and our progress on the number of CIWH is assessed using Q2 figures rather than the old spring quarters from the HLFS.</p>

	<p pid="a.381W.5/1">Powers are available under existing legislation to enable enforcement bodies to take action against excessively noisy vehicles. The legislation requires that vehicle exhaust systems and silencers are maintained in good and efficient working order and not altered so as to increase the level of noise emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.381W.5/2">As an aid to roadside enforcement the Department is considering whether a sufficiently robust in-service metered noise test might now be feasible. Such a test would enable enforcement bodies to stop vehicles and conduct noise tests at the roadside to identify excessively noisy vehicles. The Department will be letting research later this year to inform policy development.</p>

	<p pid="a.382W.0/4">Essex county council reported that the Chelmsford park and ride scheme, which was delivered in March 2006, is proving to be a success. It reported that there has been a significant reduction in traffic flow along congested routes with an average of over 4,000 people using the site each week and 440 fewer cars travelling on the Baddow Bypass on weekdays at peak periods. The scheme cost &pound;5.5 million and was completed to budget and on schedule.</p>

	<p pid="a.384W.5/1">A study is currently being undertaken by my officials into the practicability and costs of introducing vehicle restraint measures at railway stations. This follows vehicle access barriers being placed temporarily at two London stations, Waterloo and Victoria in June 2006, as part of a series of railway security measures. The current study is in collaboration with both Network Rail and London Underground who are conducting detailed engineering surveys of certain major railway stations. The results of the first three detailed surveys should be available in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.5/2">Following the completion of this work an informed decision can be taken on whether vehicle restraint measures, for example road barriers on pavement bollards, might present a proportionate and practicable security measure for railway stations, and if so where they might be installed.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.5/3">No representations have been received on the installation of vehicle access barriers at railway stations.</p>

	<p pid="a.391W.2/1">Central Government is responsible for the legislative framework for the regulation of private hire vehicles (PHVs), though individual local licensing authorities have discretion over the detailed rules and standards which apply in each local area. Following consultation last year, we have produced best practice guidance to assist local authorities in this regard (this guidance is on the Department's website). From time to time we receive representations either about decisions made locally or suggesting changes to the relevant legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.2/2">During the passage of the Road Safety Bill last year, we received a range of comments on our decisions to repeal what is known as the 'contract exemption' from the PHV licensing requirement and to introduce a power for local licensing authorities to be able to immediately suspend or revoke a taxi or PHV driver's licence if they consider this necessary in the interests of public safety. Subsequently, in response to a consultation with stakeholders, we received a number of views on the timing of the coming into force of contract exemption repeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.2/3">We have received a small number of representations about restrictions on PHVs using bus lanes, including the M4 bus lane. Any decision to allow PHVs to use bus lanes on local roads outside London falls to the local highway authority. Within London, TfL have responsibility for decisions on the issue.</p>

We see all diversity strands&mdash;including gender&mdash;as of equal importance and in line with many employers we have produced one scheme to underline that message.

This has included surveys, Gender Equality Workshops and a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis of FCO gender equality issues. With the assistance of the Women and Equality Unit at the Department for Communities and Local Government, a detailed action plan is being drawn up.</p>

Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis, which is a severe reduction in the number of white blood cells and can be potentially life threatening if it is not detected and appropriately treated. In order to reduce this risk, the Marketing Authorisation holders are obliged to collect information from the Clozapine Patient Monitoring Scheme and report changes in blood counts to the MHRA via the Yellow card Scheme.</p>

I am replying in her absence. (118964)</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.5/5" class="indent">Death certification is a statutory duty of individual medical practitioners under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1953. It is not part of their employment by NHS trusts, other hospitals, primary care trusts or nursing homes. Death certificates cannot be completed by dentists, ambulance personnel, or any other person who is not a registered medical practitioner. Guidance is therefore directed to doctors, not institutions. The General Register Office (GRO) of the Office for National Statistics is responsible for death registration and local registrars supply books of medical certificates of cause of death (MCCDs) to doctors and hospitals. Every book includes notes on how to complete the MCCD. These make clear that doctors are required to complete the MCCD to the best of their knowledge and belief. They are asked to include on the death certificate every disease or condition which, in their clinical judgment, contributed to the death either directly or indirectly.</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.5/6" class="indent">Updated guidance to certifiers was published on the GRO website in July 2005 (<a href="http://www.gro.gov.uk/medcert">www.gro.gov.uk/medcert</a>). The updated guidance specifically draws attention to health care associated infections (HCAI). HCAI, including disease due to clostridium difficile, should be treated exactly the same as any other disease when it comes to death certification. If, in the certifying doctor's clinical judgment, it was part of the sequence leading directly to death, it should be written in part I of the MCCD. If the doctor thinks that it was not part of the direct sequence, but did contribute to causing the patient's death indirectly, he should write it in part II of the MCCD.</p>

	<p pid="a.415W.9/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/2">For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/3" class="indent">there are no patients waiting over 26 weeks for in-patient treatment and no patients waiting over 13 weeks for out-patient treatment;</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/4" class="indent">Redcar and Cleveland Primary Care Trust's allocation increased to &pound;189.4 million in 2006-07, a real terms increase of 6.3 per cent. By 2007-08 the PCT's financial allocation will increase to &pound;206.2 million;</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/5" class="indent">In June 2003 at South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust, 92.7 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency (A and E) from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. Figures for September 2006 show an improvement to 99.5 percent.;</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/6" class="indent">in September 2006 at South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust 100 per cent. of patients with suspected cancer were seen within two weeks of referral;</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/7" class="indent">from April 2006 to September 2006 there were 1.9 MRSA cases per 10,000 bed days compared to 2.9 from April 2001 to September 2001;</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/8" class="indent">in the Redcar and Cleveland local authority area death rates from cancer per 100,000 population were 194.8 in 2003, compared with 243.2 in 1997;</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/9" class="indent">in the Redcar and Cleveland local authority area death rates from coronary heart disease per 100,000 population were 141.4 in 2003, compared with 103.3 in 1997;</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/10" class="indent">in June 2006 a &pound;21 million redevelopment was completed at the Friarage Hospital;</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.9/11" class="indent">a &pound;122 million private finance initiative project to build a major tertiary centre at the James Cook University Hospital was completed in June 2003; and</p>

	<p pid="a.416W.2/1">In 2006-07, the Department has considerably strengthened the financial regime applied to the national health service, not least by introducing more stringent monthly monitoring arrangements for all organisations, and by the appointment of the NHS Financial Controller to engage in regular performance management discussions with senior strategic health authorities (SHA) representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.2/2">The Department therefore continues to work closely with all NHS organisations, especially the most financially challenged, to reduce forecast deficits, acting through the SHAs and turnaround teams as appropriate. For example, action plans have been agreed with SHAs to ensure that financial performance continues to improve. It is the responsibility of primary care trusts and SHAs to analyse their local situation and develop plans, in liaison with their local NHS trusts and primary care providers, to deliver high quality NHS services while achieving financial balance.</p>

	<p pid="a.417W.0/1">The performance of the independent sector treatment centres (ISTC) in Bodmin and Plymouth is monitored weekly. The number of referrals and completed outpatient and surgery activity figures are monitored and reconciled between the independent provider and the primary care trust sponsors. The value of referral numbers and hospital activity figures are measured as a percentage of the value of the available hospital capacity. The Department is working with the national health service and independent providers to ensure contracts deliver best value.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.0/2">ISTCs have been able to provide additional surgical capacity in the South West whilst offering patients a wider choice of hospitals for their treatment. The treatment centres have helped local NHS hospitals in achieving their own maximum waiting time targets. Prior to the opening of the treatment centres, the local NHS used private sector capacity to manage demand from general practitioner, but the introduction of treatment centres has reduced the requirement for this.</p>

	<p pid="a.420W.5/1">The Department invited mental health trusts to submit bids for a share of the &pound;130 million capital funding pot through their strategic health authorities (SHAs). The bids were assessed by a group comprising Department officials, service users, commissioners and clinical services representatives, following criteria which were outlined in a letter sent to SHA and mental health trust chief executives on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March 2006</phrase>, &quot;Capital allocation process: &pound;130 million for adult mental health services&quot;. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.5/2">The Department considered bids in the following order of priority: for Section 136 health-based place of safety developments; for improvements in the psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) estate; and, for acute mental health ward improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.5/3">The &pound;130 million is being allocated to SHAs for subsequent allocation to qualifying mental health trusts. It will not, therefore, go to primary care trusts, except in the small number of cases where these are also service providers. The 2006-07 allocations for PICUs and places of safety were sent to SHAs and foundation trusts in autumn 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.5/4">Of the &pound;130 million, &pound;100 million will be allocated to PICUs and places of safety across the two years 2006-07 to 2007-08. Approximately &pound;42 million has been allocated in 2006-07, and approximately &pound;52 million is provisionally identified for allocation in 2007-08. Identifying the exact allocations made to places of safety or PICUs is not possible because some of the successful bids combine development of PICUs and places of safety as single bids, not as separate projects. Similarly timescales for project development varies as some projects involve new build and other relatively small refurbishment works.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.5/5">&pound;30 million will be allocated to acute inpatient ward developments in 2007-08. I announced last November that this &pound;30 million should focus on capital schemes promoting safety on acute wards, particularly for women service users.</p>

	<p pid="a.421W.2/1">The independent investigations commissioned and published by local health authorities, and latterly strategic health authorities, are primarily established to examine the care and treatment provided by local services to an individual or individuals. As such, the recommendations that they produce are in general aimed at local service delivery improvements and a local action plan is developed to address the issues identified. Therefore, the Department does not routinely expect to receive copies of these reports. However, it is clear that there may be lessons to be learnt nationally by considering the circumstances of the cases together. This is why the Department, and latterly the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), commissions the centre for suicide prevention at the University of Manchester to produce the national confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness (NCISH).</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.2/2">NCISH covers data on all suicides and homicides committed by someone in touch with mental health services and all sudden, unexplained deaths in psychiatric units. A wide number of aspects of these cases are analysed and recommendations for policy and practice improvement made. In addition, NCISH receives copies of independent investigation reports and undertakes a regular review of them. The NPSA has commissioned NCISH to conduct a review of recent cases which will be completed in March this year, with an initial report available in late 2007 or early 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.2/3">While the Department does not routinely expect to receive copies of all independent investigation reports, it has produced a list of those commissioned since the Health Service Guideline 94(27) came into force in 1994 to comply with a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The list, which is available in the Library, has been compiled on a best endeavours basis and is as complete as possible but it is likely that there have been other reports published that are not included.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.8/2">Detailed care records, however, are held locally within health communities and are not held on the spine. Clinicians are required to keep adequate records for clinical governance and medico-legal reasons and will generally do so within detailed care records systems. As is currently the case, patients will not be able to specify how or where local detailed records are held, though the new systems will enable patients to place restrictions on how these records may be shared or accessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.8/3">In some circumstances it may be possible for clinicians to agree to keeping records outside of the detailed care records systems if to do otherwise would cause substantial distress.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.8/4">However, some forms of care, for example blood tests and x-rays, will in future automatically generate records within the detailed care records systems, and if care is dependent upon use of these systems there can be no flexibility for those who receive that care.</p>

	<p pid="a.427W.0/46">You will be aware that the Government committed to provide a new secondary school in each local authority in the country by 2011. This will be through Building Schools for the Future, the Academy programme or the BSF One School Pathfinder programme. Over &pound;1 billion has been allocated to the 38 authorities within the one school pathfinder element of the BSF programme. The following authorities have been allocated funding to rebuild one of its schools with the highest level of building need: Barnet, Bath and North East Somerset, Bexley, Bracknell Forest, Bromley, Buckinghamshire, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, East Sussex, Gloucestershire, Harrow, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Thames, Leicestershire, North Somerset, North Yorkshire, Plymouth, Redbridge, Richmond upon Thames, Rutland, Sefton, Shropshire, South Gloucestershire, Southend on Sea, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford, Warrington, West Berkshire, West Sussex, Wigan, Wiltshire, Windsor and Maidenhead, Wirral, Wokingham, York.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/47">Primary schools are not covered by Building Schools for the Future. However we are taking a similarly transformational approach to capital investment for the primary sector. Funding for the pathfinder phase of the Primary Capital programme will commence in 2008-09 with &pound;150 million of additional funding being shared among 23 regional pathfinders. The programme will be rolled out nationally from 2009-10 underpinned by &pound;500 million of additional investment. Subject to future government spending decisions, we anticipate that the additional investment will continue at that level for at least 15 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/48">In addition to our strategic programmes, all local authorities and schools receive formulaic capital support for their local priorities, which currently totals more than &pound;2 billion a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.430W.5/1">There has been ongoing consideration of the status of personal, social and health education (PSHE) since the introduction of the National Curriculum. In considering the statutory position of PSHE, we have taken a number of factors into account. Firstly, many aspects of PSHE (sex education, drug education and careers education) already have a statutory basis. Secondly, further statutory requirements would run counter to the overall aim of current curriculum reform to give schools greater flexibilities to plan and deliver the school curriculum. Thirdly, legislation would not necessarily lead to improvements in teaching and learning in PSHE.</p>
	<p pid="a.430W.5/2">The Department's priority for PSHE is to improve the effectiveness of what is taught by providing clear guidance, supporting high quality continuing professional development for teachers, identifying and disseminating good practice, and helping schools to meet the standards for PSHE required by the National Healthy Schools Programme. We are also supporting the new PSHE Subject Association which will provide advice, guidance and support to those delivering PSHE.</p>

The GES will then be then be reviewed every three years as a whole. The action plans will be reviewed on an annual basis.

Neither publication imposes a statutory requirement on schools, they provide guidance only. Circular 7/90 establishes a general guide to good practice on lesson times.

	<p pid="a.436W.2/1">The Framework for Excellence (FfE) is still in its development phase. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC), partnered by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted), the Quality Improvement Agency (QIA) and the Department for Education and Skills are working closely with the FE sector to develop the framework. Through consultation, piloting, testing and trialling they will continue to explore a range of options to help decide the best and most appropriate measures to assess quality of outcomes&mdash;including those for non-accredited learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.2/2">One of the underpinning principles of the framework is that it will use &quot;absolute&quot; rather than &quot;relative&quot; success measures. This means that all providers can aspire to, and achieve, an excellent standard measured against set criteria rather than achieving excellence relative to others. So it will be theoretically possible for all LSC-funded providers to achieve excellence under the framework.</p>

However, the current programme of study does set out the attainment targets for the knowledge, skills and understanding that pupils of different abilities and maturities are expected to reach by the end of Key Stage 3 for each skill.

	<p pid="a.448W.2/1">Since 2001, English for Speakers of Other Languages has been delivered to adults as part of the Skills for Life Strategy. In that period, demand and funding for ESOL has tripled. We will continue to deliver ESOL as a significant strand of the Skills for Life strategy in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.2/2">As part of the preparation for implementation of the changes, the Department for Education and Skills is carrying out a Race Equality Impact Assessment. As a result of that process, we are considering what additional support may be included in family literacy, language and numeracy provision to meet the language needs of families and in particular of women who are parents. We are also considering how women can demonstrate an entitlement for free ESOL where they have no access to either benefits documentation of their own or to family funding. These groups are among the highest priority learners for Skills for Life provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.2/3">In addition, the Department has announced a New Arrivals Excellence Programme to help build capacity in local authorities and schools for those pupils for whom English is an additional language. It is also delivering projects through the Primary and Secondary National Strategies for more advanced bilingual learners.</p>

	<p pid="a.450W.0/2">In 1997 nearly half of primary schools were achieving below this level in mathematics, now fewer than one in five schools are doing so. In English one in eight schools are achieving below 65 per cent. compared with just under half in 1997. Impressive gains have been made towards meeting the KS2 PSA school-level floor target (reduce by 40 per cent. by 2008 the number of schools where less than 65 per cent. of pupils achieve level 4 in English and in maths). There are now 1,785 schools below the target in English and 2,555 schools below in mathematics down from 2,849 in English and 3,570 in maths in 2003 (baseline year).</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.8/1">Proposals to close schools are normally made by a local authority and are decided under local decision making arrangements. Under current provisions, such decisions are taken by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or, if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision, the schools adjudicator. SOCs and adjudicators must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State when deciding proposals. The guidance sets out a range of factors that must be considered for the different types of proposals but stresses that all cases must be considered on their individual merits. The factors include: the overall impact on local standards of provision, the demand/supply of school places, the impact on the local community and the views of interested parties. Decision making arrangements will change in May, when we aim to introduce the new provisions of the Education and Inspections Act. These provide for the local authority to decide most proposals for school closures, but with some explicit powers of appeal to the schools adjudicator.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.8/2">The Secretary of State has a power to direct a local authority to discontinue a school where that school has been judged by Ofsted to require special measures. We set out in the White Paper, &quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools For All&quot;, our expectation that, where a school in special measures is making inadequate progress after 12 months, the local authority will take radical action, with a presumption of closure, if necessary using the Secretary of State's power, with a replacement school or academy normally opened on the same site.</p>

The Department deplores all forms of discrimination and would expect that all schools and local authorities work to ensure that discrimination does not occur. The Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 were introduced to outlaw discrimination and harassment in employment and vocational training on the grounds of sexual orientation. The Regulations apply throughout the employment relationship?the recruitment process, in the workplace, on dismissal and, in certain circumstances, after the employment has finished.</p>

	<p pid="a.470W.3/1">Tax legislation requires that pension saving must be converted into a secure income, often through an annuity, by age 75. This requirement was introduced in respect of retirement annuity contracts in 1976 and for personal pensions when they were introduced on <phrase class="date" code="1988-07-01">1 July 1988</phrase>. For small self-administered occupational pension schemes (the only kind of occupational pension scheme that was directly required as a condition of tax approval to secure member's benefits through annuitisation) the requirement to purchase an annuity by age 75 was first introduced in 1994.</p>
	<p pid="a.470W.3/2">These rules have, of course, been replaced by the new pensions' tax regime that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>.</p>

The Government definitively set out their policy and the underlying evidence base on annuities, including the age 75 limit, in &quot;The Annuities Market&quot; published alongside the 2006 pre-Budget report.

	<p pid="a.472W.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking if the Chancellor of the Exchequer will instruct the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to include a tick box for the Cornish under the ethnic monitoring section of the 2011 Census. I am replying in her absence. (121596)</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/4" class="indent">The Government, local and health authorities, academics, commercial business and professions need reliable information from a Census in order to conduct their activities. The Census question content needs to be appropriate to meet the requirements of these users, and to be acceptable to the majority of respondents.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/5" class="indent">The primary objective of the 2011 Census is to get the best possible estimate of the population, because of its crucial importance for local and national planning and resource allocation. Consultation on census topics was carried out during 2005, and ONS' response to the consultation was published in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/6" class="indent">The 2011 Census: Assessment of initial user requirements on content for England and Wales <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/consultations/2011Census_response.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/consultations/2011Census_response.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/7" class="indent">The topic consultation identified demand for about six pages worth of questions. Cost constraints and the burden on respondents are likely to limit space to three pages of questions per person. There are thus difficult choices to be made, with census questions being limited to those where there is a national need for information on small areas or small groups of the population that could not be found from other sources (surveys, for example). Space constraints on the census questionnaire mean that there are limits to the number of tick-boxes that can be accommodated and national identity and ethnicity questions will contain tick boxes only for the largest groups; others will be able to write-in a response in an 'other' box.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/8" class="indent">Anyone who wishes to record their ethnicity and identity as Cornish would have the opportunity to do so by using the write-in options, as they did for the 2001 Census when 37,491 respondents wrote in their ethnicity as 'Cornish'.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/9" class="indent">ONS is aware of the demand for information on the Cornish, and has arranged to meet representatives from Cornwall County Council and others in Truro in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/10" class="indent">Final decisions on the content of the 2011 Census will not be made until the consultation and testing programme is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010. A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals including the wording of any questions about ethnicity and identity is scheduled to be published in 2008.</p>

The Barker Review of Housing Supply, published in March 2004, concluded that UK house price trends reflect a lack of housing supply and weak responsiveness of housing supply to prices. In autumn 2003, the Bank of England concluded that there was evidence that regional house price changes were consistent with the South East, including London, playing a role in leading, or even causing, movements in the rest of the UK but only in the late 1980s/early 1990s and not during other periods.</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.5/1">Data limitations preclude meaningful estimates of the average value of migrant workers by country of origin. However the average migrant worker (across all countries of origin) makes a positive contribution to the UK economy. Migrants (defined as people not born in the UK) constitute 10.5 per cent. of people above the age of 16 in the UK. Migrants (including family reunification and refugees) typically have lower employment rates than the UK average, around 5 per cent. lower, but typically earn 8 per cent. more. Assuming that the higher earning signify that migrants are, on average, more productive, this would indicate that migrants contribute around 11 per cent. to total gross domestic product, and cause a small but positive increase to gross domestic product per capita.</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.8/1">The Highly Skilled Migrants Programme was amended in November 2006 to trial changes proposed as part of the move to a points based system for managed migration. The Points Based System will simplify the multitude of current routes into a scheme with five tiers for entry. One of the key objectives for changing the scheme is to reduce subjectivity and base decisions on objective evidence, making the process more transparent for the applicant. The aim of the change in November was to allow for a period of 'live testing' of the proposed tier 1 criteria, presenting an opportunity to review the effects of the criteria and refine them before full tier 1 roll out. Tier 1 in the new scheme will be broadly equivalent to the existing Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) in aim (to attract the most highly skilled who can benefit the UK) and entitlements (unrestricted access to the UK labour market, no need to have an employer in UK sponsoring application, the option to settle in the UK after five years, the right to bring dependants). The changes are therefore not expected to have a measurable impact on economic relations with India.</p>

	<p pid="a.486W.8/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the average household income was in (a) Eastbourne, (b) East Sussex, (c) the South East and (d) the UK in the last year for which figures are available (120557).</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/4" class="indent">Estimates of average household income for the UK and for the regions are produced from household surveys. There is generally much less information about household income at a local level since the sample size of a national survey is insufficient to produce reliable estimates for small areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/5" class="indent">Estimates of average household income for the UK are published in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>, which also includes links to figures for previous years. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS), which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK. An estimate for the South-East can also be derived from the data underlying this analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/6" class="indent">Using this source, for the financial year 2004/05, the average equivalised disposable household income for the UK was 23,350, while the figure for the South-East was &pound;26,538.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/7" class="indent">The ONS has also published estimates of household income for wards for 2001/02 only. These estimates are based on a statistical model and are experimental statistics&mdash;this means they have been developed in accordance with the principles set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice but have yet to be fully accredited as National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/8" class="indent">These ward based estimates have been used to produce an estimate of average equivalised household income for East Sussex and Eastbourne for 2001/02, as a weighted average of the estimates for the wards making up these areas. These average incomes are &pound;21,495 for East Sussex, and &pound;20,303 for Eastbourne.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/9" class="indent">It should be remembered that the estimates for East Sussex and Eastbourne are produced using a different method to that used for the South-East and UK figures, and so the two sets of figures are not directly comparable. There is more uncertainty surrounding the estimates for East Sussex and Eastbourne.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.8/10" class="indent">All the household incomes shown here are equivalised. This means that they are standardised to take into account the different size and composition of households. The standard household is deemed to be a two adult household with no children, and so an equivalised income can be interpreted as indicating a standard of living that would be achieved by a standard household with that income. All the estimates are net of income tax, national insurance contributions, and council tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.487W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.8/2">Specific information regarding relative low income for pensioners is available in the latest publication of the 'Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2004-05'. The threshold of below 60 per cent. of relative or contemporary median income is the most commonly used in reporting trends in low income. Latest national figures for pensioners relate to 2004-05 and show the risk of low income for pensioners, after housing costs have been accounted for, of 17 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.8/3">According to the EU definition, 24 per cent. of people aged 65 and over in the UK are at risk of poverty in 2004. This is down from 32 per cent. in 1995. Thus the number of elderly at risk of poverty in the UK, according to the EU definition, has fallen by around 650,000 in less than a decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.8/4">While the EU25 average stands at 18 per cent., there is a wide variation in the risk of poverty across member states, from 52 per cent. in Cyprus and 40 per cent. in Ireland to 4 per cent. in the Czech Republic and 6 per cent. in Luxembourg. The following table presents the latest available data on the risk of poverty of people aged 65 and over.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.8/5">It should be noted that the EU measure of poverty differs from that generally adopted in the UK, mainly on account of it being restricted to persons aged 65 and over (while the national measure takes into account all pensioners&mdash;including women aged 60 to 64), and also because it does not take into account housing costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.490W.2/1">Based on HMRC administrative data from 2005-06, very slightly under half (around 48 per cent.) of all residential transactions do not bear stamp duty as a consequence of falling under the lowest stamp duty land tax price threshold or of benefiting from disadvantaged area relief.</p>

For example, from 2004-05 onwards, local authorities were no longer required to make a contribution towards the funding of Rent Allowance Payments, Non-Housing Revenue Account Rent Rebates and Council Tax Benefit. This expenditure was funded wholly by direct subsidy from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The apparent reduction in the revenue grant allocated to Chorley borough council between 2003-04 and 2004-05 simply reflects this change in financing.

If a property is subsequently sold any improvements may have an effect, but only if they are such that they push the value of the property into the next band range.

	<p pid="a.516W.2/2">Households living in decent homes are less likely to experience fuel poverty The decent homes standards requires homes to provide thermal comfort through having both efficient heating and effective insulation. Our guidance for delivering decent homes sets out the means by which landlords can meet this thermal comfort criterion, and also recommends that they seek to go further to improve energy efficiency, for example by replacing inefficient boilers, or installing extra insulation or double glazing.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.2/3">The Housing Health and Safety Rating system (HHSRS) is the Government's new approach to the evaluation of potential risks to health and safety from any deficiencies identified in dwellings. Excess cold is included as a potential hazard and a hazard assessment should take account of the adequacy of the heating, insulation and ventilation. The Housing Act 2004 gives local authorities powers to intervene where they consider housing conditions to be unacceptable following the proper application of the HHSRS.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.2/4">Where landlords refuse a Warm Front grant or decline to reply to enquiries by scheme managers, or where a landlord declines to co-operate with an approach from an energy supplier under EEC, local authorities may decide an inspection may be necessary to establish whether anything needs to be done to protect the occupant from excess cold or damp and mould affecting the property.</p>

	<p pid="a.521W.2/1">The amount and distribution of new housing to be provided in the West Midlands region over the next 25 years is currently being considered through the revision of the Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS). As part of the revision, the West Midlands Regional Assembly is consulting on options to provide up to 575,000 new homes across the Region. The consultation on the options will inform the Assembly's decision on how much housing should go in different locations in their preferred option. At this stage, options for housing development in Solihull are between 11,000 and 18,000 new homes, however, it is possible that the final figure for Solihull may be different from these figures depending on the outcome of the consultation. The location and level of housing are a matter for the regional and local planning process. Until these decisions are made it is not possible to say whether there will be any loss of Green Belt in any specific areas in the Region., However, the current RSS would expect to see all other possibilities exhausted before consideration of Green Belt.</p>

	<p pid="a.521W.5/1">The Housing Corporation has been engaged in a major programme of work with housing associations to improve value for money and reduce the level of grant required to deliver quality new social housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.5/2">The main reason why most grant rates per home have declined over the two Housing Corporation Affordable Housing Programme bidding rounds 2004-06 and 2006-08 is that the Housing Corporation conducts a bidding process, in negotiation with registered social landlords (RSLs), in order to achieve better value for money. The Corporation aims to reduce the costs of provision and the amount of grant provided. This grant reduction has enabled the delivery of additional affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.5/3">Where homes are no longer used for social housing or where a home owner has purchased 100 per cent. of their property initially subsidised by grant the Housing Corporation recovers grants to be used on new schemes. This is achieved by RSLs using Recycled Capital Grants Funds (RCGF) to hold recovered grant plus interest and re-invest within a certain time. For properties acquired by tenants under Right to Acquire and Voluntary Purchase Grants RSLs credit a Disposal Proceeds Funds with the net proceeds of the sale. These funds are then used to provide replacement properties.</p>

This estimate was based on data from the 'Survey of English Housing' for the period 2000-01 to 2002-03 and from the 2001 'English House Condition Survey'.

	<p pid="a.541W.12/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.541W.12/2">The Department has not received any recent representations on doorstep selling from European Environmental Controls (EEC) Limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.12/3">I would like to refer the hon. Member to the measures the Government are taking forward to improve consumer protection in the doorstep selling market. This is further to the announcement I made on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-07">7 September 2006</phrase> which stated that in response to the OFT's market study on doorstep selling and cold calling, and the subsequent public consultation, we would:</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.12/4" class="indent">(a) extend cancellation rights and a cooling off period to consumers for sales concluded in their home following a solicited visit, similar to those they currently enjoy for unsolicited visits;</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.12/5" class="indent">(b) require traders to include cancellation rights within contracts so consumers are more aware of their rights; and</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.12/6" class="indent">(c) encourage greater transparency on prices and greater willingness to provide written quotes, through industry self-regulation, with traders operating under Codes of Practices approved by the Office of Fair Trading's Consumer Codes Approval Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.12/7">As the hon. Member will know, the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill is currently going through Parliament and the doorstep selling provisions will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations that provide cancellation rights for solicited sales visits to the consumer's home (and workplace). Later this year we intend to publicly consult on the draft regulations, which will extend cancellation rights to all sales concluded in a consumer's home and require cancellation rights be incorporated within contracts. We expect these measures to come into force in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.12/8">I would also like to refer the hon. Member to the unfair commercial practices directive. This will be implemented this year. The new provisions will protect consumers against the physical or non-physical use of harassment, coercion or exploiting undue influence. This is also the first directive that recognizes that vulnerable consumers need a greater level of protection. Practices which would not be unfair to the average member of the shopping public can still be unfair if they are likely to adversely affect a group of vulnerable consumers in a way that a trader can reasonably foresee. For example, elderly consumers are much more likely to succumb to intimidating sales tactics than able-bodied consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.545W.8/2">The Government are strongly committed to the development of a high value added modern manufacturing sector which competes effectively in global markets. We have been extremely successful in providing a stable macro economic framework in which business can prosper and grow and are taking action through the manufacturing strategy to enable manufacturers in all regions, including the West Midlands, to move to high value added production through the application of science and innovation and the development of world class skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.8/3">We have successful manufacturing sectors; in 2006 our automotive sector produced more than 1.4 million vehicles, our aerospace industry had a turnover of over &pound;29 billion and invested &pound;2.7 billion on R and D. New high tech manufacturing markets are emerging&mdash;our bioscience industry is the largest industry in Europe and our environmental industries, worth &pound;25 billion, are growing at a rate of 10 per cent. a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.8/4">We set up the Manufacturing Advisory Service in 2002 which has generated &pound;277 million of added value and have extended the research and development tax credit which has had 22,000 claims and provides &pound;600 million a year in Government support, the majority to manufacturers. We have put &pound;370 million into the Technology Programme which has supported 600 collaborative R and D projects and 19 Knowledge Transfer Networks since its launch in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.8/5">Selective Finance for Investment in England (SFIE) and its predecessor RSA have provided 7,403 grants worth &pound;2.6 billion creating &pound;21.6 billion investment and creating/safeguarding 437,271 jobs from April 1997 to March 2006&mdash;around 80 per cent. in manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.8/6">In 2004 (the latest year for which data is available), UK attracted more inward investments projects (563) than any other EU country. France secured 490 projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.8/7">According to a survey of 1,000 multinationals conducted by AT Kearney, UK ranked fourth worldwide as a future location for direct investment (ahead of any other EU country). In comparison Germany was ninth, France was 14th, and Italy was 19th. 75,000 new jobs created by direct inward investment into the UK in 2004-05.</p>

	<p pid="a.561W.2/1">The University of Ulster looked at this issue in 2003 when it carried out its impact assessment of options for reform of the domestic rating system. Its findings were inconclusive. It did note that, as the new rating system is not a new tax but the redistribution of an existing tax, in the unlikely event that any measurable impact should emerge it could affect the market unevenly and in either direction, depending on location and sector. This work did not extend to examining the impact of Water Reform and no specific study has been carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.2/2">It should also be noted that recent evidence from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which referred to its European Housing Review 2007, shows that NI experienced the highest increases in Europe in 2006. This exceptional growth continues and it has included the period that the Valuation and Lands Agency were advising individual householders in NI of their new capital values, together with an indication of their new rate liability. This would suggest that rating and water reform have not affected the residential property market in NI.</p>
