	<p pid="b.978W.6/2">As at end March 2010, 5,064 civil service posts had been relocated from London and the South East to the North West, of which 41 went to Warrington. There are currently no plans to relocate further posts, however relocation of Government staff outside of London and the South East continues to be considered amongst other options to deliver the savings set out at the spending review and increase the efficiency of the Government's estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.6/3">It is the Government's property strategy to implement and manage a system of National Property Controls across the central civil and operational estate as well as setting up Property Vehicles (PVs) that will make savings through a more coordinated approach to property asset management of the central civil office estate. As a first step, the Government Property Unit will set up pilot PVs for the central London and Bristol office estate from 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.6/4">The current spending controls on government property will result in a reduction in both the cost and size of the estate. As at September 2010, the moratorium had resulted in estate cost reductions of over &#163;18 million and is on track to deliver &#163;49 million by the end of the financial year. As the estate reduces in size, retained buildings will be utilised more intensively wherever possible. This reduction of property in London and elsewhere could see posts being relocated to areas close to London, and where there is a strong business case, to other parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.984W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has previously spent over &#163;1 million on statistical studies into cancer incidences and mortality rates among former personnel who attended the British nuclear tests. This includes the cost of the three National Radiation Protection Board studies which completed in 2003. For completeness we have also committed some &#163;75,000 plus VAT towards a health needs analysis of former personnel who attended the nuclear tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.6/2">The NHS has lead responsibility for ensuring the health care needs of ex-service personnel in the UK are met, including nuclear test veterans. Meeting the health care needs of UK nationals who reside overseas lies with the country in which they reside.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.6/3">Where ex-service personnel are in receipt of a war pension, the MOD may meet the cost of treatment of accepted disablements, provided that the treatment is clinically necessary for a disablement due to service and is not available through the health system in the country of residence.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.6/4">The MOD has estimated that the cost of defending the legal action brought by nuclear test veterans and their families in the Court of Appeal as some &#163;450,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.987W.5/15" class="indent">Firstly, it may be helpful if I provide some contextual information with regards to DNSR Findings. A Finding is imposed when an issue is considered to have an impact on safety or environmental protection, and for which a response is required within an agreed timescale. DNSR will determine the wording of the Finding, the proposed response and timescale after consultation with the authorisee, and evidence of a satisfactory conclusion may be sought in subsequent regulatory activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.987W.5/16" class="indent">On average DNSR conducts around 100 inspections or exercise assessments each year, each of which may result in multiple Findings. Information is organised by authorisee (i.e. on a site-by-site basis) of which there are 10. Findings are recorded on databases but changes to IT systems mean that the only reliable way of collating this information will be to examine individual inspection / assessment reports. As a result, to respond to your question about the Findings issued by DNSR in the period 2005 to 2010, could only be done at disproportionate cost. If you were to refine your question to, for example a particular authorisee, such as HMNB Clyde or Devonport Dockyard, officials could extract and present this information up to the financial limit allowable for a Parliamentary Question, which is currently &#163;800.</p>

	<p pid="b.988W.5/2">The only cost that can be directly attributed to the US Navy and German Kriegsmarine ASW assets is for fuel. Fuel is supplied to the US under a reciprocal agreement which provides for each nation's assets to be refuelled by the other. The cost of fuel provided for German assets is invoiced and recovered to the Ministry of Defence. The value of fuel provided to US and German assets from RAF Kinloss to date in 2010-11 was &#163;301,000 and &#163;10,000 respectively. No figures are currently available for 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="b.991W.12/2">One of the intentions of the English baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history. Classical civilisation was not included in the humanities element of the English baccalaureate for the 2010 performance tables because the historical element of the course was not sufficient. We will however be considering comments about the English baccalaureate measure and reviewing the precise definition of the English baccalaureate for the 2011 performance tables.</p>

We continue to take a strong stand against such remarks, including in international forums such as the UN. We will work closely with other countries to ensure that future meetings on racism at the UN address all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism, and do not become platforms for the dissemination of deeply offensive anti-Semitic viewpoints.

It also showed Iran had produced 3,183 kg of 3.5% low enriched uranium and 33 kg of 20% low enriched uranium, a significant step towards weapons grade enrichment, and was still failing to address the wide range of concerns over possible military dimensions of its programme.</p>

The P5+1 were united in their view that these pre-conditions were unacceptable and therefore no further talks have been scheduled.

	<p pid="b.1003W.11/1">Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda and in general there is little social tolerance of sexual minorities. It is a commonly-held belief that homosexuality is in some way an un-African practice introduced into Uganda and promoted by European societies. A Private Member's Bill known as the Anti-Homosexuality Bill was tabled in Parliament in 2009. This would introduce new criminal sanctions for members of sexual minorities and those who promote their rights. The Government of Uganda have said that they will not allow the Bill to pass in its current form and it is not currently clear whether the Bill will make further progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1003W.11/2">We have made clear to the Government of Uganda the British Government's position on respect for the rights of sexual minorities on several occasions. Our high commission in Kampala also remains in close touch with, and has provided support for, Ugandan civil society groups campaigning for the rights of sexual minorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1006W.5/1">Capital investment proposals in the national health service are considered on a case by case basis and assessed against key approval criteria set down by the Department and Treasury. Each proposal is subject to a value for money test which compares the risk adjusted, whole life costs and benefits of a public capital funded option (known as the Public Sector Comparator) with one provided under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). This involves a private sector consortium raising finance either through a loan from a bank or from the capital markets (bonds).</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.5/2">Under the PFI option project risks (costs overruns, design faults etc) are transferred from the public sector authority to the PFI consortium for which the public sector pays a premium in the form of the private sector's higher overall borrowing charges (they include a margin for project risk). So in general terms, if the cost of this premium is lower to the public sector than the quantified value of the risk retained under the Public Sector Comparator, this, combined with any efficiency gains achieved in the PFI option, will determine if the PFI proposal represents better value for money and can be approved to go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="b.1007W.2/1">The impact assessment for the Health and Social Care Bill (published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-19">19 January 2011</phrase>) includes a partial assessment of factors affecting the costs incurred by national health service bodies and private providers, respectively, in delivering health services for NHS patients. The key conclusion is that some of these factors appear to increase costs for NHS bodies relative to private providers, whilst other factors appear to increase costs for private providers relative to NHS bodies. However, based on the information held centrally, it has not been possible to determine, on balance, whether NHS bodies or private providers of NHS services are systematically advantaged or disadvantaged relative to the other.</p>
	<p pid="b.1007W.2/2">Additional data collection and analysis would be needed to quantify some of the key factors, for example, to reflect the fact that private providers tend to treat less complex cases. With regard to corporation tax, however, this would not affect the accounting cost of providing NHS services, because it is a tax on profit, and would not affect the prices paid for NHS services under the national tariff.</p>

	<p pid="b.1017W.8/1">As a result of the challenges faced during the 2009-10 winter season, particularly those related to salt supplies, an independent winter resilience review, led by David Quarmby CBE was carried out. Among the many review recommendations was one to establish a strategic stockpile of up to 250,000 tonnes, managed by the Highways Agency, to provide a strategic reserve of salt for England through the 2010-11 winter season.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.8/2">The strategic salt is held at a number of ports across England including-Ellesmere Port, Birkenhead, Southampton, Strood, Immingham and Teesport. With salt currently both arriving and being distributed from the strategic stockpile the amounts held at each site vary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.8/3">As a result of the early onset and severity of the weather experienced already this winter season, the Secretary of State for Transport requested the Highways Agency to facilitate the import of a further volume of salt of up to 250,000 tonnes. Orders have been placed for this further amount which has started to arrive, with the majority expected between the end of January and mid-February. Storage locations are currently being arranged for the additional strategic salt.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.8/4">In September 2010, the total volume of salt available across England, Scotland and Wales was estimated to be over 1,400,000 tonnes. No surveys were carried out in October or November 2010. For this winter season, the Department has introduced an electronic stock monitoring system to monitor salt stock holdings on a weekly basis. From the most recent audit undertaken on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-17">17 January 2010</phrase>, the total salt stock available in Great Britain is estimated to be over 912,000 tonnes (including the strategic stockpile in England) which compares to just over 243,600 tonnes at the same time last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.8/5">Following each audit, a winter network group meeting is held at official level. The group brings together the Department for Transport (chair), the devolved Administrations (both Scotland and Wales), the Highways Agency, Transport for London, the Local Government Association (LGA), ADEPT (previously the County Surveyors Society), the Met Office, and the Cabinet Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.8/6">The purpose of these meetings are to give advice, not direction, to salt suppliers based upon information provided by the Highways Agency and local highway authorities on salt stocks, estimates of future usage derived from Met Office weather forecasts, and an assessment of the available market supply. In addition to this the Group also considers whether any authorities require access to the strategic stock pile.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.8/7">Officials from the Welsh Assembly Government are represented at the winter network group and issues of mutual interest regarding salt are discussed. In addition, the Secretary of State also discussed with the Deputy First Minister for Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-23">23 December 2010</phrase> the severe weather and salt stocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.8/8">The quantity of salt required in the first four months of 2011 will depend on a number of factors including the weather. On this basis we have not estimated the cost to the public purse of processing such quantities.</p>

The decision has the additional benefit of creating a clearer price signal in the scheme which participants have asked for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.0/3">The clearer and stronger price signal provided by this change should reduce uncertainty and administrative costs while maintaining energy efficiency measures among participants and the commensurate savings in energy bills.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.0/4">The cost impact will depend on the size and type of the participant organisation and how hard they drive energy efficiency within their organisation to reduce their energy bills but typically we expect this to be under 7% for CRC participants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.0/5">The impact on business of our initial changes to the CRC will depend on the extent to which participants reduce their energy consumption before they are required to purchase and surrender allowances in 2012.

	<p pid="b.1019W.3/1">A consumer's right to choose legal representation is set out in the Insurance Companies (Legal Expenses Insurance) Regulations 1990 (&quot;the regulations&quot;). The regulations apply to both specific policies for legal expenses cover and, for example, motor insurance policies that include legal expenses cover. In the absence of any legal expenses insurance policy, or where the consumer is not seeking to recover his legal costs from his insurer, there are no restrictions on a consumer choosing his own legal representative to pursue a claim. However, where a consumer has a legal expenses insurance policy to indemnify his legal costs, the insurer may require the use of one of its panel solicitors to pursue the consumer's claim for compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.3/2">The regulations are enforced by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), who are obliged to ensure that they are applied effectively and that customers are treated fairly. The FSA sets standards that financial services firms have to meet and takes action if they do not. To support this, there are specific rules for how insurance firms should treat their customers and these rules can be found in their Insurance Conduct of Business Sourcebook (ICOBS).</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.3/3">The FSA does not have any specific rules relating to insurers' use of legal practitioners with whom they have a pre-existing commercial relationship; however solicitors appointed by an insurer have a duty to their client (the policyholder). Solicitor panels, which are used by the industry, help keep legal costs down (e.g. through pre-agreed fee structures)-and this reduction in costs is fed through to premiums.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.3/4">A policyholder who feels he has been treated unfairly by a firm, in this or any other respect, can initiate a formal complaints process by first contacting the firm and, if no satisfactory resolution is found, then referring his complaint to the independent Financial Ombudsman Service (&quot;the FOS&quot;). The FOS is an independent service for settling disputes between businesses providing financial services and their customers. The service is free of charge to consumers.</p>

Within this database, jobs are counted only where they start within 91 days of a customer's last contact with JCP. Jobs occurring after this period are not counted. This is in order to reasonably attribute the job to the activity which takes place through Pathways. The mandatory activity takes on average around nine months from Pathways start. This means that the majority of jobs recorded within this data are obtained within one year and therefore the average time it takes a Pathways customer to find work may appear lower than would otherwise be expected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021W.2/2">Jobs information is drawn from tax records from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.

	<p pid="b.1022W.2/15">Extensive analysis of financial wealth at household level using the Wealth and Assets data is available in 'Wealth in Great Britain 2006/08' at the following web link:</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/16" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/wealth-assets-2006-2008/Wealth_in_GB_2006_2008.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/wealth-assets-2006-2008/Wealth_in_GB_2006_2008.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/17" class="indentitalic"> Notes</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/18" class="indent">1. We interpreted the question's mention of pensions savings to mean wealth held in private pensions and therefore provided figures in that context. Private pensions are all pensions that are not state basic retirement or state earnings related. There are nine categories included in the estimates of private pension wealth: defined benefit (DB) pensions, defined contribution (DC) pensions and personal pensions to which the individual was contributing at the time of survey, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) made to current pensions, retained rights in DB and DC schemes, pension funds from which the individual was drawing an income through income drawdown, pensions in payment and pensions expected in the future based on the contributions of a former spouse. The estimates quoted include those individuals with zero pension wealth. The private pension wealth figures provided here were not immediately available from the Wealth and Assets Survey report, and were obtained by carrying out in house analysis of the data.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/19" class="indent">2. We provide figures for both mean and median private pension wealth. The median may provide a better measure compared to the mean since the distribution of private pension wealth can be skewed by a small number of very large amounts of wealth at the top of the distribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/20" class="indent">3. We interpreted the question's mention of other savings to mean wealth held in financial assets. A general complexity with measuring individual level financial wealth in surveys is that many assets are held jointly by more than one person, particularly within couples. It is for this reason that the 'Wealth in Great Britain 2006/08' report based on the data collected by the Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) presents financial assets held by households collectively rather than by each individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/21" class="indent">4. The Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) is a large scale nationally representative longitudinal survey of over 30,000 private households in Great Britain that provides comprehensive information on people's assets and net wealth. The first wave was conducted from July 2006 to June 2008. It collected detailed information on financial and non-financial assets, and wealth components such as savings, pensions, property, mortgages and debt as well as people's attitudes and savings behaviour over time.</p>
