Net enrolment ratio is enrolment of the official age group for a given level of education, expressed as a percentage of the population in that age group.</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.9/1">In March 2006, the UN Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation announced an action plan which included a call for a global mechanism to promote water operators partnerships. We intend to increase support to various partnership initiatives that support public utilities and we are currently considering how best to do this. We are discussing a number of proposals with potential partners. Previous experience has shown that twinning agreements and capacity building arrangements in the sector can often be ineffective. Our approach to public partnerships should capitalise on this experience and be based on evidence of what works best. In particular, we want to be sure that any new partnerships are set up with the right incentives in place and do not duplicate or undermine the efforts of other established partnership approaches.</p>

	<p pid="a.741W.5/1">The Multistakeholder Forestry Programme (MFP) has worked with civil society and government organisations to broker new relationships between citizens and the state in relation to forest policy-making. DFID has contributed &pound;25 million to this work since 2000. The programme is transforming forest governance in Indonesia, promoting citizens' voice and government accountability, and increasing transparency and participation in policy-making, which is having a strong impact on poverty and forest management.</p>
	<p pid="a.741W.5/2">The programme ended in December 2006. DFID commissioned a series of independent reviews of its outcomes. These showed considerable impact in reducing poverty and conflict, in securing access to state forest lands by local communities, in improving small enterprises, in reducing illegal logging, and in rebuilding trust and effective government in a fragile state. A portrait of the programme was also written by a British journalist and published in a book entitled &quot;Aid That Works&quot;, highlighting many human interest stories and how lives have changed by the improvements in forest governance in Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="a.741W.5/3">The programme has built a solid platform for taking forward the new DFID White Paper agenda&mdash;engaging in governance reforms in difficult environments, working across Whitehall, and addressing climate change. We are now preparing joint work with the FCO in Indonesia to carry forward this agenda, particularly in addressing the international trade in illegal timber, the stabilisation of local land rights to curb deforestation and illegal logging, and to raise the profile of climate change and the huge contribution to greenhouse gas emissions made by deforestation in Indonesia. Initially this will be supported as part of DFID's &pound;24 million global Forest Governance and Trade programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.2/1">DFID has a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Indonesia on combating illegal logging, and a wider forest governance reform programme, the Multistakeholder Forestry Programme (MFP). As part of the &pound;25 million bilateral MFP, DFID has spent approximately &pound;2 million per year, over the past three years, on research, advocacy, coordination, media communications, training and policy development to combat illegal logging. While the MFP has ended, DFID's bilateral commitment to combating illegal logging continues under a &pound;24 million global programme on Forest Governance and Trade. We expect to spend over &pound;1 million each year over the next three years from this global programme in Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/2">Through its contributions to the EU, DFID is also contributing to a number of EU-funded projects combating illegal logging in Indonesia. The EU-Illegal Logging Response Centre, the EC Tropical Forest Budget Line, and the EU support to the Asia Regional Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) process, have all contributed over &pound;2 million per year, and the new EU-Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Support Project will spend just under &pound;2 million per year over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/3">Through its staff and contributions to the World Bank, DFID has also contributed to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-World Bank partnership against illegal logging in Indonesia, and leveraged US$1 million (2006-07) from a Dutch Trust Fund for a Forest Transparency Initiative. Through its contributions to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), DFID has contributed to the work of the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) in supporting the Asia Forest Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/4">These funds are backed up by the staff that we have in our Policy Division, the DFID Indonesia country office, and seconded to the European Commission office responsible for global forestry support, as well as the work we do across Whitehall in providing a coherent response to this international problem from DFID, DEFRA and FCO.</p>

	<p pid="a.744W.0/1">The following table shows the debts currently owed by Low Income and Lower Middle Income Countries to the UK through DFID, as well as debt relief and cancellation in terms of flow relief and stock cancellation for these countries. No debt is owed directly by any government to CDC Group plc, which only lends to commercial organisations. However, some loans by CDC to parastatal and quasi-governmental organisations were guaranteed by their governments. Income to CDC and debt relief on these loans is therefore included in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.744W.0/2">Debts owed by countries to the World Bank on loans financed by the UK and other then-EEC donors in the 1970s are listed separately. DFID receives payments on these loans from the World Bank. The loans reverted to bilateral status in 2005 and those to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) are being treated in accordance with the UK's 100 per cent. debt relief policies. All payments by HIPCs to the UK since 2000 on these loans will be returned to them when they complete the HIPC Initiative. The balance of the loans will also be cancelled. Payments returned to HIPCs so far are listed as flow relief since 2004, with loans cancelled recorded as stock cancellation. DFID is in the process of returning payments and cancelling our share of these loans to Malawi and Sierra Leone, which recently completed the HIPC Initiative. We are also in the process of returning payments received from Mauritania.</p>

	<p pid="a.748W.2/1">No debt is owed directly by any government to CDC Group plc, which only lends to commercial organisations. Some loans by CDC to parastatal and quasi-governmental organisations were guaranteed by their governments, and income to CDC from these loans is recorded in the table. The only income received directly by DFID from a Low Income Country (LIC) in 2005-06 came from Zimbabwe, which has not met the standards of accountability, public financial management and commitment to poverty reduction needed to qualify for debt relief from the UK. No payments are expected from LICs in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="a.748W.2/12">In addition, &pound;1.852 million was received by DFID in 2005-06, and &pound;1.883 million is expected in 2006-07 from repayments by countries to the World Bank on loans that were originally funded by the UK and other then EEC creditors in the 1970s. The bulk of these loans were to Low Income Countries. Debts held by Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) are cancelled in full when they reach HIPC Completion Point, with any payments made to the UK since 2000 returned to them. The UK is not currently able to provide debt relief on our share of the loans to non-HIPC Low Income Countries as this requires the agreement of all eight creditors. We are continuing discussions and hope to be able to offer debt relief on these loans soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.748W.5/1">The UK is a major supporter of Word Food Programme (WFP) globally and in Somalia. WFP plans to distribute 114,000mt (metric tonnes) of food aid in Somalia this year, and a significant proportion of this will be in the worst affected areas in southern and central Somalia, such as Middle and Lower Juba. The UK is the second largest contributor after the US to the World Food Programme's (WFP) protracted Relief and Recovery Operation 10191, which runs to <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2007</phrase>, with US$11.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.5/2">WFP is currently preparing a food aid convoy from Mogadishu to Wajid. A distribution in Middle Shabelle was planned just before the recent fighting, but it remains stalled because of lack of clarity over the security situation in that region. In Middle and Lower Juba there has been some limited food aid distribution in Bualle. There are 1000mt on trucks at Afmadow in Lower Juba, which it is planned will be distributed soon. WFP also has teams in Wajid that are on standby for a return to Kismayo.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.5/3">The recent conflict caused restrictions on access to Somalia for relief workers and supplies. However, for most agencies, including WFP, it is proving possible to resume operations, although there have been some problems related to the re-emergence of local militias. The UK continues to take all opportunities to press the authorities on the ground to allow for the re-establishment of humanitarian relief operations in all areas, including the deliveries of WFP food aid and the use of helicopters and aircraft. Much of this operation is funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund to which the UK is the largest single contributor. WFP has adequate supplies for the next five to six months for Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="a.749W.2/11">We are also examining urgently, with donor partners, how existing donor support to restoring effective policing in parts of Somalia can be extended to southern and central Somalia. This support is being channelled primarily through the UNDP's Rule of Law and Security programme (RoLS), which has been supporting police strengthening in Somaliland, Puntland and Baidoa.

	<p pid="a.755W.2/1">Traffic calming measures will have an effect on motorcycle traffic directly and also indirectly as a result of slowing the speed of the general flow of traffic, including motorcycles. Full width road humps are likely to be the most effective in slowing motorcycles directly. I recognise that speed cushions and chicanes may be less effective in slowing motorcycles. It is for the relevant highway authority to determine the most appropriate form of traffic calming dependingon local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.755W.5/1">16-year-olds are entitled to ride mopeds, which have an engine capacity of under 50 cc and are limited to a maximum speed of around 50 mph. Anyone wanting to ride a moped, even with a provisional licence, must first of all successfully complete a Compulsory Basic Training course. This is a legal requirement, which is designed to provide riders with the necessary skills before riding unaccompanied on the road. In this way, those who need independence and mobility at a younger age are given the opportunity to gain it.</p>
	<p pid="a.755W.5/2">The number of personal injury road accidents reported to the police, in each of the last five years, involving a 16-year-old rider on a motorcycle of 50 cc and under (whether or not the rider was themselves injured) are:</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.755W.5/13">In 2005, 1,882 16-year-old riders of mopeds were injured in road accidents, of whom four were killed and 318 were seriously injured. A further 38 pillion passengers of 16-year-old moped riders were injured, of whom none was killed and five were seriously injured. In addition, another 71 road users were injured in accidents involving 16-year-old moped riders, of whom none was killed and 12 were seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid="a.755W.5/14">Accidents involving 16-year-old moped riders accounted for 8 per cent. of all accidents involving motorcycles and 8 per cent. of all casualties to motorcycle riders and passengers but only accounted for less than 1 per cent. of fatal accidents and casualties. We have not made any other assessment of the impact on road safety of permitting 16-year-olds to drive mopeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.755W.5/15">We have no plans to consider raising the minimum age for riding a moped. Moped riders of all ages will benefit from the range of measures for improving the safety of all motorcycle users, as set out in &quot;The Government's Motorcycling Strategy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.755W.5/16">In addition, last year the Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA) produced a DVD on moped safety &quot;Get the Message: Act Your Age&quot;, which is aimed at young moped riders. Manufacturers provide a free copy with all new mopeds. It has also been distributed to all secondary schools and local authority road safety officers, as part of MCIA's educational resource &quot;Links: connecting citizenship and Road User Education&quot;.</p>

The regulations and guidance will make clear to local authorities the information that their parking documents must contain and the information that the Secretary of State recommends they contain.</p>

	<p pid="a.766W.0/1">A sound basis of research to understand the implications of a changing climate is essential to drawing a climate change perspective into decision-making across the whole range of Defra's responsibilities. Defra's climate change research programme analyses the risk of human-induced climate change. It also assesses the potential impacts of climate change and our means of adaptation and mitigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/2">Defra's committed spend to those research projects which have some relevance to climate change is given in the following table.</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="a.766W.0/15">In addition to spending on projects relating directly to climate change, the figures given in the table also include spending on projects of a cross-cutting nature where climate change may be of secondary importance but still has some relevance.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/16">Details on all the climate change research funded by Defra can be found on the Defra website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/17" class="indent"><a href="http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project_data/projects.asp?M=KWS">http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project_data/projects.asp?M=KWS</a>&amp;V==climate+change&amp;SUBMIT1=Search&amp;SCOPE=0</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/18">Research on climate change funded by Defra is assessed through peer-review where relevant both prior to commissioning and after completion. Defra staff routinely review the progress and outcome of projects, often with the assistance of independent steering committees. As part of these processes, value for money is evaluated throughout the lifetime of a research project and its translation into policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/19">Defra also commissions periodic reviews of its research contracts. A technical and scientific review of the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) was carried out in 2005 to assess its performance and identify its priorities for the next five years. The review concluded that UKCIP is performing very effectively with the resources available and therefore represents good value for the current level of investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/20">Defra's research budget includes support for the Hadley Centre, which it co-funds with MOD) (contributions of &pound;12.5 million and &pound;3.5 million respectively in 2005-06).</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/21">Defra and the Ministry of Defence have commissioned a major independent review of the activities of the Hadley Centre. This review is concerned with the scientific output and quality of the Hadley Centre's activities, as well as structure and engagement with external stakeholders. A final report is due to be published by the end of this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/22">The UK Research Councils support a considerable amount of research that is both directly about climate change or is relevant to climate change. Taken together this is of the order of &pound;400 million over the five years. They have also invested over &pound;190 million over the same period into sustainable and future energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.0/23">Research work of relevance to climate change is also undertaken and funded by the Department for International Development, and the Department for Transport. In addition, the Department of Trade and Industry, funds research into emerging low carbon technologies.</p>

Probation areas seek to make the public aware of this work and the positive contribution it makes to the community by means such as the use of plaques and signs at work sites, displays in public buildings, and by presentations to community groups. All probation areas have set up systems encouraging the public to suggest projects which they would like to see carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.9/2">In March 2006, probation areas completed a snapshot of their unpaid work provision. This showed the strong links to a wide variety of partners as sources of unpaid work of which the main ones were the voluntary sector (45 per cent.), local authorities (38 per cent.), education (15 per cent.), faith groups (12 per cent.) and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (10 per cent.). The overall numbers add up to more than 100 per cent. as some projects fit more than one category.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.2/1">Plans to establish new models for conditional cautioning were announced in the Respect Action Plan launched in January 2006. These new models involve the offender undertaking unpaid (reparative) work&mdash;to make good the damage they have caused to the local community that has suffered. In this way, offenders give something back to the community to repair the harm they have caused. The pilots are now starting in Durham, Lancashire, Merseyside, North Wales, South Yorkshire, Thames Valley and West Mercia, and will run until December 2007. A decision on whether to expand the scheme will be taken early next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.782W.5/3">These offices will open in 2007 and the network will subsequently be used for the national identity scheme. Where the network of enrolment centres needs to be further expanded, we will first seek to use high street offices that are already used by central and local government. The extent to which this will be done and the offices involved will be determined following further analysis of the needs of the scheme. We will also look at options for the private sector providing outlets. The Authentication by Interview project for passports is working with local authorities to make use of their offices to provide remote interview facilities (via videoconferencing) for remote communities that are not near any of the 69 local interview offices.</p>

	<p pid="a.800W.3/3">In the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) work is ongoing to estimate the cost of the extensions to 15 and 20 hours, based on population and take-up data and current levels of funding. We are seeking to roll-out the extension to 15 hours gradually, starting with 20 pathfinder local authorities who will begin providing the 15 hours and greater flexibility from April this year. These pathfinders will provide crucial information on the practical local implications of the changes which will underpin national estimates of the cost of extending the entitlement and increasing its flexibility. Figures cannot be confirmed in advance of the Department's Comprehensive Spending Review settlement and until we have these findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.3/4">We have no plans to extend the free entitlement to 43 rather than 38 weeks, though some local authorities offer the current free entitlement over more than 38 weeks by providing access to fewer hours per week where this is what parents want for their children.</p>

	<p pid="a.801W.0/1">I announced in October 2006 the withdrawal of automatic fee remission from courses in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) from August 2007. This move follows significant growth in spend on ESOL, which tripled between 2001 and 2005. At the same time, however, learners from priority groups who need to improve their English skills for employability and integration are finding it increasingly difficult to access the help they need quickly. The change to fee remission policy will help us to focus limited resources on those learners who most need our support.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.0/2">Those learners in receipt of benefits or on working tax credit will be eligible for full fee remission. However, the Government will continue to support the cost of learning for those who are asked for a contribution and will fund around 77 per cent. of the overall cost of learning. It is reasonable that where employers are benefiting from the opportunity to recruit in large numbers from outside the UK we should ask them to fund the full cost of English language learning and where employers seek training provision through programmes such as Train to Gain, ESOL costs will be considered as part of the overall package.</p>

	<p pid="a.802W.5/2">It is vital that we secure effective progression pathways for people looking to continue learning beyond level 3 either through further or higher education. Within their funding responsibilities, both the Learning and Skills Council and the Higher Education Funding Council for England have made important contributions to developing non-traditional pathways, particularly for people seeking to progress through the vocational route. Within our wider discussions with the funding councils about the future development of higher level skills and learning, we are considering whether there is a more effective way of organising responsibilities for funding the provision of non-prescribed higher education. Our further consideration of the issues will be set in the context of the changes needed to deliver the ambitions for higher level skills set out in the report from Lord Leitch on the UK's future skills needs. We have asked the two funding councils to work together to assess the issues relating to the current funding of higher level skills provision and to make appropriate recommendations. There are a number of complex issues to be considered and we do not expect to reach conclusions before the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.807W.8/1">The Renewables Obligation (RO) is the Government's key policy for promoting renewable energy. Suppliers of electricity are obliged to supply an increasing percentage of electricity from renewable sources by surrendering Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) or pay a buy-out price. Those suppliers that surrender ROCs receive a share of the total buy-out fund. Co-firing of biomass in coal fired station is eligible for ROCs and suppliers can meet 10 per cent. obligation through co-firing. We are consulting on whether to remove the limit on co-firing in conjunction with banding the RO. Banding the RO will allow for technologies to be given more targeted levels of support through awarding multiple or fractional ROCs. Subject to assessment of responses to the consultation and passage of legislation, banding and removal of the co-firing cap could begin in April 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.808W.5/1">Given the importance of low-carbon transport, the Department has been in discussion with niche all-electric vehicle manufacturers over plans to introduce electric cars, vans and trucks. Support is also provided to electric vehicle projects. For example Modec has been awarded a Selective Finance for Investment in England grant of up to &pound;1.39 million to support the production of an electric delivery van with drivetrain developed by Zytek, a UK automotive technology company, using up to 85 per cent. UK components. Cenex, the UK's low carbon and fuel cell centre of excellence, is also supporting Zytek to convert up to 200 Daimler Chrysler Smart cars to all-electric operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.808W.5/2">The Foresight Vehicle technology road map developed by the Department in collaboration with industry highlights the importance of electric drivetrain technology not just for electric-only vehicles, but also to hybrid systems including those potentially using fuel cells.</p>

	<p pid="a.809W.2/1">Ofgem, the independent regulator, is responsible for regulation of the UK gas market, operating within a framework set by Government. We welcome the fact that Ofgem is calling for the recent reductions in the wholesale price of gas to be passed on to consumers. Ofgem indicates, however, that there can be a time lag. Within this competitive market, individual pricing decisions are a matter for each of the energy companies, and the Government cannot direct Ofgem as to its approach on prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.809W.2/2">The regulatory framework provides for Ofgem to fine companies up to 10 per cent. of annual worldwide turnover if it finds evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. Ofgem can also refer the market to the Competition Commission if it finds evidence that competition is not working.</p>

	<p pid="a.811W.5/1">When the Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 1 was launched in April 2006, &pound;6.5 million was set aside to be allocated to the household stream over three years. Due to higher than anticipated demand, we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October 2006</phrase> that we would be re-allocating &pound;6.2 million of the total &pound;28.5 million funding to the household stream. This will give a total pot of &pound;12.7 million, which on projected demand levels should allow householder funding to continue until June 2008. By this time, some of our wider measures to promote microgeneration should be taking hold, and we believe the sector may have matured to a point where householder grants are no longer necessary.</p>

We believe eradication should be targeted where there is access to legal rural livelihoods, as set out in the Afghan government's National Drug Control Strategy. The Afghan government has yet to make a final decision on whether ground based spraying of poppy will be conducted in 2007. The UK supports the well-explained piloting of ground based spraying in areas of Afghanistan where the security situation permits, and if the Afghan government agrees, in order to assess its relative effectiveness compared to current eradication approaches. We judge that the risks of ground based spraying in Afghanistan to health and the environment are within acceptable levels. We continue to oppose aerial spraying, as does President Karzai.</p>

	<p pid="a.820W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has had no discussions with the Burmese Ambassador about the prosecution of State Peace and Development Council officials and members of the Burmese military for crimes of rape and sexual violence. I raised our serious concerns about this issue with the Burmese Ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-15">15 June 2006</phrase>. We also take other opportunities to raise human rights issues with the Burmese regime. I raised our concerns with Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Ambassadors, including the Burmese Ambassador, on <phrase class="date" code="">18 September</phrase>, and with the ASEAN Secretary-General on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase>. I discussed the serious human rights abuses taking place in Burma with Juan Mendez, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, on <phrase class="date" code="">27 June</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>, I discussed Burma in detail with Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs. Our Ambassador in Rangoon regularly raises human rights violations with the Burmese government, most recently when he met the Burmese Deputy Foreign Minister and the Ministers for Planning and Immigration on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.820W.5/2">We condemn the use of sexual violence and rape as a weapon of war. Professor Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma, has reported a large number of allegations of sexual violence against women committed by members of the Burmese military. We believe these abuses should be investigated and that those responsible should be brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.820W.5/3">The UK played an active role in securing the latest UN General Assembly Resolution on Burma, adopted on <phrase class="date" code="">22 December</phrase>. This resolution expresses grave concern about use of rape and other forms of sexual violence and calls on the Burmese government to take urgent measures to put an end to this practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.823W.8/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase> we have made numerous representations about the application of the death penalty. In that period, over 20 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. As stated in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 2006 Annual Human Rights Report we and the EU have lobbied in 2005-06, among other countries, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Botswana, Cameroon, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Malawi, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, the US, Vietnam and Yemen. Since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase>, we have lobbied most, if not all, countries which retain the death penalty in law. We have carried this out through multi-lateral and bilateral demarches or dialogues, and through lobbying for co-sponsorship of resolutions in the Commission for Human Rights and at the United Nations General Assembly.</p>

	<p pid="a.824W.2/1">Reports suggest that Laurent Nkunda met with General John Numbi and other Congolese army representatives in early January. It is important for stability in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the region that the situation in North Kivu is resolved. We support the efforts of the Congolese Government to do so in a way that avoids causing further suffering to the population of North Kivu.</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.2/2">The UK continues to support the Congolese Government, the UN peacekeeping force in the DRC (MONUC), and other bilateral and multinational efforts to secure an end to the conflict and lasting peace in DRC. Successful elections for which the UK was the leading bilateral donor, were an important part of that process. The UK is actively supporting Congolese army reform, which is also crucial to the country's long-term security.</p>

The &quot;phase 2&quot; report on the UK was published in March 2005. It commended a number of aspects of our anti-bribery framework, such as employee whistleblower protection, the ability of the tax authorities to make spontaneous disclosures of suspicious information to law enforcement agencies and the wide scope of the &quot;regulated sector&quot; in our anti-money-laundering reporting regime. The report also noted the Government's support provided to a range of private sector and civil society anti-corruption initiatives. In addition, the report made a number of recommendations for further action, for example in our awareness-raising efforts, on investigation and prosecution and on working with the Crown dependencies and overseas territories. In line with the standard procedure, the UK gave an oral progress report to the WGB in March 2006 and we will be submitting a written report in March this year. I will place a copy of this report in the Library of the House after the WGB plenary discussion in March.</p>

The agenda is drawn up by the Commonwealth Secretariat, in consultation with all Commonwealth member states. The Government have no plans at present to request a special session on human rights in Uganda.</p>

The UK also takes an active role in Kampala in the Partners for Democracy and Governance group and its sub group, the Human Rights Working Group. Both groups regularly review human rights issues and raise concerns with the Ugandan Government and civil society.</p>

	<p pid="a.835W.5/2">Before the bilateral extradition treaty between the UK and the UAE was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>, there were two formal treaty negotiation meetings between our two countries. There were also informal discussions between officials of both countries.</p>

Until this time, there are no general extradition relations between the UK and UAE. As I explained to the hon. Member in an answer I gave to a previous question on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-12">12 December 2006</phrase>, under section 193 of the Extradition Act 2003, the UK can have extradition relations with non-treaty partners who are party to international conventions that contain extradition provisions and to which the UK is also a party.</p>

	<p pid="a.844W.8/1">The UK made an application to the Commission which made the strongest possible case for renewal of this derogation. However, the Communication of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December 2006</phrase> (reference 16528/06 (Com(2006)743)), on the operation of private pleasure craft, confirmed that the Commission would not be submitting a proposal to the council for renewal of the derogation permitting the use of red diesel. The question of a vote on the issue did not therefore arise. The UK's position, including its assessment of the implications for regional policy, is set out in its application to the Commission for renewal of the derogation, and the Government's estimate of compliance and other costs is set out in the partial RIA published in March 2006. Both documents have been deposited in the Library of the House of Commons. Officials are in discussions with concerned and affected organisations to discuss how the new arrangements can be administered so as to minimise the compliance costs to businesses and individuals.</p>

	<p pid="a.849W.5/1">Central Government began receiving housing receipts in 2004-05. Before then, with-debt local authorities were required to set aside a proportion of their housing receipts. The receipts set-aside could only be used for the repayment of the authority's debt. From 2004-05 set-aside no longer applied to Right to Buy (RTB) receipts as the &quot;pooling&quot; regime was introduced to ensure fair distribution of receipts and investment across the country, whereby local authorities paid over or &quot;pooled&quot; a proportion of their housing receipts to the Secretary of State to support wider housing investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/2">The proportion of the capital receipt set-aside or pooled is 75 per cent. for a dwelling and 50 per cent. for a non-dwelling asset. The local authority is free to use the remaining 25 per cent. or 50 per cent. respectively for any capital purpose they see fit.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/3">Data formally collected about amounts set-aside and data collected about the value of receipts pooled by the Secretary of State does not separately identify the value of the set-aside or pooled capital receipt derived from RTB disposals. The data cover all housing set aside/pooled receipts. These include receipts arising from the sales of vacant housing land, shops, community centres, and garages that are on estates owned by local authorities, and receipts arising from the sales of dwellings made under powers other than Right to Buy.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.5/4">The following table shows total receipts set aside and pooled for the whole of Manchester, since the Department does not collect data for individual areas such as South Manchester; nor does it collect data on the amount of receipts retained by local authorities. The table also shows the amount of financial support Manchester has received for its capital expenditure programme. This does not include support to Registered Social Landlords who all have built new homes in Manchester. It also includes the amount of revenue subsidy Manchester receives for running its own housing stock. Pre 1995-96 data is only available at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.856W.5/1">Since 1997 we have reduced the number of non-decent homes by more than 1 million. We have increased the funding available to Councils to invest in improvement of their stock to about &pound;1,100 per Council per home compared with spend equivalent of &pound;800 in 1997. This is a 30 per cent. increase in real terms. On top of that we will have also made &pound;3.7 billion available for ALMOs delivering improvements to council housing stock, and &pound;2.7 billion for PFI schemes by March 2008. In total over &pound;20 billion of public money has been invested in improving council housing since 1997. In addition &pound;7.8 billion of private funding has been levered through stock transfer and private finance initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.5/2">We expect 95 per cent. of the stock to be decent by 2010 and the majority of landlords making all their stock decent in this timescale. Work will have been completed to 3.6 million homes, with improvements for 8 million people in total, 2.5 million children among them.</p>

It is a guide for Housing Associations and their consultants. It is also the basis upon which the Corporation will assess HAs' performance on developing housing projects. It concentrates upon design and quality issues relating to individual schemes and procedural compliance issues. The Housing Corporation has no plans to change these at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.2/2">The Government have set out their intention to increase the number of homes which meet the lifetime homes standards, as set out in the Code for Sustainable Homes. &quot;Lifetime Homes&quot; have 16 design features that ensure a new house or flat will meet the needs of most households. The accent is on accessibility and design features that make the home flexible enough to meet whatever comes along in life: a teenager with a broken leg, a family member with serious illness, or parents carrying in heavy shopping and dealing with a pushchair.</p>

Local authorities and their commissioning bodies determine these priorities locally and are expected to make investment decisions to deliver these priorities, which could include leaseholders.

Before then, with-debt local authorities were required instead to set aside a proportion of their housing receipts. The receipts set aside could only be used for the repayment of the authority's debt. From 2004-05 set-aside no longer applied to most housing receipts as the &quot;pooling&quot; regime was introduced, whereby local authorities paid over or &quot;pooled&quot; a proportion of those receipts to the Secretary of State to support housing investment across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.864W.5/2">The proportion of the capital receipt set aside or pooled is 75 per cent. for a dwelling and 50 per cent. for a non-dwelling asset. The local authority is free to use the remaining 25 per cent. or 50 per cent. respectively for any capital purpose they see fit.</p>
