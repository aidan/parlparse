	<p pid="a.4W.5/1">A road traffic collision involving four large goods vehicles occurred on the northbound carriageway of M1 adjacent to the J20 northbound entry slip at 2.50 am on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase>. Leicestershire police led the incident and directed that the motorway should be closed in order to deal with the casualties and recover the vehicles involved. This was a serious incident involving one death and life-threatening injuries to a second driver who had to be released from his vehicle by the emergency services.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.5/2">The police handed over the scene to the Highways Agency at 2.51 pm, following the removal of the last vehicle, to prepare the road for reopening. A large amount of diesel and spilled loads had to be cleared and temporary repairs to be made to the carriageway surface before the carriageway could be reopened, which was achieved at 4.44 pm. A permanent repair was left until it could be carried out overnight when there would be less disruption to the travelling public.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.5/3">Leicestershire police are carrying out their own investigation of the circumstances of the incident and the matter has been voluntarily referred by the police to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) who will oversee the result of the police investigation. All of the Highways Agency staff involved in the incident (both in the East Midlands control room and on-road Traffic Officers) were de-briefed on the day of the incident in order to identify and learn any lessons from the Agency's handling of the incident.</p>

The Environment Agency's national flood risk assessments estimate the numbers of properties at different probabilities of flood risk (but do not separately identify those which have actually flooded). The most recent of these was completed in 2006. The Office of the Water Regulator (Ofwat) compile figures on the numbers of properties at varying risk of flooding from overloaded sewers. DEFRA does not hold comprehensive national figures on the numbers of properties flooded from all sources of flooding (river, sea, surface, groundwater and sewer) in any given year.</p>

Decisions on which improvement projects to promote with this money rest with the Environment Agency within the overall policy and prioritisation framework set by the Government. I have not yet had any discussions with the Agency about Hertfordshire in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.8/2">I understand from the Environment Agency that the only significant flooding that has occurred in the last five years was in 2002 when the River Colne overtopped its banks adjacent to Lower High Street, Watford. 25 commercial properties were flooded.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.8/3">The Environment Agency completed works to construct a flood wall at the location in March 2007. The Environment Agency carries out routine inspections of flood defence assets. Currently, 95 per cent. of all Environment Agency and third party-owned flood defence assets within Hertfordshire are at or above a nationally defined target level.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.8/4">The Environment Agency operates a risk-based inspection programme of all flood defence structures located upon the main river network. The frequency of these inspections is determined by a risk assessment of the consequences of failure of a particular structure. The rolling programme of inspection covers Hertfordshire and the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.8/5">The recent weather conditions have not presented new information that creates a need to revise this inspection programme for any main river systems within Hertfordshire. All main river flood defences within Hertfordshire are fully assessed in terms of their adequacy and priority for any maintenance needed. Where third party-owned assets require maintenance the Environment Agency inform the owners of what is needed and follow up to ensure that the works are carried out.</p>

	<p pid="a.11W.3/1">In the case of R. <i> v.</i> Rawlings heard in Shrewsbury Crown court last month, the defendant was found guilty on three out of 14 counts of storage of non-approved pesticides. The judge imposed a conditional discharge for two years in relation to each count. The jury were unable to reach a verdict on the remaining 11 counts. The defendant was ordered to pay &pound;8,500 towards prosecution costs but was granted 50 per cent. of his defence costs from central funds to be calculated at the legal aid rate. The Department does not post complete reports of court cases on its website as it is impractical. A news release, however, was issued summarising the outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.3/2">The Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) is studying the court transcript and will be responding to the judge's comments about the differential in prices between pesticides in the UK and similar pesticides in other member states. The Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food (the Curry Commission) recommended in 2002 a move towards a more harmonised system for approvals of pesticides across the EC. Proposals from the European Commission for amendment of the approvals regime, which are currently under negotiation, will help to achieve that objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.3/3">Meanwhile to secure safety of operators, consumers, bystanders, residents and the environment, only pesticides approved as safe under UK conditions may be stored, sold or used in the UK. In the case of pesticides imported from other member states, approval is given, subject to a fee to cover administrative costs, if it is demonstrated firstly that the imported product is not materially different to one approved for UK use, and secondly that the label bears the necessary safety information, in English. Some 145 such approvals for &quot;parallel imports&quot; are issued each year. They are not time limited.</p>

	<p pid="a.12W.2/1">'Waste Strategy for England 2007', published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-24">24 May 2007</phrase>, sets out a range of measures which will help businesses of all sizes to improve their recycling rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.12W.2/2">These measures include: a higher and faster rate of increase in the landfill tax escalator, which will make it cheaper for businesses to separate waste materials for recycling; and continued advice and support through the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.12W.2/3">BREW is funded through the landfill tax, and is aimed at reducing the amount of waste that businesses produce and improving their resource efficiency, including through increased rates of recycling. Results from the first year of the programme suggest that businesses have saved over &pound;4 for each &pound;1 invested through BREW, as well as increased environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.12W.2/4">In the strategy, the Government encourage local authorities to take on a wider role to help local, particularly smaller, business to reduce and recycle their waste. A joint Local Government Association/National Industrial Symbiosis Programme/Oxfordshire county council project, funded through BREW, is piloting work on what local authorities can do to contribute effectively to business waste management and resource efficiency (including trade waste recycling collection services). In addition, the Waste and Resource Action Programme (WRAP) is running pilots of recycling collection services for smaller to medium sized enterprises (SME) waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.12W.2/5">Further details on these and other measures aimed at improving small business recycling rates are available in the strategy, which is available on the DEFRA website and in the Library of the House.</p>

As Afghanistan's G8 partner nation on counter narcotics, the UK lobbies for continued and increased international assistance and support for the Afghan Government's National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS). We are also helping the Afghans to sharpen the implementation of the NDCS which has four priorities: targeting the trafficker; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods; reducing demand; and developing state institutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.28W.6/1">Colombia has suffered from 40 years of internal conflict, fuelled by the illegal drugs trade. In his five years as President, Alvaro Uribe has achieved remarkable advances: security is much improved; violent crime is hugely reduced; 35,000 paramilitaries have demobilised; and the economy is prospering.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.6/2">President Uribe's Colombia is a key UK ally in the region. UK co-operation with Colombia focuses on the fight against drugs and improving the difficult human rights situation. It is one of constructive engagement rather than uncritical support. We support the efforts of President Uribe to tackle the country's serious inter-connected problems. But we can and do remind the government of Colombia of the need to address areas of concern vigorously.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.6/3">On drugs, co-operation is close and effective. President Uribe's government is committed to improving the difficult human rights situation. But serious concerns remain: illegal armed groups commit wide ranging abuses, and threats to trade unionists and human rights defenders continue, and are unacceptable. Extra-judicial killings are rising. 49 per cent. of Colombians live in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.6/4">We welcomed President Uribe's decision in June to release a number of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (PARC) operatives, including Rodrigo Granda, as a positive step forward for a path to lasting peace in Colombia. It has been disappointing that the PARC have not responded positively to President Uribe's bold move. Along with EU partners and others in the international community, we have expressed our outrage at the killings in June of 11 Colombian hostages held by the PARC, and extended our condolences to all those affected by this tragedy.</p>

The UK signed the Convention on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-14">14 September 2005</phrase>. The legislation required to implement the Convention is now in place in the UK, and the Government are currently preparing the necessary documents to be laid before Parliament prior to ratification. The Convention imposes an obligation on States Parties to report to the UN Secretary-General the final outcome of criminal proceedings undertaken in respect of the offences set out in the Convention. States Parties will also be expected to report to the committees of the UN Security Council that monitor implementation of States' counter-terrorism and non-proliferation obligations, on the implementation of their obligations under the Convention in a more general sense. While the Overseas Territories will not be included at the time of the UK's ratification, there remains the possibility of extending the Convention to the Overseas Territories following consultation with them and the passing of any necessary legislation in each Territory. With our international partners, the UK has strongly encouraged all States to sign and ratify the Convention. Most recently, in a joint statement on counter-terrorism issued at the Heiligendamm Summit on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-08">8 June</phrase>, the leaders of the G8 called on all States to ratify the Convention.</p>

	<p pid="a.32W.5/1">The UK holds regular discussions with Arab governments on ways to reduce violence in the Middle East, including attacks against Israel. These are often focussed on efforts to implement UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), including those aimed at preventing attacks on Israel. In May we lobbied a number of regional governments, drawing their attention to the provisions of UNSCR 1747 and seeking their support in implementing the provisions more effectively. Among other things, this resolution imposed a legally binding embargo on the export/transfer of all arms from Iran, including to Hezbollah and Palestinian rejectionist groups. We also regularly raise the implementation of UNSCR 1701, which brought an end to the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. We enjoy the support of many Arab partners in our efforts to implement relevant UN Resolutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.11/1">This information is not held centrally. The Government recognise the role which faith-based organisations play in delivering public services through grants and contracts with central and local government. The Government want to ensure that the range of community based organisations, including faith-based groups, can access the support available to perform their multiple roles of providing voice to citizens and in building communities. The Office of the Third Sector's Strategic Partners programme includes funding to some faith-based organisations to enable them to provide representative 'voice' for the third sector, or an element of third sector activity, at national level, including on public service delivery issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.11/2">The Third Sector Review, conducted jointly by HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office, as part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review, looking at the future role of the third sector in economic and social regeneration, held targeted events for faith groups as part of its consultation process in 2006. The review also received written representation from faith groups. The Government will seek to ensure continued dialogue with these and other groups and that all of the measures in the Third Sector Review, including the &pound;80 million small grants fund announced in the Budget, will be as accessible as possible to a wide range of organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.51W.3/1">The most recent data available on take-up of paternity leave is from the Maternity and Paternity Rights and Benefits: Survey of Parents 2005. The report of findings is available at the House of Commons Library and at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file27446.pdf">www.berr.gov.uk/files/file27446.pdf</a>. Statistics in this report are based on responses from a sample of mothers and fathers who had a child in December 2003 who were surveyed approximately 17 months after the child's birth.</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.3/2">The survey found that 93 per cent. of fathers took some time off around the time of the birth. Of the 93 per cent. who took some time off, 79 per cent. took paternity leave and the average duration was 9.3 days. Table 9.1 in the cited report provides further information.</p>

	<p pid="a.54W.0/2">The success of the strategy will be measured by the Drug Harm Index, which captures a range of social and health harms caused by drugs. This is published annually by the Home Office. In terms of research and evaluation, the complex nature of drug misuse and its associated problems means that research projects often address a range of substantive issues. As such, it is difficult to break down funding into discrete themes. However key projects since 2002 have been around assessing the impact of interventions to tackle the availability and problems caused by drugs, measuring the relationship between drugs and crime, estimating the trends in drug consumption and the number of problematic users, and the relationship between drug consumption and young people. Completed projects are published on the Home office Research, Development and Statistics web page.</p>

	<p pid="a.54W.3/2">The statutory victim contact scheme operates in cases where the offender has been convicted of a sexual or violent offence and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment or more, in England and Wales only. In the case of life sentences, the probation service will be told of any decision to repatriate a foreign national prisoner, so that arrangements can be made to inform the victim or the victim's family of the impending transfer. Ministers have no record of receiving any representations about the provision of information to British victims of crime when the offender is subsequently released from prison outside the United Kingdom.</p>

This included, in its assessment, the success of cameras within the programme in reducing the number of accidents and casualties. The report, a copy of which is in the Library, did not distinguish between front and rear facing cameras. Photographs from front facing cameras may make it easier to identify the driver of a vehicle at the time it was detected committing a speeding offence, thereby making it possible to offer a fixed penalty to or bring a prosecution against that person. Guidance on the use of speed camera photographs is issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>

Reviewing the effectiveness of section 44 Stop and Searches, its impact on communities and its role as a deterrent is an important part of this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.60W.3/2">Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of counter terrorism legislation, noted that work continues to improve the usage of section 44 powers in his report into the operation of the Terrorism Act 2000 in 2006. He also comments on the usage and effectiveness of Stop and Search and we take his recommendations very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.60W.3/3">National guidance for the police on the use of stop and search was published in July 2006. One of the key aims of the guidance is to set out a framework for the use of section 44 powers to ensure that they are used appropriately by officers on the ground. The guidance clearly states that the powers should only be used for searching for articles which could be used in connection with terrorism and that officers should have regard to the full range of other stop and search powers which may be more appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.67W.0/1">By their nature the total cost of military operations are difficult to estimate from the outset. Pre-Budget report 2002 set aside &pound;1 billion for the cost of operations in Iraq. On the basis of MOD forecasts this was increased to &pound;3 billion at Budget 2003 as a prudent contingency.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.0/2">The nature of operations, whether in Iraq or elsewhere, means that they cannot be time-limited from the outset. As a result, HM Treasury maintains a rolling annual estimate of the cost of operations and reviews the costs of and provision for military operations at the time of the pre-Budget report and the Budget. Military operations are routinely evaluated in order to measure progress and capture lessons learnt.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.0/3">By Budget 2003 a total of &pound;240 million had been committed for humanitarian assistance in Iraq, and in addition, Budget 2003 announced a further $100 million to back up the UN and the work of reconstruction and international development. At the Madrid Conference in October 2003, the UK pledged $900 million (&pound;544 million) for reconstruction in Iraq over the period 2003-04 to 2005-06. The 2004 Spending Review allocated funds to enable this commitment to be fulfilled. At the launch of the International Compact for Iraq in Sharm El Sheikh on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May 2007</phrase>, the Foreign Secretary announced that the UK will spend at least &pound;200 million over and above the Madrid pledge, to be disbursed over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.0/4">The Iraq reconstruction programme is subject to the standard internal DFID guidelines for the monitoring and evaluation of all programmes and projects. DFID has reporting arrangements in place for each of the projects it runs in Iraq, which means that funding is tracked and monitored throughout the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.69W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what the life expectancy is of (a) males and (b) females in each of the 25 (i) most deprived electoral wards and (ii) least deprived wards; and how many on average of these years will be spent with a disability. (149945)</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.2/4" class="indent">The attached table provides the period life expectancy at birth in the 25 (i) most deprived and (ii) least deprived wards in England and Wales, as a five-year average for 1999-2003 (the only period available). The figures are presented for (a) males, (b) females and (c) all persons, as some wards are too small for the calculation of life expectancies for males and females separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.2/5" class="indent">These figures are experimental statistics&mdash;that is, statistics which are in a testing or consultation phase and are not fully developed&mdash;and should therefore be treated with caution. Because life expectancies for wards can be based on very small numbers of deaths and small populations, they are subject to large variations even when averaged over five years, and extreme results may be due only to chance.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.2/6" class="indent">Based on these life expectancy figures, ONS will release experimental statistics on disability-free life expectancy at birth for wards on 23rd August 2007. These will provide a breakdown of the period life expectancy estimate for each ward into years spent without a disability (or disability-free) and years spent with a disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.2/7" class="indent">A recently published analysis showed that on average, males could expect to spend 18 out of 71 years (25 per cent.) of life with a disability in the most deprived twentieth of all wards in England and Wales grouped together, and 11 out of 79 years (14 per cent.) in the least deprived twentieth. Females could expect to spend 21 out of 78 years of life (27 per cent.) with a disability in the most deprived twentieth of wards, and 13 out of 82 years (16 per cent.) in the least deprived twentieth.<sup>(1)</sup></p>

The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> Wards for which life expectancy for one or both sexes could not be calculated due to small numbers are marked by '&mdash;'. Life expectancy for all persons combined is given for all wards.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> Deprivation was measured using the Carstairs deprivation score, which reflects levels of household overcrowding, male unemployment, low social class and car ownership.<br/> <sup>(4)</sup> Five year averages, based on deaths registered in each year, and experimental ward population estimates based on the 2001 Census. The ward names and boundaries used are 2001 Census Standard Table wards.<br/> <sup>(5)</sup> The presence of medical and care communal establishments; such as nursing homes and hospices, can artificially depress the average life expectancy of the ward in which they are located. To aid interpretation of the figures, this indicator shows the proportion of the population of each ward, aged 65 and over, who were resident in such establishments in 2001. For this purpose, all wards in England and Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six groups which are numbered from 0 to five:<br/> '0' means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care communal establishments;<br/> '1' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the lowest fifth of all wards;<br/> '5' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the highest fifth of all wards.</td> </tr>

The card clearly states that it is not proof of identity.

The IRMP enables the Authority to tailor cover, to fire and other incidents, to local circumstances by evaluating where risk is greatest and allocating resources accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.76W.11/2"><i> </i>The &pound;14 million package of aid announced by the Prime Minister comprises of three elements.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.11/3">Firstly, there is a &pound;10 million Flood Recovery Grant Scheme administered by my Department to support local authorities in their work within communities affected by the flooding, and in particular to enable them to help those in greatest and most immediate need get back on their feet. This is funding for lower-tier local authorities, so Stoke Goldington Parish Council is not eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.11/4">I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-13">13 July</phrase> a series of initial payments to local authorities under this scheme, based on the information available to me at the time about the number of households affected by flooding and on my judgment as how to best share the available funding to the best benefit of affected communities. Milton Keynes was considered for, but has not received, an initial payment. We will be making allocations in due course of the remaining funding, and are encouraging all affected local authorities to work closely with their Government Office on assessing the impact of the recent flooding. I will consider the case for payments to all eligible councils on the basis of the information I have at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.11/5">Secondly, there is &pound;3 million from the Department for Transport to assist emergency capital works needed to restore the functionality of the highway network. This is for highways authorities, which means that Milton Keynes can apply but Stoke Goldington cannot. Applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature and urgency of the repairs, and the availability of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.11/6">Finally, there is &pound;1 million which can be drawn on as contingency reserve (by the Department for Work and Pensions for use by Jobcentre Plus to support additional demand for Social Fund Community Care Grants. This is not funding for local authorities but for individuals, who should apply direct to Jobcentre Plus in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid="a.83W.3/8" class="indent">The Child Support Agency is an Executive Agency of the Department for Work and Pensions (and prior to 8th June 2001 formed part of the Department of Social Security). The Agency uses the Department's accounting system to record and report expenditure. While the accounting system does not have the functionality to report separately the discreet activities and day-to-day costs associated with either managing the Agency's corporate identity, or branding, and the information is therefore not available in the format you requested, we can identify external consultancy cost of approximately &pound;60,000 on researching brand development incurred in September 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.3/9" class="indent">In response to your other question:</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.3/10" class="indent">Staff Parties&mdash;The Agency has incurred no expenditure on staff parties in any of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.3/11" class="indent">Newspapers, magazines and periodicals&mdash;The Department for Work and Pensions accounting system does not enable us to provide an analysis of spending on these products. As such, the information is not available in the requested format.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.3/12" class="indent">Stationery&mdash;As the Department's accounting system combines spend on both printing and stationery, I am therefore unable to provide a breakdown of Stationery only. The total costs for printing and stationery are included in the table below.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.3/13" class="indent">Other promotional merchandise branded with the name of the Child Support Agency&mdash;The Agency spend on branded material is included in the table below.

	<p pid="a.90W.0/3" class="italic"> Letter from Alexis Cleveland, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-16">16 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the steps taken in response to the Ombudsman's Report of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-31">31 May 2007</phrase> (reference PA-3021 ) into the complaint of John and Jeanne Fawcett; and what steps he is taking to ensure future avoidance of similar errors. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of The Pension Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/5" class="indent">Mr and Mrs Fawcett's complaint was a difficult and complex case and I regret that it took so long to resolve.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/6" class="indent">The inaccurate advice was provided in 1994 through a predecessor organisation. When we receive Ombudsman reports they are forwarded to the Pension Centre manager concerned to highlight any errors and ensure the correct training is given to staff to prevent any reoccurrence. The findings of all Ombudsman cases are captured in a Lessons Learned Log issued by The Pension Service's Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration/Independent Case Examiner Focal Point. The shortcomings identified in this particular case feature in the Log and have been sent to all nominated customer service staff within our Pension Centres for cascading to staff to avoid similar errors occurring in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/7" class="indent">A wide range of action has been taken to ensure staff are fully equipped to be able to provide customers with the information they need on deferring State Pension. We have also provided detailed deferral information to customers on The Pension Service website as well as in the form of posters in GPs' surgeries, Post Offices and Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/8" class="indent">The Pension Service operates a robust three-tier process for handling complaints:</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/9" class="indent">Resolution at front line point of contact</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/10" class="indent">Resolution by Business Unit Manager</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/11" class="indent">Resolution by Chief Executive</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/12" class="indent">If the customer remains unsatisfied, from April 2007 we have introduced an Independent Case Examiner who can look at their complaint. The customer can also go to their MP, who may refer their case to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman).</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/13" class="indent">Complaints are recorded on a database to assist complaint management and provide Management Information on performance and causes of complaints. Staff are encouraged to take ownership of complaints and resolve them at the point of contact wherever possible and there are good examples of using complaint data to improve services in The Pension Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.91W.9/1">Building Schools for the Future (BSF) is a hugely ambitious programme. Just three years into the programme, 49 local authorities, one third of all authorities in England, are now firmly engaged with BSF. Eight local authorities have now reached financial close, covering 65 schools and &pound;1.1 billion worth of capital investment. There are currently 51 schools in construction, and it is anticipated that by the end of the year, a further 70 will be under way. Beyond 2010-11, we expect that around 200 new or remodelled schools will open each year.</p>

However, the estimated plans for 2007-08 for the Department for Education and Skills can be found in Table 8.2 of the 2007 Departmental Annual Report.</p>

	<p pid="a.95W.0/1">The Department sends information automatically to schools in England only in exceptional cases having stopped regular paper mailings in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.0/2">Discussions with head teachers and detailed research showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.0/3">Instead, the Department has successfully introduced an online ordering service where schools are able to either download or order paper based copies of publications including guidance. A regular fortnightly email is sent to schools to inform them of new publications. In addition, &quot;Spectrum&quot; provides schools, head teachers and chairs of governors with a summary of all the latest resources, publications, guidance and regulations. It is available online and can also be requested in paper copy.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.0/4">Copies of &quot;Teachers Magazine&quot; are distributed to all schools six times each year. The &quot;Governors Newsletter&quot; is available on subscription only. Both products offer news and information, and point readers to further details available online or in other publications.</p>
	<p pid="a.95W.0/5">I do not intend to make a statement. An annual report is presented to Parliament each year, listing the documents sent from the Department and its agencies to all schools.</p>

However, schools designated as having a religious character under section 69 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 are exempt from this prohibition by virtue of section 50 of the Equality Act 2006 and may, therefore, give priority, when oversubscribed, to children on the basis that they are members of or practise their faith.</p>

	<p pid="a.102W.9/1">Girls have out-performed boys since GCSE examinations were introduced in 1988. In 2006 63.4 per cent. of girls and 53.8 per cent. of boys achieved five plus A*-C grade GCSEs. Girls are ahead of boys at all stages of education from early years and foundation onwards. The gap in England has been broadly stable over two decades, and is in line with that in other OECD countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.9/2">The reasons are complex but appear mainly related to biological differences, differences in maturation, and differences in attitudes to learning and reading at different ages. The Department's recently published research paper &quot;Gender and education: the evidence on pupils in England&quot;, of which there is a copy in the Library of the House, sets out the research evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.9/3">Two points should however be noted: first, boys' GCSE attainment has improved sharply over the past decade, broadly keeping pace with that of girls; second, gender gaps can be minimised by good teaching practice and by the encouragement of reading, ensuring that pupils of both genders make good progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.9/4">The Department is planning a programme of school-level investigations and action research activities designed to identify good practice in raising boys' motivation and attainment, particularly in the field of literacy. This will build on existing Departmental initiatives such as &quot;Boys Into Books&quot;, which has enabled every state-funded secondary school to select for its library 20 free books targeted at teenage boys. It will also feed into the forthcoming National Year of Reading which will promote reading both for leisure and school attainment purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.107W.2/1">The performance of local authorities and their partners in improving outcomes for children and young people is assessed by Ofsted and other inspectorates. Since 2005, they have made an annual performance assessment of children's services in each local authority, and have been undertaking a programme of joint area reviews which will include every local authority area in England once between 2005 and 2008. Ofsted's April 2007 publication &quot;Narrowing the Gap: The Inspection of Children's Services&quot; found an improving picture, with children's services in 107 out of the 139 authorities covered by the report making a good or excellent contribution towards delivering better outcomes for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.107W.2/2">A number of areas have been assessed, by either an annual performance assessment or a joint area review, to be making an inadequate contribution to improving one or more aspects of children's services. They are Bristol, Cornwall, Devon, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Isles of Scilly, Medway, North East Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Peterborough, Plymouth, Sandwell, Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent and Thurrock.</p>
	<p pid="a.107W.2/3">The Government support and challenge all local authorities to improve their performance, with activity co-ordinated through the appropriate Government Office. Where a local authority is failing to perform functions to an adequate standard, the Secretary of State will, as a last resort, consider use of his statutory powers to secure the proper performance of functions. This can include directing that functions are performed in a particular way or by a specified person on behalf of the authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.119W.5/1">In 1993 Sir Ron Dearing was asked by the Government to review the National Curriculum and its assessment. As a result, a revised version of the curriculum was produced in 1995. The key changes were:</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/2" class="indent">a reduction in prescribed content;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/3" class="indent">increased flexibility;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/4" class="indent">statutory testing being limited to core subjects only;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/5" class="indent">the introduction of information and communication technology&mdash;to be taught as a subject in its own right and through other subjects;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/6" class="indent">a reduction in the number of compulsory subjects at KS4; and</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/7" class="indent">replacing statements of attainment for teacher assessment with eight level descriptions for each subject and end of key stage statements for art, music and P.E.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/8">The curriculum underwent further revision in 2000. The key principles of the 2000 review included:</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/9" class="indent">improving the coherence and alignment of subjects&mdash;including through a common format for programmes of study;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/10" class="indent">reducing duplication and prescription across subjects;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/11" class="indent">introducing citizenship as a subject at Key Stages 3 and 4;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/12" class="indent">allowing more flexibility at Key Stage 4; and</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/13" class="indent">developing an overt statement of the aims and purposes of the curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/14">In September 2004, the Key Stage 4 curriculum was amended to reduce the number of compulsory National Curriculum subjects to six: English, mathematics, science, ICT, citizenship and physical education. We also introduced entitlement areas in languages, design and technology, the arts, and humanities.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/15">In 2006, the Education and Inspections Bill introduced a new statutory entitlement for all Key Stage 4 students to study science programmes leading to at least two GCSEs, and an entitlement to diplomas.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/16">A review of the secondary curriculum is currently under way and will be rolled out to secondary schools from September 2008. The new secondary curriculum will:</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/17" class="indent">further reduce prescription over subject content;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/18" class="indent">create flexibility for teachers to support pupils who are struggling to master the basic skills of English and maths;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/19" class="indent">free up time and space for greater personalisation of the curriculum, allowing pupils to study some areas in more depth;</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/20" class="indent">highlight connections across and between the subjects; and</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.5/21" class="indent">give a new emphasis to the development of personal and life skills.</p>

DCSF is still agreeing the exact split of budgets with DIUS so it is not possible to give the real term increases in school funding from 2008-11 at this moment. We will announce the increase in school funding in the autumn. The level of school funding from 2012-16 will not be known until the DCSF receives its allocation in the next Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid="a.121W.3/2">We will be providing &pound;150 million for Assessment for Learning training over the next three years to help teachers better track their pupils' progress and personalise their learning to stretch gifted children and help underachieving children catch up. Assessment for learning plays a critical role in helping teachers monitor the progress of every pupil against their own individual expectations and triggering swift intervention for those pupils whose progress slows.</p>
	<p pid="a.121W.3/3">There will be a major review of maths teaching in primary schools which will seek to define the most effective methods of teaching and learning maths to develop pupils' deeper understanding; and this will inform the design of Every Child Counts, a new intervention programme for young children who are struggling with numeracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.121W.3/4">The Secretary of State has also announced a &pound;265 million extended schools subsidy over the next three years to ensure that children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit from extra out-of-hours tuition and after-school clubs in sport, music and drama.</p>
	<p pid="a.121W.3/5">Personalised learning means taking a highly structured approach to pupils' progress in the round, encouraging pupils to take ownership of their own learning, and engaging with their parents as partners.

There have been ongoing discussions relating to the capital investment in Carlisle in response to the January 2005 floods and how it will be used to raise standards in education across the city. This includes working with the council on the academy proposal to replace St. Aidan's school and about finding sponsorship for a possible second academy in Carlisle, based on the Morton school which is currently in special measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.125W.3/18">Research evidence on the impact of the specialist school programme (SSP) to date is positive both in terms of the impact on attainment and in terms of the wider reported benefits on school ethos, teaching and learning and pupil motivation.

	<p pid="a.125W.3/22">The evidence shows that specialist schools outperform non-specialist schools. On overall school improvement and value added measures, specialist schools' results have delivered higher standards for children since their inception.</p>
	<p pid="a.125W.3/23">Specialist schools are the future of secondary education in England. We want every secondary school that meets the criteria to attain specialist status. We are well on track to meet our target of 95 per cent. of eligible secondary schools to be specialist by 2008. Currently over 2.8 millions students attend specialist schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.125W.3/24">All specialist schools must work with partner schools and the wider community and we are keen to exploit the strengths of our strongest schools to lead system wide reform. There are over 550 high performing specialist schools which have taken on additional options extending their partnership working with other schools. We have also a very small scale pilot testing exploring specialism in primary schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.126W.2/2">The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) holds data on the number of QTS skills tests attempted by teacher trainees who successfully passed the tests, but not on those who have not successfully passed the tests. The available data on numbers of tests attempted is collected on an academic, rather than financial year, basis. The following table shows for each of the academic years 2000/01 to 2005/06 and for each test, the number of teacher trainees that successfully passed that test in that year, the mean number of attempts taken and, therefore, the total number of tests attempted by them. The table also shows for each year and for each test, the number of teacher trainees who either did not attempt the test or who did not pass the test during that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.2/3">The total cost to the TDA for administering the skill tests in each financial year since their introduction in 1999 is as follows:</p>

Some teachers could have progressed to higher pay levels due to excellent performance or relevant previous experience attracting a higher starting point, or may have moved to the Advanced Skills Teacher or Leadership Group spines.

	<p pid="a.130W.3/31">The table reflects the structural changes to teachers' pay over the years in question, including the shortening of the pay scale and assimilation to the new shortened pay scale in 2002. It assumes that all newly-qualified classroom teachers started on the lowest point of the pay scale, though until September 2002 all newly-qualified teachers would have started above the minimum point if they had a good honours degree. In addition, those with relevant previous experience may receive one or more additional points. The figures are based on the pay rates for England and Wales. Pay rates are higher for the London area. No allowances or incentives are included.</p>

	<p pid="a.133W.2/2">The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) funds enhancement courses to increase the number of specialist mathematics, physics and chemistry teachers. These courses have enabled over 1,000 additional people to qualify to teach in these subjects.</p>

The Secretary of State for Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) has just announced that participation in the scheme is to be doubled.</p>

	<p pid="a.134W.2/1">We plan to publish the strategy shortly. The original teenage pregnancy strategy&mdash;published in 1999&mdash;included action both to reduce the rate of teenage pregnancies and to provide better support for teenage parents. We have made steady progress in reducing the teenage pregnancy rate. The latest data (2005) show that the under-18 conception rate has fallen by 11.8 per cent. since the strategy's baseline year (1998), to its lowest level for over 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.2/2">The refreshed 'support' strategy which we will be issuing aims teenage mothers having fewer or to reduce the risk of subsequent pregnancies and to improve the lives of teenage parents and their children, who are at high risk of poor outcomes; including:</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.2/3" class="indent">Poor child health outcomes, such as a 60 per cent. higher rate of infant mortality and increased risk of low birth weight;</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.2/4" class="indent">Poor emotional health and well-being experienced by teenage mothers; and</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.2/5" class="indent">Increased risk that teenage parents and their children will live in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.2/6">Better support for teenage parents not only reduces their risk of poor outcomes now, but is also part of our long-term strategy to reduce teenage pregnancy rates in the future&mdash;as it will mean that their children will be less likely to experience the factors that increase the risk of teenage pregnancy, such as social deprivation, poor educational attainment and low aspirations. Through better support we can also help teenage parents to avoid second and subsequent unplanned pregnancies&mdash;it is estimated that 20 per cent. of births to teenagers are to young women who are already teenage mothers.</p>

	<p pid="a.134W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is assisting street children in Honduras and Guatemala through our support to the World Bank (WB) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). DFID funds are being used to strengthen WB and IDB programmes to tackle the factors that force many children onto the street. For example, DFID assistance through the IDB has included $145,000 to build the capacity of Guatemalan non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and public sector officials to reintegrate street children back into society. DFID has also contributed $150,000 to the IDB in Honduras for a programme to better prioritise social assistance to vulnerable groups, such as street children, using better data collection and analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.6/2">DFID provides core funding to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) who run programmes throughout Central America aimed at improving children's access to health and education. Street children have also benefited from UNICEF's programmes in the region on HIV and AIDS and to eliminate child labour and violence against children.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.2/1">In the 12 months since July 2006, DFID's main promotional activity was in support of the launch of the Third White Paper on International Development. This was the largest campaign that DFID has run to date. The campaign was evaluated to show which promotional method gave the best rate of response and the best value for money. This showed that e-communications compared favourably with flyer inserts into periodicals and newspapers. This information is being used to inform future campaigns and promotional activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/2">DFID's other main area of advertising spend is recruitment and procurement advertising which is assessed in terms of response rate and quality. At present there is no formal system for evaluating the cost effectiveness of each advert. However, DFID is introducing an e-enabled recruitment system that will help with this evaluation in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/3">DFID is committed to reducing the cost of advertising generally by the use of shorter and more focused advertisements and through maximising discounts through the Central Office of Information.</p>

	<p pid="a.137W.2/1">Before March 2003, the UK Government, together with United Nations agencies, international NGOs and Coalition partners such as the United States and Australia, prepared contingency plans that included the possibility of prolonged urban warfare, large population movements, or the widespread destruction of essential infrastructure. The cost of reconstruction was considered substantial. Iraq had suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and underinvestment by the Saddam regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.137W.2/2">From June to October 2003, the World Bank, United Nations and Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) undertook a joint needs assessment and recommended investing some US$56 billion towards reconstruction over four years (this was not divided into financial years). It was expected that oil revenues would make a significant contribution to this reconstruction. Against this, the international community pledged an initial US$32 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq at the Madrid Donors' Conference in October 2003 to which the UK pledged an initial &pound;544 million. Iraq has plenty of resources in its own budget, with forecast oil revenues of $33 billion in 2007. Our priority is therefore to help the Iraqi Government make better use of these resources so that they can deliver better public services.</p>

	<p pid="a.139W.3/1">Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole halfway through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Numbers of prisoners recommended for parole are shown at table 10.4 of the offender management caseload statistics 2005, a copy of which can be found in the Library. Prisoners sentenced to determinate terms of under four years under the 1991 Act are generally released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence. The Home Detention Curfew scheme (HDC) has been in operation since January 1999. Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and passing a careful risk assessment, prisoners serving sentences of between three months and less than four years may be released up to four-and-a-half months (135 days) early from prison subject to an electronically monitored curfew normally between 7pm and 7am. Information on the numbers of prisoners released under Home Detention Curfew (HDC), can be found in table 10.3 in the offender management caseload statistics 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.140W.3/1">The average cost per hour in a magistrates court in 2005-06 was &pound;415 on a full cost basis, including apportionment of central overheads.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.3/2">While there are other interpretations, this answer is based on that of a Section 6 (1) and Section 6 (2) committal hearing definition. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest these times can vary considerably from one area to another depending on the practices of the Justice's Clerk.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.3/3">A section 6(1) committal in which the defence object to being committed to the Crown court (e.g. no case to answer on the papers argued). Then the magistrates court adjourns to a convenient date for the prosecution to prepare their case, to enable the Bench to read the papers and to hear the legal argument at the adjourned hearing. This would probably run to 2 if not 3 hours including the time taken by the magistrates to read the papers and hear the legal argument. The estimated cost for a Section 6(1) committal hearing is between &pound;830 to &pound;1,245.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.3/4">A section 6(2) committal is where the court decides to commit to the Crown court for trial and there is a 6-week adjournment for the prosecution to prepare their case. This type of committal would last on average 30 minutes. The average cost for a Section 6(2) is &pound;207.50.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-07-16a.149750.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-07-16a.143W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" speakername="Bridget Prentice" colnum="143W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070716/text/70716w0031.htm#07071712000356">
	<p pid="a.143W.2/1">The Government believe that mediation can have considerable advantages over going to court in the settling of family disputes, especially where children are involved. There are already 10 in-court referral schemes, where family mediators work together with CAFCASS and the courts to refer appropriate cases for mediation. These have developed locally. The number of referrals is not collected centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost by analysing court files.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/2">In 2005-06 the Legal Services Commission (LSC) funded a total of 14,000 mediation cases for family disputes at a cost of &pound;13.8 million. In about 60 per cent. of publicly funded cases, mediation results in a resolution of all the issues. Figures for 2006-07 will be published shortly and are broadly similar. Provisional figures show the success rate rising to 66 per cent. Expenditure on publicly funded mediation where family proceedings were commenced cannot be identified separately by the LSC.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/3">In terms of early intervention, CAFCASS and CAFCASS Cymru are providing an in-court conciliation service for cases brought under section 8 of the Children Act 1989. These are most commonly applications made to the courts as a result of parental disputes about a contact or residence matter. The service is available in every county court at the first hearing. The Family Court Adviser assists and encourages the parties to reach agreement themselves rather than proceed to a contested hearing and judicial adjudication. Research into various models of in-court conciliation shows that 76 per cent. of parents reported a full or partial agreement. CAFCASS is now piloting earlier conciliation meetings that take place away from court.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/4">The courts do not collect data on the number of conciliation meetings held. However, provisional CAFCASS figures show that in 2006-07 their practitioners participated in 26,344 dispute resolution meetings, spending 57,880 hours on these cases&mdash;an increase in time spent on early intervention of nearly 34 per cent. on the previous year. The cost of providing these meetings is part of CAFCASS running costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/5">In public law proceedings, the courts may request a range of reports and assessments. Information on the types and numbers of reports and assessments is contained on individual court files. This information, and the cost of providing these reports and assessments, is not collected centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.149W.0/1">Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole halfway through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Numbers of prisoners recommended for parole are shown at table 10.4 of the offender management caseload statistics 2005, a copy of which can be found in the Library of the House. Prisoners sentenced to determinate terms of under four years under the 1991 Act are generally released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence. The home detention curfew scheme has been in operation since January 1999. Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and passing a careful risk assessment, prisoners serving sentences of between three months and less than four years may be released up to four and a half months (135 days) early from prison subject to an electronically monitored curfew normally between 7 pm and 7 am. Information on the numbers of prisoners released under home detention curfew (HDC), can be found in tables 10.3 in the offender management caseload statistics 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.152W.0/1">Offenders held in Young Offender Institutions can be aged between 15 and 21. We do not currently calculate re-offending rates for this age band.</p>
	<p pid="a.152W.0/2">The most recent juvenile re-offending rates for those aged 15 to 17 who were discharged from custody were published in &quot;Re-offending of juveniles: results from the 2004 cohort&quot;. This covers juvenile offenders who were released from all kinds of custody, these include Secure Training Centres (STCs) and Local Authority Secure Children's Homes (LASCHs), in the first quarters of 2000 and 2004, in England and Wales. 77.8 per cent. of 15 to 17-year-old juveniles released from custody in the 2004 cohort re-offended during the following 12 months. The figure for the 2000 cohort was 78.2 per cent. The actual re-offending rate is the percentage of offenders who re-offended during a one year follow-up period and who subsequently received a pre-court disposal or were convicted in court. This is discussed further in the Statistical Bulletin which can be found at;</p>

The figures for previous years were 74.8 per cent. in 2003, 77.9 per cent. in 2002 and 77.4 per cent. in 2000. For this age group, the actual re-offending rate is the percentage of offenders who re-offended during a two year follow-up period and who were subsequently convicted in court.

	<p pid="a.154W.6/1">Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be used as a treatment for skin cancer and cancers on or near the lining of internal organs, such as bile duct cancer. It can also be used to treat the classic and predominantly classic forms of age-related macular degeneration and is being investigated as a treatment for psoriasis and acne.

	<p pid="a.154W.6/2">As part of its programme of work on interventional procedures, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued guidance on the use of PDT in the treatment of several cancers.</p>

	<p pid="a.154W.6/6">In September 2003 NICE issued guidance recommending the use of PDT for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in some patients. All primary care trusts are funding PDT for patients with age-related macular degeneration in line with this guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.157W.0/1">Where a provider of national health services dental services delivers more than 96 per cent. but less than 100 per cent. of the annual service levels agreed with the local primary care trust (PCT), the PCT is responsible for setting a period during the following contract year during which these services are to be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.0/2">It is a breach of contract to provide less than 96 per cent. of the annual service levels agreed in a contract. In these circumstances, it is up to the PCT to decide whether to allow some or all of these unprovided services to be carried forward to the following contract year. Where a provider has failed to provide at least 96 per cent. of the agreed annual service levels, the PCT may depending on the circumstances wish to propose a reduction in the future contract value and corresponding service levels for that contract, so that these resources can be reinvested in other local dental services.</p>

	<p pid="a.168W.8/1">The Conference of Post Graduate Medical Deans Steering Group for Recruitment and Selection for Specialty Training was created to establish the rules and criteria for entry to specialty training in 2007. Its membership included post-graduate deans for medical education, representatives of employers, deanery recruitment teams, royal colleges, trainee doctors and the Department. The steering group agreed that all eligibility criteria including for example General Medical Council registration, Royal College exams, English language proficiency and the right to work in the United Kingdom, would be assessed on the last date on which applications to the 2007 recruitment could be submitted. The date was originally set at <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-04">4 February</phrase>. When the application period was extended until <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February</phrase> the date for assessing eligibility criteria was also extended. The decision to set the assessment of eligibility criteria on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February</phrase> was a practical one, designed to ensure that all doctors would be subject to the same criteria, and that eligibility was fixed at the start of the process rather than being subject to change at any time, creating operational difficulties.</p>

These set out the Department's key aims for organ and tissue transplantation over the following 10 years. Over the last five years, Government investment in hospital based initiatives has helped increase live and non heart-beating donor rates. An organ donor taskforce will report to Ministers in autumn 2007 on how organ donor rates can be further improved.</p>

	<p pid="a.175W.0/1">There is no specific waiting list for dialysis. Dialysis is often an emergency treatment and patients with no kidney function will die in a matter of weeks if they do not receive dialysis. For patients whose disease has been identified well in advance of end-stage renal failure, dialysis begins at a time when the individual and his or her consultant feel is appropriate. Part 1 of the National Service Framework for Renal Services recommends starting to prepare people for dialysis about a year before it will be needed, as such preparation leads to better outcomes for the patient.</p>

	<p pid="a.175W.3/1">The National Service Framework (NSF) for Renal Services recommended that, when kidney function is assessed and monitored, the most sensitive way to detect kidney disease is by use of a formula-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). To support the introduction of eGFR reporting, in 2006 the Department issued an information pack to the national health service. This consists of fact sheets which were sent to all general practitioners practices and pathology laboratories, explaining how to calculate and interpret eGFR, together with a note on frequently asked questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.177W.2/2">Performance of the EHIC service is monitored through regular service level agreement meetings with the Business Services Authority (BSA) who administer the scheme. Feedback is regularly reviewed by both the Department and the BSA and improvements to the service including the online application service are made as required.</p>

	<p pid="a.179W.3/1">Unaudited figures for 2006-07 show that the national health service delivered a net surplus of &pound;510 million at the end of 2006-07, recovering from a &pound;547 million deficit in 2005-06. This transformation in financial performance has been achieved in the context of continued improvements in both access to and the quality of patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.179W.3/2">A key component to the overall financial recovery in 2006-07 has been the rigorous action taken by strategic health authorities (SHAs) to manage financial risk at local level. This has been largely achieved by the prudent management of central NHS programme funds to create a &pound;450 million contingency, and by the top-slicing of primary care trust allocations to create SHA reserves. We have not expected any one NHS sector to contribute more in financial savings than any other part of the health system, except where that sector has specifically contributed to a deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.179W.3/3">The financial recovery in 2006-07, brought about by this local action and the introduction of a stronger, fairer and more transparent financial regime, has put the NHS on a much firmer financial footing for 2007-08 and beyond.</p>

	<p pid="a.180W.6/1">All national health service procurement must fully comply with European Union regulations and be a transparent process. Proper emphasis must be placed on guidance provided by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and information on products provided by the centre for evidence based purchasing.

	<p pid="a.182W.2/1">The Department has commissioned and funded two research studies on fluoridation and health. &quot;A Systematic Review of Public Water Fluoridation&quot;, published by the University of York in 2000, identified two studies, which found no significant association between thyroid disorders, water fluoridation, and one study with a positive association. However, the positive study looked at combined fluoride/iodine intakes and has not been published in a peer review journal. &quot;Water Fluoridation and Health&quot;, published by the Medical Research Council (MRC) in 2002 endorsed York's recommendation on the need for further research into fluoridation, but awarded low priority to further research on thyroid disorders. This was because the MRC judged the scientific plausibility of an association between water fluoridation and thyroid disease to be low.</p>
	<p pid="a.182W.2/2">We are committed to a continuing programme of research on the effects of fluoridation on health. And, under section 90A of the Water Industry Act 1991, strategic health authorities (SHAs) are required to monitor the effects of fluoridation schemes on the health of persons living in the fluoridated area and publish reports containing an analysis of the effects on health at four-yearly intervals. The West Midland Public Health Observatory is leading on the compilation of a set of standard indicators which will enable comparisons to be made between the findings of different SHAs.</p>

	<p pid="a.183W.3/1">The Department has not discussed with the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families the provision of water in schools or the effect of dehydration on mental performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.3/2">It is important that children develop a healthy diet, and a school plays an important role in helping to introduce and reinforce these behaviours. Through the national Healthy Schools programme run jointly between the Department, and the Department for Children, Schools and Families, schools are doing a lot of work to improve diet which, for example by phasing out items which are low in nutritional value such as fizzy drinks. Teachers tell us that improved diet has had both health and other benefits such as calmer children that are better behaved and a ready to learn. Good hydration helps to reduce tiredness, irritability, and increases concentration. It also contributes to a more settled and productive learning environment.</p>
