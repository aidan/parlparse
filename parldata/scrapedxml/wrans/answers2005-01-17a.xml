The UK did not therefore submit a statement of intervention or attend the hearing.</p>

Aside from the time spent by departmental officials in considering the pleadings and applying for leave to intervene, the only costs incurred were the costs of translating the pleadings from Greek to English, which were approximately &pound;2,150.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.11/1">The working time regulations provide workers with the protection of a limit of an average of 48 hours a week working time. This is not an absolute cap of 48 hours in any one week. This average is normally calculated over a 17-week reference period, although this can be longer in certain situations (26 weeks) and can be extended by agreement (up to 52 weeks). Workers may choose to work more than 48 hours per week over this reference period by signing an opt-out agreement, but employers cannot force a worker to sign an opt-out, and workers cannot be subjected to detriment for refusing to sign an opt-out. In the last 12 months four officials working in the combined Private Office for the Law Officers have worked more than a 48 hour week on occasions. This represents 100 per cent. of the total number of permanent staff in the office.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.2/1">Following the publication of the voluntary code &quot;Access to Air Travel for Disabled People&mdash;Code of Practice&quot;, which we published in March 2003, we commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory to monitor the industry's take up of the code's recommendations. It is looking at compliance generally and not specifically in relation to any particular group of disabled people. The research is due to be completed towards the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.2/2">We have said that we will legislate in this field if the voluntary approach proves ineffective and the outcome of the research will be used to inform our decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.2/3">The UK Chairs the European Civil Aviation Conference's (ECAC) Facilitation Working Group on air travel for people with reduced mobility. We work alongside other member states to promote the recommended practices which ECAC has introduced. On the domestic front the ECAC recommended practices were the basis for our Code of Practice. At a recent meeting of the ECAC Facilitation working group we raised a number of issues relating to air travel for deaf and hard or hearing people. The group has agreed to consider those and have included them on their agenda for their next meeting later this month.</p>

	<p pid="a.673W.11/2">Having considered this issue, we believe it may be necessary to revise sections 8 and 9 of the Race Relations Act 1976 so that if a close enough link (to be defined) existed between an EEA seafarer and the flag state of the ship on which they were working, they could not be paid at a differential rate from other workers with a similarly close link to the flag state (i.e. resident seafarers).</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.11/3">Our next steps will be to work closely with all those with an interest in this issue to develop and agree proposed revisions to the RRA 1976, by way of secondary legislation which will then be subject to full consultation.</p>

Transport Security Directorate (TRANSEC) of the Department for Transport considers the assessment and implements one of the three security levels prescribed by the International Port Facility and Security Code (ISPS). The security measures required at each security level are proportionate to the threat as assessed and thereby serve to minimise potential risks to the industry. TRANSEC continues to work with industry to ensure that those requirements are proportional, pragmatic and sustainable.</p>

	<p pid="a.684W.3/1">Most areas of Fallujah are now open to the returning population. The number of people returning to the city is increasing steadily. By <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-14">14 January</phrase>, over 100,000 people had crossed the checkpoints into the city since returns began on <phrase class="date" code="">23 December</phrase> although far fewer are staying overnight. It is estimated that between 8,000 and 15,000 citizens are now living in the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.3/2">The Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) is leading on assistance to the people of Fallujah. The IIG Fallujah Core Co-ordination Group is liaising with multi-national and Iraqi forces who are providing security in the city, and is co-ordinating the provision of essential supplies by Iraqi Government Ministries. Food, medical items, tents and plastic sheeting, and water by tanker and bottle are getting through to the people in Fallujah. The IIG is providing an initial $100 welfare payment for each family returning to the city, and is finalising plans for more extensive compensation for damaged homes and businesses. Figures are not yet available on the cost of this assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.3/3">The IIG is also developing medium and long-term reconstruction plans for the city and has set aside funds from the Iraqi budget for this work. The Minister of Industry has been charged with coordinating the work of the key Iraqi ministries involved.</p>

US forces are also helping to provide security for the returning families, which has been good so far. United States agencies report that they have planned around 100 reconstruction projects in the Fallujah area totalling $84.1 million. Several US-funded projects have been contracted and are due to begin soon, including a $20 million project to refurbish the sewerage system, and projects to refurbish and equip local council offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.3/6">A large proportion of Fallujah's population is yet to return to the city. Many families are staying in the surrounding area, mostly with host families or in public buildings. Iraqi ministries and aid agencies continue to deliver essential supplies to these areas. Welfare payments for displaced people are being distributed through banks in the areas where they are currently living.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.3/7">The Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq (IECI) has established plans to allow Fallujah's displaced citizens to vote in the national elections at the end of January. The IECI has made special arrangements for same-day registration and voting at centres spread across the Al Anbar Governorate, and has asked Multi-National Force-Iraq to provide extra security at polling stations.</p>

	<p pid="a.689W.2/1">Notwithstanding the fact that much progress has been made by the international community since the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention in 1999, the Government is fully aware of the suffering still caused by anti-personnel landmines. The United Kingdom thus stressed throughout the preparatory stage, that the first Review Conference should be used, not only to celebrate the achievements of the last five years, but also to refocus efforts over the next five years on the continuing humanitarian cost of anti-personnel landmines.</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.2/2">Outcomes which reflected the UK's aspirations for the Conference included:</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.2/3" class="indent">(i) a 70-point action plan 2005&ndash;09 to direct further work under the Convention;</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) acknowledgement in the action plan of the need for building mine action into wider development programmes;</p>

	<p pid="a.689W.2/6" class="indent">(iv) recognition that broadening and increasing the funding base for mine action is essential;</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.2/7" class="indent">(v) recognition of the desirability of integrating mine action into the programmes of the World Bank and regional development banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.2/8">DFID will continue to be a major donor in global mine action and has plans to spend at least &pound;10 million per year for the next three years.</p>

Over the next 10 days, Co-ordination Group members undertook a series of assessment and verification missions&mdash;to the Rakhine Coast, the Irawaddy Delta and the southern coast including the most populated islands of the Myeik archipelago and the islands off Kawthaung around Lampi Island.

It concluded that Burma had been largely spared from the destructive forces of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, and that initial emergency needs had been met. The group's assessment was a death toll of 60 to 80, and an estimated longer-term affected population of 10,000 to 15,000 (of whom 5,000 to 7,000 were directly affected). Assessment of longer-term reconstruction and rehabilitation needs is currently ongoing.</p>

Instead we see inter-religious and inter-community dialogue as the best way to promote tolerance and co-operation in Sri Lanka.

We have been in close contact with HLF to address their concerns and have made assurances both to them and the correspondents that there is no question whatsoever of reallocating balances in the National Lottery Distribution Fund in a way that would endanger the commitments made to existing heritage projects. We have also made clear that, if Parliament approves these powers, we would ensure that any money reallocated would still go to heritage projects but would be allocated to a different distributor.

The &pound;2 million available annually through the Prints and Advertising Fund is designed, for example, to encourage film distributors to acquire more specialised films and to release them more widely.

	<p pid="a.722W.0/2">Defra has no record of being sent a copy of the video by Northumberland county council before February 2003. The report of the FMD 2001: Lessons to be Learned Inquiry, chaired by Dr. Iain Anderson, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-22">22 July 2002</phrase>. The council did not release any copies of the video before the trial of Mr. Waugh in May 2002, after Dr. Anderson had stopped receiving evidence for his Lessons to be Learned Inquiry. Reports based on the eye witness evidence of Defra, Institute for Animal Health and local authority officials, who were present on Burnside Farm when the video was recorded, were submitted to the Anderson Inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.722W.3/1">The Government played a leading role in securing major reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy in 2003 and 2004. They break the link between the bulk of farm subsidy and levels of production, make subsidy dependent on meeting environmental and animal welfare standards, and redirect a greater proportion of EU subsidy to environmental and rural development schemes. As a result, the CAP will now be less environmentally damaging and trade distorting and enable farmers to become more market focused.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.3/2">The Government welcomes EU plans for further reform of the sugar sector and the Rural Development Regulation and will be looking to maximise other opportunities to reform the CAP further.</p>

	<p pid="a.725W.8/1">I attended the Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase>, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/2">Council reached political agreement on two measures concerning the Aarhus Convention, both with the support of the UK. We agreed a draft Regulation on the application of provisions on access to information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters to the Community institutions and bodies, with Belgium voting against. I intervened in the discussion to oppose a Commission suggestion that would have set a requirement that NGOs should be active at EU level to be entitled to use the access to justice provisions. Others took the same view and this proposal was not adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/3">There was unanimous agreement on a draft Decision to the effect that the European Community should ratify the Aarhus Convention. It is hoped that this will enable ratification by the EC to be concluded before the next meeting of the parties in May 2005. The Commission said it would enter a minutes statement concerning a declaration on external competence annexed to the decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/4">We also reached political agreement on the proposed Directive on Batteries and Accumulators, following lengthy discussion of the main outstanding issues which were the extent of the partial ban on nickel cadmium batteries, and, particularly, the level and timing of collection targets. There was a wide range of views in Council, with strong pressure from a number of member states for tougher provisions on nickel cadmium and more ambitious collection targets. I argued for an evidence-based approach on nickel cadmium, and for achievable and proportionate collection targets, noting that the legal base used for this measure would not prevent member states that wished to go further from doing so. A compromise was reached after a difficult negotiation, involving targets of 25 per cent. after four years and 45 per cent. after eight years from the Directive coming into force. The exemption of cordless power tools from the nickel cadmium ban was maintained, with a Commission review after four years. Belgium abstained because the targets were too unambitious, Greece because they were too high, and Ireland because of the terms of the review of cordless power tools. Italy was also unable to support the political agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/5">We debated elements of the Regulation on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH). The Secretary of State welcomed a recent workshop held by the Netherlands Presidency on the wide range of impact assessment work being done on this dossier, and pointed out that the UK proposal for 'one substance one registration' would help reduce duplication of information and therefore costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/6">There was general support for prioritising registration of substances of greatest concern, particularly those that may be persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Some member states would like to go further and there was limited interest in developing a risk-based approach at the registration stage. Mrs. Beckett expressed UK concerns about the practicality of such an approach in the absence of the data that would only become available during the registration process itself. The Commission took a similar line.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/7">There was broad agreement in Council that the treatment of substances in finished products (articles) was important to safeguard human health and the environment but could raise issues of workability. In addition we should avoid any danger of creating a competitive advantage for goods imported from outside the EU. Mrs. Beckett strongly supported the principle of regulating substances in articles under REACH, but put forward concerns over the workability of the current Commission proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/8">There was no qualified majority for or against the Commission proposal for a Decision authorising placing an oilseed rape product (Brassica napus L,GT73 line), genetically modified for tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate, on the market. The UK abstained in this vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/9">Council agreed a wide-ranging set of Conclusions on Climate Change: Medium and Long-term Strategies and Targets, following the 10th Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Change Convention in Buenos Aires, and as a contribution to the planned discussion at the Spring European Council. I spoke supporting the need for quantified targets but, with Germany and the Commission, suggested that these should follow rather than precede Commission work on cost benefits due in February.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/10">Council also adopted Conclusions on the review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy, but was unable to do so on the Kok Report on the Lisbon Strategy. Some wished to widen the scope of the conclusions. For the UK, Mrs. Beckett strongly supported the succinct draft conclusions put forward by the Presidency. The Presidency concluded that Council should return to the discussion under the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/11">Council held a lengthy preliminary exchange of views on the proposed Regulation on the Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE+). Discussion focused on the need to ensure compatibility with the EU's overall budget. Views were expressed for and against the Commission's intention to focus funding from the new Regulation on policy support rather than implementation, which would be funded from other EU funding streams or by member states. A number of member states were concerned about possible gaps arising from this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/12">Council also exchanged views on the preparation for the 23rd Session of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Governing Council, to be held in February 2005, and heard from UNEP's Executive Director, Klaus Topfer. For the UK, the Secretary of State provided an opening intervention in response to a question on achieving complementarity between the Johannesburg outcomes and the Millennium Development Goals, and the role of UNEP in enhancing these synergies. This and subsequent interventions emphasised the need to recognise the links between the Millennium Development Goals and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the effective use of resources, underlining the necessity for all parties to make appropriate financial contributions to UNEP. The need for the Millennium Review summit to address environmental sustainability and climate change, and the importance of the Bali strategic plan for technology support and capacity building as a mechanism for implementation were also stressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/13">Council adopted Conclusions on the Protection and Conservation of the Marine Environment without further discussion, in which we looked forward to the publication by the Commission of the thematic strategy on the marine environment, due in 2005 under the 6th Environmental Action Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/14">Under Other Business, the Secretary of State raised the urgent need for concrete measures to address increasing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, and our preference for action through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Council was also briefed on the mercury strategy; a number of recent events organised by the Presidency covering legionella in Europe, exploring new approaches for the regulation of industrial installations (ENAP), energy in motion (i.e. sustainable transport), 25 years of the Directive on the conservation of wild birds, the soil thematic strategy and the Environment and Health Action Plan; Commission plans for the forthcoming thematic strategies; the UNECE and UNESCO high-level meeting in March 2005; and the management of biowaste.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/15">Over lunch we also discussed Presidency ideas for a partnership between business stakeholders and governments to debate the delivery of a 'clean, clever and competitive' Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.728W.2/1">In 2003 the UK produced 7,500 tonnes of honey worth &pound;35 million, a significant increase over previous years. Part of this increase is attributable to the EU ban on imports of honey from China between 2002&ndash;04. British honey is produced by about 200 commercial bee farmers and some 43,000 private beekeepers. Their contribution to the agricultural economy is difficult to measure but the value of pollination as a service to agriculture has been estimated as at least &pound;120 million a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.729W.2/1">Part of the role of the National Bee Unit is to advise the Department on the development of its programme to control notifiable pests and diseases of bees in England and to minimise the risk of introduction of potentially serious exotic pests. There are regular discussions between the Department and the unit on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.729W.2/2">In the light of the National Bee Unit's assessment of the disease threats faced by bee colonies, the Department has concluded that statutory enforcement provisions for the control of varroa are now of low priority since this pest has become endemic. Plans are being made to remove varroasis from the list of notifiable diseases. Similar action is contemplated in respect of European foul brood in 2007&ndash;08, subject to satisfactory results from continuing applied research. This will allow the National Bee Unit to devote more of its resources to novel pests and diseases, including tropilaelaps and the small hive beetle, for which contingency measures are currently being developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.5/2">Details of the units to which issues have been made since 1992 and the number of personnel serving in those units is not held centrally, may be incomplete and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/3">Following lessons learned on Op Telic, a policy that guarantees the issue of body armour to personnel has now been endorsed and is currently being implemented. All Royal Marine, Army and Royal Air Force personnel are to be provided with combat body armour as an item of personal equipment. This is being undertaken in order of priority, commencing with personnel in operationally-liable units. The plates which are added to form enhanced combat body armour (ECBA) will be held centrally and issued to formations and units in accordance with readiness states, when required prior to deployment on overseas operations. Separate arrangements are in place to guarantee that Royal Navy, Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the Reserves and civilian personnel in support of military operations overseas are also provided with ECBA prior to deployment.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.5/1">The Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB) took into account advice from the Colonel Commandant of the Prince of Wales's Division (in which the Welsh regiments sit) as the representative of the regiments concerned. The ECAB accepted this advice and concluded that the new regiment should be called The Royal Welsh and that its two battalions should be called 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh (The Royal Welch Fusiliers) and 2nd Battalion The Royal Welsh (The Royal Regiment of Wales).</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.5/2">The title for the new Scottish Regiment and those for its constituent battalions proposed by the Colonel Commandant of the Scottish Division, were endorsed by the ECAB, who considered that the bold move direct to the largest single cap badge regiment warranted the retention of the antecedent names foremost. It was also felt that given the very different nature and large geographical spread of the existing regiments from Scotland, this would help maintain the best possible recruitment.</p>

	<p pid="a.750W.0/1">Planning has begun on the creation of a learning and development strategy for National Offender Management Service (NOMS). Working closely with Skills for Justice (the Sector Skills Council for the justice sector) and regional probation training consortia, this strategy will identify new learning programmes and qualifications needed to support the development of NOMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.0/2">As the offender management model is developed, a particular priority will be to define the competencies needed to undertake that role, and hence to develop learning programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.0/3">The Prison Service and the National Probation Service are also developing proposals for an integrated approach to leadership and management development for managers across NOMS. An early output will be the creation of a development programme for the 10 Regional Offender Managers.</p>

	<p pid="a.750W.3/1">The UK Passport Service currently plans to commence production of chip enabled passports containing a facial image by the last quarter in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.3/2">We are at present considering the benefits and impacts of the possible introduction of fingerprint and/or iris biometrics. Unlike the facial biometrics, inclusion of either or both of these biometrics will require the personal attendance of all passport applicants. I have announced that adults applying for a passport for the first time will have to apply in person from the last quarter of 2006. However to require all applicants to apply in person and to record and store their additional biometrics would have a significant impact on UKPS operations and processes and a decision will not be taken on this until later in 2005.</p>

In his report &quot;Managing Offenders, Reducing Crime&quot; published in December 2003 Lord Carter of Coles recommended that market testing should be reintroduced on the basis that contestability demonstrates value for money in the delivery of cost effective correctional services. The Government accepted this recommendation in its response published in January 2004 &quot;Reducing Crime&mdash;Changing Lives&quot;. Value for money in respect of a prisons market test is demonstrated through the evaluation of bids submitted by the private and public sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.765W.2/1">Legislation requires that capping decisions are based on principles determined by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister as First Secretary of State. In reaching his decisions, he must make a comparison between an authority's budget requirement with that of a previous year. He can also determine other principles, such as increases in council tax. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister intends to determine his capping principles once authorities have set their 2005&ndash;06 budget requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.2/2">The Government have delivered another good settlement for local government, which will ensure that authorities can provide a high level of service. There is no excuse for excessive council tax increases. We have made it clear that we expect to see an average council tax increase of less than 5 per cent. in England in 2005&ndash;06, and that we will take even tougher capping action in 2005&ndash;06 than we did in 2004&ndash;05 if that proves necessary.

	<p pid="a.768W.5/1">Each unit of property was given a rateable value using a valuation, which for domestic property was usually based on rental evidence just prior to 1973 when the last revaluation on this basis was undertaken. Every year, district and London borough councils would make a general rate to meet the difference between the total of anticipated expenditure (including sums payable to other authorities by way of precepts) less any other income. The rate was expressed in pence per pound sterling. The rates payable were calculated by multiplying this poundage by the rateable value. Rates on domestic property were reduced by a domestic rate relief scheme and could be further reduced by national or local rate rebate schemes.</p>

The use of corporal punishment by parents in the home is similar to that in England and Wales, in that reasonable chastisement is permitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/2">In Jersey, the Education (Jersey) Law 1999 provides that the Education Committee may issue a statement of general principles and guidance. On <phrase class="date" code="1986-12-10">10 December 1986</phrase>, the committee issued guidance that corporal punishment is not to be administered in schools and other institutions. The head teachers of all private schools are required to comply with the Education Committee's guidance as a condition of their registration or grant funding. Therefore all Jersey schools are obliged not to use corporal punishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/3">In Guernsey, by a Directive made under the Education (Guernsey) Law, 1970, corporal punishment is not permitted in schools controlled by the Education Department. Private schools in Guernsey are licensed and inspected by the Education Department. They have all discontinued the use of corporal punishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/4">In the Isle of Man, the Education Act 2001 (of Tynwald) provides that corporal punishment may not be imposed as penalty on a pupil for misbehaviour in a school provided or maintained by the Department of Education. The Department of Education does not have any power to prohibit corporal punishment in independent schools, however the one such school in the Isle of Man is a member of the Independent Schools Council which has banned the use of corporal punishment and hence it is not used on the island.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.2/1">We have no plans to regulate compliance with the duties under part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 beyond the enforcement provisions which are already in place in section 25 of the Act. A disabled person who believes that he or she has been unlawfully discriminated against in access to goods, facilities, services and premises may take civil proceedings against the service provider or the person responsible for the selling, letting or managing of premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.2/2">Before considering civil proceedings, the disabled person may raise a complaint directly with the service provider, or the person responsible for the disposal of premises, to see whether the issue can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. The disabled person may also wish to seek advice from the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) which has established an independent conciliation service for disputes arising under part 3 of the DDA, with a view to promoting the settlement of disputes without recourse to civil proceedings. The DRC also has statutory duties to monitor and keep under review the implementation and enforcement of the DDA, and to advise the Government on the operation of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.2/3">No assessment has yet been made since <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> of the impact of the new duties requiring service providers to tackle physical barriers that prevent disabled people accessing their goods, services and facilities. However, the Government have a programme of research to monitor how those with responsibilities under the DDA are responding to those duties. Research conducted in 2003 and published in 2004 (DWP Research Report 202, Disability in the Workplace: Employers' and Service Providers' Responses to the Disability Discrimination Act in 2003 and Preparation for 2004 Changes) showed that 56 per cent. of the service providers surveyed had changes to physical access in place or planned. Future research will include further assessments of the adjustments made to improve access for disabled people to goods, services and facilities.</p>

This operation is resourced with 1 Sergeant and 4 Constables for East Belfast DCU supported by 2&ndash;3 Regional Tactical Support Group (TSG) vehicles when available. If TSG resources are unavailable, then other East Belfast anti-crime patrols would deploy in support of the Operation Safenight personnel, where necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.795W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mrs. Katharine Bryan to Mr. Eddie McGrady, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-17">17 January 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.795W.8/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question (No. 208373) about the projected costs of bringing all Water Service mains and treatment plants up to EC Water Directive standards. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.8/4" class="indent">Investment levels in upgrading the water and sewerage infrastructure in Northern Ireland have lagged behind those in the rest of the UK for many years. As a result, compliance with EC Directives has been significantly lower in Northern Ireland particularly on wastewater treatment. It is estimated that substantial capital investment, projected at &pound;2.9 billion over the next 20 years, needs to be invested to modernise the existing infrastructure. Over one-quarter of this total is directly attributable to meeting the quality standards required by EC Directives. The remaining investment is required to cater for growth in the demand for water and sewerage services, to improve levels of customer service and to renew the existing watermains, sewers and other parts of the infrastructure. All of this investment must of course comply with the relevant standards including quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.8/5" class="indent">Priority is at present being given to upgrading water and wastewater treatment works. This accounts for some &pound;1 billion of the total investment required and of this approximately one-third is for water treatment while two-thirds is for wastewater treatment. Refurbishment of watermains and sewer networks accounts for the remaining &pound;1.9 billion and will take longer to complete. It is planned to accelerate spending on network refurbishment to around &pound;100 million per year within the next few years, as the treatment works upgrading programme nears completion.</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mrs. Katharine Bryan to Mr. Eddie McGrady, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-14">14 January 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question (No. 208374) about Water Service's future work plan with regard to fixing all burst water mains in Northern Ireland. I have been asked to reply as the issue falls to my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/4" class="indent">Water Service aims to provide continuous supplies of safe drinking water to all customers connected to the water distribution system and to ensure that interruptions to supply, whether due to an emergency or planned maintenance work, are dealt with efficiently and without unnecessary delay. Water Service's Customer Charter sets out the standards it aims to achieve in the delivery of these services. These standards include:</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/5" class="indent">having inspection staff on site within four hours (six hours outside normal working hours) when an unexpected problem disrupts the water supply;</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/6" class="indent">restoring water supplies cut off in an emergency within 12 hours;</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/7" class="indent">restoring water supplies cut off for planned work by the time stated in the notice, which will normally be within 12 hours;</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/8" class="indent">making alternative water supplies available if any interruption is expected to last more than 24 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/9" class="indent">Water Service also has a well developed Major Incident Plan to manage major incidents and to mitigate the effect on customer supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/10" class="indent">Customers can report interruptions in supply or leaks in the distribution system to the Water Service Customer Service Unit by telephoning the Waterline (08457 440088) or the Leakline (08000 282011) during normal working hours. An out-of-hours emergency service is also available by contacting the Waterline. In addition, Water Service has Telemetry Units, which are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to monitor the working of the water and sewerage systems. Operational repair teams, consisting of around 300 staff from both Water Service and contractors, can be deployed to respond to operational incidents throughout the day and night. During 2004, Water Service repaired over 6,000 bursts and leaks on the water distribution system and it is anticipated that a similar number will be repaired in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/11" class="indent">Effective leakage management is a key component in the delivery of Water Service's second Water Efficiency Plan, which was published last year. Water Service is currently implementing a comprehensive leakage reduction programme, costing over &pound;20 million in the three-year period, to reduce leakage to the economic level of 172 million litres per day by 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.797W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question (No. 208375) about the management of water pressure to reduce the amount of water wasted through bursts in water mains. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls to my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.2/4" class="indent">Water Service's second Water Efficiency Plan, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-12">12 January 2004</phrase>, set out a wide range of measures aimed at reducing demand for water, including effective leakage management and the raising of awareness of water efficiency measures. A significant programme of leakage reduction is a major component of the Plan and Water Service is currently implementing a comprehensive Leakage Reduction Action Plan aimed at reducing leakage to the economic level by 2007. It is widely recognised throughout the water industry that excessive water pressure within the distribution system contributes to leaks, and the design and implementation of an effective pressure management scheme is, therefore, one of the main elements of the Action Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.2/5" class="indent">Water Service is committed to extending pressure management to 30 new areas each year. In the current year this total has already been bettered and pressure management has been extended to over 50 new areas. Pressure management schemes have targeted areas where pressure, particularly at night, is excessive. The schemes are carefully designed to ensure that an adequate level of pressure is maintained to customers at all times.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.2/6" class="indent">The implementation of the Leakage Reduction Action Plan has enabled Water Service to reduce leakage from 291 million litres to 231 million litres in the period from April 2002 to March 2004. Water Service is on target to reduce leakage to 205 million litres per day by March 2005 and to achieve the economic level of leakage of 172 million litres per day by 2007.</p>

We expect those who use each of the seven new centres to be sited at or near major railway stations to reflect the socio-economic characteristics of the local working and resident populations. A survey conducted by MORI in November 2004 confirmed that these centres would be welcomed and used by those who work in the vicinity. Actual use of these centres will be monitored as part of our planned evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="a.809W.4/1">In general, Academy sponsors are required to provide 10 per cent. of the capital costs of establishing an Academy, up to a cap of &pound;2 million. The balance is paid by the Department. Capital sponsorship in most instances is in cash, but can be in kind (for example ICT equipment) if the sponsorship shows value for money and appropriate to the needs of the Academy (and can be from a single person or company or group of sponsors). There is no requirement for sponsors to contribute to Academies running costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.809W.4/2">The Trusts which run Academies may borrow from the financial sector. However, like maintained schools, they would require the Secretary of State's consent to do so. The Secretary of State would only be likely to grant consent where a reasonable need to borrow was shown. Academy Trusts cannot borrow against assets that have been given to them for nil consideration (for example, land transferred from local authorities).</p>

	<p pid="a.810W.2/1">The main differences between Academies and City Technology Colleges (CTCs) are around admissions and funding. A CTC is able to select those applicants who are most likely to benefit from the college's emphasis on science and technology, have the strongest motivation to succeed and intend to continue in full time education or training up to the age of 18. Unlike CTCs, Academies are required to comply with the codes of practice on admissions and admissions appeals, and to the admissions law as it applies to maintained schools. They are required to take part in local co-ordinated admissions arrangements. Academies must have regard to the code of practice on SEN and to the statutory guidance on inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.2/2">Both CTCs and Academies receive 100 per cent. of their recurrent funding from the Department. CTCs and Academies are treated on the same basis for ongoing capital funding once open, in that the Department would generally fund 80 per cent. of such costs with the trust finding the remaining 20 per cent., though where work arises through statutory requirements the Department would meet all the costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.2/3">The Department funds CTCs through a funding agreement with the Secretary of State. One fifth of the initial capital cost was paid by private sector sponsors who continue to contribute 20 per cent. towards all capital projects. The Department funds CTCs' running costs on the basis of a direct comparison with budgeted spending for secondary schools in the LEAs from which the CTCs collectively take their pupils. An overall average cost per pupil is derived from this comparison and applied to all the CTCs.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.2/4">The Department also funds Academies through a funding agreement with the Secretary of State. Sponsors pay 10 per cent., up to a cap of &pound;2 million of the capital cost of the project. The Department funds Academies' running costs on a comparable basis to maintained specialist schools within the LEA where the Academy is located</p>

	<p pid="a.814W.2/1">Government recognises the importance of early intervention for children with autistic spectrum disorders and relevant initiatives aim to ease access to informed intervention for pre-school children below the age of five. All three and four year olds are now entitled to a free part-time early education place, for at least 12 and a half hours a week, if their parents want one. The Government's special educational needs (SEN) strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement (February 2004) set out a programme for improving advice and support to, and the skills of, early years settings in meeting the needs of children with SEN. Local education authorities, where necessary, have duties and powers to assess pre-school children's SEN, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, and to draw up statements of SEN setting out the provision necessary to meet the child's needs. The provision, including the number of hours of any specialist intervention, will depend on the nature and intensity of the individual child's needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.817W.0/1">The Government is committed to improving the level of stability in the lives of looked after children, their educational support, and the outcomes they achieve. We have invested significantly in services for this group and continue to do so. The effect of policies on looked after children is monitored systematically through a variety of routes. We collect and publish a wide range of data from local authorities on an annual basis about services to and outcomes achieved by looked after children. Secondly, the draft proposals for the new joint area reviews of children services established by the Children Act 2004 mean that reports will focus specifically on this vulnerable group of children&mdash;both on the way services are working together to meet their needs within an area, and on the results achieved. We are also reviewing the National Minimum Standards used by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) to inspect and register services for children, including those for fostering and adoption agencies and for residential child care, to consider if they could be better focused around outcomes for children.</p>

	<p pid="a.817W.3/1">There are 14 City Technology Colleges (CTCs) one of which is a City College for the Technology of the Arts. The CTCs have reported that they have received over &pound;1.2 million from private sector sponsorship in cash or kind during the 2003/04 academic year. During the same period the Department has provided &pound;76.6 million to CTCs by way of recurrent grants and &pound;2.2 million for approved capital projects. The CTC Unit of Funding for pupils under school leaving age in the 2003&ndash;2004 academic year was &pound;3,717. This was uplifted by 30 per cent. for post 16 pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.817W.3/2">There is no equivalent per-pupil funding figure either directly to other state schools from LEAs or to LEAs, since in both cases the funding covers different responsibilities. The CTC unit of funding includes elements of funding for tasks/services that an LEA would normally provide for its schools but a CTC has to provide for itself. It excludes any area cost weighting which might also be received by a particular school.</p>
	<p pid="a.817W.3/3">The funding for to LEAs in England via Education Formula Spending and Revenue Grants was &pound;4,290 per pupil aged 11&ndash;15 in the academic year 2003/04 (based on financial year figures from 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05). This is a wider definition than the CTC unit of funding since it includes funding for all an LEAs responsibilities in relation to children aged 11&ndash;15, and the area cost adjustment.</p>

All schools will receive at least the guaranteed per-pupil increases that we announced in July. The guarantee for secondary and special schools remains at 4 per cent. per pupil, but the guarantee for primary and nursery schools is higher at 5 per cent. per pupil. This is in recognition that these schools need extra support to implement the final phase of workforce reform from <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>, including guaranteed time for all teachers for planning, preparation and assessment activities. The package was welcomed by representatives of teachers, headteacher and support staff on the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.5/2">To ensure that there is headroom above the guarantee all authorities will receive an increase in their School Formula Spending Share of at least 5.5 per cent. Devon's settlement for 2005&ndash;06 is significantly higher at 7 per cent. and Torbay will also receive a higher settlement of 6.5 per cent., giving both authorities greater flexibility to target resources at schools with particular pressures. Local education authorities have a great deal of freedom to decide how to allocate the available resources through their local funding formula. Therefore I think Devon teachers should press their case locally.</p>

	<p pid="a.821W.2/1">Since the publication of the National Languages Strategy in December 2002, we have made much progress to improve teaching standards and take up of modern foreign languages in both primary and secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.2/2">At primary level, 19 local education authorities have taken up Key Stage 2 language pathfinder roles to develop ways of delivering primary languages; we are consulting on a draft framework for the teaching and learning of Key Stage 2 languages; we have recently committed &pound;5 million to support primary language learning in 2005&ndash;06; and by the end of last year we had trained well over 1,000 new teachers with a modern foreign language specialism. In addition, many primary schools benefit from the resources and teaching expertise from their local specialist language college to support and deliver quality language learning programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.2/3">At secondary level, the Key Stage 3 National Strategy Modern Foreign Language programme, introduced into schools in 2003, is designed to contribute to the raising of standards in Modern Foreign Languages. The programme consists of a framework of objectives for teaching Modern Foreign Languages throughout Key Stage 3 and encourages teachers to draw on existing good practice and work together to become more effective so that pupils improve in what and how they learn. Since its introduction Ofsted have commented that the use of the framework has helped teaching and the approach it encourages is having a positive effect on the attitudes of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.2/4">The changes to the statutory curriculum at Key Stage 4 were introduced to enable schools to offer more choice and flexibility to their pupils, facilitating the introduction of new types of learning&mdash;in particular more vocational approaches. The flexibility in the new curriculum creates space for students to pursue learning programmes that reflect their aspirations and needs as well as maintaining a strong grasp of the basics. In this new flexibility students have an entitlement to follow a course in Modern Foreign Languages.</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.2/5">The changes at Key Stage 4 should not impact on our able and enthusiastic linguists, who we expect will continue to study languages at GCSE, A-level and beyond. By introducing language learning at Key Stage 2 our ambition is that we engage pupils when we know they are more receptive, so that we maximise their potential for language learning and harness their enthusiasm in order that they continue to study languages during their secondary education and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.2/6">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority published guidance last year entitled &quot;Modern Foreign Languages in the Key Stage 4 Curriculum&quot; which provides detailed guidance for the provision of Modern Foreign Languages at Key Stage 4. It includes information on statutory requirements&mdash;including the range of languages schools can offer&mdash;qualifications and the different courses available. Schools must offer at least one course in an official language of the EU that leads to an approved qualification. Schools may, in addition, offer courses in any other foreign language(s).</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.2/7">To recognise the achievement of language learners of all ages, we are developing a new voluntary recognition scheme&mdash;The Languages Ladder. The scheme is currently being piloted in three languages and will be available to all schools in eight languages from September 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.824W.2/14">1. The Information is taken from Bedfordshire LEA's section 52 budget statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.2/15">2. These figures are the Individual Schools Budget (ISB) allocated to schools. In 2004&ndash;05 there was a further &pound;747,818 unallocated Schools Budget (no unallocated ISB was reported in 2000&ndash;01).</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.2/16">3. In 2004&ndash;05 an additional &pound;19.4 million was funded through the school standards grant and the devolved standard fund (of which &pound;7.2 million was for primary schools, &pound;3.3 million for middle deemed schools, &pound;5.6 million for secondary schools and &pound;3.3 million was unallocated) while in 2000&ndash;01 an additional &pound;12.9 million was funded through the devolved standard fund (of which &pound;1.9 million was for primary schools, &pound;1 million for middle deemed schools, &pound;1.3 million for secondary schools and &pound;8.8 million was unallocated).</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.2/17">4. Prior to 1999&ndash;2000 budget data was not collected at school level. In 1999&ndash;2000 school level data were collected but amendments were not checked back with LEAs. If the data were to be made available externally, the cleansed data would need to be agreed by the LEAs which would require a significant amount of time and effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.2/18">5. In 2000&ndash;01 school standards grants was not recorded on Section 52 Budget Table 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.2/19">6. In 2004&ndash;05 Bedfordshire LEA also reported an unallocated Excellence in Cities (EiC) Grant of &pound;229,000 (no EiC was reported as allocated). In 2000&ndash;01 EiC was reported within the devolved standard fund and will therefore be included in the additional &pound;12.9million figure given above. This funding is not included in the above table.</p>

	<p pid="a.827W.8/1">The Secretary of State has no role in the approval of proposals to close schools in England. For proposals published by the local education authority, where there are no objections, the LEA may decide to implement the proposals. In all other cases the proposals are passed to the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) for consideration. If the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision, the proposals are passed to the Schools Adjudicator for the final decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.8/2">In making their decision the SOC and schools adjudicator must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. This sets out a range of factors that must be considered. These include the views of interested parties, the impact of what is proposed on local standards, whether there is sufficient capacity to accommodate displaced pupils, length and nature of journey to alternative provision and the overall cost effectiveness of the proposals.</p>
