The UK will deploy the HQ Group of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps to lead the ISAF for a period of nine months from May 2006.

	<p pid="e.4W.5/1">Harmony guidelines are measured by average Tour Intervals for units and personnel. Breaches are managed in a number of ways, including through tailoring of force packages to achieve objectives in the most efficient way possible, and sensitive posting and deployment of personnel. Pressure is further alleviated through contributions made by other Allies, which we continue to encourage through the NATO force generation process, and through eventual reductions in UK force commitments elsewhere. Over the longer-term, programmes such as the Future Army Structure will help to bring Tour Intervals in line with Harmony guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="e.5W.8/1">Personnel known to be suffering from an existing mental health condition are assessed on a case-by-case basis and medically downgraded if necessary. This assessment is made with input from appropriate health professionals, including a Consultant Psychiatrist where necessary. Even those personnel who have been medically downgraded may be fit for deployment on some operations. An assessment of such personnel will be undertaken prior to any decision to deploy them. In making a decision as to the deployability of Service personnel already known to be suffering from a mental health condition, all relevant factors will be taken into account including the severity of the symptoms, the location and duration of the deployment and the nature of the duties to be carried out. Personnel who have not been medically downgraded are, by definition, fit for operational deployment.</p>
	<p pid="e.5W.8/2">No specific, formal mental health assessment of personnel is undertaken prior to deployment. However, line managers and commanding officers will routinely monitor their Servicemen and women looking for indications of a mental health condition and whether they would therefore need to be referred for medical opinion.</p>

Complimentary soft drinks should also be made available throughout the flight.

	<p pid="e.10W.3/1">Some cluster munitions remain unexploded through malfunction and leave Explosive Remnants of War (ERW). United Kingdom played an active role at the United Nations in creating a new legally binding protocol on ERW that will offer significant humanitarian benefit to those areas affected. Cluster munitions differ from anti-personnel landmines in a number of ways and the UK has not supported steps to broaden the scope of the Ottawa Convention to include them.</p>

The final decision that the Qinetiq IPO should not include a retail offer was taken in consultation with other Government Departments. It remains the Government's view that a retail offer for Qinetiq would not have offered value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="e.34W.5/1">It is not possible to provide specific details of the development costs of the Type 45 destroyer as the contracts placed for both the warship and its main weapon system (the Principal Anti-Air Missiles System) cover both development and production phases. As reported in Major Projects Report 2005, we expect the initial acquisition costs of the first six Type 45 destroyers to be &pound;5,896 million as opposed to a figure of &pound;5,475 million when the project was approved originally in 2000. The reasons for cost growth are detailed in successive editions of the Major Projects Report.</p>

Commanders in the field draw upon training guidance relating to precautions to be taken in relation to our own forces when considering safe distances between deployed white phosphorus and non-combatants.

	<p pid="e.41W.8/1">Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff below the senior civil service subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.</p>
	<p pid="e.41W.8/2">Against this background, over 80 per cent. of the civil service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions.</p>
	<p pid="e.41W.8/3">The normal retirement age for the senior civil service is 60. However, heads of departments and agency chief executives have the flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.</p>
	<p pid="e.41W.8/4">Legislation which will come into force in October 2006 will result in the normal retirement age in the United Kingdom being 65. As a result employers will not have to justify the decision to retire an employee after that age. This will be subject to review after five years. To ensure compliance, the civil service is currently quality proofing its terms and conditions in this area to raise the retirement age of all its employees, including the senior civil service, to 65. Those areas of the civil service which consider that they need to maintain a retirement age below 65 will only be able to do so if they can objectively justify this by reference to particular circumstances. It is anticipated, however, that this will be a negligible figure against the total number of permanent civil servants.</p>

	<p pid="e.52W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.52W.3/2">There was no system in place to identify poppy fields for destruction between 2001 and late 2003. Since late 2003, however, the UK has supported the Afghans in identifying 35&ndash;50,000 hectares of poppy cultivation annually. Areas identified for possible eradication are determined by a number of factors, including the security situation and the availability of alternative livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="e.52W.3/3">On the destruction, or eradication, of poppy fields, the UK has provided and continues to provide financial and logistical support to a number of Afghan law enforcement forces. Afghanistan's first comprehensive eradication programme was initiated during the 2004&ndash;05 growing season. Final eradication figures in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) survey for 2005 can be found on the UNODC website at <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html">http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="e.52W.3/4">UK military forces deployed under International Security Assistance Force can contribute to the broader counter-narcotics effort by providing the secure environment in which the rule of law can be applied; reconstruction can take place; and legal rural livelihoods can be developed. They are not there to take direct action against the drugs trade, including the eradication of poppy fields.</p>

	<p pid="e.52W.6/1">DFID's only current bilateral support for alternative livelihoods (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production) is in Afghanistan. Here, DFID's alternative livelihoods programme was developed substantially after full-blown conflict ended in 2001, although terrorist violence continues in parts of the country where we are supporting the Government to promote alternatives to poppy production. DFID also supports a UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) project in Myanmar, which aims to support the local population in meeting their food security needs following the banning of opium production.</p>
	<p pid="e.52W.6/2">DFID is currently considering assistance to help improve social services and provide livelihoods opportunities for poor people in the southern poor districts of North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Punjab in Pakistan. These areas either experience low intensity terrorist violence or share a boundary with conflict areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.52W.6/3">In past years (projects starting in the 1990s), DFID supported alternative livelihoods programmes in Pakistan (&pound;4.4 million) that aimed to reduce poppy cultivation, and in Bolivia (&pound;720,000) and Peru (&pound;3.2 million) that aimed to reduce coca production, including projects led by UN drugs control agencies. A further &pound;16 million was provided in the 1980s and 90s to broader agricultural research projects in non coca-growing areas of Bolivia of which some 10&ndash;20 per cent. may have had an impact on coca-growing households in adjacent areas. Some of these programmes coincided with periods of conflict and terrorist violence.</p>

	<p pid="e.53W.2/1">Afghanistan is the only country where DFID has a bilateral alternative livelihoods programme (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production). The Afghan Government launched its updated National Drug Control Strategy at the London Conference in January which sets out the Afghan Governments policies and plans for tackling Afghanistan's narcotics trade for the coming three years and highlights four key priorities. These are (i) targeting the trafficker and trade, (ii) strengthening and diversifying legal livelihoods, (iii) developing effective counter-narcotics institutions and (iv) demand reduction. The UK has a three year plan to support this and DFID leads on UK support for alternative livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="e.53W.2/2">Between 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06 DFID's spending on alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan has increased ten fold. The forecast spend for this year is in the region of &pound;45 million and we hope to maintain similar levels of funding in future years. The DFID livelihoods programme will support the Afghan Government's efforts to mitigate the impact of those who have lost their livelihoods, through the expansion of key Afghan Government National Programmes into priority poppy growing provinces; support programmes to improve farm and off-farm opportunities for poor Afghan farmers and labourers to access legal income from sustainable legal employment, credit productive assets such as infrastructure and social assets such as education and health services, and markets for legal goods; help generate an improved policy and planning environment for alternative livelihood programmes; and support greater financial and technical support from other donors, delivered in a more coherent manner in line with the Afghan Government's policies and plans.</p>
	<p pid="e.53W.2/3">The success criterion for alternative livelihoods is a 10 per cent. year-on-year increase in uptake of legal livelihood opportunities. However success is highly dependant on progress with other strands of the National Drug Control Strategy, in particular improving the capacity of counter-narcotics institutions, law enforcement capacity and success in targeting the trafficker and trade.</p>
	<p pid="e.53W.2/4">The experience from other countries shows that achieving sustainable reductions in drug cultivation takes a long-time. There are no quick solutions. We will continue to support the development of alternative livelihoods as long as there is a need to do so to help the Afghan Government achieve its counter-narcotics objectives.</p>

	<p pid="e.54W.2/1">The African Union Mission in Sudan covers the three states of Darfur (Western, Northern and Southern). Across the whole of Darfur, there are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance. The priority is to provide assistance and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives.</p>
	<p pid="e.54W.2/2">Darfur remains highly dependent on food aid. Although this year there is expected to be above average food production, the ability of Darfuris to bring in the harvest depends on security which remains extremely fragile in many areas. Even with a good harvest, an estimated 3 million people in Darfur will still require food aid.</p>
	<p pid="e.54W.2/3">The massive scale of the humanitarian relief effort in Darfur has, however, had a major impact on malnutrition rates, dropping to almost half what they were in the previous year. Likewise the recent WHO Darfur survey showed mortality rates have, in cases, reduced by two-thirds since August 2004.</p>
	<p pid="e.54W.2/4">The UK is the 2nd largest bilateral humanitarian donor in Darfur (after the US), providing over &pound;96 million since September 2003. These funds have meant that hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people have been provided with shelter, food, water and basic health care.</p>
	<p pid="e.54W.2/5">However, the situation still remains extremely fragile. I am particularly concerned about the impact that the deteriorating security situation is having on humanitarian operations, especially in South and West Darfur. If aid were reduced because of conflict, insecurity or funding shortages, humanitarian indicators would deteriorate very quickly. That is why improved security and a negotiated political agreement in Abuja are urgently needed.</p>

	<p pid="e.54W.5/1">The UK has been a strong supporter of the African Union (AU) mission in Darfur, providing almost &pound;32 million to date. During my trip to Sudan last week, I announced an additional &pound;20 million in support of the AU mission. The AU has performed well in very challenging circumstances but the deterioration in security in Darfur since the end of 2005 has been marked by an increase in violence and banditry. This change has underlined that a peace support mission will be required for quite some time. This is why the UK supports the proposed transition from an AU force to a UN operation that will be able to provide the long-term stability required. While the final decision on transfer needs to come from the AU, I welcome their agreement in principle on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase> and the UN's planning for such a contingency. Any timetable for this transition will depend on negotiations at the AU and UN.</p>
	<p pid="e.54W.5/2">During my visit to both Darfur (El Fasher) and Khartoum last week, I discussed these issues with both the AU (including the new Force Commander) and the UN. I stressed the importance of the AU force continuing to be fully supported and strengthened right up until any transition date. The role the AU plays in providing support to the humanitarian agencies and protecting civilians is critical to the people of Darfur and there cannot be any winding down of effectiveness in anticipation of the UN arriving. The UK, therefore, in addition to providing substantial funding, is encouraging our international partners to maintain and increase their levels of support to the AU. This includes taking forward the recommendations of the December 2005 Joint Assessment Mission which will assist in strengthening the AU's capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="e.54W.5/3">For the future, we support the need for a strong mandate to enable any UN force to protect the people of Darfur and to assist in the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance. We are in regular discussions with our donor partners, the UN and the AU on how any transition would be managed and how international partners could assist, including planning and logistical support. We will continue to encourage the UN and the AU force to co-ordinate their work, wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="e.54W.5/4">To support the UN in their delivery of humanitarian assistance, in Sudan last week I also announced a &pound;40 million UK contribution to the new Common Humanitarian Fund. This fund will allow the UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator to fund the most important priorities and help to ensure there is greater co-ordination of the humanitarian effort.</p>

	<p pid="e.56W.2/1">There is considerable suffering in Tanzania owing to the present food insecurity. The Government of Tanzania has made effective use of its Strategic Grain Reserve to deliver grain to vulnerable households, although the continuing drought means this is now under pressure. A Rapid Vulnerability Assessment (RVA), conducted by the Government in response to the food and water situation was circulated on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase>. The RVA found that 3.8 million Tanzanians need food assistance to the tune of 100,000 metric tonnes up to the next expected harvest in May. Of those, around 565,000 are considered destitute and need immediate food aid. DFID stands ready to help the Government respond to this situation. We are consulting with other agencies, notably the World Food Programme, to determine the robustness of the RVA and inform decisions on assistance. DFID's response will be based on a proposal received from the Government of Tanzania, outlining what additional resources it needs from donors, and how it would like them delivered. Other donors are also likely to respond to the Government's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="e.56W.2/2">In addition, should the EC's Humanitarian Organisation (ECHO) decide to provide assistance to the Government in response to the crisis. DFID would contribute as a member state.</p>
	<p pid="e.56W.2/3">In the longer term, we will be seeking solutions to help reduce vulnerability, through a mix of social protection, such as cash transfer schemes or food for work, and economic opportunities for poorer households to withstand shocks.</p>
	<p pid="e.56W.2/4">Power generation in Tanzania is likely to be based on hydro and thermal sources, both of which are subject to external influences. DFID provides technical support to a Government power sector reform programme through our support to the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission. DFID also funds technical assistance to the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority to encourage private sector investment in power generation and distribution. In the interim, our support to the Government's budget indirectly supports the national electricity utility TANESCO.</p>

	<p pid="e.71W.0/1">A Statement of Requirements, which forms a part of the new Target contracts, has been developed and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House. This details the standards that all accommodation providers to the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) under the Target contracts must meet. These standards were drawn up in consultation with existing public sector providers and other external stakeholders. Accommodation providers are required to provide a briefing service to newly dispersed asylum seekers shortly after arrival, a detailed and auditable complaints service and clearly defined timescales for property maintenance and repairs.</p>
	<p pid="e.71W.0/2">We have sought to minimise, as far as possible, disruption to asylum seekers where a change in accommodation is unavoidable by providing them, at the earliest opportunity, with detailed information of the processes involved and access to a telephone helpline. The exact number of asylum seekers who will need to move to alternative accommodation will be established following the signing of the Target contracts. Current estimates suggest that nationally up to 7,200 households may have to move.</p>
	<p pid="e.71W.0/3">Asylum seekers requiring support and assistance can seek this from a range of sources including their accommodation provider, the local MASS regional office, statutory agencies, and the voluntary sector. Since April 2000 MASS has funded six voluntary sector agencies to deliver one stop services throughout the United Kingdom to asylum seekers. Following consultation with the agencies involved, new agreements are being put in place for a period of five years from April 2006 to provide continuity of advisory services.</p>

	<p pid="e.88W.2/1">No final decisions have been taken with regard to the exact number or eventual locations of enrolment centres for the Identity Card Scheme as ongoing analysis and research continues. While the 69 offices of the expanded passport office network will form the building blocks of the enrolment centre network, it does not necessarily reflect the entire network structure.</p>
	<p pid="e.88W.2/2">The Identity Cards Programme business case includes assumptions with regard the number of enrolment centres for the identity card scheme. However, it is not possible to reveal this number at present as to do so would jeopardise the ability of the Government to obtain value for money from the procurement process.</p>
	<p pid="e.88W.2/3">The Government have stated that current analysis envisages that no person will have to travel more than an hour to get to an enrolment centre. Provision for mobile enrolment facilities is planned for those who would have to travel more than an hour from the location of a fixed enrolment centre.</p>
	<p pid="e.88W.2/4">The estimated annual average running costs for issuing identity cards and passports to British citizens cost is &pound;584 million. The cost of staffing, operation, equipment and office property for passport and identity card local enrolment centres and mobile enrolment facilities where biometrics will be recorded is included in this figure as well as allowances for depreciation and the replacement and updating of IT and other equipment as well as the maintenance thereof.</p>

	<p pid="e.88W.5/1">The Government have always made clear that an ID card will not be required at any time for access to emergency treatment. This was emphasised when the policy was announced in November 2003, in 'Identity Cards: The Next Steps' (Cm 6020)</p>

	<p pid="e.89W.2/1">There are no plans to incorporate RFID chips in biometric passports and identity cards which will use proximity chips. While both use radio frequencies, they use different operating systems and security requirements. For example, proximity chips include a far higher level of security protection than an RFID tag and can only be read at a very short distance (e.g. 0&ndash;2cm from the reader). These differences are reflected in the fact that they operate to different standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).</p>
	<p pid="e.89W.2/2">Proximity chips are being introduced into travel documents worldwide to fulfil international requirements for travel documents established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, a division of the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="e.89W.2/3">It is intended that the proximity chips in both the identity card and biometric passports will utilise Basic Access Control as a data access protocol in accordance with international standards as well as other cryptographic measures in order to prevent the information on the chip from being modified. Furthermore, it is planned that further advanced encryption will be utilised to secure biometric information on the chip of the card. This will comply with Extended Access Control standards that are currently under development at an international level.</p>
	<p pid="e.89W.2/4">The security features of the chip of the biometric passport and identity card will also be subject to an assurance process including rigorous testing in advance of their rollout. In addition, before the identity card scheme can commence, it will be subject to a comprehensive security accreditation process.</p>
	<p pid="e.89W.2/5">The cost of producing chips with these security features is included in the annual running cost estimate of issuing biometric passports and identity cards.</p>

This does not provide for a direct link between the two databases but rather allows for a system that will provided a verification of specific identity information provided on applications against records held by the ONS. This will eliminate reliance on paper documentation, thereby enhancing customer service and eliminating some types of fraud.</p>
	<p pid="e.95W.5/2">A similar arrangement will be sought with the General Register Offices (GROs) in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, so information can be verified against their nationality databases. Furthermore, a similar arrangement is being considered with the Department of Work and Pensions and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. It is important to note that, by law, these checks would only be permitted for the verification of identity information provided for the purpose of a passport application or for determining whether to withdraw a passport. It would not entail the provision of any other information from these sources.</p>

	<p pid="e.96W.5/1">The 2004&ndash;05 British Crime Survey (BCS) found that older people were less likely to be victims of crime than the England and Wales average and than younger people (see Tables 1 and 2).</p>
	<p pid="e.96W.5/2">Table 1 shows that 1.6 per cent. of households where the household reference person was aged 75 and over were victims of one or more burglaries in 2004&ndash;05, compared with 2.7 per cent. of all households and 7.1 per cent. of households where the household reference person was aged 16 to 24.</p>

The review suggested that interventions based on a therapeutic community model offer the most promising outcomes, however reliable evidence of long-term effectiveness (including reconviction) is extremely limited.</p>
	<p pid="e.100W.8/2">An integrated pilot programme has been established by the Home Office and the Department of Health for assessing and treating offenders identified as having dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD). The four main sites are located in two high-security prisons and two high-security hospitals.

Only if these are completed satisfactorily will the device be considered for type approval.

Type approval will be granted only if the results from the laboratory record a satisfactory performance.

	<p pid="e.108W.2/4">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your question on whether the international migration estimates for 2004 take account of citizens from the 2004 accession countries who were in the UK before May 2004 and who then registered on the Workers Registration Scheme after that date. (51186)</p>
	<p pid="e.108W.2/5">International migration estimates are produced using data from several sources, the most important of which is the International Passenger Survey (IPS). This is a sample survey that covers the principal sea, air and Channel routes between the UK and countries outside of the British Isles. Migrants are defined as persons who, on entry to the UK, state an intention to stay for a year or more. Such intentions may not be realised. Migration flows of citizens from EU accession countries who arrived in the UK prior to May 2004 were estimated from the IPS and included in the international migration estimates.</p>
	<p pid="e.108W.2/6">It is estimated that 52,600 citizens of the 10 accession countries migrated to the UK in 2004, about 30 per cent. of these migrants arrived in the first six months of the year.</p>
	<p pid="e.108W.2/7">At present we have not incorporated information from the WRS into the migration estimates because in theory they should be represented in the IPS sample. We are considering how we could use the information to quality assure any changing patterns.</p>

The process requires applicants to complete an application form, which is checked for eligibility. Successful candidates are subject to background checks for any conflicts of interest and exceptional circumstances before being recommended for appointment. The Lancashire AC has five sub-committees which engage in this process.</p>

	<p pid="e.123W.2/1">Listing is a judicial function and dates tend to be discussed and agreed in court in consultation with a list officer. The aim is to list cases as early as possible but so that the parties are given enough time to prepare properly. Listing has to balance a number of conflicting demands and any representations made by a party will be considered on their merits. There are mechanisms in place locally to enable representatives from the criminal justice agencies to meet regularly to discuss any concerns they may have associated with listing practices.</p>

	<p pid="e.126W.9/1">Last year, the Department introduced risk offer payments for respiratory disease claims, often referred to as &quot;fast-track&quot; payments. For living claimants, offers are made based on the initial medical tests and the claims will not yet have gone through the full medical assessment process (MAP). Compensation will be paid quickly, freeing up specialist medical consultants to concentrate on assessing miners with higher levels of disability through the MAP. The scheme went live on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February 2005</phrase>. More than 65,000 offers have been made and the acceptance rate is currently 95 per cent. The average payment is around &pound;2,150.</p>
	<p pid="e.126W.9/2">In claims from the families of deceased miners, the Department make offers of &pound;1,200 to widows and &pound;1,000 to estates in cases where there is no information on the death certificate about respiratory conditions. The deceased fast-track scheme became operational in early September 2005 in England and Wales and on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-01">1 November 2005</phrase> in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="e.126W.9/3">It is hoped that the fast-track offers have the potential to shorten the overall compensation scheme by around two years.</p>

We are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to find solutions and to reduce the impact on those most affected.</p>
	<p pid="e.129W.12/2">Indications are that in January 2006, for domestic consumers, prices in the UK remained below the EU median for both electricity and gas, with our domestic gas prices still the cheapest in the whole of Europe. For industry, indications are that prices have recently moved above the EU median. However, historically, prices to industrial users have been below or around the EU median, with UK industry spending about &pound;8 billion less on gas than their German counterparts between 1990 and 2004.

	<p pid="e.133W.8/2">We are aware of public concern about the misuse of these vehicles, often by young people, and the issue has been raised with us by the police and by other antisocial behaviour practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="e.133W.8/3">To address this issue, last summer the Home Office and the Department for Transport produced information for practitioners on the enforcement and safe use of these types of bikes, to enable safety advice to be given at the local level. The Home Office also organised a number of TOGETHER Action Days with antisocial behaviour practitioners to share best practice around this topic and provide guidance on dealing with this problem. Then on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-01">1 November 2005</phrase>, additional guidance was issued to the police on the use of seizure powers under section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002. These apply in respect of any mechanically propelled vehicle, whether or not intended or adapted for use on road, if it is being driven carelessly or inconsiderately on-road or off-road without authority, if at the same time its use is causing or likely to cause alarm, distress or annoyance. This additional guidance explains the rationale behind its various aspects, clarifies the terms and the circumstances in which it might be used and offers examples of effective operations. At the same time Regulations governing use of the power were simplified.</p>
	<p pid="e.133W.8/4">This work has led to further discussions between the Home Office, the Department for Transport and the Department of Trade and Industry and we are considering what more can be done to address the problem. However, at this time we have no plans to introduce controls on the sale of mini-motorbikes to underage youths.</p>

The Post Office card account has played an important part as a stepping stone to financial inclusion, and has helped some people, previously unused to banking, get used to using a plastic card and personal identification number. However, the Post Office card account is a simple account with limited functions. It can only receive payments of benefits, pensions and tax credits. It does not, for example, allow customers to make savings on fuel bills by paying by direct debit; it cannot receive payments of wages; cheques cannot be paid into the Post Office card account; and it does not pay interest on balances.</p>

	<p pid="e.138W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, I announced the Government's response to the report &quot;A Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy Activity in the UK&quot; <sup>1</sup> which included a funding package from my department of &pound;15 million over four years for a UK wide hydrogen and fuel cell demonstration programme. The demonstration scheme is currently in preparation, and will require EC state aid approval.</p>
	<p pid="e.138W.5/2">Currently, my Department supports industrial collaborative research and development for fuel cell and hydrogen technologies through the Technology Programme (and previously through the new and renewable energy programme). Fuel Cells have been supported since 1992. Bids specifically for hydrogen technologies have been invited since April 2005. The programme seeks to advance these technologies for both stationary power generation and transport applications, with a view to achieving the cost reductions and performance levels necessary for commercial deployment. This support has amounted to approximately &pound;2 million per annum since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="e.138W.5/3">The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), including through the SUPERGEN initiative, support basic research in universities on both fuel cells and hydrogen. SUPERGEN supports the UK Sustainable Hydrogen Energy Consortium (UK SHEC) which has received funding of &pound;2.5 million. This programme is supporting projects on: hydrogen generation; hydrogen storage; and socio-economic implications for a hydrogen economy. In addition to SUPERGEN, EPSRC has awarded &pound;1 million to investigate the potential role of formic acid as a chemical method for the storage of hydrogen. &pound;500,000 has been granted to three projects on fundamental science and engineering relevant to the hydrogen economy. EPSRC also contributes to projects through the DTI's Technology Programme. More widely, the research councils EPSRC, ESRC, and NERC have recently established the UK Energy Research Centre.</p>
	<p pid="e.138W.5/4">The Government have also provided funding of over &pound;450,000 for the trial of three hydrogen-powered fuel cell buses in London as part of the EU CUTE (Clean Urban Transport in Europe) project. &pound;7.5 million of funding has been provided for the fuel cell and low carbon vehicle technology Centre of Excellence (CENEX) based in Loughborough.</p>
	<p pid="e.138W.5/5">The Department for Transport announced in January, as part of their Horizons innovative research programme, a competition for projects to investigate the options for the further steps required to move to the adoption of a hydrogen transport infrastructure. It is hoped to support between two and four projects examining the practicality and timing of the introduction of the required infrastructure to support hydrogen-fuelled vehicles at a cost of up to &pound;500,000.</p>

Some cannot be returned. The matter is dealt with by schemes made under section 89 of the Postal Services Act 2000, in particular the successor postal services company inland letter post scheme 2001, paragraph 8 of which provides that the service of returning undeliverable letters is discretionary.</p>

	<p pid="e.141W.11/1">As a result of the 2003 Graham Review of the Small Firms Loan Guarantee (SFLG), each of the participating lenders were given an annual lending limit. For the high volume lenders this was calculated according to their market share of SFLG lending over the previous three years.</p>
	<p pid="e.141W.11/2">Within the overall constraint of these lending limits the impact on the Exchequer of increasing the maximum amount a business can borrow would be minimal. However, the Graham Review did not find any economic justification for increasing the maximum loan value and to do so would have a potentially detrimental impact as, within the overall lending limits that apply, it would reduce the number of small businesses that could be assisted to borrow.</p>

	<p pid="e.147W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February 2006</phrase>, at a meeting of the British-Irish Council, I exchanged letters with the Irish Minister for Transport, stating our joint intention to proceed to apply the convention to recognise one another's driving disqualifications. My officials are working closely with those of the Northern Ireland and Ireland administrations to specify the details of such co-operation and to bring it into effect as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="e.147W.3/3">I am keen to see similar arrangements in place with other member states of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="e.147W.6/1">Folding bicycles may be carried on all trains at all times, free of charge. However, non-folding bicycles may not be carried on London commuter trains during the Monday-Friday peak hours, when capacity is at a premium. This arrangement is common to all operators, although the exact time restriction may vary by route. Operators are encouraged to provide cycle facilities at stations and since 2004&ndash;05 the Department for Transport has funded around 2,900 additional new cycle parking spaces at stations across the rail network.</p>

	<p pid="e.150W.2/1">Information on monthly sales of biofuels and all other transport fuels is available from the HM Revenue and Customs website at <a href="http://www.uktradeinfo.com/index.cfm?task=facthydro">http://www.uktradeinfo.com/index.cfm?task=facthydro</a>. The data for November and December 2005 are still provisional at this stage, but suggests that, across the year as a whole, sales of biofuels accounted for some 0.25 per cent. of total transport fuel sales. The Government's recently announced Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation is set to deliver a huge increase in UK biofuels over the next few years, and will require transport fuel suppliers to ensure that, by 2010, biofuels account for 5 per cent. of their total sales.</p>

	<p pid="e.153W.5/1">There are a number of initiatives underway that involve potential changes to driver licensing.</p>
	<p pid="e.153W.5/2">The Road Safety Bill as originally published contained provision for the removal of the paper counterpart. This is the paper section of the two-part licence and currently has to be produced with the plastic card licence. The Bill also contained a provision for the compulsory surrender of old-form licences. On the <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>, however, the House of Lords voted to remove this provision from the Bill. No further decisions have as yet been taken about this matter.</p>
	<p pid="e.153W.5/3">The European Commission (EC) made proposals in December 2003 for a third directive on driving licences. This would place obligations upon the United Kingdom as upon all other member states. The EC believed that its proposals would help to combat fraud, improve road safety and facilitate free movement between member states. The proposed directive remains under negotiation in the Council of Ministers, and under consideration by the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="e.153W.5/4">DVLA is also in the process of replacing its driving licence card production facility. This is to address the increasing threat posed by counterfeiters to driving licence security. The new cards will contain a number of state of the art high security features. Completion is planned by the end of next year.</p>

	<p pid="e.153W.8/2">The restriction is currently suspended due to the need for essential maintenance work.

	<p pid="e.159W.0/2">For the Midland branch of the Thameslink 2000 route, forecast numbers of boarders per station range from under a thousand for some stations to over 6,000 for the busier stations (for the am peak three hour period 0700 to 1000). Future population and employment predictions have been included in these forecasts.</p>
	<p pid="e.159W.0/3">The Department will consider on a case by case basis the merits for extending platforms to accommodate trains of 12 car length at stations along the Midland branch that were not included in the submitted applications.

In particular, it provides for us to lift the transport exemption in Part 3 of the DDA (that covers access to goods, services and facilities). We have already made regulations that will lift the exemption in relation to public transport-buses and coaches, trains and trams, taxis and private hire vehicles-as well as for vehicles used on leisure and tourism services, vehicle hire services and vehicle breakdown services. Those regulations come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase> this year.</p>

The Act also provides for those regulations to be applied to rail vehicles when they are refurbished.</p>

Following extensions to these categories in July 2002, persons vulnerable as a result of having served in Her Majesty's regular armed forces have a priority need for accommodation, and the number accepted for this reason are separately identified.

	<p pid="e.179W.2/1">The Government's understanding of the causes of homelessness and the actions that can be taken to tackle it more effectively was summarised in 2005 in the strategy for tackling homelessness, &quot;Sustainable Communities: settled homes, changing lives&quot;. This endorsed the analysis in the 2002 report &quot;More than a roof&quot;. Homelessness is caused by a number of factors, some of which relate to the wider state of the economy and the housing market and others which are personal to the individual or family, or reflect social and demographic change.</p>
	<p pid="e.179W.2/2">The overall supply of affordable housing is a key structural factor and the Government are increasing investment to deliver 75,000 social rented homes and 40,000 homes for essential public sector workers and low cost home ownership by 2008. Options for making greater use of the private rented sector as a source of settled solutions for homeless households are also being developed.</p>
	<p pid="e.179W.2/3">Local authorities are asked to record the reasons when they accept a household as being unintentionally homeless and in priority need. The most recent statutory homelessness statistics for England (for the third quarter of 2005) are on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website. The most important recorded reasons are parents, relatives or friends no longer willing to accommodate the household, the breakdown of a relationship with a partner and the ending of an assured shorthold tenancy. Since 2002 the Government have promoted an increasing emphasis on developing innovative approaches to the prevention of homelessness. Successful approaches to homelessness prevention have been developed to address the presenting problems of households approaching local authorities, for example mediation to resolve family and relationship breakdown and rent deposit schemes to provide access to the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="e.179W.2/4">It is recognised that the recorded reasons often obscure a complex chain of events that preceded the homelessness acceptance. At present relatively little is known about the personal, social and economic circumstances of homeless families and other vulnerable people accepted by local authorities, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is undertaking further research to improve understanding of the deeper social and personal issues involved. To address this gap in the evidence base the ODPM is currently conducting a major survey of households with children and of young people accepted as homeless by local authorities on the causes, impacts and costs of homelessness. This study will report in the summer of 2006 and results will be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="e.182W.0/1">The following table presents information reported by each local authority in the East of England for the past eight quarters on the number of households under homelessness legislation which were accepted as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and consequently owed a main homelessness duty. The number of acceptances in the region between October 2004 and September 2005 was 9,100, compared with 10,980 in the corresponding period 12 months before, a fall of 17 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.182W.0/2">The duty owed by the local authority is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.

	<p pid="e.185W.2/1">The New East Manchester (NEM) Urban Regeneration Company (URC) has an explicit role to co-ordinate and integrate regeneration activity across its area, including New Deal Communities and Housing Market Renewal. This has ensured that housing market renewal activity has not only been able to support the growing sub-regional economy but has also aligned with the provision of wider services and facilities which have greatly improved the quality of life of local residents.</p>
	<p pid="e.185W.2/2">The improvement of the existing stock and the development of new high quality homes has extended the range and choice of housing for those living or looking to live in this area. The result has been the growth and stabilisation of a once failed housing market&mdash;confidence has returned and prices have risen while numbers of empty homes have fallen significantly.</p>
	<p pid="e.185W.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently evaluating the investment plans from Manchester Salford Housing Market Renewal Partnership to ensure this positive work continues. In addition, the activity of the URC is currently being evaluated by Professor Michael Parkinson of John Moores University.</p>

Local areas and Government offices go through a process of informal negotiation on the possible need for such measures as part of the development of the area's LAA. Business cases for those that are to be taken forward formally are submitted to the appropriate Government Department. Information on those requests that have been agreed and denied to date is available online at <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1163512">http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1163512</a>.

None of the exemptions are subject to thresholds.</p>
	<p pid="e.190W.2/2">A full council tax bill assumes that there are at least two adults living in a dwelling. Where there is only one adult living in the dwelling the overall bill is reduced by 25 per cent. Certain people are disregarded for the purposes of calculating the household's bill. In the case of apprentices and some carers, the disregard is in part dependent on their earning less than a prescribed level of income.

	<p pid="e.191W.11/1">Following the report of the Balance of Funding Review in July 2004, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor agreed that Sir Michael Lyons should carry out an independent inquiry into local government funding to make the council tax system fairer and more sustainable. In setting up the inquiry, the Government recognised that Sir Michael was very widely respected and brought a wealth of local government and other experience to the task. In September 2005, it was agreed that his remit should be extended to consider issues of role and function before the finalisation of conclusions on funding. The Government will decide the way forward in the light of Sir Michael's final report, which he will produce at the end of 2006.</p>

In this respect, Doncaster is expected to receive something in the region of &pound;12 million of European funds between 2000 and 2008 which will be matched by national funding programmes, making a total investment of around &pound;25 million.

We also believe that the alignment of infrastructure and growth is the outcome of good planning, and for this reason both the infrastructure requirements stemming from the Sustainable Communities Plan and the level and distribution of housing growth in the South East are a matter for scrutiny and discussion as part of the development of regional spatial strategies (RSS). The responsibility for drafting regional spatial strategies rests with regional planning bodies.</p>

	<p pid="e.201W.5/1">There is a body of research, carried out over the past few years, that has highlighted how the lack of communication and partnerships between the stakeholders involved in the delivery of sustainable communities can result in poor urban environments. Key conclusions have emphasised that each party often sees their role in isolation rather than contributing to the delivery of sustainable communities. Examples of research, both directly commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and that from independent bodies, include Paving the way (ODPM and Cabe) 2002; &quot;Better Streets, Better Places&quot; (ODPM and DfT) 2003; and &quot;Egan Review of Skills&quot; (ODPM) 2004.</p>

While they are generally operating satisfactorily, we are not complacent. There is still some room for further improvement, such as in complying with timetables for the production of proofs of evidence for inquiries and statements of common ground between the main parties and in providing realistic estimates of the time likely to be required to make submissions and the number of witnesses to be called. However, where a party fails to adhere to the timetables, there is power to disregard late representations. Moreover, if that failure is unreasonable and leads to another party incurring unnecessary expense, the power to award costs also provides an effective discipline in the case of hearings and inquiries. For its part, the Planning Inspectorate is actively managing improvements to its own performance in arranging hearing and inquiry dates in the face of a continuing high level and variety of casework which places conflicting demands on the available inspector resource.</p>

However, in the light of changes to the Department's responsibilities (notably the fact that London has now won the right to stage the Olympic Games in 2012), the figure is currently being revisited.

	<p pid="e.209W.2/1">The Department's target for 2005&ndash;06 is to retain administrative spending at the level of 2004&ndash;05, with spending being reduced in subsequent years by &pound;1 million in 2006&ndash;07, and &pound;2 million in 2007&ndash;08.

Information is therefore not collected in accordance with the categories outlined in the question. NDPBs have all submitted efficiency delivery plans to the Department, which have been scrutinised to ensure that only genuine efficiencies have been included. Local authorities submit Annual Efficiency Statements that set out how they propose to make their efficiency gains. Interim data returns suggest that as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, NDPBs and local authorities had achieved efficiency gains of &pound;62.7 million, against a target for 2005&ndash;06 of &pound;87 million.</p>

The ingots would require an export licence to leave the UK. No such application has been received. Procedures to recover the silver ingots have been undertaken under the terms of a private commercial contract and have been declared in accordance with UK legislation.</p>

This has ranged from the publication of Framework for the Future, the first ever national public library strategy document in 2003 to, most recently, the letters I have sent to the Council Leaders of every library authority in England reminding them of the community value of public libraries and asking them to consider carefully what might be lost through closures.</p>

The standards already form a part of the libraries data within the Comprehensive Performance Assessment. It is envisaged that some of the Impact Measures will be a part of that framework from 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.213W.0/1">DCMS Ministers have not met the Publishers Association to discuss this issue. The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council has commissioned PWC to prepare options for models to improve the book supply chain for libraries and they are consulting a number of interested bodies including publishers to improve efficiency. DCMS expect to receive a report in the summer of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.213W.0/2">PWC have collected information from a sample of 50 authorities. The following information is based on that sample. 35 per cent. of library authorities use supplier selection for at least some of their stock. 10 per cent. of authorities have one or more stock procurement activities provided to them by other local library authorities.</p>
	<p pid="e.213W.0/3">On average, 7.6 staff per library authority are involved in some aspect of stock selection. There is a very wide range between authorities, anything from one to 37. This will be the result of a number of factors, such as size and location of library authority, systems for selection (e.g. any out-sourcing), whether done centrally or in individual branches and time spent per member of staff will vary considerably.</p>
	<p pid="e.213W.0/4">If 'standard processing' is considered to be that prescribed by the National Acquisitions Group ('NAG'), then the same survey suggests that 20 per cent. of authorities comply with NAG standards, which in turn implies that 80 per cent. of libraries employ standards that differ from those prescribed by NAG.</p>

	<p pid="e.220W.11/1">At least &pound;131 million, or 50 per cent. of the Department's efficiency target is to be cashable, with efficiency savings being reinvested in frontline services. It is for NDPBs and local authorities to decide which of their frontline services they will spend their cashable efficiency savings on. The Department is responsible for over 50 NDPBs which operate in a number of sectors. Accordingly, savings will be recycled into a wide variety of activities.</p>

	<p pid="e.233W.3/6" class="indent">This issue is currently being addressed as part of a management information improvement project, which has already begun to deliver more robust statistics in relation to cases on the new computer system. It is envisaged that the Agency will be in a position to provide constituency (and other sub-national) level figures for cases on the new computer system within the next few months, at which point they will be made available on the Department's website alongside the CSA quarterly summary of statistics.</p>

	<p pid="e.244W.5/3">We are also producing alternative versions of the Green Paper&mdash;word, braille, audio, large print, easy-read and Welsh language. People can request copies of these via our email and telephone contact points. The braille, audio and large print versions have already been distributed, and we took delivery of the Welsh language version on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.244W.5/4">It does take time to prepare the easy read version in a properly accessible format, with appropriate illustrations. The first draft of that version has been approved and the final version will be with us on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-27">27 February 2006</phrase>. Given this delay, we will respond sensibly and sensitively to individuals who require additional time to make their response. We also have a telephone helpline to provide one-to-one advice to individuals and organisations in understanding our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="e.244W.5/5">Ministers and officials worked closely with the stakeholder community over the past year in developing our proposals&mdash;we will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="e.245W.2/1">Housing benefit is not, and has never been, suspended if a tenant fails to pay their rent.</p>
	<p pid="e.245W.2/2">Currently regulations require that where a tenant in receipt of housing benefit has accrued eight weeks' or more rent arrears, benefit should then be paid direct to their landlord. Although the Department records data for the overall number of rent allowance cases where payment is direct to the landlord, we are not able to identify the reason for direct payments being made.</p>
	<p pid="e.245W.2/3">The Department has been undertaking more detailed research in those local authorities which have been testing the local housing allowance. Information collected to date suggests that around 85 per cent. of local housing allowance claims are being paid direct to the tenants. Of the 15 per cent. who are having their rent paid to the landlord, 9 per cent. are on the grounds of the tenant being assessed as unable or unlikely to pay on their own behalf and 6 per cent. on the grounds of rent arrears.</p>

	<p pid="e.247W.2/2">Sanctions could include financial penalties or housing benefit measures. We believe this would provide a very strong incentive to encourage these households to undertake rehabilitation when they have refused other offers of help.

The original programme was planned to be delivered in five waves of change (learning lessons from other programmes of change) between 2002 and 2006. The first phase of the first wave of change involving new state pension claim processes was deployed in three pension centres between August and November 2005. The next phase involving all pension centres for new customer applications for state pension and pension credit will commence July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.249W.2/37">Following re-planning of the delivery of the programme it was agreed that the three latter waves of change would be delivered more affordably over a longer period.

	<p pid="e.249W.2/79" class="indentitalic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="e.249W.2/80" class="indent">1. Expenditure on projects is formally approved by the Departments governance process and authorised through review gates. These reviews ensure that projects are meeting the standards we expect (including business change, technical and commercial criteria) before authority to progress to the next stage of their development. It is only when the reviews are complete that the next stage funding is authorised.</p>
	<p pid="e.249W.2/81" class="indent">2. Project details may alter as they pass through the project lifecycle. This may mean that the scope of a project is changed as a result of the development of a project's plans. Changes in scope may shorten the time for completion of a project or lengthen it. It may also increase or decrease the total costs of a project or change the year in which expenditure is planned to be incurred. All such changes are subject to scrutiny by the Department's governance processes and requires appropriate approvals before being adopted within the project's plans. This is more likely early in a projects lifecycle however projects later in the cycle are not immune to these changes. All of these issues are in the ordinary course for a project, but especially so for large IT based projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.249W.2/82" class="indent">3. Additionally the Department had a Private Finance Initiative contract for the provision of IT services to the Child Support Agency worth approximately &pound;456 million over 10 years. This contract commenced in August 2000 with a ten year duration to August 2010. Under a general realignment of Departmental contracts announced in August 2005, EDS will complete the system as currently specified, including correcting all agreed defects. The revised contract still has a completion date of August 2010 and the department expects to save around &pound;65 million (net present value basis) in Child Support information technology costs over the remaining period of the deal with EDS.</p>

	<p pid="e.262W.2/1">We are currently consulting on both the principle and method of a badger culling policy. No decisions have yet been made.</p>
	<p pid="e.262W.2/2">However, a review undertaken for the consultation (<a href="http://defraweb/corporate/consult/badgers-tbcontrols/index.htm">http://defraweb/corporate/consult/badgers-tbcontrols/index.htm</a>) identified sett-based fumigation, using carbon monoxide (CO) gas, as a possible feasible and humane technique. The main issue in relation to humaneness and effectiveness is that lethal concentrations of CO gas will be attained quickly throughout most parts of any sett. If that can be achieved then concerns .about sub-lethal dosing, either with CO or other contaminants in the exhaust gases, will be reduced because toxic concentrations of gas will kill quickly. Work is currently underway to assess this.</p>
	<p pid="e.262W.2/3">While some early results from this work should be available by the end of March, the delivery of the full report, with any recommendations for future work, should be ready by May 2006. If the model is validated then this will allow us to predict the risks and effectiveness of different strategies. If the model proposed in the consultation is not validated then the data from the field trials will allow determination of whether using a suitable, de-tuned, vehicle petrol engine is a viable method of producing lethal concentrations under specific circumstances. If the trial work demonstrates that lethal concentrations can be achieved through most of a sett, then there may be confidence in gassing as a technique for killing badgers during 2006. However, further work is very likely to be needed to ensure, efficient and safe mechanisms for delivery of gas. Data supporting the use of CO will also need to be submitted for approval as a vertebrate control agent. The earliest it is foreseen that this further research work could be completed would be March to May 2007.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-02-27e.50530.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-02-27e.267W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="267W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060227/text/60227w70.htm#60227w70.html_spnew4">
	<p pid="e.267W.2/1">The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in article 1 <i>(a)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD). Whether or not a substance is discarded as waste, and when waste ceases to be waste, are matters which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the definition of waste which are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.267W.2/2">The composting of waste is classified as a waste recovery operation under the WFD. This means that composting must be carried out under the terms of a waste management licence issued by, or a waste management licensing exemption registered with, the Environment Agency (England and Wales).</p>
	<p pid="e.267W.2/3">The ECJ has ruled that</p>
	<p pid="e.267W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Whether [a substance] is waste, must be determined in the light of all the circumstances, regard being had to the aim of the directive and the need to ensure that its effectiveness is not undermined.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.267W.2/5">In practice, this means that waste does not cease to be waste until it has undergone a complete recovery operation and has been fully recovered within the meaning of the WFD. A complete recovery operation is one which has the effect of transforming waste into a product which is wholly interchangeable with another product and requires no additional regulation or supervision beyond that applicable to the product which it is replacing. Waste has not undergone a complete recovery operation if, after the operation has been carried out, it continues to present a danger typical of waste (e.g. it continues to be contaminated).</p>
	<p pid="e.267W.2/6">The Environment Agency considers that <i>(a)</i> source-segregated waste which, after composting meets the relevant tests, including the achievement of a recognised and suitable quality standard (e.g. BSI PAS 100), certainty of use and no risk of pollution of the environment or harm to human health, is likely to be fully recovered within the meaning of the WFD; and <i>(b)</i> mixed waste which is composted is likely to remain waste until it is used in a further recovery operation (e.g. land treatment resulting in agricultural benefit or ecological improvement) subject to control by the Agency under a licence or registered licensing exemption. These considerations are being taken into account in work currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) on the development of a quality protocol for waste composting.</p>
	<p pid="e.267W.2/7">There is also now the prospect of similar work being undertaken at a European Union level following the publication, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-21">21 December 2005</phrase>, of the European Commission's &quot;Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste&quot; together with a proposed revision of the WFD. The proposals are available on the Commission's website at <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/waste/strategv.htm">http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/waste/strategv.htm</a> and include, in the draft revised WFD, a provision which would enable the adoption of environmental and quality criteria for specified waste streams. Where these criteria are met, the effect would be to deem that the recovery of the specified waste had been completed and that it had ceased to be waste. The Commission's &quot;Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste&quot; proposes that the waste streams addressed by this system should include compost.</p>
	<p pid="e.267W.2/8">The Department supports the development of protocols at national level and advocates the development of similar work at a European Union level. A key objective of our doing so is to enable our competent authorities, and those engaged in the recovery of waste, to determine with a high degree of certainty the point at which waste has been fully recovered for the purposes of the WFD and has ceased to be waste.</p>

All member states have, we understand, transposed the directive as required. In the UK, parts of the directive (including the recovery and recycling targets) are implemented through the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005. Our system differs from most other member states, since we are only one of three countries which enables packaging producers to acquire evidence notes to demonstrate compliance with the recovery and recycling targets in the packaging and packaging waste directive.</p>

	<p pid="e.275W.6/2">I understand that J E Wilson and Sons was not carrying out its statutory packaging waste recovery and recycling obligations under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations, and that enforcement action was taken by the Environment Agency who monitor compliance and enforce these regulations. Any fines will have been imposed by the courts and there is no question of any such costs being repaid by the Environment Agency.</p>

	<p pid="e.277W.3/1">The Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) is a Defra programme designed to assist local authorities (LA's) achieve EC Landfill targets for Biodegradable Municipal Waste. The Programme offers LA's various toolkits and advice and aims to promote the Waste Hierarchy as set out in the Waste Strategy (Minimisation, Reuse, Recycle, Recovery, Landfill). Minimisation lies at the top of the tree with landfill at the bottom. Recycling plays an important part in the diversion process and as such LA's are encouraged to examine recycling possibilities, which enable them to meet their targets which in turn allows them to avoid penalties under the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS).</p>
	<p pid="e.277W.3/2">WIP achieves this through a number of levers. For example WIP has recently run a series of Efficiency Roadshows designed to spread best practice (including in the recycling field) and to encourage LA's to consider the greater use of partnership working.</p>
	<p pid="e.277W.3/3">From 2002&ndash;03 to 2005&ndash;06 the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund has distributed over &pound;275 million to local authorities across England to improve their waste minimisation, recycling and composting performance. This has been through a competitive process whereby bids have to be approved before the monies released. London authorities received &pound;45.45 million from the overall pot through a scheme administered by London Waste Action.</p>
	<p pid="e.277W.3/4">In 2005&ndash;06 there has been further financial help available to local authorities through the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant. This is an un-ringfenced grant whereby the money can be spent on any service not just waste. &pound;40 million was available in 2005&ndash;06 and this will rise to &pound;105 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;110 million in 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="e.277W.3/5">PFI offers financial support to LA's for the development of long term waste processing infrastructure, such as Energy from Waste facilities. In the Spending Review (SR) 2002 (covering the period 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06) Defra was allocated &pound;355 million towards the funding of waste PFI projects. The SR 2004 (covering the period 2006&ndash;07 to 2008&ndash;09) allocated an additional &pound;275 million of PFI credits for waste PFI projects, over and above the &pound;355 million available from the 2002 Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="e.277W.3/6">WIP also encourages LA's to consider collaborations with the Community and Voluntary sectors who have recognised expertise in the reuse and recycling fields.</p>
	<p pid="e.277W.3/7">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) uses Defra funding to carry out a number of activities in the minimisation, reuse, and recycling sectors. One important area relates to Education and WRAP have run the very successful &quot;Recycle Now&quot; campaign which raises public awareness of the benefits of recycling. WRAP have also managed a Home Composting campaign which provides information on composting to LA's and the general public and offers LA's composting bins at reduced prices for distribution to householders.</p>

	<p pid="e.279W.5/1">The Government recognises the importance of encouraging companies to enter the recycling industry and is aware that business may face challenges doing so. Since it began work in 2001 the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has had a positive impact in working with business to remove barriers to developing recycling markets and products. WRAP engages with producers, purchasers and investors and has developed both advisory services and guidance to support business entering the field of the recycling industry. For example, WRAP'S Business Development Service (BDS) is a free service for SME recycling businesses which provides a range of practical help and guidance, giving businesses the opportunity to maximise their chances of securing commercial finance. The BDS has a proven track record of success doing this; in the last four years it has helped raise over &pound;6 million for 15 businesses. Other support services which WRAP provides include the UK's first venture capital fund dedicated to the recycling sector, equipment leasing guarantees, intellectual property rights awareness, and training and investment opportunities. These programmes offer companies support for growth, innovation and increased investment in the recycling industry.</p>

We are concerned at the apparent impunity from the rule of law of some of those alleged to be responsible for serious violations of human rights. We have made clear to the Colombian Government that the law must be applied fairly and impartially to all citizens.

	<p pid="e.292W.8/1">We have consistently maintained that a solution to the armed conflict in Colombia can only be achieved through a negotiated settlement between the illegal armed groups and the Colombian Government. We have called for the illegal armed groups to refrain from violence, to release the hostages they hold and to engage in talks with the Government. We have been funding training within the armed forces to improve human rights awareness, and have supported projects to strengthen the protection available to vulnerable communities and to improve the state's ability to monitor assistance and support given to displaced populations.</p>
	<p pid="e.292W.8/2">The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council Conclusions of October 2005 set out the steps the EU is willing to take to facilitate the search for peace in Colombia. These include support to communities affected by the internal conflict, victims groups, local reconciliation activities, and the integration into society of former child soldiers, complementing existing programmes developed by United Nations Children's Fund and others.</p>

	<p pid="e.293W.2/1">One of the principal objectives of our embassy in Bogota is to promote human rights in Colombia, working with our partners. We regularly draw to the attention of the Colombian authorities specific human rights cases. We also support a range of projects aimed at improving human rights. These include training for judges in international humanitarian law, work to combat the sexual abuse of children, and help to build up the state's human rights alert mechanisms. We also actively support the role of civil society in seeking to address the country's problems. The EU has made it plain in the General Affairs and External Relations Council Conclusions of October 2005 that the rights of victims of the internal armed conflict must be respected in the search for a solution. Human rights will remain at the heart of our policy towards Colombia.</p>

We welcome the intention of the Organisation of American States and others to monitor the process.</p>

	<p pid="e.293W.8/1">Torture is a serious problem in Colombia, a country that has suffered from over 40 years of internal armed conflict which causes serious human rights abuses, internal displacement of the civilian population and poverty. A significant driver of the conflict is the trade in illegal drugs. Illegal armed groups are responsible for many cases of torture. We are aware that there are also allegations of torture by the Colombian security forces. We regularly bring to the attention of the Colombian government specific human rights cases, including where torture is suspected, and will continue to do so. Where there is credible evidence of wrong-doing, the Colombian government is obliged to take appropriate action.</p>

The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is a set of politically-binding minimum common standards which control the international trade in rough diamonds, as well as stipulating various levels of transparency, monitoring and co-operation between participants. Under the terms of the Peer Review Mechanism within the KPCS, a Review Visit has been carried out in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Togo, while ad-hoc missions have been carried out in Liberia and specific monitoring measures are in place with regard to the conflict diamond situation in Cote d'Ivoire. These measures, together with those being undertaken via the three-year review process for the KPCS that is due to report in July 2006, have provided the KPCS, and the participants thereof, with an assessment of the impact of the Kimberley Process in addressing the issue of conflict diamonds upon West African economies. Sanctions have also proved a useful tool in restricting the flow of conflict diamonds.</p>

Mostly these are localised but some clashes have a wider impact on the peace process. Recent fighting between the DRC army and rebels in North Kivu and North Katanga has had an impact on civilians, who have suffered abuses by all sides. Thousands have been displaced.</p>

The robust approach taken by the UN Organisation Mission in the DRC to tackling these groups and protecting civilians was endorsed and underlined by UN Security Council Resolution 1653, adopted in January 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.296W.2/1">The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has the ultimate responsibility to protect civilians in its territory. But years of civil war and decades of misrule have damaged the Government's ability to offer that protection. As well as rebel groups, unpaid and poorly-trained Congolese soldiers are also a threat to the civilians that they are supposed to protect. Reforming the army and security sector is therefore a high priority. The UK is working on this bilaterally and through providing experts to the EU army and police reform missions in DRC. The UN mission in DRC, with strong UK support, plays a key role both in protecting civilians and through its robust military action, often supporting Congolese military efforts, to neutralise the armed groups operating on DRC territory. The UK has allocated &pound;55 million of bilateral support to DRC this financial year, part of which will support local civil society organisations.</p>

	<p pid="e.296W.5/1">British representatives in the Great Lakes region regularly discuss the security situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its border areas with the Governments to which they are accredited. We remind them of the need to respect Congolese territorial sovereignty and to work together to resolve the issue of the foreign armed groups in the region. We underline that there must be no external support for Congolese armed groups that try to disrupt the peace process and that the DRC must take action to deal with the armed groups on its soil. UN Security Council Resolution 1653 reinforced this message. We support the US-facilitated Tripartite Plus Commission which brings Ugandan, Rwandan, Burundian and Congolese Foreign Ministers together to find solutions to issues affecting the region.</p>

	<p pid="e.300W.2/1">It is a condition of employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have the legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore makes provision to help staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations in two circumstances:</p>
	<p pid="e.300W.2/2">Children who accompany their parents on postings overseas are expected to use free state schooling if it is available locally and is of a suitable standard. But at posts where no suitable schooling is available free-of-charge locally, education fees can be refunded to enable children to receive the education they would be entitled to in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.300W.2/3">With staff moving every 12&ndash;48 months and education facilities at posts' locations overseas varying, continuity of education can be problematic particularly during the important exam years. The FCO also enables children to board at school in the UK while their parents remain subject to the worldwide mobility obligation.</p>
	<p pid="e.300W.2/4">The FCO has paid school fees for children of approximately 1,100 members of staff over the last 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="e.304W.8/1">According to Iran's latest declarations to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the only method of fissile material production Iran is now pursuing is centrifuge enrichment and the associated production of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) feed material by uranium conversion. In August 2005 Iran began large scale conversion activities. In February 2006 Iran resumed centrifuge enrichment on a small scale, and announced its intention to pursue commercial scale enrichment activities. If Iran were to master centrifuge enrichment technologies, it would be in a position to produce high enriched uranium suitable for use in nuclear weapons. We assess that it has not yet done so.</p>
	<p pid="e.304W.8/2">The IAEA has reported that Iran has in its possession a document describing the procedures for the reduction of UF6 to uranium metal in small quantities, and the casting of enriched and depleted uranium metal into hemispheres, which can be used as nuclear weapon components. Iran has not so far explained satisfactorily its possession of this document. Information has also been made available to the IAEA concerning possible Iranian work on the design of a missile re-entry vehicle which could have a military nuclear dimension.

	<p pid="e.305W.2/1">All goods on the UK Military List require a licence to be exported from the UK under the Export Control Act 2002. Trade controls implemented under this Act (in March 2004 and May 2004) have also made trafficking and brokering in military equipment between overseas countries a licensable activity where any part of the activity takes place in the UK. The Government has also implemented extraterritorial controls (i.e. applying to the activities of UK persons anywhere in the world, as well as to activities carried out within the UK by persons of any nationality). These controls cover any act calculated to promote the supply or delivery of military goods from an overseas country to destinations subject to non-binding UN sanctions and full scope EU, Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe or UK arms embargoes. This includes Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="e.305W.2/2">General trade sanctions against Iraq were revoked by the UN Security Council resolution 1483 (<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May 2003</phrase>), implemented in UK legislation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-14">14 June 2003</phrase> by the Iraq (United Nations Sanctions) Order 2003 [S.I. 2003/1519]. The embargo on arms and related material was retained, with exemptions. All licences granted for exports to Iraq fall within the exemptions to the arms embargo imposed by the UN Security Council resolutions 1483 (<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May 2003</phrase>) and 1546 (<phrase class="date" code="2004-06-08">8 June 2004</phrase>), because they were required by the Coalition Provisional Authority, the Government of Iraq or the Multinational Force to serve the purpose of the resolutions.</p>
	<p pid="e.305W.2/3">Details of all licences approved by the Government for the export of military equipment to Iraq are contained within the Annual and Quarterly Reports on UK Strategic Export Controls. Copies are available at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a> or from the Library of the House. Information on licences issued to specific entities cannot be placed in the public domain owing to commercial confidentiality. However, the Government provides the House's Quadripartite Committee on Strategic Export Controls with a confidential report containing enhanced licensing information on Iraq to enable them comprehensively to scrutinise Government licensing decisions.</p>

	<p pid="e.308W.8/1">We are deeply concerned at the situation of political activists and journalists in Iran. The Iranian authorities impose significant restrictions on freedom of expression. Numerous prisoners of conscience, such as Akbar Ganji and his lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, remain in detention. In addition, many journalists and webloggers have been held in the past year, including Mojtaba Saminejad and Arash Sigarchi. We are unable to produce reliable estimates of the total numbers who have been held, and the Iranian authorities do not issue official statistics. In addition to those who have been detained, many journalists and human rights defenders have been intimidated. Ministers and senior officials have pressed the Iranian authorities on many occasions to address international concerns in this area.</p>
	<p pid="e.308W.8/2">Evidence of human rights violations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is difficult to validate given the closed nature of the DPRK regime. This is why the UK and the rest of the international community continue to press the DPRK to engage with United Nations human rights mechanisms and allow international monitors to inspect prison camps.</p>

	<p pid="e.309W.2/1">In Iran, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms has deteriorated over the past few years. International NGOs report that more juvenile offenders were executed in 2005 than in any recent year. The unelected Guardians Council disqualified large numbers of candidates from standing in parliamentary elections in February 2004 and the presidential election in May 2005. Freedom of expression and freedom of association have been seriously restricted, and human rights defenders, journalists, trade unionists and members of religious and ethnic minorities have been detained for peacefully expressing their political views. Ministers and officials press the Iranian authorities on these concerns very frequently, both bilaterally and through the European Union (EU). All EU member states co-sponsored a resolution on human rights in Iran at the United Nations General Assembly in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.309W.2/2">We also share the international community's serious concerns about reports of human rights violations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on human rights in the DPRK in November 2005 by a large majority. Together with our international partners, we continue to request the DPRK authorities to allow independent monitors access to the country to verify or disprove reports of violations.</p>
	<p pid="e.309W.2/3">We raise human rights issues regularly with the DPRK authorities via our embassy in Pyongyang and the DPRK's embassy in London. During his visit to Pyongyang in September 2004, my hon. Friend, the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Bill Rammell, urged the North Korean authorities to allow a visit by the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the DPRK, which they continue to refuse to do. In his January 2006 report on the human rights situation in the DPRK, the Special Rapporteur noted major challenges in regard to the rights to food and to life, the rights to security of the person and to humane treatment, the rights to freedom of movement, asylum and refugee protection, and various political and other rights such as self-determination and freedom of expression, association and religion.</p>

	<p pid="e.312W.5/1">The Government, through its embassy in Rwanda, has regular discussions with the Rwandan Government about security. The Rwandan Government is committed at the highest levels to protecting survivors from threats or violence. The Rwanda National Police has assured us that it investigates all allegations of crimes against genocide survivors and witnesses involved in genocide related &quot;gacaca&quot; trials. The &quot;gacaca&quot; criminal justice system requires that witnesses should be able to come forward in safety. It is therefore in the Government of Rwanda's interest to investigate all allegations of witness intimidation. However a full witness protection programme would be near impossible with over 750,000 cases.</p>

	<p pid="e.313W.2/1">There have been some reports that survivors of the Rwanda genocide have been violently targeted and intimidated by perpetrators of the genocide. But there is little evidence to suggest that those who were imprisoned because of their involvement in the genocide and have since been freed through the prisoner amnesty are particularly likely to carry out such attacks. The Rwandan National Police has assured us that any violent offence would be dealt with by the Rwandan justice system. The Rwandan Government is committed at the highest levels to protecting survivors and witnesses in the &quot;gacaca&quot; traditional justice process from threats or violence.</p>

	<p pid="e.313W.5/1">In the 12 years since the genocide, Rwanda has made impressive efforts at reconciliation and reconstruction. Reconciliation is central to government policy. The Rwanda National Unity and Reconciliation Commission works with different groups to educate the population and promote reconciliation. And the Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Commission holds re-education with a strong reconciliation theme in camps for returnees from the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
	<p pid="e.313W.5/2">Perhaps the greatest progress the Government of Rwanda has made to ensure national reconciliation has been to provide an environment of peace and security and by establishing the basis for economic development and poverty reduction. However, there are growing international concerns about increasing government charges of &quot;divisionism&quot; and &quot;genocidal ideology&quot; against individuals. These potentially impact on national and local reconciliation.</p>

	<p pid="e.318W.5/1">In March 2005 the African Union (AU) adopted a Roadmap for the Operationalisation of the African Stand-by Force (ASF). This commits the AU to establish the ASF based on five regional brigades, able to deploy complex peacekeeping missions by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.318W.5/2">The first stage of the ASF Roadmap involves the creation of Planning Elements at the AU Headquarters in Addis Ababa, and in each of the five regions to provide the AU with strategic level management capacity to co-deploy with the UN on observer missions. With the support of the UK and other international partners, the Planning Elements in East and West Africa have already been set up and are now completing recruitment. Progress is also being made by the AU in Addis Ababa and by the Southern brigade. Structures for the Central and Northern brigades are not yet as advanced.</p>
	<p pid="e.318W.5/3">In parallel the AU, in collaboration with the Sub-Regional Organisations, is leading on the development of ASF policy in key military disciplines. Each region has been tasked with running one of five Technical Workshops covering Doctrine; Standard Operating Procedures; Command, Control, Communications and Information Systems; Logistics; and Training and Evaluation. Preparatory meetings were held in January and the Workshops are scheduled to take place over the next few months. The UK and our International Partners are providing technical and financial support to this process.</p>
	<p pid="e.318W.5/4">The UK is fully committed to supporting the AU in the implementation of the ASF Roadmap. During our presidencies of the G8 and EU in 2005, the UK worked hard to ensure that specific commitments on the ASF were included in the G8 Communique and the EU Strategy for Africa, and we will continue to work with our G8, EU and African partners, towards achieving these goals.</p>

	<p pid="e.319W.5/1">A rapid deployment capability for the UN was recommended in the Brahimi report on UN peacekeeping reform in 2000. Since then a number of working groups set up under the UN General Assembly, have studied the different options which may be available to the UN. The UN World Summit of September 2005 supported the further development of those options. The three options currently being considered by the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and outlined in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-02-14.1908W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1908W</phrase>, continue to be developed, but are already being applied to an extent in practice.</p>
	<p pid="e.319W.5/2">The timing of development of rapid deployment capabilities by regional organisations will vary from one organisation to another. The EU provided such a capability in support of the UN in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003. The first standing EU battlegroup, available for rapid deployment in appropriate circumstances, was declared operational in January 2005. Full operational capacity of the EU battlegroup concept is due to be reached by 2007. The African Union plan to have capacity to manage complex peacekeeping operations by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.319W.5/3">Flexible arrangements allowing the redeployment of troops between UN missions began this year between missions in Liberia, Cote D'Ivoire and Sierra Leone and provide a model that can be built upon in the future as appropriate where missions are in close proximity and where the appropriate capacities exist.</p>
	<p pid="e.319W.5/4">The provision of a short term capability by one or more individual countries is still in the concept stage and there is no clear time-scale for this, although some arrangements already exist, such as the Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade established in 1996.</p>
	<p pid="e.319W.5/5">The further development of these three options and the appropriate balance between them will be further considered by the UN General Assembly's Special Committee on Peacekeeping in March. The Committee's deliberations and subsequent report will provide DPKO with guidance on how best to develop these options in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.324W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the national statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-27">27 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning progress on the implementation of the Allsopp report on regional economic indicators. (52742)</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/4" class="indent">A programme of work has been developed to take forward the report's recommendations. The following progress has been achieved to date:</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/5" class="indent">A regional breakdown of usual hours worked statistics was introduced to the Regional Labour Market First Release in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/6" class="indent">The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings was introduced in October 2004 to replace the New Earnings Survey providing more reliable estimates and allowing the production of time series from 1998 to 2004. It also includes for the first time explicit measures of quality which help users appreciate better the error margins in regional figures.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/7" class="indent">Regional Prices, based on a full survey conducted in 2004, were published in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/8" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) continues to develop the Neighbourhood Statistics Service (NeSS), with more employment and local business data now available.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/9" class="indent">In order to improve public sector coverage in the Workforce Jobs Survey, a project was undertaken during 2005 aiming to include data from the new quarterly Public Sector Employment Survey in the workforce jobs system. These quality improvements were made in the figures published in December 2005 nationally and in regional releases in January 2006 when a public/private table was also included in the Labour Market first release.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/10" class="indent">ONS published in 2005 estimates of Volume Indices of Capital Services (VICS) to support productivity work with better asset definition. New estimates of IT software investment will be published in February 2006 to support revisions to national accounts assets measures in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/11" class="indent">Business Data Linking has been developed both as a tool for use by ONS and as a resource for researchers.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/12" class="indent">Considerable progress is being made towards National Statistics status for the Index of Services (IOS) as a whole. Industry level aggregates are subject to an ongoing review; three industries were upgraded in November 2005; and decisions on a further seven will be announced in March 2006. The remainder will be reviewed over the course of 2006 and the status for the IOS as a whole will be assessed at the start of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/13" class="indent">In addition, we continue to address other aspects of the imbalance between manufacturing and service sectors; this will be in part through the EU who have committed to addressing these imbalances on a EU wide scale (building on work here was an initiative of the UK EU Presidency last year).</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/14" class="indent">Overall, the critical path for delivery of the programme flows from the development of the design of the business surveys to the development and expansion of new and improved surveys, followed by the processing and analysis to produce the new Regional Accounts. Hence, development of the business register and initial work to develop business surveys are early projects that began in 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/15" class="indent">Work on investigating the suitability of administrative data sources to supplement or substitute for business survey data, as well as initial regional accounts development work, are other important early projects we are taking forward in parallel in order to inform the future development of business surveys.</p>
	<p pid="e.324W.2/16" class="indent">As part of the Pre-Budget Report, the Financial Secretary made an announcement which states that RDAs have agreed to work in partnership with ONS including providing some funding, to deliver a full regional statistical presence by Match 2007&quot;. Plans are in place to create a statistical presence in the regions by March 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.325W.2/3">Since 2001, a total of nearly &pound;80 million has been frozen in the UK, although a large proportion was returned to the legitimate Government of Afghanistan. The legislation does not permit the disclosure of amounts frozen for individual entities.</p>
	<p pid="e.325W.2/4">Freezing action also prevents the flow of funds to listed individuals and entities. Asset freezing is part of the Government's overall strategy to create a hostile environment for terrorism and to safeguard the integrity of financial systems.</p>

	<p pid="e.325W.8/1">The latest figures from LINK, the UK's ATM network, show in December 2005 there were 33,000 free ATMs and 25,000 surcharging ATMs across the UK. There are approximately 4,380 free ATMS and 3,020 surcharging ATMs within the M25 boundary.</p>

	<p pid="e.332W.2/1">It is not Government practice to publish exact forecasts of the contributions and receipts of other member states, as this could prejudice the UK's relations with these states. This is a matter for their respective Governments. The Government do, however, publish qualitative indications of member states' contributions and receipts where such information is widely available.</p>
	<p pid="e.332W.2/2">As around 75 per cent. of the Own Resources System that finances the EC budget is funded by member states GNI contributions, most member states make roughly the same contribution to the budget of around 1 per cent. of GNI. The exceptions to this are: Belgium, which pays a disproportionate share of Traditional Own Resources (customs duties, agricultural duties and sugar levies which account for around 10 per cent. of the Own Resources System) because of the port of Antwerp; and Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and the UK which benefit from corrections that lower their contributions to the EC budget.</p>

Based on the European Commission's forecasts and assumptions, and using the Financial Perspective table agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-17">17 December 2005</phrase>, Treasury estimates that the largest recipients (those that receive significantly more than they contribute) are: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Those that receive more than they contribute are: Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, Spain and Slovenia.

	<p pid="e.334W.2/2">In order to meet the Government's aims to see an increase in the capacity of money advice for financially excluded individuals, the Government have allocated &pound;45 million of the &pound;120 million Financial Inclusion Fund to the Department of Trade and Industry to support an increase in the provision of free face-to-face money advice. In addition, &pound;6 million of the Fund has been allocated to the Department of Constitutional Affairs to pilot methods of money advice outreach aimed at those who do not normally present themselves to debt advisers.</p>

These are based mainly on data from the International Passenger Survey (IPS), which is supplemented with data on flows to and from the Republic of Ireland. Other data sources allow for adjustments for asylum seekers and their dependants not counted by the IPS, and for switchers (people who change their intentions and, therefore, their migratory status).</p>
	<p pid="e.337W.2/5" class="indent">As a sample survey, the IPS is unable to produce direct estimates of international migration below the level of Government Office Region in England. Therefore, no National Statistics estimates of international migration flows exist for local authorities or Parliamentary constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="e.337W.2/6" class="indent">However, in order to calculate the population estimates it is necessary to estimate the component of population change due to international migration for each local authority. These components are estimated in as robust a manner as possible given available data sources. They are not National Statistics and are fit only for certain purposes, such as to enable understanding of population estimates and population modelling.</p>
	<p pid="e.337W.2/7" class="indent">For both the year to mid-2003 and the year to mid-2004, the estimate of total international migration into the London Borough of Havering is marginally over 1,000 people.</p>

	<p pid="e.340W.2/1">The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) is unable to provide figures for mis-selling cases only, as they record their data for cases received by product type, rather than complaint type. The average time taken by the FOS to resolve all complaints about pension products is 8.5 months.</p>
	<p pid="e.340W.2/2">The time taken by the FOS to resolve cases depends largely on whether the consumer and the firm both agree at an early stage to any recommendation or informal settlement that we may suggest, or whether either the consumer or the firm request the formal process. Factors that can affect the time taken by the FOS to resolve complaints include the complexity of cases, the volume of cases in a particular product area and the time taken by both firms and consumers to respond to inquiries.</p>

	<p pid="e.342W.2/4" class="indent">Following the 2001 Census for England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) undertook an extensive programme of work to investigate the reasons for the difference between the 2001 Census and the mid-year population estimates (MYEs) at both national and local authority levels. This program of work included a series of local authority studies carried out in 2004 which were designed to improve the MYEs in the areas that proved hardest to count in the Census. The results of these studies showed that better estimates of the population could be made in 15 areas and an adjustment was made to the MYEs in these areas. For the rest of the country, including the eight local authorities in Staffordshire, it was found that the 2001 Census-based population estimate remains the best estimate of the population. A full report on these Local Authority Studies can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf">www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf</a></p>

(53447)</p>
	<p pid="e.343W.0/4" class="indent">The table attached provides the information you have requested. The most recent population estimates for wards are for mid-2002. The closest available geography to current electoral wards for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards The CAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care.</p>
	<p pid="e.343W.0/5" class="indent">The table contains CAS ward electorate counts for December 2002 and 2004. The ward electorate counts are for parliamentary electors, including attainers.</p>
	<p pid="e.343W.0/6" class="indent">The 2002 electorate counts are given for comparison with the population estimates, the latest available electorate counts are for 2004. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>
	<p pid="e.343W.0/7" class="indent">Patient register figures for July 2002 and July 2004 are included in the table. The 2002 patient register figures are given for comparison with the population estimates, the latest available patient register counts are for 2004.</p>
	<p pid="e.343W.0/8" class="indent">It should be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons. Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differentia impact from place to place.</p>

(53612)</p>
	<p pid="e.345W.2/4" class="indent">Population estimates are calculated using an internationally respected methodology. Further information can be found in the detailed methodology guide Making a population estimate in England and Wales&quot;. This is published here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product. asp?vlnk=575</a></p>
	<p pid="e.345W.2/5" class="indent">It is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate the size of the population because of changes in society, which include increased mobility and different living arrangements. The decennial Census provides a benchmark against which national and sub-national population estimates can be assessed. Substantial work has been done on the difference between mid-year population estimates and the 2001 Census. This work is summarised in the final report of the 2004 Local Authority Population Studies, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="e.345W.2/6" class="indent">These studies confirmed that the 2001 Census had worked well in most areas, including Aberavon and Neath Port Talbot, but there were a few cases where the adjustment for under-enumeration was not able to adjust sufficiently for exceptional circumstances. This work, together with revised international migration estimates, accounted for a large proportion of the initial 1.1 million difference between mid year estimates and the Census; reducing the difference to a little over 0.2 million</p>
	<p pid="e.345W.2/7" class="indent">In addition, extensive annual quality assurance is undertaken in order to ensure the accuracy of the annual mid-year estimates. Quality assurance starts with detailed checking of the source data used in the components of change (birth, deaths, etc.). Procedures are then in place to ensure that these data sources are correctly processed when deriving the estimates. The calculated national and sub-national estimates, for all 376 local authorities in England and Wales, are then subject to a further set of quality assurance procedures before they are published. These procedures include reviews of sex ratios and age profiles, comparisons of change over time, and comparisons of fertility and mortality rates. Substantial effort has already been undertaken, in recent years, to improve the quality assurance of population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="e.345W.2/8" class="indent">ONS is also now investing substantially in a project to Improve Migration and Population Statistics (IMPS). (More information on this project can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a>). The key aims of this project are to reduce the size of the difference between the 2011 Census results and the mid-year estimates and to better understand any difference that does remain. As part of this project, we are developing a data comparator tool to enable us to compare the annual mid-year estimates against a range of administrative sources. This work is ongoing and the results will inform our understanding of the accuracy of the mid-year population estimates. The tool was trialled in the mid-2004 population estimates, which were published in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.345W.2/9" class="indent">Another strand of the IMPS project is a review of the quality assurance procedures that are currently in place for population estimates. One of the aims of this review is to assess what improvements can be made to existing procedures, and determine whether additional quality assurance is required.</p>
	<p pid="e.345W.2/10" class="indent">ONS also produces population projections for each local authority area. The methodology used in the production of the subnational population projections is an established and recognised methodology. Subnational population projections undergo extensive quality assurance before publication. In addition, local authorities and health authorities are consulted on the first year of migration assumptions used as the baseline trend for migration.</p>
	<p pid="e.345W.2/11" class="indent">Population estimates and projections are supplied to the ODPM. I understand that ODPM make checks to ensure that the data as provided by the ONS have been correctly entered into their calculations for allocating <i>Formula Grant</i> to local authorities. Otherwise, they do not make any assessment of accuracy of the data supplied, as this responsibility lies with the ONS.</p>

However the direct revenue effect of a single 20 per cent. corporation tax rate can be determined approximately from Table 5 of the 2005 Tax Ready Reckoner located at <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/FA1/96/pbr05_taxreadyreckoner_223.pdf">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/FA1/96/pbr05_taxreadyreckoner_223.pdf</a> which shows the effect of 1 percentage point changes in the small companies' and main rates of corporation tax.</p>

There is a difficult but important distinction to be made between organised and localised IRA criminality. The issue is whether the IRA is living up to the commitments the organisation made last summer. The latest report from the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) shows that there have been significant changes in criminal activity associated with IRA. The IMC keeps the issue of ongoing criminality under careful review and its next report is due in April.</p>

	<p pid="e.382W.5/2">There are a number of exchange training initiatives currently in existence within the PSNI including the senior leadership development programme at Bramshill and the Scottish Police College senior leadership development programme at Tulliallan. Modules of some of these courses are also taken in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/3">I am advised that officers from the PSNI combined operational training unit have delivered training to UK police officers in the following specific disciplines:</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/4" class="indent">National firearms instructors;</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/5" class="indent">Close protection unit;</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/6" class="indent">Post-incident managers; and</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/7" class="indent">National method of entry instructor.</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/8">Likewise, the PSNI have sent students to UK police services to receive training in:</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/9" class="indent">Silver Firearms Command&mdash;West Mercia;</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/10" class="indent">Bronze Firearms Command&mdash;Devon and Cornwall;</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/11" class="indent">National public order tactical trainer&mdash;Greater Manchester police and Metropolitan police; and</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/12" class="indent">Driver and traffic training disciplines&mdash;Surrey</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/13">The Police College of Northern Ireland and Scottish Police College co-designed and deliver the leadership in counter terrorism course which has participants from across the UK and Canada. In addition training staff from the Police College of Northern Ireland deliver training in serious crime/intelligence matters to officers at the Scottish Police College.</p>
	<p pid="e.382W.5/14">The Police College of Northern Ireland also facilitates UK services to observe training courses held in Northern Ireland for the purpose of sharing good practice, for example, Merseyside, Strathclyde and Fife constabularies observed public order training. All of these examples include the exchange of training materials, which in its broadest sense includes information, experience and personnel.</p>

The main reason is that the current tests have limited accuracy and so follow up procedures could cause harm to healthy men. Men with prostate cancer symptoms are encouraged to seek early advice from their GP. They may ask for a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test. However, to enable them to make an informed decision about the PSA test, they need to know about its limitations and the potential side effects which may occur following surgery, these include incontinence and impotence.</p>

	<p pid="e.390W.2/1">The Police Service of Northern Ireland do not hold this information on a central record. A large number of police departments would have applied for search warrants in any given geographical area, including for example DCU crime teams and CID officers, senior investigating officers investigating crimes outside the area whose investigation leads to a location within it, and C1 and C2 departments investigating organised and serious crime. To obtain the details sought would therefore involve a manual trawl of records.</p>

In all cases the offences were committed over 15 years ago, in one case the offence was against a minor and involved a girl who was just under age; in the other two cases the offence was against an adult female. In each case the employing authority knew of the conviction through the pre-employment check and took professional advice. The advice was, in each case, that the person was not a risk to children, and so employment was offered. The employing authorities remain satisfied that these persons do not pose a risk to children and they are still in employment.</p>

Most other pupils attending special schools may attend any suitable school and these are usually much nearer to their homes.

	<p pid="e.396W.8/1">It is not possible to give the community background of the 10 staff who have been dismissed by the Department for Social Development over the last five years as it is the policy of the Northern Ireland Civil Service to withhold statistical data where there are less than 10 Protestants or 10 Roman Catholics. This is to ensure that the religious background of any individual cannot be inferred from the data, and is in line with the policy of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.</p>

This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>

	<p pid="e.409W.0/26">The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.</p>

	<p pid="e.409W.0/28">As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&ndash;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.</p>

This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data.

This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>

	<p pid="e.419W.3/2">The NHS care records service (NHS CRS) is at the core of the national programme for information technology in the national health service, which is being delivered by the NHS Connecting for Health Agency. Initial implementation of the NHS CRS has involved creation of a personal demographic service to contain personal identity details of patients, and the necessary security and access controls. These, together with significant physical elements, are now substantially in place, including the key broadband links to support the service, to which 98 per cent. of general practitioners' practices are already connected. The impact of the service is beginning to be felt more and more widely across the NHS, and there are already over 180,000 registered NHS users in England.</p>
	<p pid="e.419W.3/3">The capacity and functionality of the NHS CRS will build up gradually over time as new components are added and roll out continues. This year we expect to see further system changes to support the growing number and types of transactions, with full enabling capability provided in 2007. NHS Connecting for Health is aiming to achieve substantial integration of health and social care information systems in England under the national programme by 2010, though we anticipate that additional local systems will continue to be developed and deployed thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="e.435W.5/1">For many years, patient organisations have sought improvements in the domiciliary oxygen service, which has seen little change over the past 50 years. The Department asked the Royal College of Physicians to lead a multi-disciplinary working group, which reported in 1999, to review the clinical assessment and prescribing of oxygen therapy in the home. Following a further review, we announced plans for change in June 2003. Patient organisations have contributed to the specification for the new service&mdash;as patients want better access to modern equipment that can help improve their quality of life, including portable systems that enable them to leave the home. These are important features of the new service.</p>
	<p pid="e.435W.5/2">The majority of organisations representing health care professionals and the national health service were also in favour of arrangements in which a single supplier provides all home oxygen needs, replacing the fragmented service in which community pharmacies deliver the cylinder service and other organisations provide other services.</p>

For data at primary care trust (PCT) level, prescriptions written by a GP practice located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside that PCT will be included in the PCT in which the GP practice is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals /clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some British National Formulary sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community.</p>

This can be found on the borderline products page of the MHRA's website at <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>. Advice and information on the status of a product is available without charge from the medicines borderline section of the MHRA and no costs to industry have been identified on issues relating to product classification. The MHRA has held no recent meetings with industry to discuss difficulties of product classification in relation to Directive 2004/24/EC. However, the MHRA has held around 60 meetings with individual companies to discuss their initial plans for registering products under the directive. In these meetings where companies have expressed any doubt as to the status of their products they have been advised to seek further specific advice from the MHRA borderline section.</p>
	<p pid="e.445W.2/3">We do not envisage that an extension to the food supplements directive would of itself affect whether products are classified as medicines since that decision is made on the basis of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC.</p>

This report is freely available on the HPA's website at: <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/hiv_and_sti/epidemiology/August_2005_waiting_times_report.pdf">www.hpa. org.uk/infections/topics_az/hiv_and_sti/epidemiology/August_2005_waiting_times_report.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="e.448W.18/2">In addition, sexual health and access to genitor-urinary clinics is one of the six top priorities for the NHS in 2006&ndash;07. By 2008 everyone should be offered an appointment within 48 hours of contacting a GUM clinic. Strategic health authorities have all submitted plans to meet this target.</p>

	<p pid="e.452W.11/1">The redefinition of the director of public health role refers to the greater emphasis on close working with local authorities (LAs) and to the expectation of an increase in joint appointments of directors of public health, between primary care trusts (PCTs) and LAs.</p>
	<p pid="e.452W.11/2">The role of the director of public health will be strengthened by a responsibility to bring public health resources to bear across the public sector to promote health and wellbeing for the whole community, ensuring a clear and strong focus on tackling health in-equalities. Directors of public health will be required to provide reports directly to local authority overview and scrutiny committees on wellbeing, which will strengthen the director of public health role with the LA. In addition, the director of public health will work closely with the new director of adult social services and they will, working with directors of children's services, undertake regular joint reviews of the health and wellbeing status and needs of their populations.</p>

	<p pid="e.455W.5/1">The main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology.</p>
	<p pid="e.455W.5/2">The Department has since 1986 supported a research programme on sexual health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The annual amount contributed since 1997 is shown in the table. The programme is managed on its behalf by the MRC, with advice from the sexual health and HIV research strategy committee <sup>1</sup> . In this way, the MRC is able to co-ordinate the work of the programme with its broader portfolio of national and international research on sexual health and HIV.</p>
	<p pid="e.455W.5/3">The committee identifies research needs and priorities, stimulates new research, and advises on the value and relevance to the programme of proposals submitted to it for funding. Studies on prevention have been a focus of the programme. Currently, around three-quarters of the studies funded are concerned with HIV prevention technologies in their broadest sense, ranging from safer sex interventions for high risk groups, through cohort studies to follow-up children exposed to antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy, to uses of the internet to develop behaviour change interventions.</p>

It is not intended for prophylaxis, but we have not ruled out using antivirals for post-exposure prophylaxis in the very early stages of a pandemic in the United Kingdom. Use of antivirals for prophylaxis would reduce the number of people who could be treated. There is also the possibility that extensive use of antivirals for prophylaxis could encourage development of a pandemic virus with antiviral resistance. This again is under continuous review.

	<p pid="e.461W.2/7" class="indent">The electronic prescription service (EPS) is now in use at over 150 GP practices and a further 500 practices have had their system software upgraded to comply with the requirement of the system.

	<p pid="e.466W.0/1">The Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a Public Consultation Exercise (MLX 322) on the MHRA's regulatory fees proposals for <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>. That consultation exercise began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-28">28 November 2005</phrase> and ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-03">3 February 2006</phrase>. Consultation letters were issued to some 3200 companies, individuals and industry associations and licence and marketing authorisation holders who were likely to be affected by the proposals or interested in them. The consultation document was also placed on the MHRA website. By the close of the consultation, 66 responses had been received, although a number have come in after the closing date, and they will also be taken into account. We are now analysing the responses, and will be taking into account all responses received before making a decision on final level of fees.</p>

Costs arising from investment by national health service organisations in local systems and hardware, training, and ensuring compliance of local systems with programme-delivered systems will be met from reprioritising existing baseline spending on information technology and savings accrued from national purchasing agreements. These, and the cost of central expenditure on centrally-managed projects and services connected with the programme and on running NHS connecting for health, are dependent on the outcome of future spending reviews. Ongoing costs of maintaining and upgrading the assets delivered through the national programme will continue to accrue thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="e.472W.6/1">The first major hospital building programme in the national health service resulted from the 1962 Hospital Plan for England and Wales&quot; launched by Mr. Enoch Powell, the then Minister of Health. This advocated the network of large district general hospitals and the commitment to 90 new and 134 substantially modernised hospitals. The budget for this 10-year plan was set at just over &pound;500 million, equivalent to about &pound;4.7 billion in today's prices. Detailed records on the precise cost and milestone dates for each scheme are not immediately available centrally for schemes before 1980. The actual implementation ran into well documented difficulties resulting from an underestimation of the capital and revenue costs of this new generation of hospitals and the plan was subject to several revisions; for example in 1965 the number of major reconstructions was scaled down from 134 to 59. The date by which the plan's targets would be met were also repeatedly put back and further affected by the public spending cuts of the 1970's. Schemes originally proposed in 1962 were still being completed&mdash;or partially completed&mdash;in the 1980s and 90s. In reality only a third were ever fully completed, a third partially so and the rest not started at all.</p>
	<p pid="e.472W.6/2">From 1980, 10 schemes with values of &pound;50 million or more, in real terms, proceeded to construction. Since 1997, 19 hospital schemes worth over &pound;50 million given the go ahead after that date have become operational with a further 17 under construction, with a total capital value of over &pound;5 billion. Just as importantly, the great majority are all one phase projects. 43 more schemes are in development.</p>
	<p pid="e.472W.6/3">So in terms of the number of major hospital schemes completed, the number of years over which this has been achieved and their total value, the period since 1997 has seen the largest sustained hospital building programme since the NHS was founded.</p>

	<p pid="e.489W.8/2">The responsibility for carrying out pre-employment checks rests with the relevant national health service trust. The NHS is required to follow the guidance, Safer Recruitment&quot; issued in May 2005 which covers all the pre- and post-appointment checks that NHS employers must make before appointing anyone to a position in the NHS. The Department also published, Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; in 2000. This document sets out how all agencies and professionals should work together to promote children's welfare and protect them from abuse and neglect.</p>
	<p pid="e.489W.8/3">The decisions on recruiting, employing and disciplining staff are matters for individual NHS trusts and these are not reported to the Department. The Department does not therefore hold information about NHS employees of the kind requested.</p>

Primary care trusts and strategic health authorities have already developed plans on how they will meet the target of 48-hour access through the local delivery planning process and the latest survey shows that this is being achieved almost half the time already. To support this, the Department is investing an extra &pound;145 million over three years for GUM services and infrastructure to enable clinics to expand their services and reduce waiting times. In addition, a further &pound;40 million has also been invested over the next two years through the White Paper to improve access to contraceptive services.</p>

	<p pid="e.495W.0/1">The initial national health service walk-in centres were developed as pilot sites with substantial central capital and recurrent revenue support from the Department. As the NHS walk-in centre service model has established itself as a mainstream service subsequent centres have been developed with less central funding. The only exception is the centres which are now being developed with a commuter focus. Their core service is being centrally funded for the first three years in recognition that their services are intended primarily for people who live outside the primary care trust area.</p>
	<p pid="e.495W.0/2">Our aim is that all NHS walk-in centres should be funded locally and sustainably. The recently published White Paper, Our Health, Our Care, Our Say: A New Direction for Community Services&quot; commits the Department to review NHS walk-in centre funding arrangements to deliver this. Until that review has been completed it is not possible to set a timeframe for this change.</p>

	<p pid="e.497W.3/1">Absence from school has declined in each of the last four years and, at 6.44 per cent., is at the lowest level since records began. The figure for unauthorised absence in 2004/05 was 0.78 per cent. Applying this to the total number of pupils of compulsory school age in all schools gives the equivalent of an average of 55,000 pupils recorded as absent each day without authorisation. Unauthorised absence includes pupils who arrive late; term-time holidays taken without the school's permission; and absences where the explanation is unsatisfactory.</p>

	<p pid="e.497W.6/1">The aim of the Rewarding and Developing Staff (RDS) initiative has been to enable higher education institutions (HEIs) to develop their human resource (HR) capability. To secure allocations of funding under round 1 of the initiative (2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04), HEIs were asked to submit human resource strategies to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). Institutions were asked to address six priority areas: recruitment and retention; staff development and training; equal opportunities targets (including plans for job evaluation); reviews of staffing needs; performance review; and tackling poor performance.</p>
	<p pid="e.497W.6/2">KPMG was commissioned by HEFCE to undertake an evaluation of round 1 of the scheme, to assess the impact of the initiative on the development of HR management. KPMG's findings were that the distribution of expenditure between the six priority areas was as follows.</p>

A further survey took place in 2005 and the report will be published later this year. These surveys provide data on participation in different types of adult learning by a range of demographic characteristics, socio-economic and educational background, and local deprivation factors.</p>
	<p pid="e.501W.8/2">The surveys show that participation in adult learning is highest amongst those in full-time employment and lowest among those who are retired or incapable of work. Participation is also positively related to qualification levels, to household income and to socio-economic group, being highest among professional and managerial workers and lowest amongst unskilled manual workers. There is an inverse relationship between levels of participation in learning and levels of local deprivation.</p>

	<p pid="e.502W.3/1">In 2003/04 and 2004/05 adult learners in further education (FE) were assumed to contribute 25 per cent. of the basic course cost of their learning unless fees were remitted because the learner was receiving an income-based benefit or on a Skills for Life programme. This proportion increased to 27.5 per cent. in 2005/06, and will rise again in 2006/07 to 32.5 per cent. and to 37.5 per cent. in 2007/08. In average terms, this means a rise from an hourly rate of &pound;1.42 to &pound;1.94 by 2007/08. The fees collected by FE colleges and other providers cannot be broken down by the source of funder and may be paid by the individual learner or their employer.</p>
	<p pid="e.502W.3/2">However, we know that historically many FE providers choose to waive the fees for some of these &quot;fee-paying&quot; learners:</p>
	<p pid="e.502W.3/3" class="indent">In 2003/04, FE providers collected &pound;152 million out of an expected &pound;261 million</p>
	<p pid="e.502W.3/4" class="indent">In 2004/05, &pound;159 million was collected out of an expected &pound;277 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.502W.3/5">The Skills Strategy White Paper set out a vision for transforming the way in which the learning and skills sector can support higher national investment in skills, which included ensuring that the state, employers and individuals all contribute towards the costs of their learning, in line with the benefits received by each.</p>
	<p pid="e.502W.3/6">In order to increase the levels of fees collected, from 2005/06 the LSC agreed a fee income measure with each FE funded provider. To assist providers in developing a strategic approach to, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published a good practice guide to fee income earlier this year. Clearly, with the increase in the fee assumption, it will be important that FE providers recover as much money as possible from learners and employers.</p>

	<p pid="e.504W.6/1">My Department has issued no guidance to schools on the collection and recording of pupils' biometric information. In collecting data of this type the school is likely to rely on the broad powers contained in paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 of the Education Act 2002. This enables a governing body to do anything which appears to them to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of, or in connection with the conduct of the school. It will be for the school to establish that it is acting lawfully in collecting data and is, on a case-by-case basis, compliant with Human Rights and Data Protection duties and the common law of confidentiality. Schools should seek legal advice from their local authority where necessary. The British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (BECTA) published guidance for schools in 2004 on their obligations and responsibilities under the Data Protection Act and other related legislation.</p>
	<p pid="e.504W.6/2">We are aware that some schools do hold a photograph of pupils on their management information systems; use fingerprint scanners for the twice daily attendance registration of pupils; or use iris-scanners. However, my Department does not collect any information on how many schools use such equipment or hold photos or any other biometric data on their systems.</p>
	<p pid="e.504W.6/3">The Department does not issue specific guidance on the procurement of cashless systems for school meals, which sometimes make use of biometric data, although it does encourage schools and local authorities to consider their use, within the context of improving take-up of free school meals, improving the efficiency of the meals service, and reducing possible causes of bullying from children carrying cash.</p>

	<p pid="e.505W.2/1">This Government have given an unprecedentedly high profile to tackling bullying and supporting those who have been bullied. Our anti-bullying work, including the anti-bullying charter for action, takes an integrated approach to preventing bullying, to addressing causes of bullying&mdash;for example prejudice&mdash;and to helping those who are bullied.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/2">Following the White Paper, in 2006 we shall be issuing guidance on prejudice driven bullying, including racist and homophobic bullying, providing school staff with valuable support in an area they often find challenging. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase> we plan to launch our advice on countering racist bullying and we will follow this in March with a national programme of dissemination events.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/3">Since 1999 it has been compulsory for every school to have an anti-bullying policy in place which details how the school will tackle bullying.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/4">We have secured a very broad consensus, with all the teaching professional associations and the Anti-Bullying Alliance signing up to our anti-bullying charter for action. The charter is a voluntary commitment to creating a school community where bullying is not tolerated. In 2006 we plan to share examples of where the charter has been particularly well implemented with other schools so that they can learn from this best practice.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/5">Through our work with the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), an organisation comprising over 65 leading anti-bullying charities and experts, we provide schools and local authorities with expert help to tackle bullying. The national strategies' behaviour materials provide schools with support in reducing and responding to bullying.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/6">We have put more adults than ever in our schools&mdash;teachers, classroom assistants, learning mentors, Connexions personal advisers, behaviour and education support teams and police officers&mdash;so that a wide range of people are available to help prevent and tackle bullying.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/7">Anti-bullying week continues to be a successful event with a large number of schools taking part in November 2005's activities through a wide variety of national and local events. There was a considerable amount of positive press coverage and this year over 325,000 anti-bullying wristbands were distributed.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/8">Our anti-bullying resource pack for schools &quot;Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, updated in 2000 and Sept 2002 will be revised and re-issued in 2006 to ensure schools have the most up-to-date information available on tackling bullying.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/9">In addition the Department has recently launched the social and emotional aspects of learning (SEAL) curriculum resource&mdash;an intervention to develop children's social, emotional and behavioural skills from foundation stage to year 6. It is available to all primary schools and the evidence from the pilot suggests that it helps reduce bullying and promotes positive behaviour generally. It is an important arm of the Department's longer term policy to promote positive behaviour and attendance. The Department is hoping to build on the work carried out in primary schools by providing a similar whole school curriculum based resource for secondary schools (SEES). At present the programme is in a very early pilot stage.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/10">As data on bullying is not collected centrally, we do not have statistics relating to incidents of bullying in schools across England. We do know however that schools and local authorities are increasingly carrying out local surveys of children and young people's views of bullying to inform the development of their anti-bullying strategies.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/11">Bullying cases do appear to be reported more often now than before but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed, as children feel more confident to speak out about bullying it is likely that the number of cases reported will rise.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/12">We have assessed our anti-bullying strategies in the following ways:</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/13" class="indent">The Department's 2003&ndash;04 make the difference conference series was an important part of our strategy for sharing effective practice between schools and local authorities. The series was heavily over subscribed and delegates told us that they left feeling inspired and motivated to promote continuing changes and improvement in their schools.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/14" class="indent">The overall evaluations for the London conference were 100 percent. positive, and for the series overall 97 percent. positive.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/15" class="indent">The web statistics of a workshop used at the Wembley conference reflect the enthusiasm and interest generated by this conference. The number of hits on their site increased to over 20,000 the week following the conference, compared with 48 hits in their own launch week.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/16" class="indent">Last year's anti-bullying week was very well supported with a large number of different events taking place across the country. A considerable amount of positive press coverage was received.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/17" class="indent">The anti-bullying charter for action that was launched in November 2003 has been signed and returned to the ABA by about 4,000 schools. We believe that other schools have adopted the charter, but have not returned it to the ABA, and that more still have used it as the basis for developing their school anti bullying policies. The Practitioner's Group on behaviour and discipline, which was composed of heads and practitioners expert in the field of school discipline, published its report, &quot;Learning Behaviour&quot;, in October 2005 outlining best practice in schools, as well as future recommendations. Their report in particular welcomed and endorsed the charter, suggesting that it be re-issued every two years to maintain momentum, a recommendation which we acted upon in anti-bullying week 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/18" class="indent">The two anti-bullying public information films (&quot;Tell Someone&quot;, 2003, and &quot;I am&quot;, 2004) are the two most watched public information films created by the department. It seems reasonable to assume that such a volume of interest has led to increased awareness, both of the need for children and young people to tell someone if they are being bullied, and of the fact that the person being bullied is not to blame.</p>
	<p pid="e.505W.2/19">In addition, our guidance to schools on tackling bullying, &quot;Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, has been externally evaluated by researchers at Goldsmith's College, University of London. The results, though based on a fairly low response rate from schools, show that the schools found that the pack met their expectations and helped in drawing up their anti-bullying policies. This evaluation included research into the perceived success of the anti bullying strategies and interventions recommended in the guidance. Schools generally reported a high level of satisfaction with the interventions they had used.</p>

	<p pid="e.516W.2/1">As part of my Department's aim to achieve 2.5 per cent. annual efficiency gains across the three years (2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08) Children's Fund partnerships have been asked to achieve savings by either reducing management costs by 2.5 per cent. of their allocation each year and redeploying these to front line services or achieving a net annual increase of 2.5 per cent. in the number of children and young people receiving regular support from the Children's Fund. Each partnership was required to set out in its delivery plan or in discussions with the Department how the efficiency gains would be achieved and how it would demonstrate their achievement.</p>
	<p pid="e.516W.2/2">An initial analysis undertaken at the mid year point of 2005&ndash;06 indicated that savings of &pound;3.8 million in Children's Fund Management costs were planned to be made by the end of the year. The actual savings made during 2005&ndash;06 will not be known until after the end of the year (around June 2006) when partnerships have had time to close off their accounts and establish their actual expenditure for the year.</p>
	<p pid="e.516W.2/3">We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target, including the reduction of Children's Fund central management costs. These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department's Autumn Performance Report and will report further progress in the Departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April.</p>

	<p pid="e.516W.5/1">In 2004&ndash;05, children's fund grant totalling &pound;160 million was allocated by the Department for Education and Skills to the 149 children's fund partnerships based in each local authority area in England. This grant was used to fund a range of preventative services aimed at children aged five to 13 addressing social exclusion amongst children, young people and their families. Children's fund partnerships are responsible for setting priorities, making funding decisions and commissioning services according to the needs and priorities of the area. The three most commonly targeted groups were children with &quot;behaviour difficulties&quot;, &quot;self-esteem problems&quot; and those &quot;exhibiting antisocial or criminal behaviour&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="e.520W.2/1">Neither creationism nor intelligent design is taught as a subject in schools. The national curriculum programme of study for science at key stage 4 covers evolution. It sets out that pupils should be taught &quot;that the fossil record is evidence for evolution&quot; and also &quot;how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction&quot;. Pupils should however be taught about &quot;how scientific controversies can arise from different ways of interpreting empirical evidence&quot;. Also, the biblical view of creation can be taught in RE lessons, where pupils are taught to consider opposing theories and come to their own, reasoned conclusions. Therefore, although creationism and intelligent design are not part of the national curriculum, they could be covered in these contexts.</p>

	<p pid="e.524W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="e.524W.2/2">The Government's ambition is to make safeguarding children everyone's business. We want our children to be safe in all settings&mdash;and that requires everyone to play their part&mdash;in Government, as parents, citizens, in the police, local authorities, health bodies, voluntary and private sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid="e.524W.2/3">The statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January</phrase> covered this wider safeguarding agenda, as well as focusing on specific settings where appropriate. List 99 currently covers positions working with children in schools, FE institutions and LEA education services. PoCA covers child care positions in all regulated child care organisations (as defined in the Protection of Children Act 1999) who have a statutory duty to refer the names of individuals who fulfil criteria making them unsuitable to work with children. The Act also permits other organisations, such as voluntary organisations, sports clubs and scout associations to refer those working in child care positions who met the criteria for possible inclusion in the PoCA list.</p>
	<p pid="e.524W.2/4">Under the new Vetting and Barring Scheme (VBS) employers will be able to check the barred status of all those applying to work or working in jobs that bring them into contact with children, including all those with opportunity for contact in key settings in sixth form colleges, further education colleges; those who regularly care for, train, supervise, advise and counsel, provide medical treatment to or are in sole charge of children; and those in key positions of authority. Most employers will be required to check barred status before employing; parents and domestic employers will be able, but not required, to check.</p>
	<p pid="e.524W.2/5">Of the immediate policy changes announced in the statement, the further work on supply agencies and overseas staff will look across a full range of settings where staff are required to work with children.</p>
	<p pid="e.524W.2/6">Mandatory CRB checks will be implemented for schools, including sixth form colleges through regulations made under sections 35 and 36 of the Education Act 2002 (and s72 of the School Standards Framework Act (SSFA) 1998)&mdash;currently the School Staffing (England) Regulations 2003. We will also be looking to apply similar mandatory checks for teachers, tutors and trainers working in FE. Changes announced by the Secretary of State mean that existing arrangements become compulsory for schools through amendments to regulations which will make an on appointment CRB check compulsory for all new appointments of teachers and teaching support staff in further education institutions who have not worked in a further education institution or school for the last three months. It is already a requirement that Childcare for under 8s must register with Ofsted in order to operate. Part of this registration process includes an advanced disclosure to ensure that those working with children are suitable to do so.</p>

	<p pid="e.526W.0/2">Capital is allocated both to local authorities and to schools. Capital allocated to local authorities, known as formulaic funding, is controlled by them and prioritised in accordance with local asset management plans. Other funding, called Devolved Formula Capital (DFC), is controlled by schools. Foundation schools are treated on the same basis as other maintained schools regarding both formulaic allocations and DFC. Other programme allocations; relating to Targeted Capital Fund projects, PFI projects, and Building Schools for the Future projects, are spent by the local authority on the specific schools detailed in bid documentation.</p>
	<p pid="e.526W.0/3">Regarding DFC, the only exception to schools controlling the funding applies where a local authority is in a Building Schools for the Future programme.

No changes to the existing arrangements are proposed in the Education White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="e.527W.0/1">My Department has not calculated education productivity, but has&mdash;as part of the Atkinson Review&mdash;worked with the Office for National Statistics to improve measures of inputs and outputs, which ONS has used to calculate their own estimates of productivity in the compulsory education system. These estimates are, in broad terms, calculated by dividing outputs (measured by pupil numbers adjusted for school absence and the quality of education output) by inputs (measured by deflated education spending). Since there are various ways of measuring quality, ONS has published several estimates of education productivity&mdash;and the underlying methodology&mdash;in &quot;Public Service Productivity: Education&quot;, in October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.527W.0/2">The link between education inputs and outputs is complex, especially because there are time lags between changes in inputs being fully reflected in outputs. ONS argue that a single number for productivity cannot capture all the costs and benefits of the Government's investment in the education sector. Any estimates&mdash;however calculated&mdash;therefore need to be interpreted alongside other forms of corroborative evidence on inputs and outputs.</p>

(nearly 614,000) pupils reached school leaving age with a pass of some kind, an increase of 0.5 percentage point on 2004.</p>
	<p pid="e.533W.8/2">The Department has a number of initiatives to ensure that schools receive the resources, advice and support that they need to raise attainment further at Key Stage 4. The Key Stage 3 National Strategy has extended to become a full Secondary National Strategy for School Improvement designed to raise standards for all secondary school pupils, including low attaining pupils.

The first pilots will start in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="e.542W.9/3" class="indent">&quot;The &pound;170 million will be consolidated into institutions' core grants from 2004- 05 and, in addition, I am making available an extra &pound;50 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;117 million in 2005&ndash;06. I expect the Council to make the new funding conditional on universities and colleges continuing to develop and implement their human resource strategies, and in particular on their taking steps to move towards market supplements or other means of recruiting and retaining staff of the right calibre; and committing themselves to rewarding good performance. I am particularly concerned that good teaching should be identified and rewarded. The Council should also make clear that postdoctoral and other researchers should be included in these strategies. Therefore the Council should ask each institution to revise its human resource strategy to focus on these points, and reiterate the need for improvements in equal opportunities for higher education staff. Where the Council is satisfied that the strategy is sound and is being implemented properly, I look to the Council to add the additional funding to that institution's baseline. Where the Council has doubts, the additional funding should remain earmarked until the revised human resources strategy and its implementation satisfy the Council.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.542W.9/4">In accordance with this guidance, HEFCE asked HEIs to submit extended plans to encompass the additional priorities, including approaches to teaching career progression and recognition schemes for relevant staff groups, as well as consolidating work on human resource systems arising from the round 1 investment.</p>

	<p pid="e.542W.9/6">For both rounds of funding, HEFCE allocated the RDS fund to each HEI on a formula basis.

	<p pid="e.543W.2/2">The aim of the Rewarding and Developing Staff (RDS) initiative has been to enable higher education institutions (HEIs) to develop their human resource (HR) capability. To secure allocations of funding under round 1 of the initiative (2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04), HEIs were asked to submit human resource strategies to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). Institutions were asked to address six priority areas: recruitment and retention; staff development and training; equal opportunities targets (including plans for job evaluation); reviews of staffing needs; performance review; and tackling poor performance.</p>
	<p pid="e.543W.2/3">For both rounds of funding, HEFCE allocated the RDS fund to each HEI on a formula basis. Round 1 was based on the institution's teaching and research funding in the previous year, and round 2 based on teaching funding only. Each institution determined its own spend across the identified priority areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.543W.2/4" class="italic">Round 1 and 2 expenditure</p>
	<p pid="e.543W.2/5">KPMG was commissioned by HEFCE to undertake an evaluation of round 1 of the scheme (2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04), its main objective being to assess the impact of the initiative on the development of HR management.

	<p pid="e.545W.3/1">Funding is available from three sources: local authority allocations of Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG); the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG); and Unaccompanied Asylum Seekers Carers (UASC) Grant. The formula used to calculate Schools Formula Spending Share for 2005&ndash;06 and previous years took account of the extra spending needed by those authorities with populations of children for whom English is an additional language, and from low performing ethnic groups. Approximately &pound;435 million of the &pound;24.6 billion Schools FSS for 2005&ndash;06 was distributed on the basis of numbers of children in these two categories. Since the formula for Dedicated Schools Grant starts from local authorities' spending on schools for 2005&ndash;06, that will also take account of the extra spending needed by authorities with such children. There will be increases in allocations of Dedicated Schools Grant per pupil of 6.8 per cent. and 6.7 per cent. for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. The formula for distributing Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant also uses the proportion of children for whom English is an additional language, and from low performing ethnic groups. The total amount of funding for EMAG was: for 2005&ndash;06, &pound;168 million; for 2006&ndash;07, &pound;174 million and for 2007&ndash;08, &pound;179 million. The figure for 2005&ndash;06 includes local authority matched funding; the figures for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 are DfES grant, and reflect the transfer of matched funding from Dedicated Schools Grant for those years. We made available &pound;11 million of UASC Grant in 2005&ndash;06, and plan to make available &pound;12 million in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. The grant is paid retrospectively in line with the number of UASC care leavers supported by each local authority.</p>

	<p pid="e.546W.5/2">Interoperability standards are a critical element of an effective national digital infrastructure. Such standards by nature are global and agreed between many different nations. The UK is participating within bodies such as the International Standards Organisation to facilitate their creation and adoption. This removes much of the requirement to create standards only for the UK educational sectors, although specific requirements do still remain.</p>
	<p pid="e.546W.5/3">Becta (the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) and JISC (the Joint Information Systems Committee) have worked together to coordinate standards development activity for the school, further education and higher education sectors since the mid-1990s. In this way, the priorities of the UK sector as a whole has had a significant impact on the international standardisation agenda. Within the UK, close cooperation between the agencies and vendors in measures such as interoperability testing events, and between the agencies and the sectors in communities of practice has ensured that best practice and best-of-breed tools have spread widely and rapidly.</p>

A number of approaches are being taken to increase the sharing of interoperable tools and resources.</p>
	<p pid="e.547W.2/2">Within sectors there is a range of initiatives to enable the sharing of tools and resources.

	<p pid="e.547W.2/3">The Learning and Skills web portal is being developed to act as an aggregator of content and advice and guidance for all practitioners involved in the post-16 sector.

	<p pid="e.550W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not commissioned such an assessment. Pupils take National Curriculum tests in Year 6 to assess how well they have mastered the Key Stage 2 curriculum in English, mathematics and science&mdash;subjects of crucial importance to their success at secondary school. The fact that the test results will, in due course, be published should have no direct effect on the Year 6 curriculum, in these or other subjects. Evidence from Ofsted shows that good test results are associated with a broad curriculum and engaging teaching.</p>

	<p pid="e.551W.5/1">Behaviour and Education Support Teams (BESTs) can be located in either a school or community setting. In practice, many of the current teams have a permanent base in a secondary school, while also working with a cluster of associated primary and secondary schools. However, community settings are also used in some cases, and these may have the advantage of being more accessible to parents. A survey of schools and local authorities involved in the Behaviour Improvement Programme (BIP) indicated that there were around 190 BESTs, operating across 137 local BIP projects, in the summer term 2005.</p>

	<p pid="e.557W.2/1">The Every Child Matters Green Paper, published in 2003, and the Children Act 2004, have brought about a series of structural and other changes at local level which support the drive to improve outcomes for all children and young people. These include the appointment of Directors of Children's Services and Lead Members for Children's Services, the development of children's trusts and the preparation of Children and Young People's Plans.</p>
	<p pid="e.557W.2/2">We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target. These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes.

	<p pid="e.558W.2/1">The same statutory safeguards for looked-after children apply regardless of where the child is living. All looked-after children, including those placed out-of-authority, are required under the Children Act 1989 to have an individual care plan, which is subject to a regular statutory review overseen by an independent reviewing officer. In addition, an authority responsible for looking after a child which places the child in another area is required to inform the local authority and the primary care trust (or if there is no PCT, the health authority) for the area in which the child is now living. The placing authority is also required to notify the PCT where the child has been living that the child is leaving their area.</p>
	<p pid="e.558W.2/2">Last year, the Department conducted a national project on out-of-authority placements for looked-after children. We know from that project that the system for notifying local authorities and PCTs is not working as effectively as it should. That is why we have undertaken to consider how best to improve this system, alongside wider work both to reduce local authorities' dependence on out-of-authority placements and to improve outcomes for looked-after children who are placed out-of-authority. This work will be taken forward as part of the wide-ranging proposals for transforming outcomes for looked-after children which we announced in the recent White Paper &quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot;.</p>

Trusts will be an option for every school, allowing them to create a sustainable and stable partnership, with clear aims and outcomes agreed at the outset. Any school seeking to acquire trust status will be able to choose who they wish to collaborate with in order to strengthen their governance, support their long term continuing improvement, meet the aspirations of their pupils and local community and develop a distinctive ethos. They could help schools in an area to work together, or could support a network of schools across the country in developing a particular specialism or approach.</p>

	<p pid="e.562W.8/1">Changes to the new inspection processes for schools and early years provision began in September 2005. These processes are shorter, sharper and more proportionate. There is now greater emphasise on self evaluation, for example in schools where it has contributed to a significant reduction in the weight of inspection. Changes to the delivery of inspections will result in annual savings within Ofsted of some &pound;30 million. Ofsted has made other changes to its business, most notably reducing its 12 offices to three new regional offices and streamlining its administration.</p>
	<p pid="e.562W.8/2">The Government are committed to further reduction in the cost of inspection. The overall aims of its inspection strategy are to refocus, rationalise and reduce inspection in order to increase its impact and cost-effectiveness.</p>

These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department's Autumn Performance Report and will report further progress in the Departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April.</p>

	<p pid="e.563W.2/1">The Department ceased sending publications automatically to schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004. Discussions with head teachers and detailed research showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies.</p>
	<p pid="e.563W.2/2">The online ordering system enables schools to choose whether to download electronic copies or order the paper based publications they need at the right time for them and in the multiples they require. This system is linked directly to the fulfilment service and an existing telephone ordering line. A fortnightly email service to schools informs them of new and important publications. Some initial savings have already been made through a reduction in printing costs and distribution and stock management, and further efficiencies are expected as reliance on paper hard copies diminishes.</p>

	<p pid="e.565W.2/1">We recognise that we ask a lot of primary school leaders. We are determined though that every primary school should provide all their children, whatever their background, with the support they need to be healthy; stay safe; enjoy and achieve; make a positive contribution; develop as confident and enthusiastic learners; and grasp the basic skills of literacy and numeracy.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/2">Those working in and with our primary schools are making a tremendous contribution towards raising standards and improving the lives of our children. Primary schools have made significant progress in recent years and should be pleased with this progress. However, there is still much to be done. For example, there are still too many 11-year-olds who do not reach the levels in reading, writing, and mathematics they need to flourish in secondary school.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/3">Children only get one chance to start their schooling. That is why school improvement needs to happen as quickly as possible. At the same time we know that the pace of change has to be manageable. We have a range of measures in place and in development to make sure that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/4">First, for the contractual amendments that are freeing teachers to teach and school leaders to lead we worked more closely than ever before with the school workforce unions, employers and professional associations to phase changes in over a three year period.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/5">Second, on teachers' pay and conditions we take the advice of the independent School Teachers Review Body on changes needed to put in place the right incentives for teachers to focus on continuously improving their teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/6">Third, we are developing a new relationship with schools. From next year primary schools will work with a School Improvement Partner, agreeing school improvement priorities in a single school plan and accounting for them through streamlined accountability arrangements. Already we have cut Ofsted inspections from a week to a couple of days.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/7">Fourth, within the Department we have introduced arrangements that resulted last year in six surveys of schools being incorporated into a single school census where the information is harvested from school management systems automatically. We have stopped sending hard copies of documents to school informing them electronically of what is available and leaving it to them to order only those they need and want, in the quantities and at the time they want them. We trimmed 38 requests for new data from schools to five and we more than halved the number of new initiatives for schools in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/8">Fifth, in our recent White Paper we underlined the importance of external scrutiny of the way we deliver new policies by extending the remit of the Implementation Review Unit (IRU) for a further two years to 2008. This is an independent panel of serving senior school practitioners who challenge the Department to ensure our implementation plans are practicable and free from unnecessary burdens.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/9">The view of the IRU is that school leaders themselves can do a great deal to manage their own workload. The IRU themselves, have issued to all schools a set of principles head teachers might adopt. If followed, these principles will help heads to ensure that their approach to national and local initiatives gives maximum benefit to their own school with the minimum burden. A copy of those principles is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/10" class="italic">Implementation Review Unit (IRU)</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/11" class="italic">Reducing bureaucracy in schools: principles for schools</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/12">The IRU is working with the DfES, local authorities and other partner organisations to encourage them to reduce their bureaucratic impact on schools and to help them find ways of doing so. There are, however, approaches schools can take themselves which will help lessen the problem of bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/13">These approaches are embodied in the following principles which, if applied by schools, will contribute to reducing their bureaucratic burdens and which, we consider, will have a positive impact on staff throughout the school.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/14">We believe that head teachers and governors should:</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/15" class="indent">1. adopt non-mandatory guidance only where they consider it to be of relevance to their schools;</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/16" class="indent">2. question the need for non-statutory data and/or information, choosing themselves whether to provide it;</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/17" class="indent">3. challenge requests to provide duplicate data and/or information;</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/18" class="indent">4. identify and have regard to the workload implications for themselves and their staff and the impact on the school of:</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/19" class="indent">complying with non-statutory requests for information and data,</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/20" class="indent">embarking on specialist programmes and/or other initiatives;</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/21" class="indent">5. identify resources (including financial) available within the school, or elsewhere, to support complying with non-statutory requests/embarking on specialist programmes, etc;</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/22" class="indent">6. assess (and reduce) the bureaucracy associated with the management of meetings, internal communications and the preparation of school documentation, including the completion of self evaluation forms;</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/23" class="indent">7. ensure a minimalist approach towards their school's own bureaucratic systems and processes, so as to reduce their impact on both teaching and support staff;</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/24" class="indent">8. follow the principle that their own new policies and initiatives <sup>1</sup> should be instead of, and not additional to, existing ones;</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/25" class="indent">9. co-operate with the DfES, local authorities and partner agencies in discussing new policies and initiatives, including assisting with the preparation of impact assessments and looking at resource implications.</p>
	<p pid="e.565W.2/26" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> The term &quot;new policies and initiatives&quot; also embraces new strategies, schemes and directives and changes to existing ones.</p>

The initiative has helped HEIs and the sector to be better prepared to address forthcoming HE-wide challenges. It has enabled HEIs to address staff shortages more effectively, provide a substantial investment in staff development and training, and raise the profile of equality and diversity issues through policy development, awareness-raising and training, and job evaluation (the latter leading to the re-grading posts to new pay structures).</p>

	<p pid="e.571W.2/2">The release of the rewarding and developing staff (RDS) funding to institutions, for round 1, was contingent on receipt by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) of a human resource strategy that identified objectives, described how the money would be spent, and set specific targets. Institutional expenditure was monitored via the annual monitoring statement, and through the request for a statement of expenditure, and HEFCE evaluations. To ensure release of round 2 funding, institutions were asked to submit either a revised human resource strategy or an extended investment plan.</p>
	<p pid="e.571W.2/3">In terms of the overall monitoring of RDS, the Government have asked HEFCE to adopt a light touch&quot; approach, in line with our commitment to reduce the accountability burden in higher education. Round 1 of RDS has therefore been mainstreamed within institutions' block teaching grants and is no longer independently monitored. Round 2 is being monitored through institutions' annual monitoring statements. With respect to equal pay, there has been no specific monitoring. However, the evaluation of RDS Round 1 which ended in 2003&ndash;04, reported that&mdash;by that stage&mdash;38 percent. of institutions had conducted an equal pay review.</p>

This is an independent group of practitioners working in the HE sector who help identify new and additional ways to reduce existing burdens, as well as reviewing all new Government policies to try and ensure they are introduced with the minimum of additional bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="e.572W.9/3">We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target, including reducing the costs to higher education institutions of accountability, quality and reporting requirements. These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department's Autumn Performance Report and will report further progress in the Departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April.</p>

	<p pid="e.574W.0/2">Trust schools will be responsible for managing their own estate and assets and will be able to dispose of surplus land in the same way as foundation and voluntary schools can now. At present foundation and voluntary schools require the Secretary of State's consent before they can dispose of any land or buildings provided at public expense. We are proposing to strengthen local decision making by removing this requirement. Instead schools, including trust schools, will be expected to inform their local authority of any proposals to dispose of non-playing field land. Any disputes arising from the sale of such land will be determined by the schools adjudicator. Trust schools disposing of non-playing field land will be required to use any sale proceeds for capital purposes connected with education. Local authorities will potentially be able to claim a share of any excess sale proceeds either by agreement with the school or determined by the adjudicator.</p>
	<p pid="e.574W.0/3">The proposed disposal, or change of use, of playing field land will continue to be subject to the existing arrangements which require all local authorities and schools to obtain the prior consent of the Secretary of State. There is a strong expectation that any sale proceeds will be recycled for sport or education purposes.</p>

	<p pid="e.574W.3/1">While many local authorities undoubtedly do a good job in managing their school assets, we see considerable advantages to all sides in our proposals in &quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot; to encourage more school to own their assets directly. For schools, the benefits of acquiring foundation status include that they will gain direct responsibility for improving their buildings and land. This is an important strand in developing a strong school ethos.</p>
	<p pid="e.574W.3/2">Local authorities will benefit from having a new role of commissioning rather than providing education. They will have a new duty to promote choice, diversity and fair access for school places. This means that they still retain responsibility for a strategic overview of capital and asset matters. For instance, they will develop the educational vision and investment plans for their Building Schools for the Future projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.574W.3/3">Currently, local authorities do not own the assets of the 875 existing foundation schools, of over 2,600 voluntary controlled schools, or of over 4,300 voluntary aided schools, except usually their playing fields. In all, local authorities do not now own the assets of more than a third of all maintained schools. A fifth of all authorities already work successfully with over half their secondary schools either voluntary aided or foundation.</p>

	<p pid="e.576W.2/1">Weights for deprivation and sparsity are not separately identified with the distribution method for Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. That method starts from each authority's budgeted spend for schools in 2005&ndash;06, which largely reflects the historical allocation of resources through the Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) formula, which had separate weightings for deprivation, sparsity, and area costs. Given the importance the Government attaches to deprivation funding, the summary of indicative allocations of DSG (which can be found on the Teachernet website at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/DSG200608/">www.teachernet.gov.uk/DSG200608/</a>), includes an estimate of funding for deprivation contained within each authority's allocation of DSG. The national average is 10.5 per cent. for 2007&ndash;08 and 10.6 per cent. for 2007&ndash;08. The overall proportion of funding distributed on the basis of sparsity within Schools FSS&mdash;the predecessor to DSG&mdash;was 0.7 per cent. That proportion was based on research into the additional costs to sparsely populated authorities of keeping open small primary schools, and larger numbers of under fives settings, carried out during the formula review which led to the introduction of the Schools FSS formula. Almost half of all local authorities received no funding for sparsity through the schools FSS formula and the maximum proportion of funding for sparsity across all authorities was 3.6 per cent. The formula for the LEA FSS recognised the increased costs of home to school transport in sparse authorities.</p>

	<p pid="e.579W.5/1">By moving from &quot;patch and mend&quot; to long-term strategic capital investment, as in building schools for the future, we expect there to be significant savings over time for both public and private sectors, including in procurement of school maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="e.579W.5/2">Savings should come, for example, from simplified bidding, paperwork and bureaucracy, improved local asset management, grouped procurement and economies of scale, new joint venture structures, standardisation of processes and components, encouraging the market for the private sector, innovation in construction, benchmarking and testing of supply chains, improvements in the sustainability and energy efficiency of buildings, or reductions in poorly maintained or life-expired building stock.</p>
	<p pid="e.579W.5/3">The first three waves of investment through building schools for the future are gaining momentum, with good evidence of market engagement. This should result in innovation and efficiency savings across the traditional supply chains, which in turn will now be benchmarked nationally, regionally and locally to ensure value for money.</p>
	<p pid="e.579W.5/4">We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target, including our capital programmes. These are set out in our efficiency technical note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department's autumn performance report and will report further progress in the departmental annual report which we expect to publish in April.</p>

	<p pid="e.580W.8/1">Data on school playing fields have been supplied to the Department by local education authorities in 2001 and 2003. However, because the data were incomplete and of variable quality, it is not possible to accurately assess the number and area of school playing fields.</p>
	<p pid="e.580W.8/2">The Department's Building Bulletins 98 and 99 contain the recommendations on what proportion of a schools total area should be allocated to the provision of various areas of playing fields. The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 require schools to have access to team game playing fields proportionate to their pupil numbers and type. Copies of the Buildings Bulletins and the regulations setting out the minimum standards for team game playing fields can be downloaded from the Departments website: <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk">www.teachernet.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="e.580W.8/3">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 prevents local authorities and governing bodies from disposing, or changing the use, of school playing fields, without the prior consent of the Secretary of State. The criteria which applications are assessed fall under three main headings which may be described as schools' needs, community use, and finance. Normally, applications to dispose, or change the use, of school playing fields will only be approved in the exceptional circumstances that fulfil these criteria. The Department's Guidance 1017/2004: &quot;The Protection of School Playing Fields and Land for Academies&quot; set out the measures to underpin the Government's resolve to protect school playing fields. This guidance can also be accessed and downloaded from the Department's website.</p>

However, someone who has never lived in this country is unlikely to have a criminal record here and is unlikely to be included in List 99. We therefore advise employers to take extra care in other checks on overseas candidates and to seek information about the person's criminal history from their country of origin wherever possible. The CRB provides advice to employers about countries from which it is possible to obtain such information and how to obtain it.</p>

	<p pid="e.583W.3/1">There is no statutory amount of curriculum time that a school should dedicate to teaching any particular GCSE. However, guidance from examining boards suggests around 20 per cent. of the timetable should be spent on studies leading to two science GCSEs. The new science GCSE and the additional science GCSE are expected to take up the same proportion of the timetable as the double award.</p>

	<p pid="e.586W.5/4" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (this letter has been passed to myself by Phil Hope MP) regarding the provision of skills training in Easington constituency and what opportunities there are for the training of disabled workers.</p>
	<p pid="e.586W.5/5" class="indent">There are a number of LSC funded providers of skills training for residents in the District of Easington. The main provider is East Durham and Houghall Community College. The college offers a wide range of vocational provision, ranging from entry/level one through to level two and three, with local access to Higher Education via a partnership with Sunderland University.</p>
	<p pid="e.586W.5/6" class="indent">Four main providers offer Work-based Learning provision in the area. East Durham &amp; Houghall Community College is the largest with over 350 places available. The other local providers are Springboard, Shape Training and Include. In addition, national providers such as CITB and Remit offer opportunities in the District.</p>
	<p pid="e.586W.5/7" class="indent">Durham County Council offer a wide range of adult learning courses through their &quot;Education in the Community&quot; programme. Courses are particularly aimed at encouraging individuals who have been out of learning for a while, to sample non accredited learning in a supportive atmosphere before moving on to more formal qualifications if they wish. Other opportunities available in the area funded by the LSC include Learndirect, Aim High, the Employer Training Pilot (ETP) and several ESF funded projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.586W.5/8" class="indent">With respect to opportunities for the training of disabled workers, all the above provision is inclusive and open to anyone including those with disabilities. Nine per cent of learners (1,704 out of 18,858) at East Durham and Houghall Community College, the biggest provider, disclose they have a disability.</p>
	<p pid="e.586W.5/9" class="indent">These learners join mainstream provision and are provided with additional support appropriate to their individual needs, funded through LSC learner support funds. Classes are accessible to those with physical disabilities, and teaching and learning materials are adapted as appropriate for individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.586W.5/10" class="indent">The college has links with Glendene special school and the Shinwell Centre, both of which cater for disabled learners. Transport for the disabled is available in the form of two adapted minibuses. The college is also developing best practice when dealing with learners with emotional learning difficulties for the whole of County Durham.</p>

	<p pid="e.588W.0/1">During the 2005&ndash;06 financial year, local authorities in England budgeted net expenditure of &pound;4.1 billion for the provision of education for children with special educational needs (SEN). Certain elements of this budgeted expenditure are retained centrally by the local authority and SEN funding cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education. An overall figure for the budgeted net expenditure for special educational needs in primary schools is not therefore available. However, expenditure can be broken down as shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="e.588W.0/2">It is for local authorities to make appropriate provision for all pupils in their area, including primary pupils with SEN, distributing funding to their schools through locally agreed funding formulae. All local authorities have benefited from the significant increases in funding that this Government have committed to education since 1997 and are set to receive an average increase of 14 per cent. per pupil in dedicated schools grant over the next two years.</p>

	<p pid="e.588W.3/1">The Special Educational Needs (SEN) Code of Practice provides practical advice to local authorities, maintained schools and other settings on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children's SEN. The code helps these bodies make effective decisions but it does not, and could not, tell them what to do in each individual case. The code sets out a graduated approach to providing support. This involves regular reviews of the impact, on a child's progress, of support that is additional to or different from that which is provided as part of the school's usual differentiated curriculum offer and strategies.</p>
	<p pid="e.588W.3/2">The SEN Code states that all children with SEN should be offered full access to a broad, balanced and relevant education, including the National Curriculum (NC). Pupil progress is assessed at the end of each key stage against the NC levels and this applies to pupils both with and without SEN. Pupils working below level 1 of the NC can be assessed using the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority guidance: &quot;Planning, teaching, and assessing the curriculum for pupils with learning difficulties&quot;, which provides eight level descriptions leading up to NC level 1.</p>
	<p pid="e.588W.3/3">The development of the New Relationship with Schools brings a focus on how well schools meet the needs of all their pupils. All schools will carry out an annual self-evaluation and publish a single plan setting out their priorities for improvement in which they will need to show how all their pupils are achieving. This process will highlight any gaps in achievement between different groups of children, which will then be discussed with a locally appointed School Improvement Partner.</p>

Proposed trust schools will need to act in the same way, as with any other foundation school without a foundation. For parents seeking a place at an academy, academies are obliged by virtue of their funding agreements with the Secretary of State to consent to being named on statements unless admitting the child would be incompatible with the efficient education of other children and no reasonable steps may be made to secure compatibility.</p>

	<p pid="e.591W.2/1">The information requested is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="e.591W.2/2">In order to be awarded Qualified Teacher Status, trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the statutory Special Educational Needs code of practice, know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN, can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of individual pupils, including those with SEN, and can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="e.591W.2/3">The Standards for the Induction Support Programme for those awarded QTS also require that Newly Qualified Teachers can demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement, and in consultation with the SEN Co-ordinator, can contribute to the preparation and implementation of individual education plans or the equivalent.</p>
	<p pid="e.591W.2/4">Once qualified, all teachers are expected to identify their development needs through performance management arrangements, and to address identified needs by undertaking appropriate professional development. This can include strengthening SEN knowledge in areas such as dyslexia. All schools receive a School Development Grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning, including training. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN.</p>

	<p pid="e.592W.8/1">Since April 2001, all new building work at schools has been subject to the Building Regulations, which are the responsibility of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). These regulations do not currently require the installation of sprinklers in schools, but that does not prohibit local education authorities from specifying their use.</p>
	<p pid="e.592W.8/2">We believe that the decision on whether to install sprinklers is best taken locally. For example, in our Managing School Facilities Guide 6, &quot;Fire Safety&quot;, we give the example of a school in an area of high arson risk as being a suitable candidate for having sprinklers installed. However, we recognised the need to provide more detailed advice than before. Liaising with ODPM, we therefore produced new draft guidance on fire safety&mdash;Building Bulletin (BB) 100, &quot;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools&quot;. It stresses the value of using risk assessments to determine what sort of fire detection and alarm systems should be used in each school, and whether or not sprinklers should be installed. Public consultation on the draft of BB 100 was completed in November last year and an analysis of the responses should be finalised next month. We expect to be able to publish the final version by September this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.592W.8/3">Concurrently ODPM is carrying out a review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations, Part B, and its accompanying guidance Approved Document B (ADB). Public consultation on draft revised versions of these was also completed in November. An analysis of responses should be finalised around the end of March.</p>

	<p pid="e.595W.0/1">Our 1997 Manifesto acknowledged that children are not all of the same ability, nor do they learn at the same speed and recommended setting children in classes by ability to maximise progress.</p>
	<p pid="e.595W.0/2">We have encouraged schools to use setting since 1997, and putting children in ability groups within a class is now commonplace in primary schools. In secondary schools the majority of lessons in English, mathematics, science and modern foreign languages are set by ability and evidence suggests that there are more young people taught in ability sets now, than in 1997. However, schools are best placed to know the learning needs of their pupils and must use their own professional judgement to decide when and how to group pupils and set by ability.</p>
	<p pid="e.595W.0/3">We will continue through the National Strategies and our Gifted and Talented programme to offer advice and guidance to schools on classroom practice so that they can make decisions about how to use pupil setting as part of their overall commitment to personalising and tailoring learning to meet the needs of all their pupils.</p>

In 2004&ndash;05 we estimate that of the &pound;2.47 billion (face value) loans issued to students in that year, the future write off costs over the lifetime of those loans will be some &pound;124 million.

	<p pid="e.595W.6/1">Student loans are only repayable when borrowers reach the repayment threshold of &pound;15,000 and most loans are collected by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) through the Pay As You Earn or Self Assessment tax system. There can be delays in matching up the information provided by the Student Loans Company (SLC) about a borrower's loan account with the relevant tax records. The Department has agreed a series of process improvements with both HMRC and the SLC to ensure loan accounts can be linked more effectively to national insurance numbers and there are performance measures for both organisations aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the repayment system. It is too early to give a view on the success of these measures.</p>
	<p pid="e.595W.6/2">We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target, including increasing the proportion of student loans repayments due which are collected. These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department's Autumn Performance Report and will report further progress in the Departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April.</p>

	<p pid="e.601W.3/16">The Minimum Training Allowance (MTA) is &pound;40 per week and is paid to unwaged trainees. The LSC has responsibility for the MTA and holds the information about the detailed expenditure on the MTA for unwaged trainees. Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, has written to the hon.

	<p pid="e.601W.3/18" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question where you asked the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, what the cost was of minimum training allowances for unwaged trainees on work based learning in (a) 2003&ndash;04, (b) 2004&ndash;05 and (c) 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="e.601W.3/19" class="indent">In the academic year 2003/04 the LSC expended &pound;77m on allowances for young people. In 2004/05 this reduced to &pound;67m. This reduction is due to more apprentices being employed on the first day of their training meaning that the employer pays a wage of at least &pound;80 per week. Currently only 15% of apprentices do not receive a wage directly from their employer.</p>
	<p pid="e.601W.3/20" class="indent">The 2005/06 academic year is still in progress and will see the introduction of Educational Maintenance Allowances to replace the Minimum Training Allowances in WBL. This transition will bring to an end the inequalities between allowances in WBL and Further Education.</p>
	<p pid="e.601W.3/21" class="indent">The main impact of this change will be that those apprentices and learners on Entry to Employment (E2E) who are not receiving a wage will receive EMA and family benefits such as Child Benefit, Child Tax Credits and Income Support.</p>

	<p pid="e.603W.2/2">We are concerned that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils are among the lowest achieving in our schools. In 2003 the Government launched a national strategy to tackle the underachievement of minority ethnic pupils. This included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting Gypsy, Roma and Traveller young people, including a national pilot project testing strategies to improve attendance and raise attainment.</p>
	<p pid="e.603W.2/3">The findings from this pilot have informed the development of a national programme of work to support local authorities and schools with large numbers of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils to better meet their needs. This will be launched in April 2006 and follows up a commitment we made in the Schools White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="e.604W.5/1">National truancy sweeps in England have been co-ordinated by the Department since December 2002. The sweeps usually take place during the autumn and spring terms. Data are collected from each local authority (LA) which participates in the national sweeps. We do not collect data on the length of time spent on the sweeps by either local authority staff or police officers.</p>
	<p pid="e.604W.5/2">The Government believe that truancy sweeps are an effective tool to raise the profile of school attendance in the community and help to stop those pupils who may be in the early stages of drifting into the habit of truancy. They also reinforce the message to pupils and their families that school and LAs take the issue of attendance seriously. Since nationally co-ordinated sweeps began in 2002 some 92,000 pupils have been stopped: 37,000 (nearly 40 per cent.) of them were out of school without a valid reason and 42 per cent. (almost 16,000) of those without a valid reason were with an adult.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-02-27e.53902.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-02-27e.607W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="607W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060227/text/60227158.htm#60227158.html_spnew1">
	<p pid="e.607W.2/1">The Department and its partners undertake regular analysis to forecast future higher education student numbers and have done so for a number of years. For example, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) produced a report on future supply and demand in higher education in 2001 (2001/62) and subsequent publications by the Higher Education Policy Institute (e.g. Bekhradnia, 2005 &quot;Demand for Higher Education to 2015&ndash;16&quot;, HEPI) have updated on this analysis since.</p>
	<p pid="e.607W.2/2">Meanwhile, the Department and its partners continue to monitor actual levels of participation drawing on a number of sources (including UCAS data and Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) records) and have for example, also undertaken research to explore better ways of monitoring participation and conducted evaluation of the impact of policies designed to increase aspiration and attainment to secure future HE participation among under-represented groups (see for example DfES research publication references RR676 and RR649). HEFCE's report on &quot;Young Participation in Higher Education&quot; (2005/03) which considers the period 1994&ndash;2000 and monitors changes in overall participation rates year on year, is also worthy of highlighting in this context.</p>
	<p pid="e.607W.2/3">There have of course also been a number of independent reviews which have informed Government policy in this area over the last 15 years. These have variously explored actual patterns and anticipated future demand for HE. Of relevance here for example is the year long National Committee of Inquiry chaired by Sir Ron (now Lord) Bearing which in 1997 published the report &quot;Higher Education in the Learning Society&quot;. More recently, Professor Steven Schwartz, ex-Vice Chancellor of Brunei university, led an independent review of admissions practices and published a set of recommendations in 2004 for good practice in fair admissions to higher education.</p>
	<p pid="e.607W.2/4">From academic year 2006/07, no student will have to pay their fees upfront and they will only have to repay what they owe once they are earning &pound;15,000 or more. Students from poorer backgrounds will be entitled to non-repayable maintenance grants and other forms of support, such as bursaries, are available from individual universities via their access agreements. The Department conducted a review of the international evidence to explore the likely implications of these reforms on future HE participation. This review (&quot;Variable fees&mdash;the international evidence&quot;, 2004) showed that higher differential fees can be introduced without adversely affecting the participation of students from less well-off families, particularly when backed up by fee deferral arrangements. Nevertheless, we will be conducting a full evaluation of the impact of the new student support arrangements to inform the independent review due to report to Parliament in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="e.608W.2/1">The Government remains fully committed to widening participation in higher education for reasons of social justice and economic need.</p>
	<p pid="e.608W.2/2">We have reformed the student finance arrangements so that, in England, from 2006, no full-time student will have to pay fees up-front, nor will they repay anything until they leave higher education (HE) and are earning a reasonable wage. We are introducing a new up-front maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,700 a year, targeted at lower income households, and a bigger maintenance loan to meet average basic living costs. The steady state costs of these arrangements will be &pound;600 million each year for fee loans, &pound;860 million for the new maintenance grant, and &pound;510 million for maintenance loans.</p>
	<p pid="e.608W.2/3">Alongside our reforms to student finance, we have established the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). To date, OFFA has approved some 180 access agreements from institutions wishing to charge higher level fees from 2006. These will make available over &pound;300 million in financial support to students from low income backgrounds and an additional &pound;35 million in outreach.</p>
	<p pid="e.608W.2/4">In addition, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has allocated &pound;282 million to higher education institutions in 2005&ndash;06 to help offset the costs associated with recruiting and retaining students from groups under-represented in HE. HEFCE is currently working with the sector to assess the impact of the allocation.</p>
	<p pid="e.608W.2/5">The Aimhigher programme seeks to raise aspirations and attainment levels among those currently under-represented in HE. Aimhigher is subject to a comprehensive evaluation strategy, organised in partnership with HEFCE and the Learning and Skills Council. It includes surveys of young people, educational providers and Aimhigher partnerships, conducted by independent research organisations. The evaluation seeks to identify what works, and to use this to inform further policy development and delivery. Evidence to date is mainly from the first years of Excellence Challenge, a predecessor programme. It shows that the type of activities now supported by Aimhigher have made an impact on aspirations and attainment. The budget for Aimhigher for the 2005&ndash;06 academic year is &pound;102 million.</p>

These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Departments Autumn Performance Report and will report further progress in the Departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April.</p>

	<p pid="e.610W.2/1">The 13 Wider Opportunities pilots have come to an end but have certainly informed our wider policy for instrumental and vocal tuition at KS2. Guidance based on the pilots will be issued to schools at the end of this month to help them make best use of their new music allocation of &pound;26 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.610W.2/2">During 2006&ndash;2007, schools will receive &pound;3 million to take forward this work. &pound;1 million will be invested in musical instruments and &pound;1 million in workforce development. In addition to their &pound;60 million baseline allocation, music services will receive &pound;1.5 million specifically to expand instrumental provision at KS2.</p>
	<p pid="e.610W.2/3">During 2007&ndash;08, a further &pound;25 million will be invested&mdash;&pound;23 million for schools, and &pound;2 million for instruments and workforce development.</p>

	<p pid="e.610W.5/1">Statutory responsibility for supporting young carers who have been assessed as children in need lies with the local authorities concerned, and my Department issued guidance with the Department of Health in August 2005 on the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 and the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="e.610W.5/2">Further education and higher education institutions are self-governing independent bodies. Each institution is responsible for its own arrangements to widen participation and to facilitate their students' access to learning.</p>
	<p pid="e.610W.5/3">The Department's guidance to administrators of the discretionary Access to Learning Fund covers students with caring responsibilities, although this is chiefly designed with adult carers in mind. Young carers in full time education-that is, with at least 12 guided learning hours per week-may be eligible for Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs). Although in general a weekly allowance payment is only made to a student where they have attended all required sessions, a college has discretion to authorise an absence caused by caring responsibilities. Learning providers should not, however, authorise a student's absences regularly for this reason.</p>
	<p pid="e.610W.5/4">Where caring responsibilities are frequently interrupting attendance patterns, there is a need for institutions to explore solutions personally with the learner Best practice recommended by DfES Circular 10/99 is to offer a learner with caring responsibilities a named member of staff to contact when they are unable to attend, and examine whether alternative care arrangements can be made. This may entail a learning provider renegotiating a learner's attendance pattern to accommodate their commitments, whilst still meeting the minimum number of hours required under their personal learning agreement.</p>
	<p pid="e.610W.5/5">Young carers aged over 16 who provide at least 35 hours of care a week may be entitled to Carer's Allowance, where they are undertaking less that 21 hours a week of supervised study, and institutions will need to take this into account when considering appropriate arrangements for enabling young carers to access learning.</p>
