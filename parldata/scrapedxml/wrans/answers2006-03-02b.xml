(54796)</p>
	<p pid="b.851W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics has entered a contract with Siemens Business Services to digitise records for birth, marriage and death information held by the Registrar General for purposes of producing certified copies of the entry on request.</p>
	<p pid="b.851W.5/5" class="indent">The records that are going to be digitised are copies of the birth, marriage and death records held by the Registrar General for England and Wales at the General Register Office. The original records, which are the entries in registers held locally around the country at register offices, are not being sent to India.</p>
	<p pid="b.851W.5/6" class="indent">Information in civil registration records is accessible by any person within the legal frame work that governs the issue of certified copies of entries in birth, marriage and death registers (certificates). Digitisation of these records will not change the position. Access will continue to only be via certificates.</p>
	<p pid="b.851W.5/7" class="indent">The Registrar General is sent a certified copy of all entries made in registers of live-births, still-births, marriages and deaths. These form the central archive of civil registration records in England and Wales and for many years have been microfilmed by the Registrar General for the purposes of producing certificates on request. A digital image will be created in the UK from these microfilmed records. These images will be encrypted to ensure they cannot be accessed illegally and sent electronically to India.</p>
	<p pid="b.851W.5/8" class="indent">Some fields will be data-captured by operators based in India, fully supported by sophisticated computer techniques including character recognition software and look up tables of English and Welsh names and place names.</p>
	<p pid="b.851W.5/9" class="indent">There will be strict security and audit controls built into the process including physical security of data and vetting of staff. Once these fields and images have been subjected to rigorous data quality and validation checks, the images and data will be returned to the UK for further validation and quality assurance before acceptance testing is undertaken by General Register Office staff based in Southport. Once the General Register Office has accepted the digitised records, all images and data records held on off-shore computers will be deleted. The size of the contract to carry out the digitisation of these records required the Registrar General to follow rules governing public procurement in the European Union and therefore advertise for tenders via the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU). We have ensured that an open and competitive tender was carried out where the short-listed suppliers were selected after a transparent and thorough evaluation. The OJEU process does not allow for the General Register Office to restrict contract work to be carried out only in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.851W.5/10" class="indent">The General Register Office will continue to issue certificates and therefore staff will continue to be employed to carry out this work. The digitisation of civil registration records will enable certificates to be supplied more efficiently and provide improved services for customers.</p>

	<p pid="b.852W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-27">27 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question about what assessment of the accuracy of the most recent population figures provided by the Office for National Statistics has been made for West Lancashire. (52777)</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/4" class="indent">Population estimates are calculated using an internationally respected methodology. Further information can be found in the detailed methodology guide &quot;Making a population estimate in England and Wales'. This is published here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product</a>,asp?vlnk=575</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/5" class="indent">It is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate the size of the population because of changes in society, which include increased mobility and different living arrangements. The decennial Census provides a benchmark against which national and sub-national population estimates can be assessed. Substantial work has been done on the difference between mid-year population estimates and the 2001 Census. This work is summarised in the final report of the 2004 Local Authority Population Studies, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/6" class="indent">These studies confirmed that the 2001 Census had worked well in most areas, including West Lancashire, but there were a few cases where the adjustment for under-enumeration was not able to adjust sufficiently for exceptional circumstances. This work, together with revised international migration estimates, accounted for a large proportion of the initial 1.1 million difference between mid year estimates and the Census; reducing the difference to a little over 0.2 million</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/7" class="indent">In addition, extensive annual quality assurance is undertaken in order to ensure the accuracy of the annual mid-year estimates. Quality assurance starts with detailed checking of the source data used in the components of change (birth, deaths, etc.). Procedures are then in place to ensure that these data sources are correctly processed when deriving the estimates. The calculated national and sub-national estimates, for all 376 local authorities in England and Wales, are then subject to a further set of quality assurance procedures before they are published. These procedures include reviews of sex ratios and age profiles, comparisons of change over time, and comparisons of fertility and mortality rates. Substantial effort has already been undertaken, in recent years, to improve the quality assurance of population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/8" class="indent">ONS is also now investing substantially in a project to Improve Migration and Population Statistics (IMPS). (More information on this project can be found at: <a href="http://www-statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www-statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a>). The key aims of this project are to reduce the size of the difference between the 2011 Census results and the mid-year estimates and to better understand any difference that does remain. As part of this project, we are developing a data comparator tool to enable us to compare the annual mid-year estimates against a range of administrative sources. This work is ongoing and the results will inform our understanding of the accuracy of the mid-year population estimates. The tool was trialled in the mid-2004 population estimates, which were published in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/9" class="indent">Another strand of the IMPS project is a review of the quality assurance procedures that are currently in place for population estimates. One of the aims of this review is to assess what improvements can be made to existing procedures, and determine whether additional quality assurance is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/10" class="indent">ONS also produces population projections for each local authority area. The methodology used in the production of the subnational population projections is an established and recognised methodology. Subnational population projections undergo extensive quality assurance before publication. In addition, local authorities and health authorities are consulted on the first year of migration assumptions used as the baseline trend for migration.</p>
	<p pid="b.852W.2/11" class="indent">Population estimates and projections are supplied to the QDPM, I understand that ODPM make checks to ensure that the data as provided by the ONS have been correctly entered into their calculations for allocating Formula Grant to local authorities.

	<p pid="b.856W.5/15">The Home Office introduced a National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) that all police forces across England and Wales were required to adopt from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. The NCRS had the effect of increasing the number of recorded crimes by an average of 22 per cent. in all forces in England and Wales.

Since 1996 Ofwat has assessed water company performance against leakage targets that balance the needs of customers and the environment. This approach has resulted in a reduction in leakage of around 29 per cent. since its peak in 1994&ndash;95. Most water companies are now at their economic level of leakage which is the level of leakage at which it would cost more to make further reductions than to produce water from another source.</p>

	<p pid="b.857W.6/1">Clause 12 of the Childcare Bill, currently before Parliament, would place an extended duty on English local authorities to provide information on services, facilities or publications which may be of benefit to parents, prospective parents, children and young persons in their area. Children and young persons include all persons up to their 20th birthday. The Bill builds on the current duty in section 118A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, as amended by section 149 of the 2002 Education Act, to provide information on the provision of child care and related services. Authorities fulfil the duty by running children's information services (CISs). Many CISs are already making good progress in extending their services. We will encourage local authorities to move towards ensuring their information services provide the facilities envisaged in the Bill, so that, subject to parliamentary approval, the full service is ready when the duty comes into force, which is planned for April 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.858W.2/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a statutory responsibility to plan and fund high quality education and training to deliver Government's priorities and targets for post-16 learning and skills. The LSC's &quot;agenda for change&quot; published in August 2005 set out proposals for a programme of radical transformation in response to the challenge of developing an effective, efficient and dynamic learning and skills sector. Their proposals, including those for simplifying funding and streamlining data collection and monitoring, have been well received by colleges and other providers in the sector. We have made significant progress by reducing the audit burden on colleges through abolishing the detailed end-year funding claim and reconciliation for most institutions. In addition, the inspectorates introduced a lighter touch inspection regime last year which will further reduce bureaucracy for providers. Building on &quot;Success for All&quot; and responding to the challenges set out by Sir Andrew Foster in &quot;Realising the Potential&quot; the Government will soon be publishing their own proposals for reforming the sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.858W.5/1">The National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services is a key element for delivering the Government's Every Child Matters agenda. It will help to deliver the five outcomes: being healthy and staying safe, enjoying and achieving, making a positive contribution and achieving economic well being. The NSF is a 10-year programme and by 2014 we expect health, social care and education services to have met the standards set out in it.</p>

	<p pid="b.860W.2/1">At the end of each school year (beginning in 2003) my Department collects the Foundation Stage Profile results from each of the 150 English local authorities. Using postcode data we identify the results of those children living in Sure Start Local Programme Areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.860W.2/2">Overall national summary data for FSP was first published in 2003 as 'Experimental Statistics' and in 2004 as 'National Statistics'. However, a background of ongoing improvements to teacher assessment and moderation make it very difficult to draw meaningful statistical judgements about the progress made in Sure Start areas in the last three years. The dataset for 2005 is not strictly comparable with the results in earlier years. My Department considers that the 2005 figures represent the most robust baseline against which progress in Sure Start areas can be effectively monitored. The figures for 2005 are shown in the tables.</p>

	<p pid="b.860W.2/113">The final figures on the Foundation Stage Profile in England were published in Statistical First Release 03/2006 &quot;Foundation Stage Profile 2005: National Results (Final)&quot; on February 16, a copy of which is available on my Department's website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/">www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.863W.5/1">The available figures on the social background of students obtaining places on full-time undergraduate courses in the UK are shown in the following tables; information on the family income of these students is not held centrally. The figures are limited to students who applied to full-time undergraduate courses via the various application organisations, and they do not therefore cover part-time students nor those full-time students who apply directly to higher education institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.863W.5/2">Since 1994, figures have been published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). In previous years, figures were published separately by the Universities Central Council on Admissions (UCCA), which covered applicants to universities funded by the Universities Funding Council (UGC), and the Polytechnics Central Admissions System (PCAS), which covered the polytechnics and higher education colleges. UCAS, UCCA and PCAS all published figures for institutions in the UK, and PCAS did not collect details of social background prior to 1991.</p>

	<p pid="b.872W.9/1">During war fighting operations minefields are breached rather than cleared, to maintain our tempo and freedom of manoeuvre. On non-war fighting operations comprehensive mine clearance is generally undertaken by humanitarian organisations, rather than the armed forces. Unmanned surface vehicles have some utility in such mine clearance, and humanitarian deminers use unmanned flails as part of the process. However this is still followed up with hand clearance for complete assurance that the area is clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.872W.9/2">Within our armed forces, Royal Engineer Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams use the Redfire remotely controlled vehicle to deal with mines that have strayed out of minefields in the Falklands. Our future armoured minefield breaching vehicle, Trojan, and the Terrier engineer vehicle also have a capability to be fitted for remote operation during minefield breaching operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.874W.7/1">The Afghan Government has expressed its opposition to licit cultivation of opium. The Afghan Minister for Counter Narcotics, Habibullah Qaderi has said recently:</p>
	<p pid="b.874W.7/2" class="indent">&quot;The poor security situation in the country means there can simply be no guarantee that opium will not be smuggled out of the country for the illicit narcotics trade abroad. Without an effective control mechanism, a lot of opium will still be refined into heroin for illicit markets in the west and elsewhere. We could not accept this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.874W.7/3">The UK agrees that licensing opium cultivation in Afghanistan for medical use is not a realistic solution to its drug problem, not least because it risks a high level of diversion of licit opium into illegal channels. The production of opium is also contrary to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.874W.7/4">It is also unlikely that licit Afghan opium would be economically viable as Afghanistan could not compete with countries currently producing licit opium such as Australia, France and Spain. Legalisation is against the approach set out in the Afghan Government's internationally endorsed national drug control strategy. Some progress in reducing illegal cultivation is being made but it will take time and will take even longer if farmers and traffickers believe that the ban on cultivation is open to challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.874W.7/5">Agriculture dominates the Afghan economy. Previously Afghanistan was a major exporter of horticulture and livestock products. However, 25 years of war and civil conflict and the recent drought have seriously affected Afghanistan's agriculture sector. Developing this sector is critical for economic growth, poverty reduction and for tackling opium poppy cultivation. Although no other crop can compete with poppy in terms of economic return to farmers, there are several promising and profitable legal alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.874W.7/6">DFID leads the British Government's efforts to develop alternative livelihoods to opium production in Afghanistan. In financial year 2005&ndash;06, we are spending over &pound;45 million for this purpose. This is an almost tenfold increase on the amount spent in 2003&ndash;04. In financial year 2006&ndash;07 spending is expected to continue at similar levels. A proportion of this funding will continue to be specifically targeted on improving agricultural opportunities for Afghan farmers. This includes research to help identify, test and implement new crops and technologies. Examples include improvements in health and husbandry for livestock, apricot drying, honey bee keeping, and the introduction of fruit tree nurseries and greenhouses for vegetable production. DFID has also jointly funded with United States Agency for International Development a $25 million nationwide programme to increase access to seeds and fertiliser for over 500,000 farmers for alternative crops.</p>
	<p pid="b.874W.7/7">At the same time as developing agricultural opportunities, DFID is also promoting the development of non-farm alternative livelihoods by supporting national programmes of the Government of Afghanistan which are helping to increase access to credit and improve infrastructure for farmers to transport their produce to markets.</p>

	<p pid="b.876W.2/1">Over the past few months, the Government of Angola has indicated that the time has passed for a traditional donors' conference where donors pledge resources. At the same time, some members of the international community as well as members of the Angolan Government have suggested that a partners' conference would be more appropriate at this stage in the country's reconstruction and development.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/2">The main outcomes of such as event would be to secure a closer working relationship between the Government of Angola and the international community on development objectives: a formal agreement to continue open dialogue including on issues such as governance and transparency and further steps to improve aid effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/3">DFID and the FCO have agreed to consult the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the other bilateral donors in Angola about their interest in a partners' conference involving government, donors, the private sector and civil society. These consultations have only recently started and have not yet reached any clear conclusions</p>

	<p pid="b.876W.5/1">DFID has conducted fiduciary risk assessments in all 10 countries, in advance of agreeing commitments of poverty reduction budget support or other types of aid. These assessments involve an analysis (with recommendations for strengthening where appropriate) of the partner countries' public financial management and accountability systems&mdash;including the effectiveness of their auditors-general and other control mechanisms such as internal audit.

	<p pid="b.877W.3/1">EU members states and the European Commission are partners with DFID in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The European Commission is the second biggest donor in the DRC (&euro;227 million in 2005) after the World Bank. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany also have aid programmes in the DRC. The EC, France, Belgium, Germany and the UK are all developing new plans for development assistance to the DRC over the course of 2006. We are working together to try and ensure that our activities are complementary.</p>
	<p pid="b.877W.3/2">Given the extent of humanitarian and development needs, the international community has given insufficient aid to the DRC. I wrote to Kofi Annan on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-08">8 February</phrase> welcoming the launch of the 2006 UN action plan for the DRC, which made clear the level of unmet need in the country, and asked donors to give $681 million in support of humanitarian programmes. The UK has pledged &pound;60 million over two years to this plan, and encouraged European and other donors to contribute significant funds as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.877W.3/3">In my letter to Kofi Annan, I also stressed the importance of meeting all needs, no matter where poor people are or the cause of their suffering. The east of the DRC, which has suffered most from the conflict, has traditionally benefited more from development and humanitarian assistance than other regions, but there are other areas of the country with equal or greater needs that also need support. The UN action plan seeks to address humanitarian needs across the country, irrespective of geographical location and cause. We are working with the UN, European and other counterparts to achieve this. There is also recognition among the donor community that urgent humanitarian and longer term development needs in the DRC should be addressed in parallel.</p>

	<p pid="b.878W.2/1">Monitoring of the use of UK aid to the Democratic Republic of Congo is conducted in accordance with standard DFID procedures that apply across all of the Department's programmes. For our bilateral aid, organisations implementing projects on behalf of DFID are required to submit regular, usually quarterly, financial and narrative reports on their activities. In addition, projects over &pound;1 million require a full review to be undertaken at least annually with recommendations for actions to maximise impact and a final completion report, including the lessons learned to inform future work. Regular monitoring by DFID staff, who remain closely in touch with partner organisations throughout the duration of a project, is also an important part of the monitoring process.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.2/2">All multilateral agencies have their own internal monitoring and evaluation systems and DFID's work on reforming the international system has included helping to strengthen these systems to deliver results at a country level. An example is DFID's use of the Multilateral Effectiveness Framework to assess the performance of multilateral agencies and make recommendations for improvement. The UK has a seat on the board of multilateral organisations, and is therefore involved in multilateral decision making including the development and review of country strategies and programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.2/3">DFID also works jointly with multilateral agencies on many projects. DFID in the DRC works with multilateral agencies and other bilateral donors on justice, infrastructure, humanitarian, police, governance, HIV/AIDS and social sector projects. Working together in this way enables DFID to design, monitor and evaluate these programmes jointly with other donor organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.2/4">One of the most important ways in which we monitor multilateral agencies' work is through daily discussion, sharing information and ideas between DFID staff in DRC and partners in the European Commission, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and United Nations, on both the development of their overall strategies for DRC and the implementation of individual programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.878W.5/1">The Government acknowledge the damaging impact that dumping and trade-distorting subsidies have on developing countries, particularly on their agriculture. We fully support the commitment made at the WTO Doha ministerial meeting in 2001, which agreed that agriculture negotiations would aim to achieve: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/2">On export subsidies, there was progress at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial held in Hong Kong in December. It was agreed that export subsidies would be completely eliminated by 2013, subject to movement in other areas of the negotiations. The UK wanted the end date to be 2010, but there will be frontloading and substantial reductions in these particularly damaging subsidies early in the implementation period.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/3">The package of reforms to the EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) agreed in June 2003 and May 2004 mark a significant shift in the EU's agricultural policy. The decoupling of subsidies from production should connect European farmers much more closely to the market and have real impacts on reducing excessive production, which results in dumping and harms developing countries. The Government will continue to push for further reform of the EU's agricultural policy and I welcome the fact that the EU Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that the EU plays a full and constructive role in the WTO agriculture negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.5/4">The Doha Development Agenda represents an important opportunity to make a significant contribution to reducing global poverty. The UK Government are working to achieve an outcome that delivers real gains for developing countries, including the poorest. These gains should include improved participation by developing countries in the world trading system, through substantially increased market access for developing countries and the dismantling of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies by industrialised countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.880W.2/1">Between April 2003 and December 2005, DFID spent &pound;210,000 preparing DFID civil servants and consultants for deployment to Iraq. This covers pre-deployment hostile environment training, plus necessary equipment such as satellite phones, body armour, flak jackets and helmets. Our records do not disaggregate this figure between our own staff and project consultants or between UK and non UK personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/2">DFID civil servants working on the Iraq programme in this period have cost &pound;4.4 million. This includes salaries, overseas allowances, transfer costs and travel. Of this amount, &pound;3 million was disbursed on salaries. Again, our records do not disaggregate these costs between those staff working in London and those working in Iraq, or between UK and non UK personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/3">Most non-civil service personnel deployed to Iraq are engaged not individually, but through bigger contracts to implement projects. The total cost to DFID of all consultancy contracts in Iraq during this period was &pound;31.4 million. Our records do not disaggregate this figure between fees, reimbursables and programme costs, or between preparation and deployment costs. Consultants receive fees rather than salaries, so it may be helpful to know that the average fees paid for a consultant working for DFID in Iraq are between &pound;700 to &pound;1,250 a day.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.2/4">In addition to the above costs, DFID also meets essential life support costs for all DFID staff and consultants who work in or visit Iraq. This includes security, transport, medical services, food and accommodation; we expect to disburse &pound;55 million on this life-support between April 2003 and the end of the current financial year, ending <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>. This support is necessary and integral to the effective delivery of the humanitarian and reconstruction programmes that we run.</p>

Our development assistance to Mauritius is primarily channelled through our contributions to the EC and UN programmes there. The UK contributes 12.7 per cent. to the European Development Fund, which delivers funds to ACP countries, including Mauritius. The EC has allocated 43 million euros for development activities in Mauritius between 2001 and 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.883W.0/1">DFID supports the Government of South Africa in three priority areas: growth, jobs and equity; HIV/AIDS and vulnerability; and governance, democracy and service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.883W.0/2">DFID's work on growth, jobs and equity helps to access poor people to South Africa's formal economy so that they can benefit from the resources which are already available (in areas such as land, and finance) but from which they are currently excluded. It also helps South Africa translate the growth in its economy into jobs. Secondly, work on HIV/AIDS and vulnerability helps South Africa to tackle its growing HIV/AIDS pandemic, through supporting a range of partners (National and Provincial Governments, civil society groups and the private sector) across a range of activities from prevention, through care, support and treatment to mitigating the impacts of HIV on communities and society. Following the crop failures and resulting hunger which hit Southern Africa in late 2002, and DFID's response of providing more than &pound;150 million in food aid, DFID SA took on a new role of developing a longer term regional response to food insecurity in Southern Africa. Work on this, along with work on social protection issues, has been incorporated into our work on HIV/AIDS, under a broader vulnerability theme. Thirdly, DFID's work on governance, democracy and service delivery helps South Africa deliver quality public services in an equitable way to all citizens. A particular focus has been reform and capacity building of provincial and local government to strengthen their delivery of basic services, including education and health. Our bilateral budget for South Africa in 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;23 million.</p>

The Regional plan will tackle cross boundary issues in growth, jobs and equity; resilient livelihoods; and peace/security. Examples of areas where DFID plans to support work under the Regional plan include trans-boundary water management; transport infrastructure; customs border posts; treatment and prevention of infectious diseases in the region.</p>

	<p pid="b.886W.2/52">1. An old scheme application is defined as cleared if the case is closed or a maintenance assessment has been carried out. In addition, an application is also counted as cleared if the parent with care (PWC) is identified as claiming good cause or the PWC is subject to a reduced benefit decision. This differs slightly to the definition of a new scheme clearance (see below) and figures from the two schemes will therefore only be broadly, and not directly, comparable.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.2/1">In July 1999, the White Paper, &quot;Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation&quot; announced the Government's intention to invest &pound;1 million in installing automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in busy public places such as railway stations, airports, coach stations and ferry ports. A further &pound;1 million was then committed to training people employed at the site in their use and in basic life support.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.2/2">In April 2000, the Metro Centre shopping complex was the first public place in which AEDs were installed. Nine further public places (sites) received AEDs, completing the pilot phase of the programme and in November 2002, phase one of the programme was completed. This resulted in 110 sites receiving 681 AEDs and over 6,050 people receiving training in basic life support skills and the use of an AED. These AEDs were mainstreamed to the national health service as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.2/3">Evidence suggests that 71 lives have been saved as a result of the programme. This information is derived from stakeholders; sites report incident activity to the manager of the national defibrillator programme within 48 hours. On notification from a site or the Department, the manufacturers download data from the AED and forward to the Department within 72 hours. The manager then liaises with ambulance trusts and receiving hospitals, as the download data can be used for diagnosis and follow up treatment if the resuscitation has been successful. Patient confidentiality precludes the Department from insisting on identification and outcomes of the patients so the actual survival rates could be much higher.</p>

	<p pid="b.907W.5/1">There has been a major improvement in the oral health of adults. The 1998 National Adult Dental Health survey showed that the proportion of adults with no natural teeth had fallen from 37 per cent. in 1968 to 12 per cent. in 1998. However, as was recognised in the 'Report of the Primary Care Dental Workforce Review' published in 2004, people who keep their teeth have a greater need for oral hygiene advice and restorative dental treatment. This additional demand was one of the reasons why, in response to the report, we took measures to expand the dental work force by recruiting the equivalent of over 1,400 whole-time national health service dentists (comparing October 2005 with April 2004) and providing for an extra 170 dental training places each year from 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.910W.5/1">Cheshire and Merseyside Strategic Health Authority reports that a time-limited arrangement, agreed between Warrington Primary Care Trust (PCT) and the Culcheth Village Dental Practice, has seen a second dentist at the practice since August 2005. The dentist has been salaried through short-term funding, allocated by the Department in October 2005 which ends on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>. From April 2006, the national health service will be implementing major reforms to dentistry. New contracts for dentists will abolish the traditional fee per item remuneration system and support new ways of working with a greater focus on preventative care. Evidence from personal dental services pilot schemes is that these new ways of working free up significant capacity that dentists can then use in part to see a greater range of patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.912W.14/1">Control totals are an internal financial management tool used for the operational management of the national health service. The reason for having control totals is to bring strategic health authorities (SHAs) as close as possible to financial balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.14/2">The control totals are set in agreement with SHAs. They are used to inform performance management discussions across SHAs' health economies. It would be inappropriate to publish the control totals during the financial year, as it may have implications for performance discussions held with NHS organisations, and the ability of the Department and all SHAs to discharge their performance management function.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.14/3">In 2005&ndash;06, spending control totals have been issued to the Department's three business groups. These have not been translated into individual budget underspends. The overall central programme is on target to deliver savings.</p>

	<p pid="b.918W.2/1">The main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology. Much of the funding for new drug development is provided by the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.2/2">The MRC funds a considerable programme of research that underpins scientific understanding of hospital acquired infections including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other antibiotic resistant pathogens. Within this portfolio there are currently no studies exclusive to MRSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.2/3">The Department has for some years recognised the importance of the control of hospital acquired infection, and the threat to public health posed by the increase in antimicrobial resistance. As part of a wide-ranging approach to these issues, the Department set up an advisory group to identify research priorities in 1999. The group's report, published in 2001, made recommendations for future research that led to a research programme that is currently underway.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.2/4">In 2003, the Department published &quot;Winning Ways&mdash;working together to reduce healthcare associated infection in England&quot;, a report that laid out a strategic approach to dealing with health care associated infections, including recommendations for further research. The report placed particular emphasis on activity aimed at preventing the occurrence and spread of infection.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.2/5">Currently available expenditure figures on MRC and Department's policy research programme research into hospital acquired infections are shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="b.919W.2/16">All diagnoses count of episodes&mdash;these figures represent a count of all finished consultant episode's (FCE) where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) record.</p>
	<p pid="b.919W.2/17">Finished consultant episodes&mdash;an FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultation with one health care provider.

	<p pid="b.919W.2/18">Deaths&mdash;HES data cannot be used to determine the cause of death of a patient while in hospital. Deaths recorded on the HES database may be analysed by the main diagnosis for which the patient was being treated during their stay in hospital, which may not necessarily be the underlying cause of death. For example, consider a patient admitted for a hernia operation (with a primary diagnosis of hernia), but who died from a heart attack. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) collect information on the cause of death, wherever it occurs, based on the death certificate and should be the source of data for analyses on cause of death.</p>
	<p pid="b.919W.2/19">Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&mdash;the primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&ndash;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.919W.2/20">Secondary diagnosis&mdash;as well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&ndash;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnosis relevant to the episode of care.</p>

	<p pid="b.920W.2/1">We recognise the systemic nature of many health care errors and are aware that a number of factors including involuntary automaticity and unconscious behaviour can contribute to adverse incidents in the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.920W.2/2">The Department therefore welcomed the recent report following an independent review of a serious adverse radiotherapy incident that occurred at Cookridge hospital which highlighted circumstances where involuntary automaticity may be triggered. Following the publication of the report, the deputy chief medical officer met with the report's authors to discuss the specific circumstances leading to the incident together with the wider implications. In the light of that, we have facilitated debate about involuntary automaticity, including a discussion at the European Union patient safety summit in November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.920W.2/3">As yet, it is difficult to determine the proportion of adverse incidents where involuntary automaticity is a contributing factor. However, overcoming this and other factors is built into our patient safety agenda and the work of the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA). For example, the NPSA's publication 'Right Patient, Right Care' included work on the bedside identity checking of patients receiving care.</p>

	<p pid="b.921W.8/2">The most recent full-year figures for new medicines approval times by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are for 2004&ndash;05. These show an average approval time, from receipt of the application to grant of the licence, of 288 calendar days. This period, however, includes the time taken by applicants to supply any necessary new or correcting information following the initial assessment of their application. When this is taken into account the actual number of net working days taken by the MHRA reduces to an average of 122 days. These figures apply to all types of new product licensing including products for over-the-counter (OTC) supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.8/3">For the relatively small number of completely new medicines, for example, those containing new drugs and with the potential for meeting unmet medical needs in major diseases, the MHRA, during the same period, has maintained its record of assessing these in under 40 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.8/4">For variations to OTC product licences, whether straightforward or complex, and again in the most recent full year for which figures are available, 2004&ndash;05, the average time taken to approve, from receipt of the application to grant of the variation, was 58 calendar days. This includes the time taken waiting for the company to provide any further information needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.922W.3/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is committed to developing regulation which is proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted and is considering how unnecessary regulatory burdens, primarily in relation to over the counter (OTC) medicines, could be eased.</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.3/3">To take this important initiative forward the MHRA is leading the better regulation of OTC medicines initiative (BROMI)&mdash;a broad ranging strategy group, which includes representatives from the Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), the non-proprietary sector, the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), and wider Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.3/4">The group first met in December 2005 at which the terms of reference were agreed and a work plan developed. The group is considering a range of options for easing unnecessary regulatory burdens in relation to OTC medicines and I have asked that BROMI delivers its first proposals to simplify regulatory burdens for OTC medicines in April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.928W.4/2">The Medical Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) Sentinel programme, began in 2002 following formal Government procurement processes. The expected life of the programme is 10 years and to date has cost around &pound;19 million which incorporates enhancements to the scope of the original programme. The MHRA is currently using Sentinel to handle all applications for marketing authorisations and variations, for clinical trial certificates and for import and export licences, as well as a range of internal corporate functions, and will soon extend Sentinel to pharmacovigilence, including new capabilities for signal generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.4/3">Recently assessment approval times have lengthened, mainly due to delays in validating applications, and assessment targets are not being met in a proportion of cases although urgent cases are being processed promptly. Some technical problems were encountered when parts of the Sentinel programme were implemented, which is not unusual for a project of this complexity, but those have been or are being resolved. Positive improvements have already been achieved and more are forecast. Sentinel's development is founded in its ability to handle electronic submissions and as industry increases its use of the external portal for this purpose, the workflow will be further streamlined.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.4/4">Sentinel completely revolutionises the MHRA's approach to information management and processing and will put the them in a leading position in its ability to handle electronic submissions, attract revenues from within and outside the United Kingdom and to remain a centre of excellence for medicines regulation. It will enable improved access to information to assist in the protection of public health and provide a better service to all its stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="b.929W.5/2">Erlotinib (Tarceva) for non-small cell lung cancer was granted a licence by the European Medicines Agency, in September 2005. The Department does not hold data on the number of people prescribed particular drugs but does hold data on the number of national health service prescriptions dispensed. There is no record of the drug having been issued in hospitals up to June 2005, though our information is not comprehensive and might not capture the use of the drug in clinical trials where it has not been dispensed at the NHS's expense. More recent data is not available due to the contractual restrictions on how data on drugs issued in hospitals can be used. The drug has not been prescribed in primary care up to September 2005. More recent data is currently not available due to National Statistics protocols.</p>

	<p pid="b.932W.2/1">Specialist support services form part of the Legal Services Commission's (LSC) special projects budget. Research undertaken by the LSC which underpins their consultation paper &quot;Making legal rights a reality&quot; points to an increasing demand for front line advice for the most needy.</p>
	<p pid="b.932W.2/2">Given the pressure on the limited legal aid budget and the number of clients needing legal advice, the LSC has concluded that the &pound;2.3 million will be redirected to fund direct legal advice in the next financial year. This will increase access to legal aid services for vulnerable people.</p>

	<p pid="b.935W.8/1">The labour cost adjustment (LCA) is the element of the local government funding formula that takes account of differences in local wage costs. It is calculated using wage data from each area cost adjustment (ACA) area. The majority of West Sussex is contained in the 'West Sussex Non-Fringe' ACA area. Crawley is contained in the 'Surrey, Berkshire and West Sussex Fringe'.</p>
	<p pid="b.935W.8/2">The LCA was calculated using information from the New Earnings Survey (NES) panel dataset for the 2004&ndash;05 local government finance settlement. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) replaced the NES in 2004, so the ASHE panel dataset was used to calculate the LCA in 2005&ndash;06. Following the formula review, we used the full ASHE dataset to calculate the LCA in 2006&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid="b.943W.8/1">The UK condemns all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith, wherever it happens and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned. We regularly urge states, where there is a systematic problem, to pursue laws and practices which foster tolerance and mutual respect and to protect religious minorities against discrimination, intimidation and attacks. While we have not recently raised this issue in all of the countries mentioned, specific examples of where we have been engaged in the last 12 months include:</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.8/2" class="indent">China: Freedom of religion was a focus of the last EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which took place under the UK presidency in October 2005. Individual cases of concern, including Christians, was also raised during an UK-led EU demarche on the Chinese Government in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.8/3" class="indent">Pakistan: The treatment of Christians and the repeal of Blasphemy Laws was raised during an EU demarche on human rights in December 2005. In November 2005, our high commissioner in Pakistan wrote to the Minister for Religious Affairs about the use of mosques to incite violence against Christians and the Archbishop of Canterbury, accompanied by members of the British high commission, raised the treatment of minorities in meetings with President Musharraf and Prime Minister Shauk Aziz.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.8/4" class="indent">India: Attacks on Christians and other minority groups was raised with Indian Officials during an EU human rights dialogue in December 2005 and again by our Deputy High Commissioner during his call on the National Human Rights Commission in January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.8/5" class="indent">Indonesia: We co-sponsored an international conference to promote inter-faith understanding and harmony with the Indonesian Government in July 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.8/6" class="indent">Iran: Ministers and officials have pressed Iran to address international concern over the freedom of religious minorities on several occasions. All EU member states co-sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution on human rights in Iran in December which expressed serious concern at the continuing discrimination, and other human rights violations against persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities, recognised or otherwise. During our EU presidency, we twice raised the case of the Christian Pastor and convert, Hamid Pourmand, imprisoned for allegedly deceiving the armed forces about his religion and spying. We continue to monitor Mr. Pourmand's case and the situation of Christians in Iran closely.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.8/7" class="indent">Saudi Arabia: We participated in an EU demarche in May 2005 during which the arrest of Christians for taking part in religious activities was raised.</p>

	<p pid="b.944W.8/1">The peace process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains fragile, but the country is making progress towards holding democratic elections by June 2006. It is crucial that all parties stick to this timetable, and work constructively towards free and fair elections. The key challenges of Security Sector Reform, ending corruption and promoting human rights still remain.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.8/2">Freedom of the press generally exists in the DRC, but harassment of journalists, including physical attacks, have recently increased. The UK has reminded the DRC authorities of their duty to protect freedom of expression and the rights of all vulnerable groups, including journalists. The UK drafted the EU-led Resolution on DRC, adopted at the 2005 UN General Assembly, which made clear that the DRC Government must do more to protect human rights defenders.</p>

	<p pid="b.946W.5/1">Since the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference concluded at the end of May 2005, there has been progress in much of the international non-proliferation regime. I described EU progress, which was made under the UK presidency in my answer today (UNI 44497) and steps we have taken since the Review Conference to strengthen the NPT in the answer I gave to the hon. Member on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-01-23.1803W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1803W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/2">The UK successfully chaired a meeting of states party of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in a discussion of codes of conduct for scientists and the substantive outcome of the meeting was published in a written statement I made to this House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-12-20.191WS"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 191&ndash;93WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/3">At the annual Conference of States Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, we were instrumental in the decision to extend the Conference action plan to achieve full national implementation by all states party which sets a series of tight deadlines for states party to take various implementing measures, including passing implementing legislation. It also lays down steps for dealing with countries that do nothing towards implementation.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/4">The UN Security Council's 1540 Committee continued its work to implement the provisions of the resolution, with many states, including the UK, submitting their second reports to the Committee. This followed the examination by experts appointed to the Committee of States' first reports, which highlighted areas where states were required to take action to implement the resolution in full.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/5">At a Diplomatic Conference of the International Maritime Organisation in London in October, States Party to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation agreed amendments to the Convention which, among other areas, will criminalise the transportation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and related material by sea, including dual-use equipment intended for a weapons programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/6">As part of the continuing engagement with Libya, the UK and US offered assistance in 2005 for the re-deployment and re-training of a number of Libyan scientists and technicians who were working on WMD programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/7">The Amendment on Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, agreed this year, significantly strengthened our key instrument for driving physical protection standards around the world. The Convention on Nuclear Terrorism, agreed in April 2005 with significant UK input, opened for signature in September. The UK was among dozens of states which signed the Convention straight away. The Convention includes measures which will reduce greatly the risk from terrorists using nuclear devices.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/8">As G8 President, we encouraged all states to adopt the International Atomic Energy Agencies Additional Protocol and worked with others to formulate appropriate incentives for countries to forego fuel-cycle facilities. The G8 Global Partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction made measurable progress on various programmes this year, from tackling the management of the stockpiles of spent nuclear fuel from decommissioned submarines in NW Russia to further progress on the construction of chemical weapons destruction facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/9">On WMD export control regimes, increasingly accepted around the world as important counter-proliferation mechanisms, we made progress towards agreeing criteria in the Nuclear Suppliers Group on transfers of enrichment and reprocessing technology, although final agreement has not yet been reached. We continued to play a lead role in the Australia Group's work countering biological and chemical weapons proliferation which, in its 25th year, marked in Sydney in June 2005, agreed significant control list amendments and admitted Ukraine to its membership. The Missile Technology Control Regime agreed our proposal for special scrutiny at trans-shipment points known to be used by the North Korean missile programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/10">The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) has continued to attract support from countries around the world, for example the endorsements of the Initiative by Argentina, Jordan, Iraq, and Georgia. We have played a full role in the Initiative, including the organisation of the global exercise Exploring Themis in November. In the same month, the first Regional Operational Experts Group was held in Hamburg. This new format will help further increase the co-ordination and sharing of best practice between supporters of the PSI, which in a short space of time has become a key tool in our efforts to improve global counter-proliferation capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/11">We pressed forward with our commitment to an international treaty on the trade in conventional arms, securing strong support from the EU in Council Conclusions agreed on <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase> and on <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase> with support from the Commonwealth for the start of a negotiation at the UN.</p>

Our general co-ordination of EU positions in numerous lobbying campaigns and multilateral meetings such as the United Nations General Assembly First Committee was acknowledged to be strong and helped convey the EU's policies clearly and positively. We made good progress on existing initiatives: the EU agreed to renew Joint Actions to support International Atomic Energy Agency and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons work on universalisation and full implementation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention. We have also begun two major pieces of work to strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), which we expect to be completed during the Austrian presidency: a new Joint Action on universalisation of the BTWC and an EU Common Position for the BTWC Review Conference. We have also agreed a new Strategy to combat illicit trafficking in Small Arms and Light Weapons to complement the WMD Strategy. We launched a debate on future financing of WMD work to focus discussion on how best to channel limited EU resources for the period 2007&ndash;13.</p>

The UK was instrumental in securing adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1653 on the Great lakes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase>, which strongly condemned Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) actions, and asked the UN Secretary General to make recommendations on how the UN Security Council, UN Missions and agencies can best support Governments in the region to put an end to the activities of illegal armed groups. As part of that process, Jan Egeland, the UN's Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, plans to visit Uganda in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.2/2">The UK is committed to restricting the arms available to all illegal armed groups, and is therefore a strong supporter of the arms embargoes in force in the region. We support the international criminal court's efforts to bring indicted LRA leaders to justice. But we are unconvinced at this time that targeted sanctions against the LRA in Uganda would be effective. However, we look forward to receipt of the Secretary General's report, and in the light of the report will consider further with partners all possible options for addressing the conflict.</p>

Thus, one specific kind of radio frequency technology will be used in the &quot;proximity&quot; chip in the identity card in line with their introduction into passports in many countries in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.0/2">However, the use of radio frequencies in the identity card should not be confused with other uses of radio frequencies in many different technologies, such as RFID tags. While both use radio frequencies, they use different operating systems, access controls and security requirements. For example, proximity chips include a far higher level of security protection than an RFID tag and can only be read at a very short distance. These differences are reflected in the fact that they operate to different standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.0/3">Furthermore, proximity chips in the identity card will utilise Basic Access Control as a data access protocol in accordance with international standards as well as other cryptographic measures in order to prevent the information on the chip from being modified. In addition, it is planned that further advanced encryption will be utilised to secure biometric information on the chip of the card. This will comply with Extended Access Control standards that are currently under development at an international level.</p>

	<p pid="b.957W.0/1">The Russell Commission report on youth action and engagement, published in March 2005, recommended the creation of a new national youth volunteering body, independent of Government. The report provided the Government with four options for the legal form of this body: a non-departmental public body, a company limited by guarantee, a community interest company, or an existing organisation, suitably adapted.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.0/2">The Government decided to create a company limited by guarantee with charitable status. This was for three reasons:</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.0/3" class="indent">1. The vast majority of the 6,000 young people responding to the Russell Commission consultation commented that a programme run by an organisation independent from Government would be more attractive to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.0/4" class="indent">2. Implementation of the scheme is more likely to be successful in an organisation with an exclusive focus. While there are existing voluntary sector bodies with a focus on youth volunteering, they do not individually have the capacity or governance structures to deliver the framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.0/5" class="indent">3. Full implementation of the reports recommendations is dependent on securing support from the private sector. Private sector supporters proved more likely to fund an independent charity than a Government scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.0/6">It is also important to note that the charitable company will not be delivering the Commission recommendations itself, but will be contracting with existing voluntary and community organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.957W.6/1">The calculation of a UK wide travel average utilised the services of a specialist transport and locational analysis company, MVA Ltd. The company accessed Office for National Statistics census population data, and combined this with Department for Transport and other Government transport and travel data. By analysing trends in public and private travel patterns, MVA were able to advise the UK Passport Service on the average journey time for the anticipated catchment populations of each of the 69 proposed passport office locations. The catchment areas of the proposed 69 office locations are derived by determining the nearest convenient office. Therefore catchment areas cross parliamentary constituency and national boundaries so it is not possible, without incurring disproportionate costs, to calculate the average travel times for a specific population group (for example within a constituency) within the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.6/2">The choice of the proposed 69 locations was informed by this analysis; the locations chosen balanced the need for ensuring convenience for the customer with the operational efficiency of potential locations given the predicted number of adult first time passport applications within the catchment area. Applicants will be free to choose to be interviewed in any fixed office, enabling them to be interviewed near, for example, their places of employment or study, or to attend an interview in conjunction with travel for social or leisure reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.6/3">The arrangements for passport interviews will include, in addition to the network of permanent passport interview offices, different arrangements for people living more than an hour's journey time from one of these offices.</p>

	<p pid="b.963W.5/2" class="italic">Custody</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.5/3">The table shows the number of Sex Offender Treatment Programme completions in custody in each financial year since 1995. The percentage of imprisoned sex offenders completing treatment has been calculated by taking the total number of sentenced sex offenders in prison as of <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> each year. These figures are only available from 2000 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.5/4">Please note that some of the completions refer to second or third treatment programmes. Thus the absolute number of prisoners receiving treatment in a given year is lower than the number of completions.</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.5/5">HO Research Findings 205 reported an evaluation of prisoners attending the Core SOTP between 1992 and 1996. This study found that 2.6 per cent. of treated sex offenders reconvicted for a further sexual offence compared with 2.8 per cent. of untreated sex offenders over a two-year follow up period. However when further sexual and violent reconvictions were included, 4.6 per cent. of treated sex offenders reconvicted compared with 8.1 per cent. of untreated. There have not been any further evaluations to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.5/6" class="italic">Community</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.5/7">Accredited sex offender treatment programmes were introduced in the Probation Service in 2002&ndash;03. Data on offenders starting treatment are available for 2003&ndash;04 (1,051 starts) and 2004&ndash;05 (981 starts). In 2004&ndash;05 there were 4,767 sex offenders under supervision in the community, 21 per cent. of offenders were participating in accredited treatment programmes reflecting assessments that not all were suitable for the treatment programmes or had conditions of treatment as part of their supervision.</p>
	<p pid="b.963W.5/8">A reconviction study is not yet available for sex offenders who have completed treatment in the community, as there has been insufficient time for a meaningful follow-up.</p>

	<p pid="b.963W.5/10">Please note that some of the completions refer to second or third treatment programmes. Thus the absolute number of prisoners receiving treatment in a given year is lower than the number of completions.</p>
