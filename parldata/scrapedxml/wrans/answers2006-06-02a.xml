	<p pid="a.7W.6/1">Like all other customers, people aged 50 and over can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/2">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme that provides people with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment, including 320 people in Hartlepool. Once in work, New Deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &pound;1,500 for training of which up to &pound;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/3">People aged 50 and over, including those in Hartlepool, are also eligible for help from New Deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously participated on New Deal 25 plus are already required to attend the Gateway stage of the New Deal 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/4">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the New Deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50 to 59 who have been claiming JSA for18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Hartlepool was not part of the pilot, however, interim pilot data has yielded positive results and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we will be commencing a phased national rollout.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/5">New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme for those who have been claiming benefits, including those claiming the pension credit, for six months. However, our Green Paper also announced our intention to pilot mandatory participation in New Deal 50 plus activities for people aged 50 to 59 who have been claiming JSA for six months. This will involve attendance at work-focused interviews and the development of action plans to help participants move into employment. Pilot locations have not yet been confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/6">In spring 2005 there were 3 million people claiming incapacity benefits in Great Britain, of which1.3 million were aged 50 or over. As nearly half of all benefit claimants aged 50 or over are on IB, they will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new IB customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a &quot;Choices Package&quot; of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis. Pathways has already begun helping people in the Hartlepool area, having rolled out there last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/7">Our Age Positive campaign works with employers and others to promote the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the 'Be Ready' national information campaign to raise employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of older workers in advance of age legislation due in October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.9W.6/1">Like all other customers, people aged 50 and over can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/2">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme that provides people with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment, including 240 people in Denton and Reddish. Once in work, New Deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &pound;1,500 for training of which up to &pound;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/3">People aged 50 and over, including those in Denton and Reddish, are also eligible for help from New Deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously participated on New Deal 25 plus, are already required to attend the Gateway stage of the New Deal 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/4">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the New Deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for 18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Denton and Reddish was not part of the pilot, however, interim pilot data has yielded positive results and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we will be commencing a phased national rollout.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/5">New Deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme for those who have been claiming benefits, including those claiming the pension credit, for six months. However, our Green Paper also announced our intention to pilot mandatory participation in New Deal 50 plus activities for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for six months. This will involve attendance at work-focused interviews and the development of action plans to help participants move into employment. Pilot locations have not yet been confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/6">In spring 2005 there were 3 million people claiming incapacity benefits in Great Britain, of which 1.3 million were aged 50 or over. As nearly half of all benefit claimants aged 50 or over are on IB, they will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new IB customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a 'Choices Package' of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis. Pathways is due to rollout in the Denton and Reddish area in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/7">Our Age Positive Campaign works with employers and others to promote the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the 'Be Ready' national information campaign to raise employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of older workers in advance of age legislation due in October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.11W.0/1">We continue to keep work incentivesin both benefits under review. For example, since April 2004 a move into work has no longer required a fresh claim for either housing benefit or council tax benefit for the vast majority of people. Also, from April 2004 the extended payment scheme in housing benefit and council tax benefit has been widened to include people moving off incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance because they are starting work.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.0/2">As outlined in the Green Paper &quot;A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work&quot; published in February, we propose to roll-out the new local housing allowance to tenants in the private rented sector. The local housing allowance would be a major simplification of the housing benefit system which would make it easier for people to understand what in-work support they could receive. Our proposal to pay the local housing allowance directly to tenants, rather than to landlords, is also designed to promote financial inclusion and, where appropriate, help tenants develop financial and budgeting skills as they move towards work.</p>

	<p pid="a.14W.5/1">Since November 2004, the Department has taken forward a wide-ranging assessment to investigate how best to support the improvement of child and adult immunisation services through commissioning including:</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/2" class="indent">an examination of the systems and commissioning routes needed to improve access and increase low uptake; and</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/3" class="indent">a review of the way services could deliver more effectively for the people currently missing out.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/4">Primary care trusts' (PCTs) experience of the new commissioning routes for immunisation is still growing and there is an opportunity to share good practice around planning and service delivery using these mechanisms. In support of this, the Department has:</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/5" class="indent">prepared guidance for the wave two national purchasing pilots of alternative providers for immunisation services (referred to as the alternative personal medical services (ARMS) wave two pilots);</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/6" class="indent">developed a series of targets for local use as part of the Better Metrics project in conjunction with the London Health Observatory to allow service managers to monitor the performance of services targeted at deprived or disadvantaged groups;</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/7" class="indent">held two national events with national health service primary care contracting to share good practice and facilitate learning networks; and</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/8" class="indent">in the recent White Paper, announced measures to free up the target payment funds and allow them to be carried across into other contract forms. It also highlighted a recent example of a nurse-led personal medical services that successfully increase immunisation uptake rates among poor and deprived groups who were planning to apply for ARMS status.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/9">The Department is working in partnership across policy teams, NHS Employers, other Government Departments (including the Department for Education and Skills, Social Exclusion Unit and Neighbourhood Renewal Unit) and a range of NHS implementing agencies in order to improve childhood immunisation take up for families. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/10" class="indent">continue collaboration with our stakeholder to examine the systems and commissioning routes that have worked to improve access and increase low uptake;</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/11" class="indent">requiring the Health Protection Agency to promote the benefit of opportunistic immunisation, in order to reach disadvantaged groups more effectively;</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/12" class="indent">continue to deliver a series of reports and seminars and generate concrete recommendations for PCTs and commissioners; and</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/13" class="indent">issued joint guidance with neighbourhood renewal unit on local partnerships that led to a number of PCTs and councils to submit and secure a local area agreement for immunisation among disadvantaged groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.15W.8/1">In 2003, the Department announced &pound;8.5 million central funding to stimulate improvements in care, access to treatment and to ensure the long-term continuing provision of services for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/encephalopathy and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME) across England. This resulted in the development of 13 clinical network co-coordinating centres and 36 local multi-disciplinary teams, as well as 11 specialist children and young people teams to support the development of multi-disciplinary CFS/ME services in their designated area.</p>
	<p pid="a.15W.8/2">Funding of these services from 2006-07 is included within the resource allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs), to facilitate the continuation of services following the end of the ring-fenced period of funding.

The NSF sets out a clear vision of how health and social care organisations can improve the quality of care, consistency and responsiveness of their services and help improve the lives of people with neurological conditions, including CFS/ME. The Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection can undertake performance reviews to assess progress on local implementation of the NSF.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.8/1">It is for councils to decide how to set charges for non-residential social services. The legal basis is that charges generally should be 'reasonable' and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can. The position contrasts with that on charges for residential care, where regulations prescribe a national means test, which councils must follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.8/2">The Department of Health issued statutory guidance, &quot;Fairer Charging Policies for Home Care and other Non-residential Social Services&mdash;Guidance for Councils with Social Services Responsibilities&quot;, which is available in the Library, to all local councils in November 2001. It was amended in September 2003 to reflect the introduction of pension credits. It does not seek to change councils' power to charge, or not, for these services.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.8/3">The guidance aims to ensure in particular that service users on low incomes are protected from charging and that any charges levied on disability benefits are subject to an assessment of disability costs, to ensure their reasonableness. Councils are required to ensure that charges do not put any users' incomes below basic income support levels or the guarantee credit of pension credit, plus a buffer of 25 per cent. This can lead to real improvements in the position of many users, who will cease to pay charges or pay a smaller charge.</p>

We understand that there has been concern that plasma imported from the United States may have carried a higher risk of transmitting hepatitis C. However, knowledge of the viral risks associated with both domestically produced and imported blood products evolved over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.11/2">Blood products contain plasma pooled from many thousands of donors, and only one donation needs to carry the virus to infect the whole batch. Regardless of the source, or of the manufacturer of the plasma used, all products were potentially contaminated with the hepatitis C virus as a result of the need for pooling and the prevalence of the virus in blood donor populations around the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.37W.0/15">Article 21 of the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006 provides that the Secretary of State for Defence may defray necessary expenses in respect of the medical, surgical or rehabilitative treatment of a former member of the armed forces which arise from a disablement due to service, provided they are not provided for under other UK legislation. Under this discretionary power, MOD defrays the individual costs of war pensioners undergoing &quot;remedial treatment&quot; at the Combat Stress homes for conditions related to their individual pensioned disablement and of related expenses, such as travel costs. The table shows the funding received by Combat Stress under this provision.</p>

Gurkha soldiers are members of the Gurkha pension scheme which does not provide for preserved pensions, there are therefore no Gurkha widows who would be eligible. The Department does not hold records of individuals (or of their widows) who do not have an entitlement to a pension, so cannot make reliable estimates of either the numbers involved or the cost of hypothetical pension entitlements.</p>
	<p pid="a.39W.8/3">However there are currently 26,699 Gurkha service pensioners (of which 1,900 have retired since <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>) and the Gurkha Welfare Trust have reported that last year they paid 10,246 welfare pensions.

	<p pid="a.42W.9/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>, the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) rolled out Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) to all 48,000 RAF service personnel throughout the world on time and on budget. The event marked the culmination of five years system design, development, integration and testing and bears testimony to a very strong partnering agreement between MOD and EDS. The total cost to date of JPA is &pound;116 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.42W.9/2">The suitability of JPA was considered in July 2004 by the Defence Investment Approvals Board in approving the Main Gate Business Case. Prior to rollout, the readiness for service was assessed by an independent Office of Government Commerce Gateway review.</p>
	<p pid="a.42W.9/3">On JPA rollout to the RAF there were a small number of technical issues which had not manifested in the extensive testing carried out prior to its launch. This resulted in the system operating much more slowly than anticipated which greatly restricted the number of self-service users at any one time. Over the course of the last six weeks these early problems have been overcome and all users now have full access to the system. JPA has performed satisfactorily on rollout to RAF professional HR administrators and has delivered pay to the RAF with only a relatively few discrepancies caused by the migration of data from the legacy systems to JPA. Although the first few weeks following rollout has generated a significant number of enquiries, no formal complaints have been received.</p>
	<p pid="a.42W.9/4">Following RAF rollout, the related provisional JPA dates for the RN and Army were June and November 2006 respectively. However, in order to more closely align JPA with Defence Information Infrastructure (Future) programme requirements, current plans are that JPA will be rolled out to the RN from October 2006 and to the Army from March 2007 respectively.</p>

A series of events will be held around MOD sites to promote a healthy lifestyle. MOD already has a thriving Sports and Social Association and a number of workplace sports clubs and gyms which staff can join at their own cost and in their own time. MOD restaurants also provide healthy choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.2/3">Health is vital to operational effectiveness and the armed forces have always had policies for health promotion. A Health Promotion Action Plan was published last year prior to the production of the Choosing Health White Paper covering issues such as diet, tobacco and alcohol consumption and sexual health. There is an expert panel on armed forces feeding which advises on diet and has published &quot;Recruits' and Commanders' Guides to Nutrition&quot;. These offer advice on diets and eating patterns which are compatible with military requirements and health.</p>

	<p pid="a.51W.2/1">Encouraging staff to share vehicles when travelling to work is dependent on the circumstances of each site. For example, at Abbey Wood in Bristol, there is a scheme offering 300 car-sharing priority parking spaces. There are also informal schemes established on an individual basis. The Royal Navy also encourage the practice through their intranet sites with schemes in place at Royal Navy Fleet HQ, and at Portsmouth and Devonport Naval Bases.</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.2/2">Vehicle-sharing is one of a number of measures that the Ministry of Defence encourages as part its work on sustainable development and travel. These include the use of both telephone- and video-conference facilities for business meetings, and offering staff a pay advance to purchase bicycles and public transport season tickets for commuting to their place of work.</p>

	<p pid="a.58W.6/1">The cost of calls to the new 101 single non-emergency number has been set at 10p per call following consultation with a wide group of stakeholders and research with the public. The research showed that a small fixed charge would not put people off calling the service but would reduce the likelihood of the service being abused. The Government, police and local authorities will not profit in any way from the 10p fixed charge for calls to the single non-emergency number. The charge will be retained by telecom providers to offset the substantial cost of carrying calls.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.6/2">This fixed rate charge compares favourably with existing police and local authority non-emergency numbers many of which are charged at 0845 call rates which can cost as much as 10p per minute or more. Calls to 101 will be 10p per call regardless of length which means that callers are protected against additional cost if their call is longer and more complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.6/3">The tariff will be reviewed once the service is in operation and has been evaluated with the aim of making it free to call the number in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.67W.2/1">Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 is the primary measure for combating illegal working. It provides employers with a statutory defence from conviction if they check and record certain specified documents belonging to potential employees. To support employers in meeting their responsibilities under section 8, IND produced short (summary) guidance which was distributed widely among other Government Departments and agencies. If further guidance on this legislation is required, the booklet refers the reader to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate website where comprehensive guidance is available, and there is also a reference to the Employers' Helpline which offers a dedicated service for employers by advising on the legislation on preventing illegal migrant working. The Employers' Helpline also disseminates hard copies of the comprehensive guidance on request. The comprehensive guidance makes clear that this legislation covers contracted and sub-contracted employment.</p>

	<p pid="a.72W.0/1">The responsibility for ensuring that the nutritional standards are being met will rest with either the local authority or the school governing body, depending on the model of provision. Ofsted are already inspecting schools' general approach to healthy eating as part of the new inspection framework for schools. They have also already carried out, alongside nutritionists, a pilot thematic study in three local authorities, looking at the standard of food provided in a sample of schools. A further larger-scale thematic study is planned for next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.0/2">We have published a full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which considers the financial impact that the new nutritional standards will have. In compiling the RIA, account was taken of the report written for the School Meals Review Panel (SMRP) by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the costs of implementing the Caroline Walker Trust's recommendations, which are closely mirrored by the recommendations of the SMRP.</p>

	<p pid="a.74W.0/1">The Learning and Skills Council was established in 2001 to replace the 72 Training and Enterprise Councils and the Further Education Funding Council. It was estimated that this would result in savings of some &pound;50 million per annum. These savings have been realised and a significant proportion has been reinvested in better training in local areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.0/2">Building on this, the Learning and Skills Council is currently undertaking a second major restructuring exercise which will further streamline the organisation and strengthen its capacity to work strategically with partners at local and regional level. This will involve the merger of some local offices, and the LSC estimates that, once completed, the restructuring will release up to &pound;40 million per annum nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.0/3">The national costs incurred to date in <i> (a)</i> closing the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) and<i> (b)</i> creating the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) are &pound;83 million. TECs, which were independent local companies, will also have incurred some local costs connected with the ending of the TEC network, but we do not have details of the amounts involved. Although the majority of TECs have now been formally wound up, there will be some additional costs involved in winding up those remaining. It is not possible to disaggregate the costs associated with <i> (a)</i> and <i> (b)</i>.</p>

Guidance has been made available to local authorities and schools to allow them to plan and meet their requirements in time to meet the 2008 personal online space target. Becta is procuring a national framework (with preferred suppliers), which will help purchasers to select appropriate learning platforms. This framework will be available to all educational institutions from January 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.75W.2/1">I do not have a tally of the number of complaints which the Department has received about private finance initiative contracts, but I will write shortly to you with this information. We have been working consistently to improve the delivery of operational private finance initiative contracts in response to problems that have been brought to our attention. We have, for instance, provided additional support directly and through Partnerships UK for those schools and authorities which had contracts with Jarvis plc., and where there were undoubtedly exceptional problems because of the financial difficulties of that firm.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.2/2">Ensuring satisfactory delivery of the services included in a private finance initiative contract is the responsibility of the authority which is signatory to the contract. However, the Department is always happy to advise and support where there are individual problems that cannot be resolved locally. It also continues to work with Her Majesty's Treasury and with other Departments to improve the delivery of public services through private finance initiatives. This is done by a process of continuous improvement of the contracts, and also by providing additional support through the recently formed Operational Task Force. This will support and intervene on wider structural issues like benchmarking, market testing, payment mechanisms and variations.</p>

	<p pid="a.89W.5/2">The objective of the current trial is to assess whether a specially designed body snare for badgers is an effective and humane method of restraint. The body snare is intended to be non-lethal and the purpose of the proposed trials is to assess the snare. The study will follow the principles laid down in the draft EU Directive on Humane Trapping Standards whereby the humaneness of a trapping device is first assessed under controlled conditions in pen trials before, if its humaneness is deemed to be acceptable, field trials of the device are conducted to confirm its humaneness and to assess its efficacy and non-target risks. The aim is to release all captured badgers taken during the trial back into the wild unharmed.</p>

	<p pid="a.91W.6/1">The Environment Agency started to monitor for perfluorooctance sulfonate (PFOS) in the vicinity of the site following the fire in order to give a better understanding of the impact of the incident on the environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.94W.6/1">Section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 allows a person with a complaint of statutory nuisance, for example, noise, smell or smoke, to take private action through the magistrates court. If the court agrees that a statutory nuisance exists and/or is likely to recur, it will issue an abatement notice on the person responsible for the nuisance, requiring that the nuisance be ceased or abated within a specified timescale. It may, but does not have to, specify the steps to be taken. Anyone causing a statutory nuisance could also be liable to a fine.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.6/2">The statutory nuisance provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 have been amended by measures implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, which introduce insects, and artificial light, to the list of potential statutory nuisances. The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 also introduces an optional seven-day deferral for serving of an abatement notice for statutory nuisance from noise in order to pursue alternative steps before formal action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.6/3">The Government work as a matter of course with stakeholders and, on statutory nuisance from noise in particular, we will be seeking stakeholder views on the Noise Strategy, which will be the subject of full public consultation early in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.6/4">A large number of amendments have been made to the 1990 Environmental Protection Act and the cost of collating a list would be disproportionate.

	<p pid="a.98W.0/1">The Marine Fisheries Agency, along with other fisheries administrations in the UK, operates systems as required by EU legislation to monitor and control the activity of UK fishing vessels to ensure quotas allocated to the UK are not exceeded. This involves maintaining dedicated systems for the collection and collation of information from vessel logbooks and landing declarations, as well as information from sales notes from registered buyers and sellers of fish. The information from UK systems is collated to produce reports on the level of uptake of quotas that are updated on a daily or weekly basis as appropriate. These reports are used by fisheries administrations, producer organisations and other groups in the UK to manage the individual quota allocations during each year. Monthly reports are provided to the European Commission, with measures also in place to check and validate information received by the Commission from other member states on landings by UK vessels outside the UK. The agency takes management action, as necessary, to control or close activity in particular fisheries to ensure quotas limits are complied with.</p>
	<p pid="a.98W.0/2">The risk weightings relate to enforcement of sea fisheries legislation. The Marine Fisheries Agency aims to deploy 60 per cent. of its inspection and enforcement resources to high risk fisheries, 30 per cent. medium risk and 10 per cent. low risk. The specific risk weightings take account of a number of factors, including the nature of the fishery, the area and the type of fishing activity. For instance, we would consider vessels fishing in an area and for a species for which specific recovery measures have been introduced to be classified as 'high risk'. The agency is developing a computer model to assist in analysing a wide range of factors to determine compliance risks in fisheries for the medium to long term so that its resources can be deployed and utilised to best effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.104W.2/19">No funds have been withdrawn from south west region's allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.2/20">Under the EU regulations supporting the rural enterprise scheme, 50 per cent. of funding comes from the European Union. These European funds are allocated on an annual basis and it is generally not possible to transfer any unspent EU funds to a later financial year. This scheme, therefore, requires close and careful financial management To this end, each region is given an annual budget within which it must manage the grant awards it has made. This will include any delays to project expenditure and therefore delays to claims, as well as any under or over-claims by beneficiaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.2/21">The performance of approved projects is subject to continuous review to establish the true value of any 'headroom' in annual budgets. For 2006-07, a detailed exercise is in place to ensure that budgets are used to the maximum extent possible. In this regard, it is expected that some additional monies will be identified as available to support new grant awards before the closure of the scheme at the end of June. The precise value of funds available for grant awards will be confirmed by mid-June.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.2/22">There will continue to be significant competition for the remaining funds, the Rural Development Service will continue to manage the position carefully in 2006-07, with a view to the possible redirection of funds between regions where regional interest in the scheme is genuinely lower than anticipated.</p>

	<p pid="a.106W.3/1">The Rural Payment Agency's (RPA) Customer Service Centre (CSC) provides an inquiry response facility and, outside business hours, a recorded messaging service, referring customers to RPA's website. As such the CSC seeks to answer inquiries as they are made. A proportion of the inquiries that are answered require a follow up response from a CSC operator or a member of RPA's processing staff. Moreover, RPA provides an electronic ordering facility for those customers seeking to acquire an application form or other scheme literature.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/2">RPA launched a CSC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-14">14 February 2005</phrase>. This was done to streamline single payment scheme and customer registration telephone inquiries into the Agency through one route, to allow staff to concentrate on processing. More importantly, this system aims to ensure that customers receive consistent answers and any more complex inquiries can be directed to specialist areas of the business to call the customer back.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.3/3">The main call centre is based in Workington with facilities for calls to be diverted to staff at other RPA sites during periods of unusually high demand.</p>
