	<p pid="b.1276W.2/1">The UK has made a strong commitment to tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world. Globally we are the second largest bilateral funder of AIDS-related activities. Last year saw the publication of the UK's Strategy &quot;Taking Action: The UK's strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world&quot;. This commits DFID to spending at least &pound;1.5 billion over the next three years, to step up the international response to AIDS, including spending to at least &pound;150 million to meet the needs of children affected by AIDS. This year, the UK has made AIDS a centrepiece of our G8 and EU presidencies, focusing on the importance of more and better aid for AIDS, maintaining HIV prevention momentum, and scaling up towards universal access to AIDS treatment by 2010, with the ultimate aim of achieving an AIDS-free generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/2">We secured a landmark agreement at Gleneagles</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;to develop and implement a package for HIV prevention, treatment and care, with the aim of as close as possible to universal access to treatment for all those who need it by 2010.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/4">Progress has been swift since Gleneagles. The universal access commitment was also agreed by member states at the Millennium summit in September. The UK convened a rapid follow-up, bringing together members of the G8, developing countries, civil society, together with the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Trade Organistaion (WHO), the World Bank and UNICEF to start mapping out how to deliver against the commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/5">UNAIDS have now set up a Global Steering Committee (GSC), co-chaired by the UK and UNAIDS. The GSC will meet for the first time on 9&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January 2006</phrase> to discuss and prepare a plan of action to be considered at the high level UN General Assembly Special Session in June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/6">In September 2005, the UK hosted the third and final Replenishment conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, chaired by UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. The Secretary of State confirmed that the UK is doubling support for the global fund in 2006 and 2007 to &pound;100 million in each of these two years. The UK's pledge amounted to 10 per cent. of the US $3.7 billion pledged to the global fund for the two-year period by international donor. The amount pledged by 29 donors represents more than half of the global fund's total resource needs for the two-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/7">The global fund conference also addressed the context within which the global fund operates. These discussions built on the 'Three Ones' principles and the UK co-hosted 'Making the Money Work' meeting, which had established a global task team (GTT) to improve AIDS co-ordination among multilateral and international donors. As a result of the GTT, the UK expects significant improvements in how the UN and international donors such as the global fund work together to support countries develop and lead effective responses to AIDS. To support this work, the UK doubled our contributions to UNAIDS for the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/8">EU Ministers met in London on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase> under the UK presidency, confirmed their commitment to increased prevention by issuing a statement on a vision for an AIDS free generation&mdash;the first pan-European pledge of its kind. The statement backs efforts to give people around the world better access to condoms and effective information. It advocates a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to HIV prevention including sexual and reproductive health information and services, harm reduction programmes for injecting drug users and reliable access to sexual reproductive health commodities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/9">For World AIDS day, the UK also published a cross-governmental briefing paper on harm reduction: &quot;Tackling drug use and HIV in the developing world&quot;. This confirms the UK Government's commitment to harm reduction as an important part of the overall HIV prevention strategy in countries with serious HIV epidemics among injecting drug users, as well as in countries without serious HIV epidemics where harm reduction interventions help maintain low prevalence rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1276W.2/10">As part of our commitment towards stepping up efforts on HIV prevention, DFID announced on World AIDS day (<phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>) that it is giving an extra &pound;20 million to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, and &pound;7.5 million to the International Programme on Microbicides. This re-affirms the UK's long-standing commitment to developing new prevention technologies, and brings our total investment in mircobicides to over &pound;50 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1278W.9/1">Afghanistan has made remarkable progress over the last four years and with strong commitment from the Government of Afghanistan and the international community has moved away from a predominantly humanitarian situation. To date 3.5 million refugees have returned home, the number of functioning health clinics has increased by 60 per cent., and over 5 million children are now in school. Many Afghans however remain vulnerable. During the winter in particular many suffer the effects of nature, lacking basic elements of protection. The Government of Afghanistan have begun contingency planning and drawn up a work plan to help minimize the impact of this winter upon the most vulnerable through the provision of basic relief supplies. In line with Afghanistan's needs, DFID's support has evolved from a humanitarian focus to supporting the Government in creating the conditions for sustainable development and poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid="b.1279W.2/1">Since 2002, DFID has committed &pound;35 million in support of the development of infrastructure in Afghanistan: &pound;17 million of support through the National Solidarity Programme for small scale rural infrastructure; and &pound;18 million to the National Rural Access Programme for roads construction and maintenance. Of this, &pound;3 million was spent in 2004&ndash;05, &pound;27 million will be spent in 2005&ndash;06 and &pound;5 million is planned to be spent in 2006&ndash;07. Support to larger scale infrastructure is not a major focus of DFID's programme: we believe other donors are better placed to do it than DFID.</p>

	<p pid="b.1280W.3/1">DFID has always recognised the importance of agriculture to reducing poverty. A new DFID agricultural policy paper will be launched on shortly which will set out how we will do more and improve the benefits to poor people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.3/2">Examples of current support include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.3/3" class="indent">Agricultural research to develop new technologies. We currently spend some &pound;25 million per year on this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.3/4" class="indent">Expansion of infrastructure to link producers to markets. Three out of five rural Africans live in areas with good agricultural potential but little access to markets. For example, we are providing $20 million to the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa, which will enable G8 and multilateral donors make more effective infrastructure investments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.3/5" class="indent">Increasing public expenditure on agriculture and rural development such as crop and livestock services through support to Governments' central and agricultural budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.3/6">DFID has responded quickly to address hunger in the immediate term in Africa. This year we have provided &pound;64 million through the UN, other agencies and some of the Governments in the region. Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia are the worst-affected countries, although Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland also face shortages.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.3/7">DFID is also helping to build longer term food security. For example, we are currently supporting a programme for 5 million people affected by chronic hunger in Ethiopia with &pound;25 million per year. This programme provides regular payments of cash and food to 5 million chronically hungry people. This meets their immediate food needs but is also designed to help them climb out of poverty in the longer term, as it allows them to become more productive by purchasing assets such as seeds, goats or oxen, knowing they will still have a safety net in times of crisis. DFID proposes to scale up this national safety net approach for those affected by hunger in Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, and Kenya over the next year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284W.2/1">The UK Government are committed to the development of an open and rules-based international trading system that fulfils its potential to contribute to the reduction of poverty in poorer countries. Our key policy commitments on trade and development, as well as our objectives for the current Round of multilateral trade talks, are set out in the Government's White Papers, Making Globalisation a Force for Good (July 2004) and Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor (December 2000). The UK Government are working hard to support the poorest and most vulnerable producers, be it through multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or regional trade agreements such as the Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/2">The UK Government do not support forced liberalisation or unfettered free trade but trade that is fair as well as free. The UK Government supports the view that developing countries need to decide on the timing, pace and sequencing of any market opening in line with their own national development and poverty reduction plans. In the context of the WTO negotiations we are firmly committed to ensuring that developing countries are given appropriate flexibility to adjust to trade reforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/3">In the longterm, the removal of trade barriers, if managed properly, can help developing countries gain better access to developed country markets and more competitively priced inputs. By increasing Aid for Trade, (AFT) the UK hopes to help poorer countries seize the opportunities presented by more open markets. DFID will treble its support to &pound;100 million a year by 2010 to help boost poor countries' capacity to trade. This shows the UK re-affirming the commitment at the G8 summit to help developing countries trade their way out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/4">At the WTO ministerial in Hong Kong we are working with international partners to deliver on the ambition of Doha and build on G8 commitments. The UK Government are working to achieve an outcome that delivers real gains for developing countries, including the poorest.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284W.5/1">Since the London Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund, the UK has continued discussions with G8 partners, through G8 officials' meetings, to ensure that the Gleneagles commitment to the Global Fund is met. We will also re-double our efforts to make Global Fund resources work better and demonstrate good results. This is crucial if the Global Fund is to widen its funding base and achieve the longer term sustainability it needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.5/2">At the London conference, donors pledged US$ 3.7 billion for the two-year period 2006&ndash;2007, more than half the estimated US $7 billion needed to replenish the Global Fund for this period. This is a significant achievement which has enabled all existing Global Fund projects to continue plus provided funding for a small number of new projects. The Replenishment conference also focused on improving the Global Fund performance at global and country level. To make the Global Fund's money work effectively, the UK also pledged at the Replenishment conference, to double our contribution to the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) from &pound;8 million to &pound;16 million for the financial year 2005&ndash;6. Replenishment of the Global Fund is an on-going process. A follow-up Conference will be held in June 2006 to secure additional pledges.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.5/3">Donors who were unable to make pledges at the London conference (due to their funding cycles) included Canada, the US and the EC. Since the conference, Canada announced a firm pledge of Can$ 250 million (around US$ 213 million) (this was included in the US$ 3.7 billion pledging figure). The US House and Senate Conference Committee have now approved US$ 450 million for the Global Fund for 2006. This is US$150 million more than was anticipated in London. In addition, the US may appropriate more through the forthcoming Health and Human Services Bill. The European Commission's 2006 budget is still being finalised and the Financial Perspectives governing the budget from 2007 are yet to be agreed. Currently the European Union (including the Commission and members states) has pledged almost 60 per cent. of the commitments made at the conference to the Global Fund's finances for 2006 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.5/4">At the Replenishment Conference, the UK doubled its funding to the Global Fund from &pound;51 million for 2006 and &pound;51 million in 2007, to &pound;100 million for 2006 and &pound;100 million for 2007. Our contribution amounted to some 10 per cent. of the total US$3.7 billion pledged. Overall the UK has pledged 359 million (US$ 640 million) to the Global Fund over seven years (2002&ndash;08). DFID will continue to encourage donors to do as much as they can to substantially increase their contributions to the Global Fund.</p>

	<p pid="b.1285W.2/1">DFID would welcome moves to reduce tariffs, subsidies and other barriers to the free flow of goods and services. The UK has made assessments based on studies from the World Bank, the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that suggest substantial gains for developing countries resulting from developed country liberalisation of agricultural and industrial trade. Of course, the level of gains for developing countries depends on the level of reform in developed country agriculture policies and liberalisation efforts undertaken by developing countries themselves. If the current round of trade talks are really to deliver their Development objectives, then clearly, as the Prime Minister has said, all sides need to move further and allow poor countries to trade their way out of poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1288W.3/1">The UK Government have contributed &pound;18.2 million to address Malawi's food shortages this year. These funds will pay for around 55,000 tons of maize with pulses and oil to provide a balanced diet. This food will be distributed with the help of non-governmental organisations on the ground to poor people whose harvests have failed and who do not have money to buy food. Our funds also paid options for the Government of Malawi on a further 60,000 tons of maize, the purchase of seeds for the harvest in 2006 and Government capacity building, including financing a logistics unit to distribute food on behalf of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.3/2">On other humanitarian requirements, the UK Government are providing support to UNICEF for the treatment of severely malnourished children. In addition, the &pound;100 million that the UK Government are contributing to the health sector over six years is helping to address related health problems, such as cholera 'outbreaks, which have been dealt with successfully.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.3/3">The prospects for food production in 2006 depend principally on the weather, for which the long-term forecasts are encouraging. The UK and other donors are meeting with the Government of Malawi on 7 and <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase> to examine the effectiveness of existing policies for agriculture and safety nets and to identify new approaches that will be more effective in addressing the underlying problems through faster growth and better support to reduce chronic problems of hunger.</p>

	<p pid="b.1289W.8/19">In addition, the joint DFID/FCO Overseas Territories Environment Programme (total budget &pound;1.5 million over three years), a development aid project that covers all the UK Overseas Territories, spent &pound;67,311 in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;41,000 in the current financial year on projects in St. Helena.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.8/20">A number of development aid infrastructure projects funded by DFID on the island also contribute directly and indirectly to the conservation of the island's biodiversity: the Drip Irrigation Project (&pound;198,000 over three years) and Water Development Phase II Project (&pound;1.25 million over five years) being good examples. The development aid programme has also included projects on forestry, water catchment, fishing, flora conservation and rodent control during the period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.8/21">St. Helena has also received modest amounts of financial support for conservation from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Environmental Fund, the Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Many activities under a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Tourism Project also involve aspects of conservation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1290W.2/1">The Government acknowledges the damaging impact that dumping and trade-distorting subsidies have on developing countries, particularly on their agriculture sectors. We fully support the commitment made at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Doha ministerial meeting in 2001, which agreed that agriculture negotiations would aim to achieve: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.2/2">The package of reforms to the EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) agreed in June 2003 and May 2004 mark a significant shift in the EU's agricultural policy. The de-coupling of subsidies from production should connect European farmers much more closely to the market and have real impacts on reducing excessive production, which harms developing countries. The Government will continue to be at the forefront of those pushing for further reform of the EU's agricultural policy and I welcome the fact that the EU Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that the EU plays a full and constructive role in the WTO agriculture negotiations. I also welcome the commitment in the WTO to agree to set an end date for all export supports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.2/3">The Doha Development Agenda and specifically the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong represent an important opportunity to make a significant contribution to reducing global poverty. The UK Government are working to achieve an outcome that delivers real gains for developing countries, including the poorest. These gains should include improved participation by developing countries in the world trading system, through substantially increased market access for developing countries and the dismantling of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies by industrialised countries.</p>

Sometimes the bed itself may be bought separately from the adjoining land, perhaps to allow access by boat to other land owned by the purchaser. In other cases the ownership of the bed is vested in, for example, the navigation authority by a local Act of Parliament in order to give control over the use of the river.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299W.5/1">Staff appointment contracts set out the total number of hours that staff are required to work and do not include specific provisions for flexitime working. It is a matter for local agreement how these hours are worked, either on the flexibility of start and finish times or allowing staff to work a more formal flexible working hours scheme-so long as an agreed central core time is worked each day and conditioned hours worked each week. Since it is a matter of local agreement, the Department does not keep a central record of those staff who work under a formal flexible working hours scheme. Information on each member of staffs local flexible working arrangements could therefore only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

Individuals discuss and review their training and development needs with their line managers as part of the performance management process. Any skills gaps in literacy or numeracy are identified and the appropriate help in a number of ways, for example, through training courses, on the job training or the Skills for Life Programme at an external learning establishment. Staff can also approach their union learning representative for advice and sources of help on how to improve their literacy and numeracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308W.6/2">Broad average costs of prosecutions dropped have been calculated by applying the CPS activity based costing model, using average staff input times which enable costs for dropped cases in the magistrates court and the Crown court to be calculated. The broad average cost to CPS of a case dropped in the magistrates courts is &pound;208, and for a case dropped in the Crown court is &pound;1,840. The cost figures represent the internal cost to the Service but do not include disbursements such as counsel fees or witness expenses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308W.6/3">The total cost of cases dropped over the 18 month period was &pound;44 million. The cost of prosecuting all cases including cases dropped was approximately &pound;450 million. Again, these figures exclude disbursements such as counsel fees and witness expenses.</p>

	<p pid="b.1316W.5/1">Significant progress has been made putting measures in place to tackle congestion through targeted improvements and new methods of managing traffic. Since 2001 we have completed 32 major strategic road schemes. A further 15 major schemes are currently under construction, including widening of the M25 between Junctions 12 to 15 around Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.5/2">Uniformed Highways Agency Traffic Officers are now patrolling the motorway network in five regions of the country (West Midlands, South East, North West, North East, and East of England), having taken over some responsibilities from the police for managing incidents and keeping traffic moving. They now have powers to stop and direct traffic in live carriageways, and will be operational on all motorways by next summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.5/3">Regional control centres are assuming responsibility for scheduling road works, monitoring road conditions, establishing diversion alternatives, setting variable message signs for real-time traffic management, and supporting traffic officers. Five regional control centres are currently operational, and all seven will be live by summer 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.5/4">Britain's first High Occupancy Vehicle (carpool) motorway lane will be trialled on the M1 between junctions 6A and 10 (St. Albans to Luton) in 2008, following widening of the motorway. As part of an Active Traffic Management pilot on the M42 corridor between junctions 3a and 7 to the east of Birmingham, mandatory variable speed limits became operational in November, with other aspects of the pilot to follow in 2006, including strictly controlled use of the hard shoulder as a running lane, and access management. Both schemes will operate at peak times to help minimise delay and congestion for road users.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.5/5">Transport Direct, the Government's real-time web-based travel information and journey planning service for public and private transport, allows travellers to check the likelihood of delays and see whether choosing a different route, departure time or transport mode might suit them better. The service has now recorded 2.5 million user sessions since formal launch in December 2004. The Highways Agency's &quot;Traffic England&quot; website is now operational with real-time information about traffic conditions on motorways and trunk roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.5/6">The Traffic Management Act 2004 gave local authorities a duty and new powers to do all that is reasonably practicable to keep roads clear and traffic moving, including appointing traffic managers to manage local roads; powers to co-ordinate utility and telecoms companies' road works to minimise disruption, enforce parking and bus lanes, and some moving traffic offences from police.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.5/7">In June the Government announced a Transport Innovation Fund to help local authorities develop local charging schemes. Up to &pound;200 million per annum will be made available to support such schemes. Alistair Darling announced on <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> that seven local authorities will share over &pound;7 million in advance of the main fund to explore new ways to tackle local congestion.</p>

	<p pid="b.1318W.5/1">The &quot;Design Manual for Roads and Bridges&quot; (DMRB) sets the design standards, including road widths, for motorways and other trunk roads throughout the UK. Where it is used for local road schemes, it has the status of guidance only, and it is for local highway authorities to decide on the extent to which it is used in any particular situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/2">Guidance on the width of residential roads and footpaths is contained in &quot;Design Bulletin 32: Residential Roads and Footpaths&quot;, and in &quot;Places, Streets &amp; Movement: A companion guide to Design Bulletin 32&quot;. In due course these two documents will be superseded by the &quot;Manual for Streets&quot;, currently expected to be published by the Department for Transport in late 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/3">The dimensions for parking bays are specified in Schedule 6 to the &quot;Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002&quot; (SI No. 3113). Guidance on use of the markings for different categories of user is given in section 20 of Chapter 5 of the &quot;Traffic Signs Manual&quot;. Bays for general use can be varied in width between 1,800mm and 2,700mm at the local authority's discretion, to take account of local conditions. These bays may also be marked wholly or partially on the footway if the traffic order provides for this. Bays for disabled badge holders are normally required to be a minimum of 2,700mm wide (3,600mm maximum), but this minimum may be reduced to 1,800mm in a case where, on account of the nature of the traffic using the road, the overall width of the carriageway is insufficient to accommodate a wider bay. Echelon parking bays, set at an angle to the kerb, are required to be between 2,000mm and 2,500mm in width.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319W.5/20">A change in counting rules occurred in 1998. This was built upon by changes in the National Crime Recording Standards (NCRS) in 2002. With the shift to a more customer focused approach and the recording of crime based upon the perception of the victim rather than the police satisfying themselves that a crime had taken place; it was inevitable that there would be a rise in the number of crimes recorded. This point was acknowledged by the Home Office in their publication, &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2002/03&quot;.</p>

The Department for Transport also provides rural bus subsidy grant (RBSG) and, to 2003&ndash;04, Urban and Rural Bus Challenge funding.

	<p pid="b.1321W.6/1">The only estimate that has been made was an illustrative sensitivity test included in Air Traffic Forecasts for the United Kingdom produced by DfT in 2000. This considered the impact of fares remaining constant in real terms throughout the 1998&ndash;2020 period in place of the central assumption of a 1 per cent. annual decline. This sensitivity test showed that passenger traffic at UK airports in 2020 would fall from the central forecast of 401 million to 301 million. However, this was based on the very simple assumption that a 10 per cent. rise in fares would lead to a 10 per cent. fall in demand. In practice, rising real incomes at home and overseas are likely to have a substantial positive impact on the demand for air travel.</p>

	<p pid="b.1321W.9/1">The average fare paid on international no frills flights has dropped by 16 per cent. over the 2000&ndash;04 period. Other international leisure fares (excluding those included as part of a holiday package) have only fallen by 2 per cent. Average fares paid by international business passengers have fallen by 20 per cent. between 2000 and 2004, but this in part reflects the relative weakness of the long haul sector after 2000, and reduced use of premium cabins by business passengers on short haul flights. The headline reduction in fares in the national forecasts supporting the White Paper was on average a 1 per cent. fall per annum in real terms over the period 1998&ndash;2020.</p>

	<p pid="b.1328W.2/4" class="indent">The information requested is shown in the table below which gives average annual inflation rates for the consumer prices index (CPI) and retail prices index (RPI).</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.2/5" class="indent">The CPI is the main domestic measure of inflation for macroeconomic purposes in the United Kingdom. It forms the basis of the government's inflate target that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is required to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.2/6" class="indent">The CPI index is available from January 1996, with estimates available back to 1988.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.2/7" class="indent">The RPI is available from 1947 and its uses include the indexation of pensions, state benefits and index-linked gilts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.2/8" class="indent">Both the CPI and RPI measure the average change from month to month in the prices of consumer goods and services purchased in the UK, although there are differences in coverage and methodology. These differences are summarised in the background notes to the Consumer Price Indices First Release in which these figures are published monthly.

Fuel produced from vegetable oil is eligible for this lower rate (currently 27.10 pence per litre) if it meets the legal definition of biodiesel for tax purposes set out in section 2AA of the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979.

	<p pid="b.1336W.2/2">This funding will enable colleges and other providers to deliver a wide range of learning opportunities to meet the needs of adults in local communities but those who are able to do so will need to pay higher fees in the future.

	<p pid="b.1337W.2/1">Section 12 of the Children Act 2004 gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations to require the establishment and operation of an information sharing index or indexes. The purpose of an index is to improve early intervention by children's services to help children with additional needs. An index helps professionals to quickly identify the child they are working with and the services the child is receiving. This enables the professional to contact others working with the child, so they can then, where appropriate, share information to improve the provision of services for that child. An index would also enable quicker identification of children not receiving services they are entitled to such as education and primary health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337W.2/2">In implementing any index approach, no information about any individual children would be published. The index would provide anonymised statistical information which might be used to assist with service planning and analysis at local and national level.

	<p pid="b.1338W.5/1">The Learning and Skills Council conducted in depth analysis of learners attending very short courses. The analysis indicated that, in the case of the basic food hygiene, emergency aid for appointed persons, lifesaver for babies and children and the British Red Cross response courses, only 147 of the 31,260 learners enrolled in 2004/05 went on to further learning in that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.5/2">The Learning and Skills Council's document &quot;Priorities for Success&quot; set out the Government's intention that in future, food hygiene and other health and safety courses taken by those in work should be fully funded by the employer wherever possible, in line with employers' statutory duty to meet the terms of relevant legislation. The LSC is consulting further on this proposition with key stakeholders. Where individuals are taking qualifications on their own account the expectation is that learners should cover the full cost, although colleges are of course still free to reduce or waive the course fee at their discretion. This is consistent with the principle set out in the Governments skills strategy that individuals should contribute more towards the cost of their learning in line with the benefits they receive. However, while the LSC will cease funding for very short courses below nine guided learning hours (excluding provision for personal and community development learning and learndirect courses), such learning may still continue if it is part of a larger programme that is more likely to lead to progression to further learning.</p>

	<p pid="b.1340W.5/1">The Higher Education Council for England (HEFCE) funds higher education institutions (HEIs) by way of block grant, and it is for each HEI how they allocate this within their own organisation. However, the allocation to HEIs makes assumptions about the pattern of student recruitment at each institution, and HEFCE are able, therefore, to provide a notional split between different programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1340W.5/2">Figures for 2005&ndash;06 are shown in the following table, with overall allocations so that the proportion can be calculated. Although overall funding totals for the next two academic years were determined in the 2004 spending review, the allocation of this total between institutions is done annually by HEFCE, and allocations for years later than 2005&ndash;06 have yet to be made.</p>

	<p pid="b.1341W.5/1">The report &quot;Higher Education Admissions: Assessment of the Bias&quot;, by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) re-works a previous study from 2002 (based on 1996/07 data) that found that applicants from ethnic minorities were disadvantaged. It is good news that the re-examination of the data does not show the same biases in HE admissions as suggested by the original research. HEFCE did however find that ethnic minority applicants had lower chances of receiving an offer when applying to study law than would be expected given their predicted grades and other factors. A certain amount of caution needs to be attached to these findings, due to the age and other inadequacies of the data. It is important to look at what has happened more recently, and HEFCE's proposals for more research in this area will do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341W.5/2">It is not acceptable for any bias to be found for any subject or minority group. While admissions are the sole responsibility of institutions, the Government do have a legitimate interest in the fairness of the admissions process. That is why Professor Steven Schwartz was invited to lead an independent review of the HE admissions system. That review found that admissions processes are generally fair but established a number of underpinning principles that the sector has been encouraged to adopt. The Department, as requested by Professor Schwartz, plans to undertake a follow-up review of progress in 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341W.5/3">Institutions must not be complacent and must strive to eradicate biases as they develop their fair admissions policies and practices. Research such as this and the follow-up work that HEFCE is recommending will help institutions address the problems identified.</p>

	<p pid="b.1344W.2/2">In September 2005, I announced a drive against 'serial truants' in 146 secondary schools which account for one in five of all instances of unauthorised authorised absence across the country.

	<p pid="b.1344W.2/3">Key workers in the 200 schools and their local authorities will draw up an individual action plan and work with each truant to improve their school attendance. Where appropriate, truants and their families will be given co-ordinated support from children's services to tackle wider issues such as drugs, mental health or parenting skills that might be contributing to their truancy. Key workers will also consider referring parents of the most persistent truants onto the 'Fast Track to Attendance' scheme and, unless the youngster's attendance improves over a 12 week period, the parents will face a penalty notice or prosecution.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-07b.26053.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-07b.1344W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" speakername="Beverley Hughes" colnum="1344W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/text/51207w21.htm#51207w21.html_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/1">The scope and understanding of mentoring practice appears to vary widely depending on the intended aims of the programme. By and large, mentoring appears to have benefits on achievement, and generally such schemes are directed at those from low socio-economic groups almost by definition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/2">Our principle mentoring programme working with children from low socio-economic backgrounds is the learning mentor programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/3">Excellence in Cities (EiC) is a targeted programme of support for schools in deprived areas of the country. Learning mentors are part of this programme, described by Ofsted (2003) as:</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/4" class="indent">&quot;the most successful and highly valued strand of the EiC programme&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/5">Learning mentors are salaried non-teaching school support staff who work with school and college students and pupils to help them address barriers to learning. These barriers can be wide ranging and often very personal to the individual pupil. They include the need to develop better learning and study skills, personal organisation, difficulties at home, behaviour, bullying, or just general disaffection and disengagement from learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/6">At present it is estimated that around 6,000 learning mentors are working in the secondary sector and 4000 in primary, funded through excellence in cities (EiC) provision. The numbers will be higher than this as an increasing number are being employed outside of EiC areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/7">Learning mentors work with caseloads of pupils, largely on a 1:1 or small group basis, but also run clubs and &quot;drop ins&quot;. They liaise closely with teachers and other support professionals, and often act as a supportive link between the family and school. One to one support may include developing coping strategies, enhancing motivation, raising aspirations and encouraging re-engagement in learning, taking account of a range of complex underlying issues that may impact negatively on learning and achievement (e.g. bereavement, lack of confidence/low self-esteem, low aspirations, mental health issues, relationship difficulties, bullying, peer pressure, family issues/concerns).</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/8">NFER (2004) Evaluation indicates positive impact of learning mentors on attainment outcomes for young people. Seeing a learning mentor was associated with a level of performance above that which might be anticipated from their prior attainment. In particular:</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/9" class="indent">In low performing schools, young people who had seen a learning mentor in a low-performing school performed an average of 0.15 GCSE points better than their peers who had not seen a mentor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/10" class="indent">In low performing schools, students with a learning mentor were also one and a half times more likely to have achieved five or more GCSEs at A* to C grades than young people with similar prior attainment and other characteristics who had not been mentored.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/11" class="indent">In high performing schools, mentees were three times more likely to have achieved three or more GCSEs at A* than those who had not seen a learning mentor</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/12" class="indent">Regarding learning mentors' impact on behaviour, more than half of the identified group of 430 young people who had been mentored over two years demonstrated a positive change in either their attitudes (to school, to teachers and/or to learning) or their behaviour (in terms of improved attendance, punctuality and/ or completion of work).</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/13">In addition to their impact on academic performance, Ofsted (2003) found that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/14" class="indent">&quot;Learning mentors are making a significant effect on the attendance, behaviour, self-esteem and progress of the pupils they support&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/15" class="indent">Ofsted further reported that in 95 percent. of the survey schools, inspectors judged that the mentoring programme made a positive contribution to the mainstream provision of the school as a whole, and had a beneficial effect on the behaviour of individual pupils and on their ability to learn and make progress.&quot; (Ofsted 2003)</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/16">The behaviour improvement programme (BiP) evaluation report by the university of London, published in November 2005, states that &quot;learning mentors were seen to fulfil one of the key roles in the programme and were highly valued by schools particularly at primary level. The BiP focuses on addressing behaviour and attendance issues in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344W.5/17">There are additional forms of mentoring provided within schools which are not provided by school learning mentors (employed by the school/local authority) e.g. peer and voluntary mentoring. There is also the work carried out by the mentoring and befriending foundation (ttp://<a href="http://www.mandbf.org.uk/">www.mandbf.org.uk/</a>).</p>

	<p pid="b.1359W.2/1">The Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) provides a route out of crime and into treatment for drug misusing offenders, using their contact with the Criminal Justice System as an opportunity to engage them in treatment and support. The intensive elements of the programme, which include testing for class A drugs on charge for certain trigger offences, are operational in 97 basic command units (BCUs) (67 Drug Action Teams) within England and three drug/alcohol partnerships in Wales. Other key elements of DIP are delivered in all areas of England and are being rolled out in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1359W.2/2">The intensive areas are listed in table 1. Since the programme began, over 31,000 drug misusing offenders have entered treatment through DIP. Latest figures show that over 2,000 DIP clients entered treatment in October 2005 and that the programme is on course to achieving the target of 1,000 offenders per week entering treatment by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1359W.2/3">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, the police in Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire police force areas, are able to test for class A drugs on arrest for certain trigger offences as an alternative to on charge for those who test positive and require them to attend an assessment with a drug worker. These new powers will be expanded further on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>. Acquisitive crime&mdash;to which drug related crime makes a substantial contribution&mdash;is going down and fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005.</p>

Friend the Minister of State Tony McNulty and I represent the interests of Home Office and the services it oversees on the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.2/2">In deriving these estimates account has to be taken of current and planned levels of investment in similar or related technologies and the types of use required to support the particular services which the Home Office oversees. Not all services will require a high degree of integration between the ID cards scheme and other IT systems. Where there may be a need for integration, some costs can be absorbed into the usual cycles of system upgrades and technology refreshes.</p>

It should be noted that swiping, to enable basic access control, is only likely to be required when the card is used as an international travel document.

This new centre will be called Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and is on track to open on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.3/2">The centre will take over the existing functions of the National Crime Squad (NCS) Paedophile Online Investigation Team (POLIT) and the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) Serious Sex Offenders' Unit (SSOU) and those functions of the NCS National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) that are focused on tackling online child abuse. It will also deliver a range of new functions. The new centre will:&mdash;receive, assess and disseminate intelligence on paedophiles and other serious sex offenders;&mdash;undertake proactive investigations into high risk targets. This will include targeting travelling sex offenders and seizing the assets from those who profit from the trade in indecent images;&mdash;provide a 24/7 cybertip line for reporting online child abuse;&mdash;deliver innovative crime prevention and crime reduction initiatives to reduce the harm caused by online abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.3/3">This will include public awareness and education campaigns;&mdash;manage the national database of child abuse images; and&mdash;provide information, advice, training and support. This includes specialist advice and guidance to law enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.3/4">The centre will be affiliated to the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and included in the SOCA governance arrangements but will have full operational autonomy. We know the only way to tackle these issues effectively is in partnership. Putting the different experts together for the first time in an operational centre will allow us to make a step change in the work we do to protect children.</p>

When light fittings come to the end of their life they are similarly replaced with energy efficient bulbs.

	<p pid="b.1371W.5/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the average time taken by local contact centres in England to call back applicants for Jobseeker's Allowance. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. In answer to your specific question, we do not keep separate figures for specific benefits. Also, whilst we do not have an official target for calling back customers who have made an initial application via our contact centres, we do have a stated aim to call 90% of customers back in 24 hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371W.5/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is undergoing a massive change programme. Change on this scale does create challenges in maintaining levels of service and it has put our business under some pressure in this transitional period. As a result many customers claiming working age benefits have not received their call-back within our stated timescales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371W.5/6" class="indent">We have put in place robust measures to improve performance including temporary adjustments to streamline the business process and ramping up recruitment plans, supported by robust training programmes. The latest figures that we have available are for the second week of October when 9.8% of customers received their call-back within 24 hours and on average customers were being contacted within 2.6 days of their initial contact. While this is clearly not acceptable it is a significant improvement from an average of 4.9 days at the beginning of September. Please note that this figure applies to all working age benefits that are made through contact centres based in England. We remain confident that the week on week improvements in customer service we have seen since the beginning of September will continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.1374W.6/1">Stakeholder pensions are now an established pension product. Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) show that at <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase> over two-and-a-half million stakeholder pensions had been sold since their introduction in April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1374W.6/2">Official figures for the 2003&ndash;04 tax year confirm that 99 per cent. of sales have been to people in work and that the majority of stakeholder pensions are being bought by those on modest incomes; over three-quarters (1,080,000) of stakeholder pension plans with contributions in them in that year were for workers earning under &pound;30,000 a year and around two-thirds (790,000) were for those workers earning under &pound;20,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1374W.6/3">Stakeholder pensions form an integral part of the range of Stakeholder Savings Products introduced in April 2005 and will benefit from the Government's Consumer Awareness Campaign launched in September.

	<p pid="b.1374W.6/4">Information on employee contributions alone is not available.

	<p pid="b.1381W.8/1">I understand that the chief executive of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, Ms Evelyn Collins, has written to the hon. Gentleman in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="b.1381W.8/2" class="indent">&quot;The Equality Commission recognises the sensitivity surrounding the use of emblems and symbols within Northern Ireland and offers guidance on these issues based on the relevant legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381W.8/3" class="indent">The Commission is of the view that the wearing of poppies by individuals in the workplace, in a respectful manner and within the appropriate period, should not be something which would cause offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381W.8/4" class="indent">Our advice to employers on the general issue of emblems in the workplace is that emblems which tend to distinguish one community from the other in Northern Ireland but are not directly connected with community strife are unlikely to be regarded as creating an intimidating or hostile working environment as described in the Code of Practice. In this category would fall marks of religious observance, ashes, crosses, crucifixes, pioneer pins, fainnes, as well as poppies and shamrocks when worn with decorum and at the appropriate period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381W.8/5" class="indent">It would be unacceptable if an individual was made to feel uncomfortable for not wearing any particular emblem or if the emblem was being flaunted before or forced on someone not wearing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381W.8/6" class="indent">It is a part of the Commission's remit to give advice and guidance on the Fair Employment legislation. It is for the Fair Employment Tribunal and the courts to establish and interpret the law, and, of course, if any individual feels that the use of emblems has constituted an unlawful act they are free to apply to the Tribunal for a decision on that point.&quot;</p>

The National Accord meeting itself, which is due to take place in Iraq at the end of February/beginning of March, will be an opportunity for countries to follow-up this review with substantive commitments of assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385W.3/2">The joint statement of principles which followed the Preparatory Meeting contained a number of positive points. Among these were the calls for support of Iraq's political/electoral processes, the importance of increasing security, recognition that terrorism is not a legitimate form of resistance and a call for greater economic, technical, diplomatic and security support for Iraq from Arab countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385W.3/3">The election of a new Iraqi government should herald a new era of international engagement with Iraq, with increased assistance for social and economic development as well as political and security development. Arab and regional governments should play a leading role in this&mdash;the National Accord Conference in February will be an early opportunity to carry forward this new international partnership.</p>

	<p pid="b.1392W.3/1">Exploration for offshore hydrocarbons is currently being undertaken by companies holding licences issued by the Falkland Islands Government, in areas to the north and the south east of the Falkland Islands. Exploration is at an early stage and has not yet led to any commercial discoveries, but seismic surveys are underway with a view to exploratory drilling in due course. The Government are fully committed to the offshore prospecting policy pursued by the Falkland Islands Government, which is entirely consistent with the United Kingdom's sovereign rights over the Falkland Islands.</p>

	<p pid="b.1408W.2/42">Officials keep the scheme under regular review and I am satisfied that it has provided significant help in supporting HCAs who wish to become nurses. Indeed, the number of HCAs participating has exceeded our expectations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/43">In 1998&ndash;99, &pound;50 million was allocated to widening access initiatives and the majority was spent on HCA secondments. In 2003&ndash;04, the student nurse population was around 63,000 and of these over 6,900 were HCAs. In 2004&ndash;05, &pound;164 million was allocated to strategic health authority workforce directorates to fund tuition fees and salary support for HCA's pre-registration training for an increased HCA population of over 9,400 (18 percent. of the population). In 2005&ndash;06, the planned spend is around &pound;185 million and the number of HCAs entering pre-registration nurse training is expected to rise to over 13,500 (18 percent. of the student population).</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/44">We do not hold centrally the number of applications accepted or rejected by national health service trusts nor the number of NHS trusts who do not offer secondments. The number of HCAs seconded to train as nurses is a matter for local decision and it is for individual employers to decide their policy on offering such secondments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/45">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Health addressed the Healthcare Assistants' Conference in July 2005 where she praised the outstanding care that healthcare assistants deliver on a daily basis. She made a commitment to continue to invest and reform the training and development opportunities for all in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="b.1409W.2/1">Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have recently submitted their proposals for the reconfiguration of primary care trusts (PCTs), which set out how they intend to strengthen their commissioning function. These proposals have been assessed by an independent external panel drawn from and representing a wide range of stakeholder interests, to determine whether the SHA proposals meet the criteria stipulated in &quot;Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS&quot;, (July 2005). Where the criteria are judged to have been met the proposals will go forward to a three-month public consultation. No decisions on the reorganisation of PCTs will be taken until this process has been completed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1416W.17/16">1. Data are not collected for individual hospitals. Data were collected by health authority only prior to 2001&ndash;02. Trust level data were collected from 2001&ndash;02 onwards. September 2005 represents the latest data.</p>
	<p pid="b.1416W.17/17">2. A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, you are to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels your operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.</p>
	<p pid="b.1416W.17/18">3. An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The quarterly monitoring cancelled operations (QMCO) collection does not record the number of postponements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1416W.17/19">4. Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; administrative error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1420W.5/1">All applications for new marketing authorisations made to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) under the European licensing procedures are being assessed well within the statutory timelines. The MHRA continues to assess new active substance applications with a mean assessment time of less than 40 days. However, it is acknowledged that performance with regard to the assessment of national abridged applications is currently below MHRA norms. This is due to a combination of reasons. As a result of new European requirements regarding the format of applications, the MHRA experienced a surge in applications in 2003 resulting in a backlog of applications to be processed. This, coupled with some difficulties in recruiting appropriate professional assessment staff as a result of market forces and the recent introduction of Sentinel, the MHRA's new information management system, has had an adverse effect on MHRA's overall efficiency in this area. Steps are currently in progress to actively address these issues, including a recent successful recruitment campaign, overtime exercises and the implementation of a range of steps to improve efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1422W.0/2">In order to support GPs in reducing obesity we are developing a variety of tools such as the obesity care pathway, a Weight Loss Guide and a short patient activity questionnaire.

NICE guidance will include an assessment of four commonly used methods to increase physical activity: brief interventions in primary care, pedometers, exercise referral schemes and community based exercise programmes for walking and cycling.</p>

	<p pid="b.1433W.2/2" class="indent">A duty under part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 for local housing authorities in England to ensure that suitable accommodation is available for people who are homeless through no fault of their own, if they are eligible for assistance and fall within a priority need group. (Priority need groups are as defined in section 189 of the 1996 Act and, additionally, in the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002.)</p>
	<p pid="b.1433W.2/3" class="indent">A duty under part 6 of the Housing Act 1996 for local housing authorities to ensure, in allocating settled social housing, that 'reasonable preference' for an allocation goes to certain categories of people (including those who are homeless and those who need to move on medical or welfare grounds) who might be considered vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1433W.2/4" class="indent">A duty under the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 23(B) (8) <i>(b)</i> to promote the welfare of care leavers, aged 16&ndash;18, and to support them by providing them with or maintaining them in suitable accommodation. Local authorities have continuing responsibilities to support care leavers aged 18&ndash;21 which may also require them to offer support to enable this group to access suitable accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1433W.2/5" class="indent">A duty under section 20 (3) of the Children Act 1989 to accommodate any child in need aged 16 and 17 whose welfare is likely to be seriously prejudiced without the provision of accommodation.

	<p pid="b.1433W.2/6" class="indent">Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 also includes the power for the children's services function of local authorities to provide accommodation for families and children. The power to provide accommodation under this section will almost always concern children needing to be accommodated with their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.1433W.2/7" class="indent">However, there may be cases where a lone child who needs help with accommodation, but who does not need to become a looked-after child, might appropriately be assisted under section 17. In these cases, the decision about whether or not a child should be accommodated by the local authority and the related decision as to whether he/she should become looked-after will be determined by the local authority's assessment of the child's needs in accordance with the statutory guidance set out in &quot;The framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families&quot; published by the Government in April 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1433W.2/8" class="indent">A power, and so far as directed by the Secretary of State for Health a duty, under sections 21 and 29 of the National Assistance Act 1948, for local authority social services to provide residential accommodation and certain other welfare services for people who are 'ordinarily resident' in the authority's area and who are in need of residential care. This includes a person with no settled residence or ordinarily resident elsewhere who is in urgent need of residential care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1433W.2/9">In single tier arrangements, these duties will fall to parts of the same local authority. In two-tier arrangements, the housing duties will fall to the lower tier authority and the social services duties will fall to the upper tier authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1433W.2/10">While not a duty, upper tier authorities also provide housing-related support services for vulnerable adults through the Supporting People programme. These services are intended to support and assist people to maintain or move towards living independently.</p>

	<p pid="b.1437W.5/1">Anti-discrimination legislation does not extend to the practice of refusing to let to benefit claimants and it would be impracticable to do so. However landlords often refuse to let to tenants on housing benefit because of the historical delays by local authorities in administering it. In 2002 the Government implemented a comprehensive strategy to improve delivery and now the average time taken to process new claims has been cut by over two weeks, with the greatest improvements seen in the poorest performing local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1437W.5/2">We are keen to encourage greater use of the private rented sector for those in housing need and we have been exploring with local authorities good practice in this field. Access to the private rented sector can be improved for households who might otherwise face homelessness through local authority schemes that provide rent deposits or the rent guarantees that private landlords seek, or which offer approved lettings with accredited landlords as part of an expansion of arrangements for choice-based lettings.</p>

	<p pid="b.1438W.5/2">The total capital receipts from right-to-buy sales of local authority dwellings in Bradford in the years from 1996&ndash;97 onwards are tabulated as follows. Information for years prior to 1996&ndash;97 is not centrally available. These figures are net of discounts and are as reported by the local authority. There was a large scale voluntary transfer in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
