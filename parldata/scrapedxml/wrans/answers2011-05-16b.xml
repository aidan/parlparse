Allotment authorities have a duty to provide plots for growing food to persons resident in the area and there are no plans to change this.

	<p pid="b.7W.2/1">We are setting up a new Animal Health and Welfare Board for England to have responsibility for strategic animal health and welfare policy, and oversight of its delivery in relation to England. Groups within the new rural and farming network will be able to engage with Ministers on local animal health and welfare issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April</phrase> we combined DEFRA's two key agencies for protecting animal health and welfare into a single body: the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency. This will enhance a joined up approach to responding to animal diseases and protecting the welfare of farmed animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/3">A new Strategic Animal Health Policy Programme has also recently been launched, building on work done to minimise the impact of exotic diseases, through which we will be working closely with industry to promote activities which can help maintain animal health by preventing disease incursion.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/4">We have placed increased emphasis on working with core groups of stakeholders to deliver better understanding and response to exotic notifiable disease incidents and emergencies and to develop new disease control strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/5">Working closely with farmers, the veterinary profession and others, we have made good progress towards improving the level of animal health and welfare:</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/6">We conducted a public consultation at the end of 2010 on the Government's approach to tackling bovine tuberculosis (TB) and a badger control policy, which also highlighted a number of planned changes to existing cattle measures to ensure that that they are better targeted on the basis of disease risk. We will be announcing a comprehensive and balanced TB eradication programme for England as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/7">We have reviewed the implementation of the Veterinary Surveillance Strategy to ensure that risks and emerging threats are effectively identified and prioritised. We continually monitor and assess the global animal health situation to help inform risk-based controls on imports of animals and animal products.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/8">We have continued to support the development of a surveillance system for diseases and issues in pet animals. This has been led by the University of Liverpool using a consortium approach and has now completed a successful pilot project, the Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network, which is now accessing data from veterinary surgeons and veterinary laboratories across the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/9">We have improved our arrangements for conducting veterinary risk assessments and prioritisation and established a standardised, peer-reviewed evidence base for policy development.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/10">We have continued to work to improve the availability of veterinary medicines for farm and pet animals by, for example, allowing the importation of medicines from other member states when there is a supply problem in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/11">We implemented EU Council Directive 2007/43, which lays down minimum standards to protect the welfare of conventionally reared meat chickens. The implementing regulations set a maximum stocking density of 39 kg/m<sup>(2)</sup>, sets training requirements for all keepers and requires post mortem conditions and mortality rates to be assessed as an indicator of on-farm welfare.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/12">The Code of Practice for the Welfare of Gamebirds Reared for Sporting Purposes came into force in January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/13">DEFRA completed its review of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and presented its findings in the form of a Command Paper to the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in December 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.9W.5/1">Current food labelling law permits manufacturers to choose to label oils, when used as ingredients, under the generic name &#8216;vegetable oil' (which could include any mixture of refined oil, other than olive oil) to allow for variability of supply in the type of the oils used and avoid label changes. If the palm oil was to be sold on its own it would need to be sold using the term 'palm oil' or any name that was sufficiently precise to indicate the true nature of the food and to distinguish it from any other food with which it could be confused, or a customary name.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.5/2">Amendment 387 to the proposed food information regulation which will replace the existing food labelling directive (from which our legislation derives) has been proposed by the European Parliament. This would make it mandatory for all the specific types of vegetable oil, including palm oil, to be separately labelled in food ingredients. It is one of a number of amendments asking for more information to be provided about oils which are used as an ingredient in pre-packed foods. Discussions on the regulation are ongoing and it is unclear whether this provision will be included in the final regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.5/3">I consider that this requirement for mandatory labelling of all vegetable oils in foods is unlikely to be a cost-effective approach to improving the sustainability of palm oil production and consumption. It may be burdensome for businesses to identify all the individual oils given the high number of products affected, often containing only small quantities of oils, and it would not inform consumers about whether or not the palm or other oils were sustainably produced. There is nothing to prevent manufacturers providing further information on a voluntary basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.10W.6/1">Pigeons are an agricultural pest and in more urban areas pigeons carry a range of diseases that can be harmful to humans. For this reason, Natural England issues a general licence, which allows authorised persons (e.g. owners/occupiers/local authorities or persons authorised by them) to kill or take these birds all year round. The licensing regime provides a legal framework within which local authorities and other authorised persons can take action to address a particular problem. The licence permits adult population control, egg control and nest clearance.</p>

Funding is being provided by all partners and volunteers will be taking a central role in the new project.</p>

Targeted control of grey squirrels is carried out in the reserves and surrounding buffer zones. In addition, the reserves and surrounding areas are being managed in ways that favour red squirrels. In the south-east, where there are secure populations on the Isle of Wight and Poole Harbour islands, there is an action plan in place to respond to the appearance of grey squirrels.</p>

The resulting protocol to bring the agreement into effect was opened for signature in February, but many contracting parties have had to delay signature because of a translation problem. This is likely to be resolved in June and we expect to be able to sign soon afterwards.

	<p pid="b.14W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) works in close partnership with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in promoting free and fair elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Together we closely monitor reports of intimidation and harassment of opposition figures. We work with our EU partners to follow up cases of concern, and liaise regularly with the UN stabilisation mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) Joint Human Rights Office and local NGOs to assess the situation. We continue to press the Government of the DRC at the highest levels on these issues, including during recent meetings with the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.14W.3/2">Additionally, we are working to support a transition towards democratic policing in DRC. Central to this is improving respect for human rights. We are actively engaging with the Government of the DRC, provincial governments and the police to promote adherence to democratic principles of policing during the elections process.</p>

	<p pid="b.20W.8/1">The Goldstone report outlines serious allegations of breaches of international humanitarian law during the Gaza conflict. Justice Goldstone stated in his recent comments that some aspects of his report would look differently in light of new evidence, correcting the allegation in the report that Israel intentionally targeted civilians.</p>
	<p pid="b.20W.8/2">Justice Goldstone has made clear that there is no reason to reconsider the various other serious allegations contained in the report at this time. This is consistent with our longstanding policy of calling for full, credible and independent investigations by the parties into any and all allegations of breaches of international humanitarian law (IHL).</p>
	<p pid="b.20W.8/3">Allegations of breaches of IHL made against all parties to the Gaza conflict are not limited to the Goldstone report and have arisen from various other credible sources. We firmly believe that any and all such allegations must be met with credible and independent investigations by the parties to the conflict.</p>

	<p pid="b.21W.2/2">Our embassies in Tunis and Cairo remained functional throughout recent events and this question therefore did not arise there. In Libya, the Hungarian embassy remains open and British nationals can seek assistance there or from any other EU member state embassy that remains open. The Hungarians have already provided consular assistance to a number of unrepresented EU nationals in Libya. Arrangements for accessing consular assistance have been communicated to British nationals through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel advice, available on the FCO website.</p>
	<p pid="b.21W.2/3">We also distribute guidance to British nationals regarding their rights under Article 20. This is set out in the FCO publication &#8220;Support for British nationals abroad&#8221; which is also available on the FCO website. While the guide does not explicitly mention Article 20, it makes clear that if British nationals need help in a country where there is no British diplomatic or consular mission, they can receive help from the diplomatic or consular mission of another member of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.45W.2/1">Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 55/2010 gave effect to a June 2010 Supreme Court judgment that fundamentally changed how the legislation must be applied to prisoners with multiple sentences which are subject to a mixture of release provisions (i.e. under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and Criminal Justice Act 2003). The result has been that some prisoners have been notified of earlier Home Detention Curfew (HDC) and Early Removal Scheme (ERS) eligibility dates, while the impact on others has been later sentence and licence expiry dates. Prisons have reported that the dates for 5,651 prisoners have had to be recalculated. We have estimated that an additional 80 prison places may be required in the longer term as a direct result of implementing the judgment. These can be accommodated within planned provision. There will be some additional costs in extending the supervision period of some offenders but these are expected to be minimal. These recalculations have been necessary in order for the sentences of affected prisoners to remain lawful and in line with the Supreme Court judgment.</p>

	<p pid="b.46W.5/4">A considerable amount of work aimed at reducing the FNP population is already under way.

	<p pid="b.46W.5/5">In addition, we are building on existing prisoner transfer agreements, which enable some foreign national prisoners to serve their sentence in their country of origin.

Less serious failures are logged locally and will be discussed routinely with the governor's manager and at regular security committee meetings held within each prison. The results of formal security audit reports are published internally and a follow up action plan must be produced by the prison to remedy any deficiencies. High priority recommendations are always followed up with individual prisons and a quarterly report, listing progress on implementation of recommendations, together with any patterns in security failures, is distributed to senior management. A NOMS Audit Committee, chaired by a non-executive director, will consider any underlying patterns, issues and specific areas of concern connected with both security and general matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.57W.3/1">Under the last Administration as part of a two day event, the Planning Inspectorate held a Gypsy and Traveller appeals workshop on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-13">Friday 13 November 2009</phrase>. The aim of the workshop was to provide an opportunity for dialogue between the principal stakeholders engaged in Gypsy and Traveller appeals, to explore ways in which current appeal practice might be improved, for example, to help the smoother running of appeals, as Gypsy and Traveller casework tends to be more complex and can often result in delays and events overrunning. The workshop also addressed current issues and different perspectives. The discussions specifically did not address individual cases nor current or forthcoming appeals, being restricted to generic matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.3/2">The matters discussed through round table discussions, were Gypsy status and consistency on application and acceptance of Gypsy status; Development Plan Matters; Procedural Matters and Personal Circumstances (eg confidentiality and sensitivity of personal data and educational and health needs).</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.3/3">The workshop was attended by around 50 inspectors and staff from the Planning Inspectorate and representatives from parties involved in appeals, namely a number of planning consultancies: (Anderson Planning and Dev Ltd, Green Planning Solutions, Heine Planning Consultancy, Philip Brown Associates), various legal chambers (Garden Court Chambers, 10 King's Bench Chambers, 2-3 Gray's Inn Square, Radcliffe Chambers, 1 Pump Court Chambers, Francis Taylor Buildings), a number of local authorities (Basildon, Brentwood, Bromley, Central Bedfordshire, Maidstone, Mendip, Sevenoaks, South Gloucestershire, South Somerset, and Wychavon) and DCLG. Participants were invited based on the amount of relevant casework they were involved in.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.3/4">Since the workshop the Planning Inspectorate has made some minor procedural amendments, for example changes to durations, for gypsy and traveller cases. It has also trialled the use of a pre-inquiry or hearing note in some cases, but this has not been limited to just Gypsy and Traveller casework.</p>

	<p pid="b.60W.5/2">From December 1997, blood components, plasma products or tissues obtained from any individual who later develops variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), have been withdrawn/recalled to prevent their use;</p>

	<p pid="b.60W.5/6">Donors who were unsure if they had previously had a blood transfusion. This now applies to donors who have been transfused anywhere in the world;</p>

	<p pid="b.60W.5/10">All of these measures were recommended or endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (which first met in January 2008) or its predecessor committees.</p>
	<p pid="b.60W.5/11">Additionally, considerable effort is being extended to promote appropriate use of blood throughout the national health service, to target blood use to where it is clinically essential, and for bleeding disorder patients (such as haemophiliacs) UK plasma has not been used for the manufacture of clotting factors since 1999 and recombinant clotting factors are now available for all patients for whom they are suitable.</p>

	<p pid="b.61W.2/1">A study published in 2004 of stored appendix and tonsil tissue samples found abnormal prion protein in three appendices out of 12,674 samples. This suggested a population prevalence of about one in 4,000, though with very wide confidence interval of between one in 1,400 and one in 20,000. A further study of over 96,000 tonsils pairs is nearing completion, and a study of 30,000 appendix samples is due to be completed in 2012. Prevalence estimates are kept under active review by the relevant expert scientific advisory committees, who will review all the evidence on the completion of these ongoing studies.</p>
	<p pid="b.61W.2/2">In England about 4.4% of the population are blood donors, and the prevalence of potentially infective blood donors remains unknown. Not all of the individuals in the 2004 published study would be of an age eligible to donate blood, nor is it clear whether presence of abnormal prion protein in tissues such as the appendix or tonsils indicates that the blood of such a donor would transmit variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

	<p pid="b.63W.0/1">It is up to local authorities to decide how much advocacy they commission for people with profound and multiple learning disabilities, who they commission it from and how they make it available to their local populations. The role of the Department is to provide the framework for services&#8212;to be clear about social care law and about social care policy. Therefore, we are considering the report of the Law Commission and looking to modernise the legal framework in which social care is provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.0/2">It is for local authorities and national health service commissioning staff to ensure that advocacy services meet the needs of people with profound and multiple learning disabilities through their commissioning arrangements. They also monitor and assess the quality of advocacy and local needs and make decisions about deployment of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.0/3">Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, local authorities and general practitioner commissioning consortia will be required to prepare a Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA). This is to ensure that each area develops a comprehensive analysis of the current and future needs of their area (including those relevant to health, social care and public health). Based on the JSNA, the members of the Health and Wellbeing Board will be required to develop a joint health and well-being strategy for their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.0/4">In its &#8216;Vision for Adult Social Care, Capable Communities and Active Citizens&#8217;, the Government say that</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.0/5">&#8220;councils should focus on improving the range, quality and accessibility of information, advice and advocacy available for all people in their communities&#8212;regardless of how their care is paid for&#8212;to support their social care choices&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.0/6">Additionally, the Independent Mental Capacity Advocacy (IMCA) Service was created under the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005. The MCA introduced a new duty to instruct advocates in certain conditions for people who lack the capacity to make decisions for themselves. The Department has funded this service by making &#163;6 million available to local authorities to commission local services to provide the IMCA role. Nearly 10,000 people benefited from this last year and the Department published an annual report on the IMCA service in November 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.0/7">The Department has worked with the advocacy sector to develop a national qualification in advocacy, which is available to the sector and to commissioners. The national advocacy qualification has been part of the professionalising of advocacy and ensures that advocates are appropriately trained. The Department has also funded a &#8216;Quality Mark&#8217; system, administered by Action for Advocacy, which enable advocacy organisations to demonstrate their services are of high quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.0/8">The Department does not collect local information on advocacy provision and its costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.0/1">Valuing People Now (2009) said that independent supported living can be enjoyed by people with profound and multiple learning disabilities because the support is tailored to their particular requirements based on an assessment of individual needs and choices. Different types of housing and support, including home ownership and assured tenancies have to be matched and coordinated with a package of care specifically designed to support the particular individual in the home of their choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.0/2">Professor Jim Mansell's report, &#8216;Raising our Sights&#8217;, published in March 2010 identified a need for adequate housing for adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. The Government's response to Professor Mansell's report recognised that there is a continuing need for new affordable housing, including supported housing. The needs and aspirations of those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities should be considered in the provision of general housing needs, as well as in specialist provision. We expect housing associations and local authorities to work closely to identify the type of provision that will most appropriately meet the locally identified needs. They will also have the best understanding of how any new provision will fit with, and complement, existing services and supported housing locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.0/3">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will be issuing a consultation paper on the payment of housing costs for people living in supported and sheltered housing classified as exempt accommodation. DWP intend to publish this shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.3/1">In the public health White Paper, &#8220;Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our strategy for public health in England&#8221;, we announced radical reforms to how public health is managed in future. From April 2013, local authorities will be given responsibility, backed by a ring-fenced public health grant, and new freedoms, to make a major impact on improving people's health and tackling health inequalities in every community.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.3/2">We remain fully committed to the NHS Health Check programme, which is aimed at everyone in England between the ages of 40-74. It is a risk assessment and risk management programme, which assesses people's risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and diabetes and supports people to reduce or manage that risk through individually tailored advice. In rolling out this programme, some primary care trusts targeted high-risk groups first such as South Asian populations who are at particularly high risk of diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.3/3">The recently published National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidance, &#8220;Preventing type 2 diabetes: population and community-level interventions in high-risk groups and the general population&#8221;, makes recommendations for the provision of culturally appropriate messages about preventing Type 2 diabetes. The guidance underlines the action that we are already taking to improve public health and reduce the risk of people developing Type 2 diabetes. It is for the national health service at a local level to determine the needs of their local population and to allocate resources appropriately to meet these needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.3/4">To raise awareness of the importance of maintaining a healthy weight, the Government developed a national movement called &#8220;Change4life&#8221; to help parents make healthier food choices for their children and encourage more activity.</p>

	<p pid="b.70W.0/1">Before a medical device can be placed on the market the manufacturer has to show that he has met the safety, quality and performance requirements laid down in the EC medical devices directives. This will include having clinical data to support any claims made for the device. For high risk devices, such as hip joints, stents and pacemakers, the clinical data is assessed by an independent conformity assessment organisation, known as a notified body, designated by the competent authority of the member state where they are located. On the basis of the notified body's conformity assessment the manufacturer can affix the CE marking (denoting compliance with the directive requirements) on the device.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.0/2">Since March 2010, when the 2007 revision of the EC medical devices directive came fully into force, manufacturers of high risk devices have to justify, to the notified body, not conducting a specific clinical trial of their product to obtain the clinical data. Where this is because the manufacturer is relying on data relating to a similar device, the manufacturer has to demonstrate equivalency between the devices and thus the relevance and appropriateness of the data used.</p>

It is therefore likely that some functions will be transferred to other organisations and the Department will take on some new ones.

FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. <sup>(2)</sup> Main procedure or intervention The first recorded procedure or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (eg time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedures. <sup>(3)</sup> Assessing growth through time Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in national health service practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i>Note:</i> Data quality HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i>Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.80W.6/3" class="italic">Substantive answer from Chris Grayling to Martin Vickers:</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.6/4">There are two elements to the payments, social security benefits and health care claims.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.6/5" class="italic">Social security benefit expenditure</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.6/6">Under the EU rules that coordinate the social security rights of persons who move within the EEA and Switzerland, some benefits acquired in one member state must be paid to people who live outside that state but within the EEA or Switzerland. Generally the benefits are acquired because someone is, or has been, working in the United Kingdom and has paid the relevant national insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.6/7">These regulations apply to benefits for old age, sickness and invalidity, unemployment, family responsibilities, death and survivors, and industrial injuries, and lay down the circumstances in which a person retains social security benefits when they move between EEA member states. Winter fuel payments are covered by these rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.6/8" class="italic">Health  care expenditure</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.6/9">Health is a benefit in kind for the purpose of the regulations. Member states reimburse each other on an annual basis for care provided to each other's citizens. The costs are for claims for medical costs made under the European Health Insurance Card scheme, for health care provided to posted workers, for planned treatment and for health care costs relating to state pensioners.

	<p pid="b.83W.9/11">Nearly all the above payments relate to injury related claims connected with the health liabilities of British Coal that now rest with the Department. The vast majority of these claims have been handled under the supervision of the High Court. However, the coal health figures relate to claims issued in all jurisdictions, even though the Department has assumed that the term &#8220;civil claims&#8221; in the question refers to claims issued in England and Wales, in the courts of civil jurisdiction (the High Court and the county courts). Data on coal health claims payments and costs relating solely to claims issued in England and Wales could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.9/12">The Department of Energy and Climate Change was established in October 2008. In relation to coal health claims, the amounts included in the table for 2008-09 are pro rata estimates, based on total payments and costs that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.9/13">The figures included on other (non-coal health) claims relate to claims issued in England and Wales, in the courts of civil jurisdiction, and do not therefore include employment-related claims pursued through the employment tribunals. In one of these cases, the Department used the case handling services of another Government Department, and the cost of those services could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Significant progress has been made by Sellafield in reducing radioactive discharges to the Irish sea.

	<p pid="b.96W.8/13">Working tax credit is designed to remove barriers to work and to top up earnings of working people on low to moderate incomes. People with children or a disability can claim it from age 16, provided they work at least 16 hours a week. Others must be aged 25 and work 30 or more hours a week to qualify. This reflects the fact that people without children or a disability face fewer barriers to work and should, therefore, be expected to work more hours per week than those with children or a disability.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.8/14">Employment and support allowance (ESA) is payable to people aged 16 to 65 whose ability to work is limited by ill-health or disability, subject to other qualifying conditions being met. ESA has both contributory and income-related elements; entitlement to contributory ESA is linked to a person's national insurance record with income-related ESA providing a means tested level of support.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.8/15">Disability living allowance is a cash benefit for children and adults with long-term impairments, which contributes towards the extra costs associated with their disability. It can be paid whether the recipient is in employment, unable to work as a result of their condition, seeking work or in education. It is not means tested and does not require a record of national insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.8/16">Young people under 18, who are available for work and training, can get jobseeker's allowance in certain situations&#8212;in particular if the young person would suffer severe hardship if the allowance were not paid. Under this power, all the individual circumstances of the young person are taken into account and it is therefore an effective safety net for those young people who are the most vulnerable. The young person will need to meet certain labour market rules and register with Connexions.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.8/17">Certain groups of young people who are still in relevant education can claim income support. These include lone parents and those who are still in full time non-advanced education (up to A Level/NVQ Level3 and equivalents) but estranged from their parents, or those acting as their parents, for reasons of abuse or family breakdown.</p>

	<p pid="b.99W.2/2">The main measure of Jobcentre Plus performance is the rate at which people leave jobseeker's allowance, income support and employment and support allowance and move into employment. The measure supports the Department for Work and Pensions 2011-15 business plan and the coalition Government's structural reform priorities.

Jobcentre Plus has a robust Risk Assessment methodology to deal with this volume of customer interactions, with suitable and sufficient control measures in place to manage the majority of those contacts. The majority of incidents reported are verbal. Jobcentre Plus employs approximately 73,000 staff. It takes the safety of staff very seriously. For this reason, it encourages staff to report all incidents of unacceptable customer behaviour. Where incidents do occur we provide support through our Employee Assistance Programme. All incidents are also investigated so that, if appropriate, lessons can be learned.</p>

	<p pid="b.102W.0/2">We believe it wholly appropriate that people below the pension credit qualifying age should receive the support that will be available through universal credit to encourage and enable work. We are still considering the support that will be available for couples in this position. However, we also recognise that it is important not to undermine the stability and outcomes for existing pension credit customers, so the change will only apply to new claims and not to couples already in receipt of pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="b.108W.2/1">The Council for Mortgage Lenders have advised that a student loan is very unlikely to materially impact on an individual&#8217;s ability to get a mortgage. The reduction in net income as a result of loan repayment results in a commensurate reduction in the amount a mortgage lender is willing to lend. That is one reason why our proposal to increase the repayment threshold from &#163;15,000 to &#163;21,000 reduces the amount borrowers need to repay each month, and therefore increases the amount of net monthly income available to them which could be helpful to them when applying for a mortgage.</p>

	<p pid="b.108W.5/1">The Department considers it essential to ensure that prospective students and their families know about the full package of support available, to support access to higher education. One of the key messages for the campaign is that students will not have to pay up front. This message features in both our radio and digital advertising.</p>

These centres include the National Renewable Energy Centre, Wave Hub, the Centre for Process Innovation, and the National Composites Centre, and these have been the primary focus of our direct discussions. Officials across this Department also have formal and informal contacts with a number of centres in the context of their work although there is no formal record of these interactions.</p>
