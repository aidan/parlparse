To that end, the ODA's Access and Inclusion Forum meets on a quarterly basis to advice on areas of inclusive design through the sharing of knowledge and experience.

	<p pid="a.745W.6/3">In addition to the forum, the ODA Access Panels&mdash;one for the built environment and one for transport&mdash;target the more specific issues around those areas. The Panels provide specialist disability and inclusive design experts to review and advise upon Park commitments&mdash;both at Games time and in legacy&mdash;and have final sign-off on ODA build commitments. In support of this, the ODA has also appointed two Principal Access Officers, one specialising in transport accessibility, and one specialising in the built environment. These Officers are responsible for the development of inclusive design within the ODA's programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.753W.8/1">Over the past 12 years, the Ministry of Health in Vietnam have been carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the continuing effects of dioxin contamination across the country. The evidence shows that the majority of land in Vietnam is not contaminated and that concentrations of dioxin in most of Vietnam are within international guidelines. However, there remain &quot;hotspots&quot; of serious contamination particularly around former US bases where dioxin and other herbicides were stored and deployed. The main priorities are to protect communities living in these areas and to provide support for those already affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.753W.8/2">The Vietnam Government are implementing policies, standards and guidelines to deal with the problem. This work is being funded by a number of agencies including the Canadian International Development Agency, Ford Foundation, and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation. DFID provides budget support to Vietnam through its funding of the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Support Credit. Part of this supports work on environmental standards and waste management. In addition, our education programmes (around &pound;40 million) support inclusive education for children with disabilities (including from dioxin) and our core funds to the UN (&pound;4 million) also support UN work on environmental management. A large number of international and national non-governmental organisations also provide support to Agent Orange victims, including the Vietnam Red Cross, Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange, the Fund for Reconciliation and Development, and Oxfam-Hong Kong.</p>

	<p pid="a.767W.8/1">The Government remain committed to engagement with the Governments of both Pakistan and Iran to tackle the flows of opiates from Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.8/2">The UK has supported the work of the Pakistan government to update its drugs strategy (&quot;Masterplan&quot;) and earmarked US $80,000 of its contribution to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) for consultancy input to its development. The UK provides diplomatic and political support to the Pakistan government's counter-narcotics (CN) work, including through some &pound;800,000 in the last three years to train officers of the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) and to provide them with equipment. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, when he was the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March 2006</phrase> that the UK had agreed to gift two helicopters to the ANF for CN work. Delivery is expected in the early spring of this year. The UK Serious Organised Crime Agency enjoys operational co-operation with its Pakistani partners on counter-narcotics issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.8/3">The UK has also contributed to the work of the UNODC in Iran. With the support of the Government of Iran, the UNODC has developed a strategy to build international support for tackling drugs demand and trafficking of opiates in Iran. The UK has contributed &pound;500,000 to the UNODC in the last three years for this purpose with a particular focus on the provision of equipment and training of officers combating the trafficking of opiates on Iran's eastern border with Afghanistan. Additionally, we have supplied bilaterally some &pound;30,000 of equipment for policing the eastern border.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.8/4">The Government further engages to support a number of multilateral fora in which the policies and operations of governments in this region are co-ordinated and developed. The Paris Pact, organised by the UNODC, brings together those donor and beneficiary nations which are committed to tackle the drugs flows from Afghanistan to Europe; a database organised by the UNODC collates and co-ordinates the contributions of the donor community and matches these with the identified needs of countries on the trafficking routes. The Afghan government's work on the Good Neighbourly Relations Declaration (GNRD) on CN, agreed in Berlin on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> and in which the UK acts in an observer role, brings together all immediately neighbouring nations and commits them to work with each other and with Afghanistan to develop CN work. The UK is supporting the Ministry of Counter Narcotics' plans to hold a further GNRD meeting this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.772W.6/1">The Arts Council operates at arm's length from the Government and decisions about which arts organisations to fund are entirely for them. Their fundamental criteria are set out in their Royal Charter</p>

	<p pid="a.772W.6/3">In February 2007 the Arts Council created detailed guidance on how it would develop its investment strategy for 2008/9-2010/11. That guidance said that the Council would give particular priority to the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.6/4" class="indent">achieving a portfolio of effective and thriving organisations;</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.6/5" class="indent">increasing engagement in the arts across the population;</p>

	<p pid="a.772W.6/8">The Arts Council informed their regularly funded organisations of this in May 2007 and of their intention to provide the majority of organisations with at least an inflation increase in funding, and that this would be achieved by reducing the size of their portfolio of regularly funded organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.772W.6/9">The Arts Council did not hold any consultation about these criteria specifically. However, it held a public value inquiry, the Arts Debate, between October 2006 and September 2007. The inquiry considered how people think and feel about the arts in England and their priorities for public funding. The Arts Council is incorporating the results of the enquiry into their corporate planning.</p>

	<p pid="a.772W.6/11" class="indent">&quot;Our proposals for non-renewal of funding cannot be made available until our National and Regional Councils make final decisions. This information is considered confidential and commercially sensitive during the response period. This is especially so in the case of a recommendation that might be overturned by the National Council or a Regional Council. Regularly funded organisations who have a right to respond to our recommendation, should be able to do so freely without fear that our intention to reduce or stop their funding is potentially unnecessarily, and without their consent, released into the public domain.

	<p pid="a.776W.2/1">Since 2002, Sport England has awarded almost &pound;70.2 million to the Football Foundation to support grassroots capital and revenue projects. This includes &pound;11.7 million from the Community Club Development Programme (CCDP) which helps community sports clubs to develop their sports facilities. We do not hold details of CCDP awards made specifically in West Lancashire, however, in Lancashire, &pound;1.6 million has been awarded to community football clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.2/2">Over 4,500 community sports clubs are also benefiting from tax relief through the Community Amateur Sports Club initiative. This has saved sports clubs an estimated &pound;22.8 million over the last five years&mdash;allowing clubs to put money back into sport, including for sports facilities. In Lancashire, 97 sports clubs, including 12 football clubs, have benefited to date.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.5/1">The Gambling Act 2005 places the protection of children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited by gambling as one of the principal objectives of gambling regulation for the first time. The Act also establishes a powerful new regulator, the Gambling Commission, responsible for ensuring UK gambling operators are meeting the Government's licensing objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.5/2">All gambling operators must comply with tough social responsibility measures or risk losing their licence. These measures include procedures to prevent under-age gambling, procedures for self-exclusion, information about how to access help in relation to problem gambling, and a commitment to contribute to research, education and treatment of problem gambling. However if there is evidence that the objectives of the Act are not being met, the Government have wide-ranging powers to introduce further regulations and restrictions.</p>

It is the intention of both the MLA and the BM to maintain a national scheme in 2008-09 and beyond.</p>

	<p pid="a.783W.3/1">DCMS and VisitBritain are working to maximise the impact of public funding for 2012-related tourism work. VisitBritain is currently leading a Strategic Review to examine how we can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the expenditure of &pound;350 million invested by public bodies to support tourism. DCMS and VisitBritain are considering the best mechanisms for using funding at all levels to promote the UK at home and in overseas markets, between now and the 2012 games. This includes the best use of VisitBritain's funding allocation from DCMS.</p>

	<p pid="a.791W.9/1">The Government recognise the vital role that taxis play in the transportation of disabled people and we are committed to delivering more accessible taxis.

	<p pid="a.791W.9/2">Under sections 32 to 36 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Government have powers to regulate in this area.

I will announce our proposals shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.791W.9/3">In the meantime, we are encouraging taxi licensing authorities to ensure that local policies take account of the needs of all taxi users. The Department issued best practice guidance to local authorities in 2006. Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act also now applies to both hackney cabs and private hire vehicles and it gives disabled people a &quot;right of access&quot; to goods, services and facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.791W.9/4">Taxi drivers now have to take reasonable steps to ensure that disabled people are able to use their vehicles, but they do not have to modify the vehicle itself. The Disability Rights Commission (now superseded by the Equality and Human Rights Commission) issued guidance in 2007 on what may be considered reasonable in relation to disabled people and access to taxis.</p>

	<p pid="a.792W.2/2">Without accounting for the impact of policy measures, analysis suggests that emissions of carbon dioxide from UK transport would continue to increase to 2020. However, by implementing the policy measures quantified in the 2006 Climate Change programme and the 2007 Energy White Paper, domestic emissions from transport are projected to be up to 20 per cent. lower in 2020 than they would have been in the absence of these measures.</p>

In the central scenario from the UK &quot;MARKAL-Macro&quot; model reported in the 2007 Energy White Paper, (under which the UK achieves a 60 per cent. reduction in domestic CO2 emissions by 2050), the transport sector sees emission reductions from 2000 levels of about 5 per cent. by 2020, and of about 45 per cent. by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.792W.2/4">The results of this model are not &quot;forecasts&quot;; the model presents the most cost-effective way of achieving the target in 2050, given, for example, an analysis of what technology can in principle deliver.</p>

	<p pid="a.792W.5/14">These figures do not include lorry travel as the Department does not collect figures on passengers travelling by this mode. However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Company Reporting Guidelines (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/envrp/pdf/envrpgas-annexes.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/envrp/pdf/envrpgas-annexes.pdf</a>) give average emission factors per km for lorry journeys, separated by type of vehicle and laden factor (the extent to which the lorry is loaded to its maximum carrying capacity).</p>
	<p pid="a.792W.5/15">For example, the average CO2 emissions from a 0 per cent. laden rigid HGV (carrying no load), travelling from London to Edinburgh, is approximately 359 kg. With a laden factor of 100 per cent., this average increases to about 517 kg. Actual emissions will vary depending on, for example, the particular vehicle, driving style and laden factor. Similar calculations can be made using the guidelines for journeys between any two points in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.8/1">The MOD is determined to lead the way in reducing its carbon dioxide emissions. We have already made significant progress in this area by taking a range of actions including: improving building energy management and energy efficiency; working with the Carbon Trust to identify opportunities for energy efficiency improvements at the top 220 energy-consuming defence sites; making central funds available for estate emissions reduction projects and embedding pro-rata energy efficiency targets into service delivery agreements between the MOD Permanent Under Secretary and the Department's management areas. We have also worked with our road vehicle fleet contractors to provide more energy-efficient vehicles and have offset emissions from business and ministerial flights.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.8/2">Work in these areas will continue during 2008-09 and beyond. In addition, we will develop and implement a carbon neutrality strategy for the MOD office estate, increase our procurement of non-climate change levy electricity and use of on-site micro-renewable energy systems, and make staff more aware of the environmental impact of their travel through a new self-booking travel tool.</p>

	<p pid="a.801W.9/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January 2008</phrase> (Official Report, column 53W) to respond to your Question, regarding the cost of the decommissioning of Vanguard Class submarines.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.9/4" class="indent">As you may be aware from the answers to previous questions, it is not possible to provide costs broken down by class; the furthest they can be broken down at present is to the total decommissioning cost for in-service submarines only.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.9/5" class="indent">Nuclear decommissioning provisions are the estimated costs of future liabilities. These are principally related to future facility decommissioning and the treatment and storage of nuclear waste arising from operations at MOD sites, operations of Royal Navy submarines, and the Departmental share of planning and constructing a national repository for the eventual disposal of that waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.9/6" class="indent">We have recently undertaken a review of the nuclear provisions. Our estimated current liability for in-service submarines only (i.e. excluding facility decommissioning, and the decommissioning of out of service submarines and submarines not yet in service) is &pound;455 million. This is an 'undiscounted' figure, meaning that it includes an estimate of potential inflation; the equivalent discounted figure is &pound;240 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.9/7" class="indent">I hope that this is helpful.</p>

We expect that once the new fleet of submarines comes into service the annual in-service costs of the UK's nuclear deterrent, including the costs of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, will be similar to today (around 5 to 6 per cent. of the defence budget).</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.9/1">Evaluation and assessment of the single non-emergency number 101 service in the initial five live areas has found that the service has successfully demonstrated the benefits it was intended to achieve. In addition to improving the public's access to community safety services, through better partnership working and information about what problems are happening where, the 101 service has also helped local police and councils to target their resources more effectively and efficiently and improve the delivery of those services to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.9/2">While the Government recognise the benefits that have been achieved, it has been decided that the Home Office will not continue to fund directly the operation of the 101 service in the live areas or the development of 101 services in other areas. This was a difficult decision taken in the context of significant pressure on resources and competing policing and security priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.9/3">However, the Home Office will continue to provide funding for the national 101 infrastructure in order to enable and support local areas to maintain or develop their own locally funded 101 services, informed by and building on the benefits demonstrated to date, I welcome the work currently being taken forward to this effect by the Greater London Assembly together with London councils, individual boroughs and the Metropolitan Police in their plans to pilot the 101 service locally.</p>

	<p pid="a.806W.2/1">It is estimated that police checks against the NIR will take only a short time, similar to current checks against police databases, to fit in with the operational requirements of the police. The exact amount of time taken will vary, depending on the nature of the check carried out, but routine identity verification should take a matter of seconds.</p>
	<p pid="a.806W.2/2">The exact technical details of how identity checks will be made have yet to be negotiated, precise details will be determined by the chosen supplier and the police during the development of the Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.806W.2/3">When the Scheme is first introduced the number of checks required by the police will be limited but will increase as the Scheme grows. Consequently, in the beginning there will be a limited number of police stations that have technology and equipment to allow officers to make identity checks against the National Identity Register. As rollout continues it will be a matter for the police to determine their requirement for equipment as the Scheme rolls out.</p>

	<p pid="a.809W.5/2">The purpose of extradition is to ensure that those accused of a crime do not avoid justice by leaving the country in which the alleged offence took place. The fugitives unit of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) processes extraditions from the UK to member states of the European Union under the European Arrest Warrant system. The involvement of SOCA finishes when the extradition case is concluded, either by the person being extradited to the requesting country or by the extradition request being dismissed. SOCA has no statutory role in the monitoring of cases post extradition.</p>
	<p pid="a.809W.5/3">However, information about convictions received abroad by UK citizens&mdash;whether extradition was involved or not&mdash;may be of interest to the UK police, and this information is obtained from countries of the Council of Europe (which includes all EU member states) by the UK Central Authority for the Exchange of Criminal Record information (UKCA-ECR) which is a part of the Criminal Records Office of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACRO).</p>

	<p pid="a.824W.2/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has been an integral part of the team tasked with designing the new processes associated with the requirements of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (SVG Act) to ensure that impacts on the disclosure service are minimised as far as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.2/2">There should be no adverse impact on the processing time of standard or enhanced disclosures as a result of the new processes, and the CRB is taking the opportunity afforded by the changes prompted by the SVG Act to explore how to leverage further efficiency improvements in its existing processes. The costs to CRB of operating the new elements of the processes associated with the SVG Act will be covered by the additional application fees levied under Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.2/3">There is no legal requirement to assess the level of charge between intermediary bodies, individuals and small organisations for the processing of checks, which is a commercial matter between the intermediary body and its customers. However, a regulatory impact assessment for the Act was published in 2006 and includes details of the impact on small firms, references to how we propose to balance the rights of individual employees with those of vulnerable groups, and a range of references to the impact on other bodies such as regulators, the voluntary sector, local government bodies and the police.</p>

	<p pid="a.828W.11/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question about how many people were (a) employed (i) full-time (ii) part time and (b) unemployed in (A) City of York constituency, (B) City of York council area, (C) Yorkshire and The Humber and (D) the United Kingdom (1) at the latest date for which figures are available and (2) at the same date in each of the previous 10 years.

	<p pid="a.828W.11/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles employment statistics for local areas from the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.11/5" class="indent">Table 1 attached, shows the number of people, aged 16 and over, resident in the City of York constituency, who were in full-time and part-time employment, for the 12 months ending in February from 1997 to 2004 from the annual LFS and for the 12 months ending in March from 2005 to 2007, and for the latest period, the 12 months ending in June 2007, from APS. The table also shows corresponding data for residents of the City of York Unitary Authority, Yorkshire and The Humber and Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.11/6" class="indent">For unitary and local authorities, the ONS produces estimates of total unemployment, following ILO definitions, from a statistical model. Annual estimates for other areas are compiled from the annual LFS and APS following ILO definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.11/7" class="indent">Table 2 attached, shows the number of people, aged 16 and over, resident in the City of York constituency, who were unemployed, for the 12 months ending in February from 1997 to 2004 from the annual LFS and for the 12 months ending in March from 2005 to 2007, and for the latest period, the 12 months ending in June 2007, from APS. The table also shows corresponding data for residents of the City of York Unitary Authority, Yorkshire and The Humber and Great Britain. Corresponding headline unemployment rates, for persons of working age (males aged 16 to 64 and females aged 16 to 59), are also provided. The rates allow changes to be seen in the context of changing population numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.11/8" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. In this case, for the City of York constituency and the City of York Unitary Authority, the sample sizes are not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of even the direction of the change over the period.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.11/9" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). Table 3, attached, shows the annual average number of people, resident in the City of York constituency, the City of York Unitary Authority, Yorkshire and The Humber and the United Kingdom, claiming JSA from 1997 to 2007. The number of claimants is also shown as a percentage of the resident working age population.</p>

	<p pid="a.834W.3/6" class="indent">The data for analysing migrant workers comes from the labour force survey.

This question has been answered on this basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.841W.2/2" class="indentitalic"> Letter from Steve Bundred<i> ,</i> dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-04">4 February 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/3" class="indent">Your parliamentary question on whether the district auditor has oversight over the <i> (a)</i> London Development Agency and <i> (b)</i> Greater London Authority has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/4" class="indent">I think it would be helpful at the outset to clarify the role and responsibilities of the Audit Commission and the appointed auditor, before turning to the work being undertaken by the District Auditor for the Greater London Authority (GLA) and London Development Agency (LDA).</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/5" class="indentitalic"> The role of the Audit Commission</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/6" class="indent">The Audit Commission (the Commission) is an independent body with statutory responsibilities to regulate the audit of local government and NHS bodies in England. The Commission's statutory responsibilities in relation to audit are set out in the Audit Commission Act 1998 (the Act). They are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/7" class="indent">appoint auditors to local government and NHS bodies;</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/8" class="indent">prescribe how auditors should carry out their functions through a statutory Code of Audit Practice, which is approved by Parliament at five-yearly intervals;</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/9" class="indent">set scales of fees for audit work; and</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/10" class="indent">make arrangements for certifying grant claims and returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/11" class="indent">The Commission appoints professionally qualified auditors from its own staff (known as District Auditors) and private firms of auditors. Once appointed, auditors carry out their statutory and other responsibilities, and are required by the Code of Audit Practice to exercise their professional judgement, independently of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/12" class="indent">The separation between the Commission and its appointed auditors is reflected in statute and case law. The Act confers the duties and powers of the appointed auditor on appointed auditors, who exercise their duties and powers in their own right.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/13" class="indent">The statutory independence of auditors means that the Commission cannot:</p>

	<p pid="a.841W.2/17" class="indent">The Commission appoints the auditors to the GLA and its associated bodies including the IDA. The District Auditor for both the GLA and the IDA is Mike Haworth-Maden.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/18" class="indent">It is not therefore a matter for the Commission itself to investigate the recent claims of impropriety in the allocation of grants by the IDA and the GLA. Those claims are properly matters for the consideration of the independent District Auditor in the exercise of his functions (see below).</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/19" class="indentitalic"> The role of the appointed auditor</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/20" class="indent">The Audit Commission Act 1998 sets out the specific statutory duties of appointed auditors.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/21" class="indent">They are:</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/22" class="indent">to comply with the Code of Audit Practice]</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/23" class="indent">to give an opinion on the accounts of the audited body;</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/24" class="indent">to satisfy themselves that the accounts comply with statutory requirements and have been compiled in accordance with proper practices;</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/25" class="indent">to satisfy themselves that the audited body has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources; and</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/26" class="indent">to certify completion of the audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/27" class="indent">In addition, auditors of local government bodies (which include the GLA and IDA) have other statutory duties and powers:</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/28" class="indent">to consider issuing a public interest report about any matter that comes to their attention during the audit, which they judge should be considered by the audited body or brought to public attention;</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/29" class="indent">to decide whether the audited body should consider formally, and respond to in public, matters raised in an audit report;</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/30" class="indent">to give electors the opportunity to raise questions about the accounts, and consider and decide on objections received from electors about the accounts; and</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/31" class="indent">where unlawful expenditure has been or is about to be incurred by an audited body, to issue an advisory notice, to apply to the courts for a declaration that an item of account is unlawful or apply for judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/32" class="indent">The Code of Audit Practice requires that where, in the course of an audit, representations are made to the auditor or information is provided that is relevant to the audit, or matters relevant to the audit otherwise come to their attention, auditors should consider whether the matter needs investigation and action.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/33" class="indentitalic"> Work carried out by the District Auditor</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/34" class="indent">The District Auditor is currently considering a number of allegations concerning the allocation of grants that have recently been reported in the media. I understand that matters have also been referred to him by three MPs and the London Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/35" class="indent">The District Auditor is considering these matters in the context of his statutory responsibilities. His initial focus has been the conduct and findings of the GLA's and LDA's internal reviews to date. In this context, he has received the reports on the reviews recently undertaken by the Statutory Finance Officers:</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/36" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> for the GLA, the report of the Executive Director of Finance and Performance dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-09">9 January 2008</phrase> (which is available on the GLA's website); and</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/37" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> for the LDA, the report of the Group Director, Risk and Resources dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-11">11 January 2008</phrase> (which is available on the LDA's website).</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/38" class="indent">His work to assess the conduct and findings of those reviews, and other related internal activity undertaken to date by the GLA and LDA, is currently in progress. As part of this, he has recently met officers from the Metropolitan Police with regard to the ongoing police investigations into a number of matters that the LDA's Statutory Finance Officer has referred to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/39" class="indent">On the basis of his assessment of the internal reviews carried out by the GLA and the LDA, he will assess the further work required on his part, including whether further information, interviews or other investigation activity (of the GLA and LDA itself, or of third parties) is required with regard to the specific projects referred to him. This will also inform his wider assessment of the GLA and LDA in the context of his statutory responsibilities, including the arrangements for making grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/40" class="indent">In following the approach set out, he will need to have regard to other ongoing work, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/41" class="indent">the Metropolitan Police's ongoing investigations;</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/42" class="indent">the further work that the LDA is carrying out on a number of specific projects, but also with regard to its planned wider risk-based project review; and</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/43" class="indent">London Assembly scrutiny activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/44" class="indent">It is too early to assess the timescale for completion of this exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/45" class="indent">I hope you find the above helpful. Please contact me, or Mr Haworth-Maden, should you wish to discuss any of the matters raised .</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.2/46" class="indent">A copy of this letter will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.857W.2/1">The Department is committed to reducing its direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions by reducing energy consumption and business travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.857W.2/2">We work closely with our Estates Partners, Land Securities Trillium to reduce energy consumption, and as a consequence the carbon dioxide emissions resulting from our operations across our estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.857W.2/3">There are a number of initiatives currently under way which have already shown average reductions of 8.5 per cent. in electricity consumption and 23 per cent. in fossil fuel consumption over the past two years. This equates to an overall reduction of 16.9 per cent. in our indirect carbon dioxide emissions in the same period. So far we have concentrated on our larger sites, which represent two-thirds of our overall energy consumption. This programme is ongoing, will be expanded to our smaller sites,, and continues to make a significant impact on emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.857W.2/4">The programme includes installing new energy saving technologies (e.g. voltage optimisation devices and passive infrared controls), more energy efficient equipment (e.g. IT), and Automated Meter Reading (AMR) to provide better quality management information leading to quicker resolution of issues and improved staff involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.857W.2/5">We have also identified sites for possible micro-generation schemes (e.g. wind turbines, solar-thermal and bio-mass boilers). We will continue to explore the practicalities of installing these technologies at appropriate locations across our estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.857W.2/6">A review of business travel was undertaken in 2007 and a number of recommendations are being implemented. These include reducing our average vehicle emissions below the current Government target and setting targets to reduce business mileage travelled by car.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.2/2">We have considered whether universal screening of patients for <i> Clostridium difficile</i> (<i> C. difficile</i>) is the best way forward for the national health service. However, the current clinical evidence does not suggest that universal screening would be clinically effective as universal screening would not identify the majority of patients who might be carrying <i> C. difficile</i> bacteria, and patients without symptoms are not considered to present an increased risk of infecting others. This is why we are targeting high risk patients for <i> C</i><i> . </i><i> difficile</i> screening. All over 65s in hospital with diarrhoea already should be screened for <i> C</i><i> .</i><i> difficile</i> as set out in current guidance. This will ensure the infection is identified quickly and appropriate measures are taken to treat the patient and minimise infection of other patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.875W.3/1">The Department has taken steps, over a number of years, to encourage staff not to print off e-mails, and other documents, unnecessarily. In particular, the following actions have been taken:</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.3/2" class="indent">at staff sustainable development awareness events one of the major messages has been that staff should not print unless strictly necessary;</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.3/3" class="indent">over the past 12 months the Department has introduced a new managed print service where existing printers, photocopiers and fax machines have been replaced by multi-function devices. This has reduced the number of print devices by three-quarters. The ratio of staff to printers has reduced from 3:1 to an average of 10:1. The fact that most staff must now walk further to collect their printing is seen as a disincentive. Where printing is necessary the default on the new printers is duplex which reduces the amount of paper used. As computers are renewed we also have a policy to supply these with larger screens, to better enable staff to read their documents on screen;</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.3/4" class="indent">all staff in Information Services Directorate have an environmental strapline on their e-mails.

This greatly exceeds the Government target to reduce overall waste arisings by 5 per cent. by 2010. While there are a number of factors that have influenced this figure, it does indicate that printing of ephemeral documents (which are destined for the waste bin) has reduced.</p>

	<p pid="a.876W.0/3">It is not currently possible to screen for type 1 diabetes in children. The Department therefore has no plans to implement a screening programme for type 1 diabetes in children. The onset of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes develops quickly, and they usually require immediate medical attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.0/4">The Prime Minister's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January 2008</phrase> outlined plans to develop a programme of vascular risk assessment, which includes diabetes. Proposals for this programme will be brought forward later in the year, but this will be a programme for adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.0/5">The Department does not collect data about the number of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. However, the current estimate of prevalence in the United Kingdom is one per 700-1,000 children, yielding a total of population of people with type 1 diabetes aged 25 years in the UK of approximately 25,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.0/6">In April 2007, the Department of Health published &quot;Making Every Young Person with Diabetes Matter&quot;, the report of the Children and Young People with Diabetes Working Group, which looked at ways to improve diabetes services for children and young people. This report includes guidance on the management and support of type 1 diabetes in children and young people.

	<p pid="a.877W.3/1">Dental fluorosis is characterised by a flecking, or more rarely a mottling, of teeth, often only visible when teeth are dried. If severe, it may give some people concern about the appearance of their teeth. It does not, however, affect the extra resistance to dental decay provided by exposure to fluoride. It is often caused by very young children swallowing fluoride toothpaste unsupervised. When parents or dentists make inquiries, they are referred to advice contained in &quot;Delivering Better Oral Health: An evidence based toolkit for prevention&quot;, which was issued to all national health service general dental practices in November 2007. The guide, advises that</p>

We are therefore supporting a research project on the use of intra-oral cameras to assess the extent of fluorosis. If, as we expect, the research shows that the measurement of dental fluorosis can be standardised, we will undertake a further study of its prevalence and aesthetic impact.</p>

The deadline for extension of the 31-day standard for radiotherapy is December 2010. This is in recognition of the length of time needed to increase radiotherapy capacity, for example building bunkers and purchasing and installing machinery. At present, we have monitoring systems only to capture achievement against the 31-day standard for first treatments, as this is the current standard. We do not currently have data for second and subsequent treatments but we are developing systems which will allow the capture of information on achievement of the standard for radiotherapy by area before the achievement deadline.</p>

However, in the vast majority of cases this is as a result of bureau mergers and not closures. Citizens Advice&mdash;the national charity&mdash;works in partnership with its members and funders to merge legal entities where there is a strong business case to do so. The number of outlets from which CAB advice is available continues to grow and currently stands at approximately 3,300. Permanent closure of Citizens Advice Bureaux is extremely rare and in the past decade the only areas where services have been terminated, either by the funder or by Citizens Advice, are : London borough of Ealing, London borough of Islington, Lytham St. Annes, Oadby and Wigston, and Old Swan.</p>

Of the countries which did not agree an EPA, 32 are classified as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) which makes them eligible for the Everything But Arms scheme (EBA) which provides for duty free access into the EU on all products except for arms. 10 other countries can utilise the Generalised System of Preferences scheme (GSP) which is available to all developing countries and provides for a reduction in the standard rate of duty for products entering the EU. These schemes were already in existence and so these countries have been able to utilise them since the beginning of this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.897W.5/1">Action to reduce energy costs cuts across several Departments. The Government have a package of measures in place to support vulnerable households to reduce energy costs. We have announced that spend on energy efficiency measures for those on low incomes for the period 2008 to 2011 will be in excess of &pound;2.3 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.5/2">In addition to this, my Department has promoted measures to reduce energy costs for those not connected to the mains gas network. In partnership with the regional development agencies in north-east England and Yorkshire and Humberside, we have set up two demonstration programmes to provide mains gas and renewable technologies to deprived communities outside the mains gas network. We have also worked with Ofgem to incentivise the large gas distribution networks to provide mains gas connections to deprived communities from April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.5/3">In the Energy White Paper we made it clear that we expected energy suppliers to have a proportionate programme of assistance in place for vulnerable customers. Energy companies have responded and have recently increased the level of support they provide to vulnerable customers from &pound;40 million to &pound;56 million this winter.</p>

	<p pid="a.900W.8/1">The Government's policy on waste and decommissioning for new nuclear power stations is designed to ensure that operators make adequate arrangements to cover the full costs of decommissioning and their full share of waste management and disposal costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.8/2">In the past the Government have found themselves called upon to cover the costs of decommissioning and waste management and disposal where nuclear power station operators have been unable to do so. The mechanism set out by the Government in the Energy Bill aim to mitigate in so far as possible against this risk for any new power stations that are built.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.8/3">Paragraph 3.58 of the White Paper makes clear that the financing arrangements put in place by a nuclear operator must demonstrate that the risk of Government being called upon in this way is minimised. The operator must do this by ensuring that in addition to the accruing fund, additional financial safeguard mechanisms are in place to deal with a range of challenging scenarios. However, paragraph 3.58 recognises that in extreme circumstances the Government may be called upon to meet the costs of ensuring the protection of the public and the environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.901W.2/2">The Office of Fair Trading and Trading Standards Services will have a duty to enforce the regulations. The Government believe that these enforcement arrangements suffice to adequately enforce the CPRs, including in relation to misleading copycat packaging design. OFT and trading standards services will have to act in a manner consistent with their duty to enforce the regulations. Indeed the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property notes that in this context the Local Authority Coordinators of Regulatory Services have said that once the UCPD is in place they will act on behalf of consumers by pursuing businesses who act improperly.</p>

	<p pid="a.904W.0/2">The Call for Evidence will help inform what next steps may be needed and further improve understanding of the costs and barriers to taking action. Once the replies are logged, we will consult over the summer on policies to increase the use of renewable energy in the UK, including heat. The UK Renewable Energy Strategy will be published in spring 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.904W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister stated on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November 2007</phrase> that in order to remove the barriers to the deployment of onshore and offshore wind farms, he has asked my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Transport and myself to step up efforts in cooperation with industry and the regulators to identify and test technical solutions to the potential difficulties that wind farms pose to air traffic and defence radar. The Department is facilitating the resolution of these concerns. We have established groups to improve the understanding of the issues and to initiate programmes of work to identify, develop and implement mitigation solutions to reduce the impacts of wind turbines on radar. It is our aim to establish a range of mitigation solutions that can be considered and, where appropriate, utilised to allow the removal of objections to wind applications in respect to their potential impacts on radar. We are working closely with the various aviation stakeholders and the wind sector to drive these initiatives forward.</p>

Local authorities plans show that we expect 12 new schools to be open by December 2008, 35 more in 2008-09, 115 more in 2009-10, 165 more in 2010-11, and then around 200 a year and rising thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="a.908W.0/1">An understanding of special educational needs is an integral part of all initial teacher training. In order to be awarded qualified teacher status, trainees must demonstrate that they:</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.0/2" class="indent">know how to make effective personalised provision for pupils they teach, including those with SEN, and know how to differentiate their teaching accordingly;</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.0/3" class="indent">have knowledge of current legislation and guidance on the safeguarding and promotion of the well-being of children and young people, including SEN and disability legislation and the SEN code of practice;</p>

	<p pid="a.908W.0/5" class="indent">have the ability to communicate effectively with children, young people, colleagues, parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.0/6">As part of a wider programme to strengthen understanding of SEN and disability issues within initial teaching training, we have worked closely with the Training and Development Agency for Schools, to develop and pilot a series of specialist SEN and disability units for primary undergraduate courses, and for newly qualified teachers during their induction. These units have been well received by both staff and students and it is planned to organise a national roll-out to all training providers this year. Work is also under way to develop similar materials for secondary undergraduate courses and the postgraduate certificate of education (PGCE).</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.0/7">Ofsted are also undertaking a thematic review of the journey taken by trainee teachers, in terms of acquiring SEN and disability knowledge and skills during their initial training and induction. The results of this review are expected to be published in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.0/8">Once qualified, all teachers are expected to discuss their own development needs in performance management reviews, and to address development priorities. This could include strengthening knowledge and understanding of SEN. Where schools have identified a need to strengthen knowledge and understanding of SEN, as a school improvement priority, this should be addressed through their school improvement and development plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.0/9">All schools receive a school development grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. A wide variety of courses are available covering SEN, ranging from awareness-raising through to in-depth studies leading to specific qualifications. It is, however, a matter for individual teachers and their schools to determine their own particular training and development needs. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.0/10">In October 2007, we launched our Inclusion Development Programme (IDP), which is designed to provide a programme of confidence-raising professional development for serving teachers and other staff. The opening round of the IDP has focused on training and resources in relation to children's speech, language and communication difficulties, including dyslexia. In later rounds, the IDP will focus on autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), behavioural, emotional and social difficulties (BESD) and moderate learning difficulties (MLD).</p>

	<p pid="a.911W.2/1">Building Schools for the Future aims to renew all secondary schools in England where there is need, in 15 waves of investment which started in 2005-06, including those in Kent. The first Kent project has been prioritised in wave three, and approximately &pound;240 million has already been allocated to it. This funding will be used to transform 10 schools, improving the learning environments for thousands of young people. Kent is also prioritised in wave four, but the project is not yet sufficiently progressed for funding to be allocated. It will have further projects in later waves, prioritised on social and educational need.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.2/2">For these waves and for subsequent ones, Kent will need to demonstrate how the investment will be deployed to meet its education vision and its strategy for the estate. The Strategy for Change process ensures that all local authorities can deliver transformational projects which create 21st century learning environments, with integrated ICT solutions and deliver a strategic approach to pupil place planning across the whole estate. The full BSF Strategy for Change guidance can be found at:</p>

As independent bodies, higher education institutions are free to set their own entry requirements for individual courses. However, a large number of institutions are now providing entry profiles for their courses, to enable potential applicants to clarify the entry criteria for any courses that they may be interested in. It is important that HE institutions publicise the availability of entry profiles and that careers advisers take them into account when advising young people on their options choices at age 13-14.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.2/1">The Department does not currently report figures for functional literacy at age 16. We are piloting functional English qualifications at entry level, level 1 and level 2 to be available from 2010 which will provide young people and adults with the essential knowledge, skills and understanding that will enable them to operate confidently, effectively and independently in life and at work. The Government's current public service agreement target is for 60 per cent. of 16-year-olds to achieve 5 good GCSE grades (A*- C) or equivalent by 2008. Figures for 2007 published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-09">9 January</phrase> show that this target has been met. But we are raising the bar and in future the target for the end of Key Stage 4 will be measured against the proportion of pupils achieving 5 grades A*-C or equivalent, including GCSE English and mathematics. The 2007 figure for England achieving this standard was 46.7 per cent. compared with 37.0 per cent. in 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.919W.2/2">Our Teacher Supply Model takes account of a range of factors that determine how many teacher training places we need to set for future years. One of the most important is the number of pupils needing to be taught and our projections of these use data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This shows an increase in births and a need for more teachers beyond 2009/10, so we have increased the targets given to the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) for teacher training places in the infant/primary phase. We will be revalidating these assumptions in 2009, based on the latest ONS data available, and will make any adjustments necessary. Another modelling exercise to forecast demand from 2011/12 to 2013/14 will begin in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.919W.2/3">The TDA has already allocated 1,760 places to training providers offering courses to those wishing to teach foundation stage and key stage 1 in each of the three years; an increase from 1,610 in 2007/08. It will allocate more places later to provide for the growth in 2009/10 and 2010/11 when there is better indication of regional and key stage demand.</p>

There is no direct and simple way of establishing which research studies have gathered information on family circumstances and it would involve a disproportionate effort to do so, but as examples of the sort of information gathered, the London Challenge Parents questionnaire asked a sample of parents of 9 to 16-year-olds in London schools about home ownership, income, employment and number of people in the family, and the Youth Cohort study has regularly asked a national sample of 16 to 21-year-olds about their health, whether they looked after any other family members and whether they had any housing or family problems. The published reports of these and other individual studies are available through the Department's Research and Statistics Gateway on its website.</p>

	<p pid="a.920W.2/1">I agree that it is vital to ensure the safety and well-being of those children and young people who run away from home or care, and to tackle the underlying causes that lead to running away.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.2/2">A report from the social exclusion unit (SEU) in 2002 identified the problems for young runaways and set out how the Government should respond, highlighting the importance of early intervention and prevention, and of integrating children's services. These issues were addressed in the Every Child Matters Green Paper and the subsequent Change for Children programme. Last year, we commissioned the Children's Society to assess how far these changes had in fact improved services for young runaways, and to identify what more needed to be done. We received their report &quot;Stepping Up&quot; in the autumn and, in response, we have established a cross-departmental working group on young runaways, to co-ordinate the Government's work on young runaways.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.2/3">The working group will develop an action plan on young runaways, to be published in June 2008, which will set out the necessary actions to improve services for young runaways, building on the principles set out in the &quot;Stepping Up&quot; report recommendations, and the recommendations made following the parliamentary panel hearings on young runaways in October 2007. The action plan will cover emergency accommodation provision, recognising the need for young runaways to have safe places or 'breathing spaces' to go to in a crisis, and the Missing from Home and Care guidance, to support local areas in delivering effective services for young runaways.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.2/4">We do not currently collect data centrally on young runaways and the services they receive. A new indicator on young people who run away from home or care has been included in the National Indicator Set, to be measured from 2009. The working group will consider what data collections will best support this indicator, and their conclusions will be represented in the action plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.923W.8/1">The Children's Plan, published in December 2007, includes an overview of the key activities we are undertaking to raise standards in secondary schools. Some key facts are:</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.8/2" class="indent">Record numbers of 16-year-olds are now achieving five good GCSEs. In total over 470,000 more young people have gained at least five good GCSEs over the period 1997-2007. Total funding per pupil has increased by 87 per cent. in real terms since 1997, and the full-time equivalent (FTE) number of teachers in local authority maintained secondary schools has increased by 27,400 and 69,500 for FTE teaching assistants and other support staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.8/3" class="indent">2007 provisional results show there has been a 17 percentage point increase in the number of 14-year-old pupils achieving level 5 or above in English, a 16 percentage point increase in mathematics and a 13 percentage point increase in science at key stage 3 since 1997. At key stage 4, 60.8 per cent. of pupils aged 15 achieved five or more good GCSEs&mdash;a 15.7 percentage point increase since 1997&mdash;which means the 2008 60 per cent. target for the percentage achieving 5+ A*-C grades has been achieved a year early.</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.8/4" class="indent">Through the Building Schools for the Future and Academies programmes we are investing &pound;9.3 billion over the three years 2007-2008 to 2010-2011 to rebuild or refurbish every secondary school in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.8/5" class="indent">More than 2,800 secondary schools&mdash;88 per cent. of the total&mdash;have specialist school status and we are on track to achieve the target of every eligible school achieving specialist status by next year. More than 300 schools have either become Trusts or are working towards Trust status enabling them to work with external partners to create a distinctive ethos and direction for their school.</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.8/6" class="indent">There are now 83 academies open in 49 local authorities. The Government are firmly committed to establishing 400 academies and regard the scaling up of the programme as a national imperative, supported by the growing body of evidence&mdash;improved GCSE results and key stage 3 results; and independent reports by the National Audit Office, PricewaterhouseCooper and Ofsted that academies are proving to be highly effective. A further 50 academies are projected to open in each of the following three years, (2008 to 2010), thereby exceeding the target of 200 academies by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.8/7" class="indent">There is more work still to do. In recent years, the number of children eligible for free school meals achieving five good GCSEs has improved faster than the national average, but we need to do more to tackle some of the gaps between economically disadvantaged pupils and their peers, and between boys and girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.8/8" class="indent">The Secondary National Strategy for School Improvement is at the heart of our work to transform secondary education and spreads effective teaching and learning to all schools through training and materials, a comprehensive development programme for teachers and support from local consultants who are experts in their field. This year we will be renewing the secondary frameworks for teaching to provide teachers with resources to capitalise on the opportunity presented by the new secondary curriculum to accelerate progress for all pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.8/9" class="indent">To ensure that all pupils are able to fulfil their potential, we continue to seek to improve attendance and behaviour in schools. Our national programme will strengthen schools' capacity, to increase significantly the two-thirds of secondary schools judged good or outstanding by Ofsted in standards of behaviour. The Children's Plan set for all local authorities the goal of 5 per cent. or fewer 'persistent absentees' amongst their secondary pupils by 2011, reducing the level by a third compared to 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.924W.2/1">Since 2004, the Department for Children, Schools and Families has collected data on pupils' type of special educational need (SEN) as part of the School Census. There are a range of factors which may affect the data recorded, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.2/2" class="indent">local interpretation of definitions;</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.2/3" class="indent">classification of children with multiple needs;</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.2/4" class="indent">differences in diagnoses between education and health professionals; and</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.2/5" class="indent">availability of school-based provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.2/6">To minimise the impact of these factors, revised guidance was available to schools from October 2005. The data collected on pupils' type of need is suitably reliable and robust to analyse at local authority level from January 2006 onwards. The available figures covering 2006 and 2007 have been placed in the Library. Information on the primary type of need is only collected for pupils with statements of special educational needs or at &quot;School Action Plus&quot;. It is not collected for pupils at &quot;School Action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.2/7">The information has been taken from the Statistical First Release &quot;Special Educational Needs in England&quot; which is published annually. The latest figures, for 2007, can be accessed at:</p>

	<p pid="a.926W.2/2">None so far, but the Training and Development Agency for Schools and Children's Workforce Development Council will soon be discussing this with training providers of initial teaching and early years professional status to explore the feasibility of such training being offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.926W.2/3">None. The Secretary of State's requirements for initial teacher training (which includes PGCE as well as BA and BEd courses) only covers the ages three to 19. However, beyond initial teacher training, degree courses to provide training on working with children in the 0-3 age-range are available via the Early Years Sector Endorsed Foundation Degree and the Early Years Study Degree. Training towards the award of Early Years Professional Status is also available for graduates who wish to develop their knowledge and experience of working with 0-3 year olds.</p>

	<p pid="a.930W.5/14">The changes in the number of Higher Education Enrolments at Further Education Colleges will have been affected by the transfer of institutions from the Further Education sector to the Higher Education sector. In addition, changes in the reporting methods used to record franchising arrangements between Higher Education Institutions and Further Education Colleges may have contributed to the changes in numbers. Franchising is a process where students take a course delivered by an institution on behalf of another institution and this often occurs between Higher Education Institutions and Further Education Colleges.</p>

A detailed inspection of the records shows that during the period in question meetings took place with a variety of organisations representing the music and film industries. Ministers and/or senior officials met with organisations such as British Music Rights, BPI, EMI, the Musicians' Union, the British Copyright Council, the British Screen Advisory Council, the UK Film Council, Time Warner, and the Alliance against IP Theft. These meetings generally took place in either Government premises or at the offices of the organisation concerned, and commonly lasted for an hour or so. The extent of any records kept, including records of who attended, depends on the subject matter&mdash;in many instances these meetings were introductory meetings which covered a large number of topics.

	<p pid="a.932W.3/3">Although copyright law that underpins these royalties is shaped largely by international and European law, Ministers and officials are aware of the need to keep the UK system under review.

The minimum household income for a full maintenance grant of &pound;2,835 a year will be extended from &pound;17,910 in 2007/08 to &pound;25,000 in 2008/09. The maximum household income for a partial maintenance grant has been raised from &pound;38,300 in 2007/08 to &pound;60,005 in 2008/09. By 2011, the number of students receiving some level of grant will increase by 100,000. As part of this change, an extra 50,000 students will receive a full grant. In total, around two thirds of eligible students will be entitled to a full or partial grant each year&mdash;compared to around a half now. The new grant arrangements will be available to all eligible 2008/09 entrants, including those who have deferred entry from academic year 2007/08. The aim of these new arrangements is to ensure that everyone with the potential to progress into higher education has the financial support to do so, no matter what their background.</p>

	<p pid="a.935W.6/1">Student loans have very different features to commercial loans. Graduates with income contingent loans (ICL) only repay once they are in work and only when their annual income reaches &pound;15,000. Interest is charged at the rate of inflation, so students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.6/2">This is achieved by linking the interest rate for student loans to the annual rate of inflation as defined by the retail prices index (RPI). The interest rate is recalculated each year at the beginning of September using the RPI figure from the previous March. This methodology ensures that over time the student loan interest rate will be equivalent to the rate of inflation but with a time lag.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.6/3">For the academic year 2007/08, the interest rate is set at the rate for RPI for the year to March 2007&mdash;4.8 per cent. Although the underlying RPI rate has fallen since March, and is now below the 2007/08 student loan interest rate, this works both ways. In other years, the time-lag will benefit borrowers, as it did in 2006/07. Over time, peaks and troughs even out, and borrowers repay no more in real terms than they borrow.</p>

	<p pid="a.936W.8/25">The Department does not publish estimates of participation in education above academic age 18. However, it is possible to produce estimates for 18 to 24-year-olds from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). Estimates for England from the LFS, relating to the first quarter of 2007, are shown in the following tables. It is important to note that the LFS will not produce estimates that directly match those from the Department's Participation SFR, and that they will be subject to sampling error and respondent error. The LFS estimates of population size by cohort also differ from the Participation SFR. LFS estimates are also provided for young people of academic age 16, 17 and 18 for comparison with the Departments estimates as tabled above.</p>

	<p pid="a.943W.2/11">The number of prisoner recalled to custody has increased over recent years. There are several reasons for this increase: nearly all prisoners on licence can now be recalled to prison executively by the Secretary of State. Prior to 1998, prisoners serving less than four years could be recalled only by the courts, a slow and bureaucratic process that was rarely used. The Probation Service has become far more effective in enforcing licence conditions. In 1997 appropriate enforcement action was taken in only a third of cases where the offender breached a sentence being served in the community. This figure was over 90 per cent. in 2007; and there is more robust supervision of high risk licensees and better information sharing between police and probation, through multi agency public protection arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.950W.3/2">Regional level estimates of households in fuel poverty are most recently available for 2003 and come from the Fuel Poverty Indicator Dataset available online at:</p>
	<p pid="a.950W.3/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.fuelpovertyindicator.org.uk/">http://www.fuelpovertyindicator.org.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.950W.3/4">The dataset does not attempt to split out vulnerable households from non-vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.950W.3/5">These show that in 2003, there were around 2,660 households (both vulnerable and non-vulnerable) in Easington local authority in fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.950W.3/6">The only estimate that exists for previous years was for 1996 and is not strictly comparable with the 2003 figure as the geographical modelling was done at a different level. The indicative figure for 1996 was around 10,000 households living in fuel poverty in Easington.</p>
