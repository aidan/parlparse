	<p pid="c.128W.6/1">The impact assessment associated with the White Paper 'Raising Expectations and Increasing Support&mdash;reforming welfare for the future' estimated that the increase in work-focused interviews and provision to support work and skills-related activity could cost up to an extra &pound;20 million a year for parents with younger children. For employment and support allowance customers we are assessing the appropriate balance between provision of the service by Jobcentre Plus and providers. Additional costs will be met from within the current agreed Department spending plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.128W.6/2">A cadre of skilled and capable personal advisers will be absolutely essential to effectively implement the Progression to Work model. Our discussion document 'Realising Potential: developing personalised conditionality and support' made clear that that it will be necessary to think through the implications for the adviser role and implement a work force development strategy for Jobcentre Plus staff. This is an issue we will discuss in detail with stakeholders. Until pathfinder locations are decided final decisions cannot be made on the number of personal advisers necessary to deliver the Progression to Work pathfinders.</p>

	<p pid="c.129W.5/1">The Government are committed to giving everyone the support they need to find employment as quickly as possible, whatever their age.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.5/2">A major factor in the employment of older people is employer behaviour. In addition to providing generic good practice guidance to employers, the UK's Age Positive initiative is working in partnership with business leaders to develop sector-based models of flexible retirement to support the increased employment and retention of older workers and the removal of fixed retirement ages.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.5/3">Our plans for the future include providing guidance to older workers on their options for working longer, encouraging employers to increase flexible work and phased retirement opportunities, a review of the Default Retirement Age in 2011&mdash;if it is found to be no longer needed it will be removed, and monitoring the impact of the economic downturn, identifying which groups are being most affected and further increasing help where it is most needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.5/4">For young people who are in danger of slipping into long-term unemployment, funding was provided in the Budget for the Young Person's Guarantee; a guaranteed offer of a job, work-focused training, or meaningful activity to all 18 to 24-year-olds who reach the 12-month stage of their claim to jobseeker's allowance. At the discretion of the Jobcentre Plus adviser, parts of this guaranteed offer could also be extended to people over 24 who face significant barriers in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.5/5">As part of the Young Person's Guarantee, the Future Jobs Fund will help create up to 100,000 new jobs. It will also help create up to 50,000 new jobs in areas of high unemployment, and is available to all people of working age claiming out of work benefits. We expect the Young Person's Guarantee to be available from January 2010 but we want to get Future Jobs Fund jobs up and running as soon as possible&mdash;with some places starting as early as October this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.5/6">In addition to this, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase>, as part of the Government's response to the economic downturn, the Department for Work and Pensions put in place extra support for newly unemployed customers of all ages, including information and advice about the latest job search techniques and coaching on how to make the most of transferable skills. Extra help for those who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months was also introduced, including opportunities to volunteer, support to become self-employed, recruitment subsidies and work-focused training.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.5/7">Since last autumn, the Department has also quadrupled the available funding for the Rapid Response Service, which provides advice and support to customers facing redundancy. It has also extended Local Employment Partnerships, the Adviser Discretion Fund and Access to Work so they are available to customers from the first day of their claim, alongside the support they receive from their Jobcentre Plus personal adviser. This help is available to customers of all ages to ensure that everyone has the best possible chance of finding work.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.5/8">The introduction of the Flexible New Deal across Phase 1 areas from October 2010 will give providers the freedom to offer personalised, tailored support to everyone who has been claiming jobseeker's allowance for 12 months, helping them overcome their individual barriers to work. Greater Manchester East and West and Greater Manchester Central districts are included in Phase 1 of the New Jobseeker's Regime and Flexible New Deal and are also pilot districts for Integrated Employment and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.129W.5/9">Across the whole of the Greater Manchester area, Jobcentre Plus also promotes a range of partner provision to enhance the confidence, skills and employability of all of our customers, including those aged 18 to 24 and 50+.</p>

This high street presence is supported by 31 modern, industry standard, contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.138W.14/7" class="indent">Jobcentres continue to provide an essential service&mdash;especially to those customers most in need of tailored help. However, the great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now also delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access we have around half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line.</p>
	<p pid="c.138W.14/8" class="indent">Wherever we have considered the closure of a public facing office we have undertaken a full consultation with local stakeholders, including MPs. When finalising our Service Delivery Plans, our District Managers take account of this consultation and may, in the light of that consultation, decide not to pursue closure. We do not retain records of offices that remain open following a consultation exercise, but, in the light of the current economic conditions and welfare reform changes planned for the next two to three years a decision was taken in November 2008 to suspend the closure of 25 Jobcentres which were being considered for closure. Three small offices in London, where closure had been previously announced, subsequently closed this year. There will be no new Jobcentre closures while the current economic conditions exist.</p>

In such cases, all export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria and a licence would not be issued if to do so was inconsistent with the criteria. In particular a licence would not be issued if there was clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression.</p>

	<p pid="c.145W.12/1">There is good evidence that participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) enrichment activities improves young people's progression in science education. A recent OECD study &quot;Science Competencies for tomorrow's world&quot; (PISA 2006) shows that students in schools that hold more extracurricular science activities tend to perform better than their counterparts in schools that run fewer activities. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and its predecessor departments have funded a number of initiatives with the specific aim of providing enrichment and enhancement activities for young people, thereby increasing numbers taking these subjects at GCSE level and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.12/2">We have undertaken several studies on the impact of those Government-funded initiatives whose aim is to increase the numbers of young people studying STEM subjects. It is not usually possible to prove a quantitative causal link between any one initiative and impact on numbers, because many factors affect the decision-making process when choosing specific courses.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.12/3" class="italic"> Recent studies include:</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.12/4" class="indent">An evaluation of SETNET (now STEMNET), published in 2007, carried out by the Tavistock Institute. STEMNET has recently commissioned a follow-up evaluation, which will be published next year.</p>

Science centres in England are principally funded by users and regional or charitable bodies, rather than by central Government. The research compares the contribution of science centres to STEM objective with that of a number of Government-funded initiatives, including STEMNET's STEM ambassadors programme, outreach work of the Royal Academy of Engineering (including the London Engineering Programme), Research Councils UK, and the British Science Association (including the CREST Star Investigator programme). This research will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.12/6" class="indent">In January 2009 DIUS published a report on &quot;the Demand for STEM skills&quot; which reviewed the evidence from employers on STEM recruitment alongside analysis of the supply of young people with STEM qualifications and their labour market outcomes. The report included recent trends of STEM qualifications at A Level, First Degree and Postgraduate levels. In addition, DIUS commissioned the Warwick Institute of Employment Research to provide some benchmark projections and associated implications of the demand and supply of STEM graduates. These studies identify the important contribution made by STEM enrichment activities in stimulating interest among young people and their increased attractiveness to employers which results.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.12/7" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-26">26 May 2009</phrase>, DIUS launched a Science and Society strategy, which tackles the five key themes identified in last year's public consultation. In so doing we will develop a more coherent approach to evaluating the impacts of science and society initiatives, including those related to STEM enrichment and enhancement, and the take-up of STEM courses by young people.</p>

	<p pid="c.146W.2/3">The administrators are shutting down the company's UK operation and have made 102 London-based staff redundant, along with a further 73 staff in Glasgow. They are keeping on another 21 staff in the short-term to help close the business down; 15 in London and six in Glasgow. Setanta's sales team is outsourced and I understand that the loss of Setanta's contract will result in around 95 redundancies at the out-sourcing company.</p>

The early take up results of the pilots suggest that veterans are willing to access the service, however the numbers making use of the service are currently being validated and are not yet available. An independent evaluation of the pilots is currently under way with a final report due in 2011. Outcomes will include the range of disorders and the level of demand to inform future service planning and subsequent roll out nationwide.</p>

	<p pid="c.154W.2/1">The Department for Transport only provides grant for cycle training that meets the National Standard, promoted as Bikeability training in England. We have made over &pound;9 million available to local authorities and school sports partnerships to deliver the national standard in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.2/2">The National Standard replaces the old cycling proficiency and been designed and developed by leading experts in the road safety and cycling fields including RoSPA, Local Authority Road Safety Officers (LARSOA) and the Cyclists Touring Club. It is based on similar principles to lessons for motorcycles, allowing cyclists to assess risks and obstacles faced on the road. It involves a higher standard of cycle training, including an on-road element and is designed to give confidence and skills to deal with today's road conditions. It can only be delivered by qualified national standard trainers.</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.2/3">The training consists of three levels:</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.2/4" class="indent">Level 1: aimed at 7-9 year olds-off road teaching of basic cycling and balance skills;</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.2/5" class="indent">Level 2: aimed at 10-11 years-on-road training building on the first level;</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.2/6" class="indent">Level 3: aimed at older children/adults-includes tackling difficult road features (e.g. roundabouts) and the safe use of cycle facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.2/7">The National Standard deals with positioning and identifying the different hazards and road conditions cyclists may face on the road including being able to recognise the dangers that can be posed by large vehicles. Positioning and filtering is particularly important when sharing road space. Filtering allows a cyclist to move inside or outside of slow or stationary traffic but the choice to filter rests with the cyclist who needs to know how to judge when to filter. These skills are primarily taught at Level 3. Not filtering up the left of large vehicles at junctions is the main proviso cyclists are taught because the drivers of large vehicles have a blind spot on their nearside when turning left and the space there if occupied by a cyclist becomes closed.</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.2/8">A number of local authorities and other organisations give advice to HGV drivers about sharing road space with cyclists.</p>

	<p pid="c.159W.6/5">Estimates of foreign registered traffic are split between motorways and all other roads, while the Highways Agency is responsible for managing both motorways and other major trunk roads in England. Estimates covering all Highways Agency routes are therefore not available, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.160W.2/1">All major road schemes submitted to the Department for Transport by local authorities or promoted by the Highways Agency are subject to a full assessment against the Government's five overarching objectives of safety, environment, economy, integration and accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.2/2">The Highways Agency also has in place a set of advice notes in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges that deal with the environmental design and management of roads. These advice notes state clearly that good environmental design is a matter of respecting the special character of each individual location where a road improvement may be sited. While this is written with the trunk road system in mind, local highway authorities are likely to find it useful for their purposes, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.2/3">In addition, the Department has commissioned research into valuing transport's impact on the natural landscape. The results of phases 1 and 2 of the study are reported on the Department's website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/economics/rdg/landscape/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/economics/rdg/landscape/</a></p>
	<p pid="c.160W.2/5">The Highways Agency has recently released a report, 'Post Opening Project Evaluation: Meta Analysis', on the evaluation of a number of Highways Agency schemes. A copy of the report can be found at the following weblink:</p>

	<p pid="c.160W.2/7">The Highways Agency is also developing an improved methodology to account for the changes to the quantity of vehicle emissions that affect air quality that can result from new road schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.2/8">Finally, the Department is collaborating with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to manage research that they have commissioned to investigate the health impacts of environmental noise.</p>

Further information is available in the &quot;Impact Assessment&quot;, published alongside the Government's response to the consultation on the principle of Crown court means testing.</p>
	<p pid="c.172W.5/2">Defendants in the magistrates court need to pass both the Interests of Justice test and the means test to qualify for legal aid. Recent estimates suggest that around half of the population of England and Wales would be financially eligible to receive legal aid in the magistrates courts if they were charged with an offence that satisfied the Interests of Justice test. The majority of defendants who are not legally-aided in the magistrates courts are ineligible because their cases do not meet the Interests of Justice criteria.</p>

	<p pid="c.173W.11/1">The number of persons proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts for sexual offences against children, 2004 to 2007 is shown in the table. As there is no specific offence of &quot;child abuse,&quot; statistics are only provided where the age of the victim can be identified as a child from the description of the offence. The term &quot;child abuse&quot; describes harm caused to a child arising from emotional, physical, sexual abuse or neglect caused by a parent, guardian, carer, or stranger. A number of other offences such as offences against the person including physical assault may frequently be used by the police to charge offenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.11/2">The Sexual Offences Act 2003 significantly modernised and strengthened the laws on sexual offences in England and Wales to provide extra protection to children from sexual exploitation. This makes direct comparisons with previous legislation very difficult. Many new offences created by the Act will not have a direct equivalent under the old legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.11/3">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="c.180W.0/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) holds data on the number of offenders convicted of serious further offences for the years 2006-07 and 2007-08, recorded in accordance with the requirements of probation circulars 8/2006 and 41/2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.0/2">The following table contains a break-down, by type of supervision, of those offenders convicted of serious further offences, who were included in the Offender Management Caseload Statistics (OMCS) 2007 for 2006-07 and 2007-08. NOMS does not hold this information for 2004-05 and 2005-06. I will send the hon. Gentleman the breakdown by supervision type in respect of the 2008-09 figures (and updated figures for 2007-08) after OMCS 2008 has been published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-31">31 July 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.0/3">It should be noted that the figures are based on the year in which NOMS was notified that the offender was charged with the serious further offence, not the year in which the offender were subsequently convicted. The table includes the probation caseload figures for 2007 and 2008, for reference.</p>

	<p pid="c.187W.9/2"><i> </i>The UK is committed to the long-term goal of a world without nuclear weapons and is actively working towards creating the conditions to make that goal a reality. We believe that the principal means to achieve this is through the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), resulting in a reinforced sense of shared responsibility for both nuclear and non-nuclear weapons states.</p>
	<p pid="c.187W.9/3">At the moment we believe it would be premature to press for a Nuclear Weapons Convention, which be unlikely to make any headway and would distract attention from efforts to bolster the NPT. We do nonetheless believe there may be a role for a Nuclear Weapons Convention in the future when the time comes to establish a final ban.</p>

For example, an additional 10 affordable homes were acquired in Tamworth in 2005-06; these are not included in the table. The social rent figures differ from the number of affordable homes provided, because the affordable housing figures also include intermediate rent and low cost home ownership, as well as social rent.</p>

	<p pid="c.199W.3/3">This study, by Entec, will comprise a large scale survey of public bodies this summer, follow-up interviews with a smaller sample of bodies and views from other stakeholders.

	<p pid="c.199W.3/4">A publication called &quot;Making the Best of Byways&quot;, published by DEFRA in 2005, provides advice on managing the different sorts of traffic on byways. In addition, DEFRA published guidance entitled &quot;Regulating the Use of Motor Vehicles on Rights of Way and Off Road&quot;, which was sent to all local highway authorities. We believe this is the first step in providing information to local authorities, the police and Community Safety Partnerships on getting the most out of existing legislation, and to encourage the formation of local partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="c.212W.6/1">Until 2008-09 the pooled treatment budget (PTB) was allocated against a basket of indicators of social and economic deprivation known to reflect drug use as the best available proxy of treatment need. As a result of differences in performance between drug partnerships in getting people into treatment this funding formula was resulting in unjustifiable variations in the amount of central subvention for each person's treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/2">2009-10 is the second year of a process which seeks to produce a fairer allocation system which more accurately matches need, activity and resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/3">The new process is based on three elements:</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/4" class="indent">25 per cent. of the allocation is based on the indicators underpinning the previous formula to reflect the differential cost of responding to different levels of complex need such as homelessness, mental heath, family breakdown and unemployment;</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/5" class="indent">75 per cent. is based on activity in the treatment system with areas being allocated a set amount per person treated effectively; and</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/6" class="indent">The final element is an area cost adjustment figure to reflect the varying costs of delivering services in different part of the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/7">To promote an orderly alteration to service planning, the change is being introduced over three years with the annual maximum reduction set at 5 per cent. in 2008-09, 15 per cent. in 2009-10 and 30 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/8">Funding allocated to Milton Keynes in each of the last five years is tabled as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.212W.6/11"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.212W.6/12"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>1,066,714</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/19">For the next two years, the indicative amount for 2010-11 is &pound;925,000 (announced January 2008). This, however, was based on performance at the time predicted to grow at 1 per cent. a year. Growth in Milton Keynes is currently anticipated to be in excess of this so the final allocation may increase. The exact allocation will not be known until January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/20">Based on data collected by the university of Glasgow covering the period 2004-05 to 2006-07, the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse have advised Milton Keynes that an estimated 930 problematic drug users (PDUs) should be used for planning purposes. However, there is insufficient data on the number of PDUs to determine how the PDU population has changed over time.</p>
	<p pid="c.212W.6/21">The number of PDUs in treatment in Milton Keynes for each of the last fives years is tabled as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.212W.6/24"> <td></td> <td><i> Number</i></td> </tr>

It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (e.g. time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedure.<br/> <i> Secondary procedure</i><br/> As well as the main operative procedure, there are up to 23 (11 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and three prior to 2002-03) secondary operative procedure fields in HES that show secondary or additional procedures performed on the patient during the episode of care. <sup>(2)</sup><i> Number of episodes with 'Bariatric Surgery' as a main or secondary procedure</i><br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) operative procedure fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record.

These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data.

	<p pid="c.233W.2/10">This year the Department is funding the newly established Council for Learning Outside the Classroom &pound;740,000 to take forward the aims of the Manifesto. Funding beyond this financial year has not yet been agreed.</p>
	<p pid="c.233W.2/11">There are currently 1,698 signatories to the Manifesto, including 199 schools. We also know from the huge interest and enthusiasm from schools for last year's LOtC Awards that schools and teachers recognise the importance of different activities outside of the classroom in supporting learning and development for their young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.233W.2/12">The Department does not collect data on how many children experience learning outside the classroom. However, we know that most schools do provide learning outside the classroom and recognise its importance. The 2006 NFER survey confirmed that schools were doing the same, or more, learning outside the classroom than before and they expect to do the same or more in future. Changes to the secondary curriculum are designed to encourage 'curriculum opportunities' outside the classroom and the proposed new primary curriculum, to be introduced from 2011, which is currently subject to consultation, will also reflect the need for teachers to engage pupils with these experiences.</p>

			<tr pid="c.236W.3/29"> <td colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br/> 2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the R01 form collected by the ODPM to the section 52 form from the DFES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown as parts B and C. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from section 52 outturn table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from section 52 outturn table 3 for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and from the R01 form previously.<br/> 3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &pound;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &pound;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br/> 4. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DFES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> 5. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place during the mid to late 1990s and those LAs that did not exist either pre or post LGR are shaded out for those years.<br/> 6. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br/>  7. The 1999-2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Consequently LAs where there entire pupil provision were educated in GM schools will show a unit cost of zero prior to 1999-2000.<br/>  8. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br/> 9. School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br/> 10. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10. Cash terms figures as reported by local authorities as at 26 June.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.242W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families has regular discussions with representatives of teachers' professional bodies and industry to discuss teachers' continuing professional development (CPD). He has not given recent consideration to teachers participating in CPD during school holidays.</p>
	<p pid="c.242W.2/2">Under the provisions of the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD), teachers are contracted to work under the direction of a head teacher for 1,265 hours over 195 days. They are required to teach and perform other duties for 190 of those days and are to be available for deployment at the head's discretion for the other five days to perform duties other than teaching. These five days are commonly known as school closure days and schools can and do use them for a variety of CPD/school planning activities. The timing and organisation of these days is entirely for individual local authorities, governing bodies, and head teachers to determine, but we look to them to be sensitive to local circumstances in deciding which days to choose.</p>
	<p pid="c.242W.2/3">No teacher may be required to work on any Saturday, Sunday or public holiday unless his or her contract of employment expressly provides for this.</p>
	<p pid="c.242W.2/4">In relation to teachers participating in CPD during school holidays, there is nothing to prohibit teachers undertaking such activity during those periods. However, head teachers, in carrying out their duties in deploying and managing staff, must have regard to the desirability of teachers being able to achieve a satisfactory balance between the time required to discharge their professional duties and the time required to pursue their personal interests outside work.</p>
