	<p pid="c.745W.7/1">The Government of Afghanistan (GoA) and the UN monitor the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) across Afghanistan. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) most recent assessment, conducted in early 2007, the estimated figure for long-standing IDPs in Afghanistan is some 130,000. Around 85 per cent. of these are located in four settlements in the south of the country.</p>

The UK Government responded to this by providing food aid and essential items like soap and blankets for 3,000 internally displaced families. This aid was distributed by the GoA.</p>

	<p pid="c.746W.5/1">Indoor air pollution is a considerable health hazard for approximately 2.4 billion people around the world relying on poorly designed wood, dung and coal burning stoves for their cooking and heating. DFID has funded research into the problem, with a current &pound;253,000 programme due to end in July 2007. This is being carried out by Practical Action, a UK based non-governmental organisation active in many developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.5/2">While raising awareness of the health risks may change behaviour to reduce exposure to smoke, the best solution is to improve access to reliable, affordable and clean energy supplies.

	<p pid="c.747W.0/1">Water shortages exist in many countries, and there is a risk of water pollution from human activities. Technologies for sanitation and wastewater management for specific situations are recommended on the basis of individual merits, and with the agreement of partners, taking account of local technical, financial, economic, social, and other considerations.</p>
	<p pid="c.747W.0/2">The use of Gravel Bed Hydroponic (GBH) reed beds, conventional reed beds or constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment has been the subject of various DFID funded research projects over the last 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.747W.0/3">For instance, from 1991 to 1995, DFID funded research into the use of reed beds to treat domestic and industrial wastewater in Egypt. Teams of scientists and engineers in the UK (University of Portsmouth) and Egypt (Suez Canal University) built, monitored and evaluated the operational performance of constructed wetlands as an appropriate technology for semi-arid, developing countries. The research did not provide clear evidence that reed beds were the most appropriate wastewater treatment option, and showed that industrial wastes resulted in erratic performance efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.747W.0/4">The outputs of successful research and similar projects are promoted through dissemination channels such as our resource centre network and websites. These technologies have also been promoted in DFID programmes where appropriate. One in Bangladesh in collaboration with WaterAid has seen the use of reed bed technology in the urban environment evidenced.</p>
	<p pid="c.747W.0/5">DFID Central Research Department is currently considering whether to develop a water and sanitation 'Research into Use' programme to promote the adoption of technologies generated through research. Such a programme might analyse the potential of outputs and fund uptake promotion of those technologies with greatest potential.</p>

	<p pid="c.747W.6/1">DFID has received no representations on the withholding of aid to Zimbabwe. The UK does not give direct funding to the Government of Zimbabwe. All DFID's funding is channelled through NGOs and UN agencies, much of it programmed jointly with other donors. We do not believe in cutting direct assistance to poor Zimbabweans and thus punishing them further for their unaccountable Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.747W.6/2">The UK is one of the largest bilateral donors of humanitarian support to Zimbabwe, supporting over 1.5 million of the poorest people. Over the last five years, DFID has spent approximately &pound;143 million in Zimbabwe, including over &pound;33 million in the last financial year. This funding prioritises HIV/AIDS, food insecurity and supporting orphans and vulnerable children. DFID also supports civil society organisations to promote better governance and human rights. Our current programmes will help ensure that an additional 30,000 people receive anti-retroviral treatment, will provide health care for around 350,000 children, promote food security in urban and rural areas and assist extremely vulnerable displaced people.</p>

	<p pid="c.751W.2/2">None of these groups make a contribution from their pay into the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. When setting pay levels for all personnel up to Brigadier and equivalents, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) looks at a range of factors in their consideration of overall pay comparability. Pension is just one of these factors. The AFPRB then makes an adjustment to comparator earnings to reflect the value of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) benefits compared with the pension benefits of comparator employees.</p>

	<p pid="c.754W.8/1">The provision of opportunities for service personnel to gain nationally recognised civilian qualifications is an important component of the MOD's Personnel Strategy and is detailed in &quot;Defence Policy for the Accreditation of Education, Training and Experience&quot;, which aims to have military training, education and experience, where appropriate, accredited against nationally recognised qualifications. Furthermore, the priorities set in this policy are aligned with those in the Government's National Skills Strategy, focusing particularly on qualifications in literacy and numeracy and in wider employability skills, such as NVQs and Apprenticeships, but also accreditation leading to higher education qualifications, including Foundation Degrees.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.8/2">Although the attainment of the operational requirement remains the primary goal of military training, accreditation to civilian qualifications has an obvious benefit to recruiting, retention and resettlement. The success of this policy is such that, in the last financial year, personnel in the armed services gained:</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.8/3" class="indent">in excess of 11,000 NVQs or other Level 2 qualifications;</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.8/4" class="indent">over 8,000 apprenticeships at either Levels 2 or 3;</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.8/5" class="indent">and 500 completed Foundation Degrees.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.8/6">In addition, staff are constantly seeking further opportunities with Awarding Bodies to extend the linkage of military training, education and experience to appropriate civilian qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.8/7">However, it is more difficult for Awarding Bodies to validate, in terms of quality assurance and syllabus content, military training and education that was undertaken by serving and ex-serving personnel a number of years ago and thus provide retrospective accreditation opportunities. For those who have left the services with no or very low level qualifications, there are opportunities with local colleges and training providers to gain civilian qualifications funded through schemes such as the Learning and Skills Council's &quot;Train to Gain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.8/8">Financial assistance is also provided to support service personnel in gaining nationally-recognised qualifications for their own personal development through the Armed Forces Learning Credits Schemes. First, under the Standard Learning Credit Scheme, service personnel are eligible to claim from public funds 80 per cent. of course fees, up to a maximum of &pound;175 per financial year. Secondly, the Enhanced Learning Credit (ELC) Scheme (introduced in 2004) provides larger scale support to pay for higher level academic and vocational learning at Level 3 or above on the National Qualifications Framework. The claim limit is also 80 per cent. of the annual fee (the claimant making a minimum 20 per cent. personal contribution to demonstrate their commitment). Individuals can draw down a maximum of &pound;1,000 per annum on three occasions after serving four years from registration, and this rises to &pound;2,000 per annum having served eight years after registration. Since the introduction of the ELC Scheme, over 225,000 personnel have registered with 16,500 claims made. While the majority of those registered have not yet made a claim, many of the claims are made in the last two years of service and are used alongside individuals' resettlement provision. Moreover, claims under the ELC Scheme can be made up to 10 years after leaving the armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.756W.5/1">I apologise for the delay in replying to the hon. Member's question. For Great Britain the procedures for assessing the cleanliness and habitability of service families accommodation (SFA) are laid down in the MOD's Housing Management Manual. A number of separate checks for levels of cleanliness and inspections on equipment are carried out prior to a service family moving into SFA. The standards are set out in the contracts with the service providers for SFA and incorporated in the Guide to Living in Service Family Accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.756W.5/2">In England and Wales, there are more than 20,000 move-ins each year. Prior to the rolling-out of the Housing Prime Contract (HPC) in 2006, there were no separate complaints recorded for the level of cleanliness. Under the HPC, in 2006 there were 573 separately recorded complaints about cleanliness. This level of complaints was due to the early problems experienced with the HPC. There is no separate recording process for ill-equipped housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.756W.5/3">In Scotland, houses are maintained through a regional prime contract. There are some 1,500 move-ins each year in Scotland and the number of overall complaints in Scotland were three in 2004, four in 2005 and two in 2006.</p>

While the Act does not formally apply on the parliamentary estate, the Commission, on the advice of the Administration Committee, has decided that the House should comply with the principles of the legislation, as it is not desirable that those who work on or visit the parliamentary estate should be treated differently in this respect from those in other workplaces and public places. The Commission recognises, however, that many who work on the estate are unavoidably present for long periods, particularly when the House is sitting. It is therefore desirable to make reasonable provision for those who wish to smoke to do so, provided that the health and safety of other users of the estate is not adversely affected.</p>

From that date smoking will, however, be permitted in four designated external areas: the Terrace, Commons Court (North West corner), North Terrace (between Portcullis House and Norman Shaw South), and in a designated area on the west side of Canon Row courtyard.

	<p pid="c.758W.6/1">The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the Electricity and Gas (Energy Efficiency Obligations) Order 2004 estimated that the cost to energy suppliers of meeting their energy efficiency obligations for 2005-08 would be around &pound;1,200 million. If passed on in full to their domestic customers, this would be no more than about &pound;9 per fuel bill per customer per year. We do not anticipate any recurring costs for energy suppliers (other than complying with subsequent obligations). On average costs will be more than outweighed by the benefits to householders in terms of reduced fuel bills or increased comfort from the installation of energy efficiency measures. The RIA estimated that overall lifetime-discounted savings would amount to a net present value of around &pound;1,000 million by 2010, &pound;3,400 million by 2020 and &pound;5,400 million over the lifetime of the measures.

The implementation of a more risk based approach to regulation, in conjunction with tougher penalties combined with improved effectiveness via focus on outcomes, and simplification where possible, is fully consistent with this.</p>

This offers the most comprehensive solution to the problems faced by householders whose properties are connected to a private sewer or lateral drain.</p>
	<p pid="c.759W.5/2">The Government will now consult on a range of ways transfer can be implemented. The consultation will also be used to examine how to prevent the proliferation of new private sewers, in order to prevent the reoccurrence of existing problems. The responses to consultation will inform the drafting of regulations to provide for Water and Sewerage Companies (WaSCs) to make 'schemes' to effect transfer. The earliest date these regulations could be in force is likely to be summer 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.760W.5/1">Regulation 13 of Chapter V of the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea places a general responsibility on contracting Governments for the adequate provision of aids to navigation in and around each of their respective coastal areas. Under Part VIII of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, responsibility for the provision of marine aids to navigation has been given to the general lighthouse authorities (GLAs). These are Trinity House Lighthouse Service, the Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which provides aids to navigation around the coast of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="c.771W.9/2">None. The Casino Advisory Panel (CAP) is entirely independent of the Government. The arrangements for the Examinations in Public (EiPs) were entirely a matter for the panel, and it would not have been appropriate for the Government to intervene. Guidance notes for participants in the EiPs were sent to all the shortlisted authorities in August 2006. Professor Stephen Crow, the Chair of the CAP, who is experienced in chairing similar hearings as part of the planning process, chaired all seven Examinations in Public to ensure consistency.</p>

	<p pid="c.777W.0/2">Sure Start children's centres in the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged areas in England must provide integrated early learning and daycare as part of their core services. Based on information supplied by local authorities, 1,111 (97 per cent.) of the 1,137 designated Sure Start children's centres are offering this provision either on the same site as other children's centre services or at a site close by. Children's centres outside the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged areas may choose whether to provide integrated early learning and daycare depending on levels of local need.</p>

	<p pid="c.777W.3/2">Local authorities are responsible for deciding the location of children's centres, and we do not routinely collect data on the numbers based on school sites. We estimate however that, based on an analysis conducted in 2006, around a third of the 1,137 centres currently designated fall into this category.</p>
	<p pid="c.777W.3/3">The proportion of children's centres based on school sites may increase as children's centres are rolled out across England and local authorities take full advantage of the opportunities for co-location and offering integrated services for children and parents from one place.</p>

	<p pid="c.777W.6/2">We have issued planning guidance for all local authorities which sets out the criteria for the location of children's centres. We have asked them to ensure that these locations enable all children under five in the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged areas of England to have access to integrated services by March 2008. These areas are defined by Super Output Areas as developed by the Office for National Statistics. The exact location within these areas is determined by local authorities in consultation with local partners. When appropriate plans have been made to serve the most disadvantaged areas with children's centre services, the local authority has the flexibility to decide where to locate further centres according to the resources available.</p>
	<p pid="c.777W.6/3">There are currently 18 designated Sure Start children's centres in Kent and a further 52 planned by March 2008. By 2010 every ward in Kent will be served by a children's centre as part of the Government's commitment to offer Sure Start integrated services to every community in England. A breakdown of the designated and agreed Kent children's centres by ward is as follows:</p>

This funding can be used to provide support for child care places where affordability is an issue for parents, and can also be used to provide training, enable early education and child care settings to make adaptations to premises and equipment, provide additional staff, and support multi-agency working through the early support programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.806W.5/2">The Department for Communities and Local Government is responsible for leasehold issues. Legislation provides that landlords are required to consult with leaseholders where an agreement of more than 12 months is to be entered into that will incur expenditure to be funded through leaseholder service charges. This includes agreements with managing agents or relating to building insurance. Parliament agreed during the passage of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 that agreements of 12 months or less should not automatically require consultation. However leaseholders with agreements of 12 months or less do have the right to challenge the reasonableness of service charges they may be asked to contribute towards.</p>

	<p pid="c.832W.5/1">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. These surveys assess that the potential volume of opium production in Afghanistan was 6,100 metric tonnes (mt) in 2006, 4,100 mt in 2005, 4,200 mt in 2004, 3,600 mt in 2003 and 3,400 mt in 2002. The cultivation picture varies between and within provinces and comparing total levels of production does not necessarily represent an accurate picture of progress to date; in areas of Afghanistan where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved in 2005 were sustained and in some cases improved upon in 2006. Although it is too early to predict the levels of production in the next three years, the UNODC's 2007 Rapid Assessment Survey suggests that Afghanistan may be facing another year of high poppy cultivation.</p>

Arbitrary detention is common for political reasons, as well as criminal, and is sometimes imposed for apparently minor offences. Imprisonment without trial is also commonplace. Expatriates working on contracts in the country have been detained, not always in prison, in purely commercial disputes. Corruption and bribery is widespread throughout the judicial system. Nepotism is also rife, so resolving consular difficulties can be problematic and time consuming. Where trials do occur, they are often considered to be unfair. Amnesty International, which observed the coup trials in 2005, stated in its 2006 report that subsequent trials were also unfair, with defendants held incommunicado before the trial and reportedly convicted on the basis of confession statements extracted under torture.</p>

	<p pid="c.837W.5/1">The European Council Secretariat prepared a &quot;food for thought&quot; paper, intended to stimulate discussion at the February meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. The paper did not reflect a considered or shared EU analysis.</p>
	<p pid="c.837W.5/2">Concerns about Iranian development of enrichment technology are pressing, but it is also clear that Iran is having difficulty in mastering enrichment technology. We still have time to make diplomacy work, and a renewed suspension of enrichment-related activity is still relevant and important.</p>
	<p pid="c.837W.5/3">The UK and the rest of the EU remain fully committed to finding a negotiated solution and to prevent Iran from acquiring the means to produce nuclear weapons, through stepping up pressure on Iran to comply with United Nation Security Council and International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors requirements while keeping generous proposals on the table. We have seen that Security Council Resolution 1737 has stimulated a debate inside Iran about the cost of the course on which the regime has set the country. A further resolution imposing additional incremental measures is under discussion in the Security Council.</p>

We will continue to discuss the situation in Zimbabwe with EU partners in Harare and Brussels. Zimbabwe is a regular subject in the EU's dialogue with the South African Development Community (SADC) and with individual SADC members. However, the SADC has shown no desire to engage with the EU in a co-ordinated international strategy of the kind suggested by the hon. Member.

	<p pid="c.849W.2/1">The information requested is in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.849W.2/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February 2007</phrase>, 52 per cent. of men and women had returned their testing kits. This figure is likely to rise as kits are being sent out all the time and there is a time lag between people receiving and returning the kits.</p>
	<p pid="c.849W.2/3">Local screening centres cover populations of around 500,000 people. Men and women in their 60s in these populations are invited to be screened on a general practitioner practice basis over a two year period. For each two year screening round we would expect each local screening centre to invite 50,000 people for screening. It is estimated that full national roll-out of the programme in England will be achieved by December 2009. All eligible men and women will therefore have been invited for screening by December 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.849W.2/4">The national health service bowel cancer screening programme is in the relatively early stages of roll-out. We will consider publishing an assessment of the programme when roll-out is more complete.</p>
	<p pid="c.849W.2/5">The bowel cancer screening programme is beginning by inviting men and women aged 60 to 69 to be screened as the risk of bowel cancer increases with age, with over 80 per cent. of bowel cancers arising in people who are 60 or over. The successful NHS pilot study also showed that men and women in their 60s were more likely to take up their invitations for screening than men and women in their 50s. Within the programme men and women aged 70 and over are able to self-refer for screening every two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.849W.2/6">When we have rolled out the programme to the whole of England, we will make an assessment of whatever next steps may be required, including looking at the age range.</p>

	<p pid="c.852W.2/1">Primary care trusts (PCT) in England do not award dental providers an annual budget but an annual contract value, which is payable in equal monthly instalments, in return for an agreed level of service. Service levels may be defined by an annual number of units of dental activity (which are a weighted measure of courses of treatment), or they may include service outputs that cannot be measured through courses of treatment. All contract payments will be honoured if the dental provider delivers their agreed service levels. The Department does not assess the performance of individual dental providers. PCTs, as the commissioning bodies, are responsible for monitoring the delivery of services by their local dental providers. Dental services in Eastbourne are the responsibility of the East Sussex Downs and Weald PCT.</p>

	<p pid="c.856W.2/1">In previous years the pooled drug treatment budget (PTB) has been allocated using a formula based on an estimate of population need, linked to social and economic factors, known as the York formula. For 2007-08, the York formula continues to determine the majority of the PTB allocation formula. In 2007-08 the PTB indicative allocations also includes a small element of redistribution from those areas who currently receive a high level of Government contribution to the cost of treatment per person treated, to areas where the contribution is significantly lower. Nationally, this will mean a distribution of funding that is flatter per person treated than has previously been the case. For Enfield, the projected number of individuals in drug treatment in 2006-07 is 604. These figures are based on April to December data from the national drug treatment monitoring system.</p>
	<p pid="c.856W.2/2">The Government contribution per person treated in Enfield in 2006-07 was the second highest in England at &pound;4,191. The contribution per person treated in 2007-08 will be &pound;3,954, compared with the national average of &pound;2,300 and the London average of &pound;2,582.</p>
	<p pid="c.856W.2/3">The latest estimate for problematic drug users in Enfield, from the University of Glasgow data is &pound;1,409. This figure is for problematic users of heroin and crack cocaine only and was not used in the calculations for the 2007-08 PTB.</p>

	<p pid="c.857W.5/1">We take the issue of eating disorders, especially among young people, very seriously. This is why the Department asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce a clinical guideline on the core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders, which NICE published in 2004. The guideline covers physical and psychological treatments, treatment with medicines, and information specifically for patients, carers and the general public. The guideline is due for review in January 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.5/2">In the four years to the end of March 2007, we will have invested over &pound;400 million of additional money into the child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) provided by the national health service and local authorities. These funds will assist in meeting and maintaining the Department's public service agreement (PSA) standard of a comprehensive CAMHS, including services for young people with an eating disorder. Further funds totalling &pound;134 million have been made available to the NHS and local authorities in 2006-07 to help achieve a comprehensive CAMHS in every area by the end of 2006 and ensure that it is maintained thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.5/3">As primary care trusts (PCTs) consider local health needs and commissioned services, they will need to assess whether the right balance exists between in-patient care and home-based care, particularly at a highly specialised levels, to help individuals with eating disorders. This means that PCTs will need to consider their commissioning role, where they work with local organisations and opportunities exist to commission services jointly&mdash;for example, where voluntary organisations can provide services more effectively than statutory services.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.5/4">We made a manifesto commitment in 2005 to increase the provision of psychological therapies. This followed 2001 Department guidelines on treatment choice in psychological therapies which included eating disorders, and 2004 guidance, &quot;Organising and Delivering Psychological Therapies&quot;, to help local services to understand best practice and how to organise local services to support access. Last year we embarked on a new programme, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies, (IAPT), to provide more effective and timely access to psychological therapies for people with mild to moderate mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. IAPT's two national demonstration sites in Newham and Doncaster, and a national programme of regional projects, will complete their work by March 2008 but interim results are showing positive gains in health and wellbeing in many of the 3,500 people already referred to the service.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.5/5">Between 2004 and 2009, the Department is also funding a five-year initiative, Shift, to tackle the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health issues in England. Shift works with young people and professionals to promote awareness of all mental health problems, including eating disorders.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.5/6">We fund several voluntary sector organisations involved with eating disorders, including Weight Concern and beat, formerly the Eating Disorder Association for whom we are funding a three-year pathways to recovery project, which provides a support network of people who have had eating disorders. This project, which began in June 2006, will receive &pound;131,000 over its three-year duration. The Department is also considering whether we can undertake further research into eating disorders through the National Institute for Health Research, about which I hope to make an announcement in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="c.864W.5/4">In addition, the &pound;250 million that will be released as a result of the recent re-organisation of the NHS will be returned directly into frontline services. Managers however will remain a key part of the NHS workforce in supporting clinical care and delivering improvements in waiting times and the accessibility of services.</p>

	<p pid="c.865W.5/1">The Information Centre for health and social care had planned to publish the workforce census in March 2007. It will now be published in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.865W.5/2">This is because the reorganisation of primary care trusts (PCTs), which took place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>, has impacted on the collection process. Data have been provided by PCTs in different formats and this has required extensive validation (of the quality of data submitted), to ensure consistency with previous years. In many instances new staff within PCTs have been involved in this process, which has led to delays</p>
	<p pid="c.865W.5/3">In addition over 200 organisations have submitted workforce data through the new national payroll system, the electronic staff record (ESR). Additional data validation has been undertaken to ensure that in the first year of deriving census information from this source, it is of at least equivalent quality to that previously collected directly from trusts and PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="c.865W.5/4">The Information Centre for health and social care is working with the Department to review systems for collecting workforce information and looking at ways of building on the development of the ESR. When the ESR is fully rolled out across the national health service in 2008 this should enable comprehensive workforce data to be available more quickly and frequently.</p>

	<p pid="c.868W.2/1">The national health service provides a contribution to the cost of continuing education and training for professions whose income derives in part from providing NHS services. Under deregulatory changes approved by Parliament in 1986, the NHS provides optical vouchers to certain eligible groups to assist in buying glasses or contact lenses, but the dispensing of glasses is carried out on a private basis. The Department considers that these arrangements work well in promoting choice and access to services and that it would be anomalous to use public funds to make continuing education and training payments to health care professionals who do not provide services under contract to the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="c.871W.0/1">Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation, both natural and artificial, is the most important modifiable risk factor for skin cancer. The Government do not advise people to avoid the sun entirely but to enjoy it safely and prevent sunburn. Similarly they advise against the use of sunbeds for cosmetic purposes but they recognise the right of individuals to make informed choices.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.0/2">The possible need for information about the number and distribution of coin-operated sunbeds, and the scale of any sunbed use by minors, is one factor that the Department has considered as part of its review of options for the regulation of such sunbeds.</p>

	<p pid="c.876W.5/1">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) keeps the risk of Avian Influenza (AI) under constant review. The Department has a range of preventive measures in place, which are ongoing, to address the risk of AI entering Northern Ireland and to stop it spreading in poultry. Wild bird surveillance is under way this winter throughout Northern Ireland and to date no highly pathogenic H5N1 AI has been found here. A NI Bird Register is in place to gather essential information about poultry, game and other captive birds for the purposes of risk assessment, disease prevention and control. DARD has issued extensive guidance to bird keepers on biosecurity measures to protect their birds, including on how to plan for housing birds in the event of an outbreak. This is also available on the DARD website.</p>
	<p pid="c.876W.5/2">Following the outbreak of H5N1 AI in Suffolk, DARD has reviewed the level of risk and has put in place some additional precautionary measures. These include the introduction of a number of trade restrictions including new general and specific licensing arrangements,, and a ban on the movement of birds from Great Britain to attend bird gatherings and pigeon races here. The Department has also reiterated to bird keepers the importance of good biosecurity measures to minimise the risk to their birds. The Department continues to liaise closely with Defra to monitor developments, and also maintains very close contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food in the Republic of Ireland. The Department will continue to keep the situation under constant review and the need for additional measures in proportion to the level of risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.876W.5/3">The Department has a contingency plan in place for use in the event of an outbreak here to contain and eradicate H5N1 AI if it does occur here.</p>
	<p pid="c.876W.5/4">H5N1 avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds. Transmission to humans in contact with poultry/other birds occurs rarely and to date has occurred almost exclusively in people with very close physical contact with infected birds. The Northern Ireland Pandemic Influenza Control Committee (NIPICC) is concerned with contingency planning for, and management of, a pandemic of human influenza. As such NIPICC does not have a role in reviewing/managing an outbreak of avian influenza and hence has not met in relation to the most recent H5N1 outbreak in Suffolk.</p>

	<p pid="c.884W.3/4" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> The system records notification of ground changes, such as new housing development, on a map background. Notifications can be added by OSNI staff and/or users of OSNI mapping such as the Land Registers of Northern Ireland (LRNI) either from local knowledge, new address information supplied by the local authorities or from aerial photography within the STAR system. The recorded information is used by OSNI managers to allocate work to the OSNI survey teams and to track the progress of that work. Customers such as LRNI can also monitor any requests for map updates that they submit using the system. STAR also provides several map query tools that enable users to take measurements such as distance and area from the underlying OSNI large-scale mapping.</p>

	<p pid="c.887W.2/1">I am discussing the application of the recent Pay Review Body settlements with ministerial colleagues in HM Treasury. Where comparable, the settlements, including those for nurses and other health professionals, will apply in Northern Ireland. The Pay Review Body pay awards should ensure that the public sector can recruit, retain and motivate suitable staff. The Government have achieved a great deal in recent years with significantly increased investment in public services, with the NHS being the main beneficiary. This in turn has led to greatly increased pay for front line staff, fully recognising the hard work they undertake and service they offer on a daily basis. On balance, the latest pay award ensures that key front line workers continue to be fairly rewarded while maintaining the wider need for overall awards that help maintain our current UK economic success.</p>
	<p pid="c.887W.2/2">While Northern Ireland health care workers are not formally covered by the Pay Review Bodies this will change in 2008-09 when these staff groups are incorporated formally into the pay review body process. A productivity working group has been established in Northern Ireland following the independent Appleby Review. This group will continue to monitor and assess productivity levels in the local health sector.</p>

Furthermore, the Education and Libraries (NI) Order 2003, which came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, places a duty on all grant-aided schools to have an anti-bullying policy and to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. Inspections of pastoral care arrangements in schools include an assessment of anti-bullying measures and if improvements can be made schools are advised at the time.</p>
	<p pid="c.887W.5/2">In 2004 the Department in partnership with voluntary organisations, including Save the Children, established an Anti-bullying Forum to enable a collaborative and co-ordinated approach to tackling bullying in schools. The Forum enables members to share models of best practice and disseminate information, to develop and co-ordinate joint initiatives and to ensure that schools and organisations working with children and young people are able to develop appropriate strategies to prevent and deal with bullying behaviours.</p>
	<p pid="c.887W.5/3">From early 2006 the Department has been funding a coordinator post attached to the NI Anti-Bullying Forum. She is currently involved in developing a regional anti-bullying strategy based on good practice here and elsewhere and in developing a support network for schools. In addition she will be researching best practice solutions to emerging problems such as cyber-bullying.</p>

	<p pid="c.888W.8/1">Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) was introduced in Northern Ireland in December 2002. However, the offence of failing to make a SORN declaration was superseded in December 2003 by the introduction of continuous registration which created the new offence of being the keeper of an unlicensed vehicle; a vehicle being unlicensed if neither a current licence nor a Statutory Off Road Notification is in force. Accordingly, there are no longer any prosecutions specifically for failing to make a Statutory Off Road Notification. During 2006, action was taken against 12,837 motorists for being the keeper of an unlicensed vehicle, resulting in the payment of over &pound;538,000 in penalties.</p>

	<p pid="c.889W.2/1">The chief executive of roads service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-13">13 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary question regarding what progress has been made with the upgrading of <i> (a)</i> the A8 Belfast to Larne Road and <i> (b)</i> the A72 Belfast to Carrickfergus Road; and if he will make a statement. As this issue falls within my responsibility as chief executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.2/4" class="indent">Roads Service completed a package of major improvements on the A8 Belfast to Larne road in 2005 at a cost of some &pound;13.3 million. With the completion of these works, which included a significant number of safety improvements, approximately 43 per cent. of the road between Sandyknowes (M2) and Larne is now of dual or motorway standard. Current traffic volumes on the remaining single carriageway section, between Ballynure and Kilwaughter do not merit the provision of a dual carriageway standard road at this time and it is the Department's view that the recent improvements provide a high level of service on this road.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.2/5" class="indent">However, you will be aware that on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase>, the Minister for Regional Development David Cairns MP, published the Consultation Document &mdash; 'Expanding the strategic road improvement programme 2015'. This included a proposed &pound;10 million improvement scheme at the M2/A8 (M) Sandyknowes Junction. Roads Service has received some 80 responses to the document including a number in support of further upgrading of the A8. All responses are currently being considered and it is hoped that an announcement of the final proposals &quot;will be made later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.2/6" class="indent">You also enquired about progress on upgrading the A72 Belfast to Carrickfergus Road. I presume you meant the A2 Belfast to Carrickfergus Road.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.2/7" class="indent">I can advise that a proposed road improvement scheme on the A2 at Greenisland is included in Roads Service's major works preparation pool. The preparation pool comprises the highest priority major works schemes which are being designed and taken through the necessary statutory procedures with a view to progressing to construction within the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.2/8" class="indent">Following assessment of alternative route options, a preferred route has been selected and a preliminary design has been completed. The Department has prepared a Notice of Intention to Make a Direction Order, a Notice of Intention to make a Vesting Order, and an Environmental Statement, which we plan to publish in March 2007. A public exhibition will be held to coincide with the publication of these documents and there will be a formal period for public comment/objection to the Department's proposals which, depending on the outcome, may result in a public inquiry being required.</p>
	<p pid="c.889W.2/9" class="indent">Subject to the successful completion of the statutory procedures and funding being available, Roads Service would hope to commence construction in 2008-09.</p>

In order to help them carry out that responsibility, the Education and Library Boards have set out detailed fire precautions guidance in their publication &quot;Health and Safety Manual&mdash;A Manual for Principals and Governors&quot;. That manual requires school principals to ensure staff receive training in areas such as fire prevention and evacuation and also requires that a safety inspection is completed annually. Principals and governors of schools are further assisted by each board's health and safety practitioner in the preparation of fire evacuation policies and testing of school-based procedures. While primarily aimed at governors in controlled and maintained schools, the manual is also available via the boards' websites to voluntary grammar and grant-maintained integrated schools, whose governors have similar responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="c.891W.9/1">Due to an administrative oversight question 119455 was not answered earlier.</p>
	<p pid="c.891W.9/2">The most recent survey recorded 4,331 whooper swans in Northern Ireland in January 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.891W.9/3">There are five main sites that regularly support whooper swans in numbers of international or regional importance. These are Upper Lough Erne, Lough Neagh and Lough Beg, Lough Foyle, River Foyle, River Lagan-Flatfield and River Blackwater-Derryscollop. There are a number of other smaller, more widely dispersed flocks.</p>
	<p pid="c.891W.9/4">My officials are aware of only one road scheme with the potential to impact on a whooper swan site. This is the proposed further road development at Toome, County Londonderry. This is still at the planning stage and is subject to an assessment as required by article 6 of the Habitats Directive. Recent surveys of the swans at this location will provide further information on the number and behaviour of birds overwintering on Lough Beg.</p>
	<p pid="c.891W.9/5">Whooper swan is listed in Annex II of the Birds Directive and three special protection areas have been classified for them at Lough Neagh and Lough Beg, Lough Foyle and Upper Lough Erne.</p>
	<p pid="c.891W.9/6">Whooper swan is also listed on schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, which affords protection for them throughout Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="c.892W.2/1">I understand that planning for Towerview Primary School is well advanced and that final design stage costs are to be submitted by the South Eastern Education and Library Board to the Department of Education for approval. Once design costs have been received and approved it would normally take a few months to complete the remaining stages before construction work could commence. I would therefore expect that the scheme should be able to start by the summer and take around 12 to 15 months to finish, subject to the necessary stages being completed satisfactorily.</p>
