	<p pid="a.859W.2/1">The coalition Government's approach differs from that of the last Government. While the network helped schools to increase participation rates in the areas targeted by the previous Government, the fact remains that the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.2/2">The Secretary of State has decided to withdraw central funding for the Youth Sports Trust because, in spite of significant central Government expenditure, nearly a quarter of all pupils do not do any competitive sport at all within their own school; and more than half of all pupils do not do any competitive sport at all against other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.2/3">Furthermore, the actual provision of competitive sport across the country has been very patchy, with some 1,280 secondary schools having none of their pupils taking part in any intra-school sporting competition, and 710 schools where no pupils regularly take part in any inter-school competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.2/4">Consequently, the Secretary of State concluded that a fresh approach to school sport is needed and has announced that he will not continue to provide ring-fenced funding for school sport partnerships. By removing all the unnecessary targets and reporting requirements placed on schools by the previous Government's strategy, schools will be freed up to provide more opportunities for competitive sport that are most appropriate for their own pupils. The best way to increase participation is to give schools the freedom and incentives to organise school sport themselves, rather than imposing a central Government blueprint.</p>

	<p pid="a.859W.5/1">The coalition Government's approach to school sport differs fundamentally from that of the previous Government. While the network of school sport partnerships helped schools to increase participation rates in areas targeted by the previous Government, the fact remains that the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. Only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.5/2">We are committed to creating an Olympic and Paralympic style school sport competition to address this. The best way to create a lasting Olympic legacy in schools is to give them the freedom and incentives to organise it themselves, for themselves, rather than imposing a central Government blueprint.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.5/3">When announcing his decision not to continue to ring-fence funding for school sport partnerships, the Secretary of State also lifted the many requirements of the previous Government's PE and sport strategy. This gives schools the freedom and clarity to concentrate on competitive sport. In giving schools this freedom, we are trusting school leaders to take decisions in the best interests of the pupils and parents they serve. This will allow schools, both nationally and in the Brighton Pavilion constituency, more time and greater freedoms to run after school clubs and to organise competitions and festivals involving other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.5/4">I should clarify that the Department is not closing down school sport partnerships. Rather, they are being entrusted to schools, who can decide whether and how to use them in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.860W.6/1">The UK Border Agency will always first seek to achieve voluntary departure of illegal migrant families. Where families refuse to leave the UK, enforcement efforts will start with efforts to remove the family without the need to detain any family members. Separating parents from children is only ever done as a matter of last resort and only after careful case by case consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.6/2">For example, there may be circumstances where a prisoner, who is also a parent, is released from prison and a decision is made to maintain their detention under immigration powers in order to effect their deportation. Such assessments are made on a case by case basis taking into account public and child protection concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.6/3">However, family separations may occur for other reasons, such as for child protection purposes (which would be a matter for local authority children's services) or where the parent has chosen to separate the family by deliberately hiding the whereabouts of their children. Where children are missing the UK Border Agency will work with other statutory agencies, such as the police and local authorities, to try and locate the children and reunite them with their parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.6/4">At present we do not centrally hold the requested information. To do so would mean examining individual case records at a disproportionate cost. In response to the Independent Chief Inspector's report into family removals the UK Border Agency committed to improving the management information held on families, which we are currently reviewing.</p>

	<p pid="a.871W.5/1">Estimates of pensioner poverty are published in the Households Below Average Incomes series. The most commonly used measure of pensioner poverty relates to those people with incomes below 60% of contemporary median income, after housing costs.

	<p pid="a.873W.2/3">Jobseeker's allowance claimants may also undertake full-time training if this is needed in order to gain the necessary skills to enhance employment prospects. While undertaking two weeks of work-related training within any 12 month period claimants can remain on jobseeker's allowance. This is agreed by the adviser and it can be combined with part-time learning to give a longer period of support.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.2/4">Within limits, jobseekers may also undertake full-time training for longer than two weeks where it is deemed appropriate in order to help towards a move into employment. Currently, jobseekers who undertake full-time training in excess of two weeks are transferred to a separate training allowance. Full-time training opportunities for jobseekers are ideally no more than eight weeks long as short, intensive periods of work-focused training better achieves the purpose of the jobseeker's allowance interventions regime of helping people find employment as quickly as possible. Those with basic skills needs (for example literacy and numeracy) may be able to remain on full-time training for 15 weeks or longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.2/5">The current approach maintains a balance between enabling unemployed people to provide access to training while keeping claimants close to the labour market. Where there are identified skills barriers to work they can be tackled through structured provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.2/6">From summer 2011 we will also be launching nationwide the Work Programme, which will provide personalised and individual services to claimants to support them into work. Work Programme providers will be free to design support according to the needs of the individuals referred to them; this may include training courses which the claimant can undertake while still retaining their benefit.</p>

The strategy announced the introduction of a new &#163;50 civil penalty for those individuals who fail to take reasonable care of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.3/2">The civil penalty will apply to customer error and not fraud. Customer error applies in cases where there is no fraudulent intent on behalf of the customer and a change in circumstance goes unreported as a genuine mistake. Where a customer deliberately does not inform the Department of a reportable change in circumstance this constitutes benefit fraud. The Fraud Investigation Service investigate such cases thoroughly, and an admission of fraud or proof beyond reasonable doubt are the criteria used to determine whether fraud has been committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.3/3">This new penalty will not apply to tax credits as the Tax Credits Act already includes a civil penalty. For Social Security benefits, it is too early to confirm the criteria that will be used when considering the penalty such as <i> (a)</i> the exercise of discretion and <i> (b)</i> a de minimis level. However, it is intended that the penalty will deter individuals from negligent behaviour in the future and increase their personal responsibility for keeping claims correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.3/4">There will be a clear appeals process in place where individuals can appeal against the overpayment decision (as currently exists) and also against the decision to instigate the penalty.</p>

	<p pid="a.878W.2/1">We have maintained close contact with farming organisations throughout the recent severe weather conditions. This has allowed us to support farmers in responding to a range of issues, including relaxing drivers' hours for hauliers supplying feed to farms so that animal welfare is not compromised; relaxing the rules on supplementary feeding to help livestock farmers who are in agri-environment schemes; and monitoring the position on milk collections.</p>
	<p pid="a.878W.2/2">DEFRA and Animal Health have published advice for farmers on their websites on what they should do to protect the welfare of their animals. DEFRA remains in close touch with the industry and will continue to look at whether there are additional, specific measures that need to be put in place to ease problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.878W.5/1">Many bird of prey populations in the UK have recovered in the latter part of the 20th century following severe declines, and in some cases national or regional extinctions. These declines were due to the impacts of illegal persecution and secondary poisoning by pesticides used in agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.878W.5/2">The interaction between birds of prey and various countryside interests (in particular, lowland game rearing, pigeon racing and driven grouse shooting) have been the subject of considerable research involving stakeholder organisations and other interested parties. These studies have demonstrated that a wide range of practical management techniques are available to reduce or eliminate these conflicts with birds of prey. There are no current plans to assess the merits of reducing bird of prey populations.</p>

	<p pid="a.878W.8/2">Because of the poor sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test in South American camelids (llamas, alpacas, etc.), voluntary blood testing for TB can be offered to herd owners. This is currently at the Government's expense and subject to a veterinary risk assessment by Animal Health (AH). Although only optional for herd owners as it is not yet fully validated in camelids, blood testing is often recommended in order to maximise the chances of detecting all infected animals that may remain in these herds and thus speed up the resolution of the TB outbreak.</p>
	<p pid="a.878W.8/3">The case veterinary officer will discuss the TB testing options and implications with the affected herd owner. Herd owners must then signify their intention to co-operate with the TB testing regime and release any animals testing positive by signing a standard letter of consent. If the owner agrees to supplement the skin test with blood testing, AH will take blood samples from all the potentially exposed animals remaining in the herd. This will normally take place 10 to 30 days after a skin test.</p>
	<p pid="a.878W.8/4">Blood testing of camelids is currently undergoing full validation at Veterinary Laboratories Agency as part of a project largely funded by the British Alpaca Society and British Camelids Ltd. It is hoped that a suite of validated blood tests for camelids will be available by the end of 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.882W.3/1">The most recent data on the Incomes and Compositions of Farm Households in England was published by DEFRA on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-15">15 July 2010</phrase> and can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.882W.3/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/foodfarm/farmmanage/fbs/published-data/farmhouseholdincome/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/foodfarm/farmmanage/fbs/published-data/farmhouseholdincome/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.882W.3/3">Farm household income figures are derived from the Farm Business Survey (FBS) and are measured on a gross basis, before tax while assessments of households' living standards are usually made on the basis of income net of tax, based on the Family Resources Survey. Given the significant differences between the two measures of household income and the difficulty of making appropriate adjustments to place them on a comparable basis, direct comparisons are no longer made between the two surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.882W.3/4">Based on the most recent report an analysis of the incomes and assets of farm household population by quartile, according to the level of household income of the principal farmer, is shown as follows. Farm business income refers only to income deriving from the farm business and, unlike household income, excludes income from other sources. It should be noted that 46% of businesses in the bottom quartile were classified as part-time, with insufficient agricultural enterprises to keep one person occupied on a full-time basis. This compares with 28% overall.</p>

	<p pid="a.882W.3/18">One of DEFRA's priorities is to help to enhance the competitiveness and resilience of the whole food chain, including farms, and we therefore want to see a farming sector that is competitive and profitable. That is why we are calling for ambitious reform of the common agricultural policy in order to improve the industry's ability to respond to consumer demand, introducing the grocery code adjudicator to ensure that everyone in the food supply chain gets a fair deal, and have established a task force to conduct an industry-led review of existing farm regulations. Additionally we are providing funding to increase industry competiveness through the Rural Development Programme for England, funding scientific research into increasing food production sustainably, and working with industry to improve skills across the food chain.</p>

	<p pid="a.885W.8/1">Since May, DEFRA has received six written or electronic representations about the costs to business of REACH registration, all from small-medium enterprises (SMEs). These ranged from concerns about the direct financial costs to concerns about potential costs caused by interruption of supplies arising from failure by suppliers to register chemicals used, or by their not having included downstream uses in chemical registrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/2">REACH places responsibility for preparations for registration, including cost sharing, firmly on industry, with no formal role given to the regulatory authorities. While this has meant that authorities have not been able to intervene directly in addressing industry concerns about REACH registration, DEFRA and the UK REACH Competent Authority (provided by the Health and Safety Executive) have provided guidance and advice on best practice. In the case of downstream users' concerns about continuity of supply, my right hon. Friends, the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and for Business, Innovation and Skills, wrote jointly in October to the relevant European Commissioners to draw attention to the issues and propose a course of action to address the concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.885W.8/3">REACH itself provides a number of measures to assist SMEs with the costs of registration, including a reduced scale of fees, with further discounts for participation in data sharing. While the Government are constrained by EU competition and state aid rules from providing direct financial assistance to companies for registration costs, the European Investment Bank is offering a loan facility to SMEs that can be used to cover REACH-related costs. Where appropriate, we have drawn attention to this facility in responses to representations from businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.887W.0/2">Slaughterhouse operators are responsible for the welfare of animals at the time of slaughter. The rules governing animal welfare at slaughter and killing are set out in the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, as amended (WASK). Under this regulation it is an offence to cause or permit an animal avoidable excitement, pain or suffering. There are also specific requirements that must be followed on handling, stunning, slaughter or killing of animals. In particular:</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.0/3" class="indent">anyone carrying out any of these tasks must have the knowledge and skill to do their job humanely and efficiently;</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.0/4" class="indent">all slaughtermen must be competent and hold a registered licence;</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.0/5" class="indent">in every slaughterhouse a competent person must be given authority to take action to safeguard welfare; and</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.0/6" class="indent">only permitted methods may be used to stun or kill animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.0/7">Schedule 12 of WASK sets out the detailed requirements that apply where animals are slaughtered by a religious method to meet Jewish and Muslim religious beliefs. These requirements ensure all slaughter by a religious method is undertaken in licensed slaughterhouses (approved premises), and Official Veterinarians of the Food Standards Agency Operations Group monitor and enforce the rules set out in the Regulations daily.</p>

The number of RAF Harrier pilots who will be required to leave the Service as a result of the withdrawal of that aircraft is the focus of detailed analysis regarding the wider issue of implementing the strategic defence and security review's outcomes including manning and supporting the front-line. The number of Fleet Air Arm Harrier pilots that will be required to leave the Royal Navy is subject to ongoing work between the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force to determine how best to meet the requirement to re-generate a Carrier Strike capability in 2020.</p>

Any pilot made redundant will receive the same standard retraining package offered to any service personnel made redundant and will qualify for graduated resettlement training. In addition, any service personnel made redundant will receive compensation in the form of a lump sum in addition to normal entitlements to pensions and retirement benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.903W.5/1">Sport England is the arm's length body with responsibility for community sport. Their aim is to increase and sustain levels of participation in sport and develop talent to drive standards of elite performance throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.903W.5/2">National governing bodies of sport (NGBs) are responsible for the strategy, delivering through their networks of community clubs, coaches and volunteers. Sport England is investing &#163;480 million through 46 governing bodies over the next four years and has agreed 'grow', 'sustain' and ''excel' targets with each one. Each sport has developed a whole sport plan to achieve these targets. Since 2006, Sport England has invested a total of &#163;3,780,824 into the Birmingham Ladywood constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.903W.5/3">Additionally, the &#163;135 million Mass Participation Olympic Legacy-Places People Play-was launched in November and is available to residents of Birmingham.

	<p pid="a.908W.10/4">Across the package of policies and measures put in place to deliver the savings required to meet the UK's carbon budgets there is a wide range of cost-effectiveness: Conservation and energy efficiency measures typically represent more cost-effective options in the near term, while decarbonising the power generation sector is key to place the UK on track with its long-term target-and to do so at least-cost, avoiding locking in to costlier alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.10/5">Evidence on the net costs and cost effectiveness of the economy wide package of policies and measures to deliver the first three carbon budgets was published in the Analytical Annex to the Low Carbon Transition Plan (DECC, July 2009). Since then various individual impact assessments have been produced, for example to support the Energy Bill, and an impact assessment on the Electricity Market Reform will be published alongside the consultation document. The Government will produce its report on delivering the Fourth Carbon Budget by October 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.912W.8/1">The priority group target ensures that households more likely to experience fuel poverty do receive support. However, we do not have data detailing whether households that received measures under priority group rules during either supplier obligation phase were fuel poor at the point of installation. This summer we introduced a super priority group obligation under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target to ensure that more of the low income households vulnerable to fuel poverty receive energy efficiency measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.2/1">In England, a household is said to be in fuel poverty if it needs to spend more than 10% of its income on fuel to maintain an adequate level of warmth (usually defined as 21 degrees for the main living area, and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms).</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.2/2">In order to determine the required spend on fuel, the annual energy consumption of each household is modelled based on characteristics of the dwelling and the households members. The source of data for this is the English Housing Survey (EHS), an annual survey commissioned by CLG. In addition, the EHS also contains information on the structure of the property, energy efficiency measures, the type of walls and the fuels used.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.2/3">This modelled consumption is then combined with energy price information in order to calculate the required spend. The information on domestic gas and electricity prices is collected and published by DECC on a quarterly basis via a survey of all major energy suppliers. Information on prices of other fuels come from external sources, including from the Office for National Statistics and the Sutherland tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.2/4">Income information is collected as part of the EHS, via a set of detailed questions. This information includes income from the earnings, benefits and savings for the whole household.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.2/5">Full details of the methodology employed for calculating fuel poverty statistics can be found in the Fuel Poverty Methodology Handbook at:</p>

	<p pid="a.917W.0/1">Where students take out loans for tuition from the Student Loans Company (SLC), payments are normally made direct to universities in two instalments, in February and May each year. I am informed by SLC that almost all tuition fees are paid promptly once the student's attendance has been confirmed. Comparatively small sums (less than 0.1% of the total) are held back, usually due to the need to reconcile overpayments made in previous academic years (for example, when a student leaves their course early and the full amount of tuition fee, already paid, may no longer be applicable). This is illustrated as follows. Figures are not available for AY2007/08 and earlier.</p>

Once a programme has finished, a formal project completion report assesses results achieved against objectives set.</p>

	<p pid="a.926W.5/17">The numbers include patients also waiting for other organs in addition to a kidney (such as kidney/pancreas).</p>
	<p pid="a.926W.5/18">The average waiting times are 1,088 days for adults and 276 days for children. NHS Blood and Transplant does not have figures on the average waiting time split between males and females. However, previous analyses have shown that female patients wait longer for transplants than males. This is due to higher levels of sensitisation in female patients caused by pregnancies, which means that it can be more difficult to identify a compatible donor.</p>

The 2009 pandemic tested organisations' plans and the NHS remains well prepared should a new pandemic emerge. This includes the potential for a more severe pandemic, such as could be caused by bird flu, and supplies of H5N1 prepandemic vaccine have been purchased as part of the preparedness plans.

	<p pid="a.929W.2/1">The antiviral drugs marketed as Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) can be used in two broadly distinct disease settings. Firstly, in seasonal influenza, the kind of 'flu' that occurs annually over the winter months, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have examined the effectiveness of both drugs and concluded that they both should be made available to treat at-risk patients with suspected influenza illness and when seasonal influenza virus is circulating.</p>
	<p pid="a.929W.2/2">This NICE guidance does not cover the use of these drugs in a second disease setting, pandemics of influenza, which occur only rarely but at potentially any time of year. For this situation, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee (SPI) reviewed the effectiveness of Tamiflu and Relenza in 2007 and concluded that both drugs could have a significant beneficial impact in reducing morbidity and thus mortality. SPI is currently re-examining the scientific evidence base for the use of antiviral drugs in pandemic influenza. The output from this review will be published in early 2011.</p>

A survey carried out by SQW consultants in 2009 for the Development Trusts Association indicated that of around 1,000 transfers under way in England, approximately one third related to community centres.

	<p pid="a.936W.2/1">Information on rough sleeping counts is available both in the Library and via the DCLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1648099.xls">http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/1648099.xls</a></p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/3">Since 1998, only councils in areas with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count-which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/4">Under new guidance all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>
