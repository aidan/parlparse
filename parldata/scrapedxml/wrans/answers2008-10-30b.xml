	<p pid="b.1175W.3/2">Flystrike is not a notifiable disease and as such farmers are not obliged to report cases to Animal Health. The number of submissions to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) are very small and therefore any conclusions drawn from these figures would be unreliable as they are not reflective of the incidence of flystrike.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.3/3">Flystrike occurs annually in most UK sheep flocks, the incidence being highest in warm and humid areas of South West England. It is estimated that about 12,000 sheep die each year in the UK as a result of flystrike (NADIS report, 2005). Flystrike is a major welfare concern and an important cause of ill thrift in affected animals. Furthermore, the disease results in economically significant fleece and hide damage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.3/4">An article by leading experts, J. M. Broughan and R. Wall (2007) following a study in South West England during 2002-03 indicated that flystrike was associated with higher mean temperatures among other variables. The article concluded that an increase average ambient temperature was likely to increase the incidence of flystrike.</p>

	<p pid="b.1176W.0/2">DEFRA worked in partnership with the industry to create a strategy for voluntary vaccination, and ensured the availability of vaccine. DEFRA has always encouraged vaccination as the only effective way for individuals to protect the welfare of their animals and their own livelihood. Ministers and the chief veterinary officer have emphasised the importance of vaccinating against bluetongue in the media and in meetings with the industry. DEFRA also supported the industry-led Joint Action Against Bluetongue (JAB) communications campaign which promoted the benefits of vaccinating against bluetongue (under the &quot;Don't hesitate, vaccinate&quot; banner), and highlighted the risks of not doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.0/3">DEFRA backed up these messages through a communications campaign which ran throughout the summer, using the farming press and local channels such as roadshows and Animal Health communications to stress the importance of vaccination.</p>

	<p pid="b.1186W.11/1">In the UK, the Government are working with the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU), HM Revenue and Customs and the police to establish the extent of trade taking place over the internet that is illegal, and to find effective ways to tackle this. The issue is one of five priority areas for consideration by the NWCU as part of its delivery of obligations to assist the Government to apply the requirements of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Additionally, DEFRA has been working with the trade, website owners, enforcement experts and other stakeholders to establish a Code of Practice for internet providers and users.</p>
	<p pid="b.1186W.11/2">The issue, however, transcends borders and we believe a global approach is required. The UK was instrumental in proposing that CITES convenes a special workshop to consider the issue, and provided funds for this to occur. I am pleased to report that this meeting will take place next February in Canada. The workshop will review what is known about the scale and nature of illegal internet trade in wildlife globally and then consider ways to tackle illegal activity there. In addition to providing financial support to the workshop we have also contributed evidence of our current knowledge of illegal wildlife trade over the internet.</p>

	<p pid="b.1187W.5/1">A good deal of water is already transferred within water companies' areas of operation to give individual companies greater flexibility to meet local shortages. Longer distance links have long been established between, for example, Wales and the West Midlands and South East Lancashire, the Lake District and Lancashire, and from the Fenland watercourses to Essex.</p>
	<p pid="b.1187W.5/2">The idea of a national grid system for water was discussed at the Secretary of State's Water Meeting during summer 2006 attended by representatives from across the water industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1187W.5/3">There was unanimous agreement that a national water grid was not feasible due to its disproportionate and unjustified cost, both for the environment and for water bills, compared with its possible benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1187W.5/4">This view is underpinned in the Environment Agency report 'Do we need large-scale water transfers for south-east England?', which was published in September 2006. The report found no evidence for the need for such large-scale transfer and was considered to be more expensive and environmentally damaging than the measures already in the south-east water companies' water resources plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.1187W.5/5">The Environment Agency, in consultation with Ofwat, is able to propose to a water company that it enters into a bulk supply agreement with another water company, where it is necessary to secure the proper use of water resources.</p>

	<p pid="b.1199W.2/2">The Department has a responsibility to provide an effective service for its customers and ensure business continuity. Consequently, employees wishing to attend meetings not connected with their duties during the working day would be expected to apply for time off and to attend any such meetings in their own time. Time off may be restricted or refused if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.2/3">On occasion, there are specific scheduled meetings arranged by departmentally recognised trade unions such as branch Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and these meetings may take place either on or off the Department's premises. Managers may grant union members reasonable time away from their desks to attend. However, they would use their discretion in restricting the number of attendees so that the delivery of the services provided by the Department would not be compromised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.2/4">In addition, the Department makes provision for employees to take special leave. This enables employees to serve on certain public or community bodies, i.e. as members of a local authority, magistrates, mayors, school or college governors, jury members or members of the Territorial Army, reserve forces or cadet forces. Special leave can be either paid or unpaid depending on the role and individual circumstances. Again, time off may be restricted or refused so that the delivery of the services provided by the Department would not be compromised.</p>

	<p pid="b.1203W.9/1">The funding for Crossrail was announced by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">5 October 2007</phrase>. Funding will be split roughly three ways; between the Government, Crossrail fare payers and London businesses. Details of the contributions expected to be made were included in a Heads of Terms agreement signed in November 2007 between Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for London (TfL).</p>

	<p pid="b.1203W.9/4">Discussions between DfT and British Aviation Authority (BAA) about a funding contribution towards the cost of Crossrail are at an advanced stage and should be finalised shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.9/5">Under the Heads of Terms agreement, TfL is responsible for underwriting &pound;7.7 billion of the Crossrail project's &pound;15.9 billion estimated capital cost. This includes a contribution from fare payers but also covers the business contributions in the form of the proposed business rate supplement, contributions from property development around stations, the use of the existing s.106 mechanism and possibly a mechanism to extract planning gains. TfL is also funding the costs of Cross London Rail Links Ltd. during 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.9/6">The Heads of Terms agreement assumes considerable contributions from key beneficiaries of Crossrail. The City of London corporation has committed to make a significant contribution and to collect voluntary contributions from businesses across London. An in-principle agreement has been reached with Berkeley Homes for them to construct, at their own cost and risk, a station box at Woolwich. In addition, terms have been agreed with Canary Wharf Group for a significant contribution to the project, the details of which are under negotiation.</p>

The drop in eradication has been accompanied by a drop of nearly one fifth in poppy cultivation, which is a significant success. Furthermore, eradication efforts in Helmand targeted land cultivated by individuals of significance in the narcotics trade.</p>

	<p pid="b.1217W.5/1">The most recent period for which sub-regional estimates of fuel poverty are available is 2003. The data for fuel poverty levels for 2003 come from the Fuel Poverty Indicator dataset, available on the Fuel Poverty Indicator website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.5/2">This shows that in 2003, there were around 5,000 fuel poor households in Havering. In 2003, there were around 1.2 million fuel poor households in England in total.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.5/3">The Government's Sixth Annual Progress Report on Fuel Poverty was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-02">2 October 2008</phrase>. It shows that, in 2006, there were approximately 3.5 million households in fuel poverty across the UK, an increase of 1 million households since 2005. Around 2.75 million of these are vulnerable households (containing children, the elderly or a person who is disabled or suffering from a long-term illness).</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.5/4">In England, the overall number of households estimated to be in fuel poverty in 2006 is 2.4 million of which around 1.9 million are vulnerable. This represents a rise of 900,000 households since 2005 and a rise of 700,000 vulnerable households over the same period. In London in 2006, there were around 250,000 fuel poor households.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.5/5">Official figures for 2007 will not be available until next year, however indicative projections for 2007 and 2008 were published in the Sixth Annual Progress Report, copies of which have been placed in the Library. The projections made for 2007 show that further price rises are likely to have pushed a further 0.7 million households into fuel poverty. Projections for 2008 show a further increase in fuel poverty for England, of around 0.5 million households. These projections are based on known price changes along with estimates for income and energy efficiency improvements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1220W.5/1">British Energy owns a relatively small quantity of plutonium that has arisen from reprocessing at Thorp. British Energy treats the plutonium as a zero-value asset, and records a liability of &pound;4.8 million (discounted) in its accounts relating to the management of the plutonium. This is consistent with the approach taken by the NDA to the plutonium it holds. EdF's offer for British Energy, under which EdF would pay around &pound;4.4 billion to Government for its stake appeared to represent value for money. The plutonium stocks were not separately valued, and any valuation of them would have been <i> de minimis</i> in the context of the deal as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="b.1223W.8/2">Our planning policy statement (PPS) on climate change expects planning authorities to provide a framework that promotes and encourages renewable energy. The PPS advises planning authorities that they should not require applicants to demonstrate the overall need for renewable energy because new renewable energy projects provide crucial national benefits. Planning authorities are also asked not to question the energy justification for why a proposal must be sited in a particular location as this involves considerations of technical and commercial feasibility (including meteorological and economic viability) which are for the developer concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223W.8/3">When determining planning applications, planning authorities should address the planning issues which arise from the proposed location of renewable energy projects, including the suitability of the topography. These concerns are set out in our published planning policy statements and guidance, together with the wider environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy projects that should also be taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="b.1230W.2/1">The Department's policy on the acquisition of vehicles, and motor trade assemblies/parts, is to seek best overall economic advantage in the supply arrangements. EC procurement rules prohibit preferential treatment of UK providers and MOD pursues the normal EC prescribed competitive route, where those rules apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/2">The MOD does, however, consider wider economic factors, such as the effect on British industry, when looking at the options for significant purchases. The MOD also pursues a policy of maximum competition within the sub-contract supply chain with a view to incentivise innovation and maximise opportunities for small to medium enterprises.</p>

The development at COARM of the User's Guide on the Code of Conduct (published in full in this year's Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls), has helped to reduce the number of these cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.1231W.9/1">In November 2006, the then Commander Maritime Reserves informed the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Marine Reserve that a future incumbent of his post could either be a regular or reservist officer. It was also informed that the basis for this selection would be completely on merit. A number of candidates were considered for the post of Commander Maritime Reserves at a board convened in September 2008. The candidates were either members of the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marine Reserve, the Royal Fleet Reserve or the Active List of regular servicemen and women. The appointment of a regular officer as Commander Maritime Reserves is entirely consistent with the Royal Navy's policy of achieving full professional integration of its maritime reserves. All candidates were both reported on and considered for promotion under the common Royal Navy system of career management and promotion appropriate to the post. A number of regular senior posts within the Royal Navy remain open for competition from officers of the Royal Naval Reserve who are suitably qualified and can offer appropriate availability.</p>

	<p pid="b.1233W.3/1">So far as I am aware, no invitation has been received from the French Government for ministerial or other senior representation at a 65th D-day Anniversary Parade in Normandy next June; should an invitation be received nearer the date of the anniversary, it will be considered carefully. An Army band participates annually in the Normandy commemorations and one is scheduled to participate in 2009.</p>

QOF is the national Quality and Outcomes Framework, introduced as part of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract on 1 April 2004. 2. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services (PMS) practices also taking part. 3. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health. 4. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF. 5. The system calculates practice achievement against national targets. It gives general practices, primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) objective evidence and feedback on the quality of care delivered to patients. 6. The Quality Management Analysis System captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists. 7. Figures presented here are just the number of patients on the disease register for dementia.  <i> Source:</i> The data supplied in Table 1 is published on the website of the Information Centre for health and social care.

	<p pid="b.1242W.8/1">The Department's strategy for reducing infections in the national health service is set out in &quot;Clean, safe care&quot;, which has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.8/2">Infection control is one of the five top priorities in the NHS operating framework for 2008-09 and MRSA and <i> Clostridium difficile</i> targets to 2010-11 have been set under the &quot;Better Care for All&quot; public service agreement. &quot;Clean, safe care&quot; outlines the comprehensive range of measures being employed, backed by &pound;270 million additional investment per year by 2010-11 to tackle health care associated infections (HCAIs) and improve cleanliness.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.8/3">Steps include screening all elective admissions to hospitals for MRSA by March 2009, and all emergency admissions by 2010-11; a technology programme designed to accelerate the development and uptake of new technologies to improve infection control; and the development of a new national standard for cleanliness in the national health service. The Department is re-launching its nationwide antibiotic awareness campaign alongside an HCAI patient campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.8/4">These measures should support the NHS to meet their legal requirements on infection control, as set out in the &quot;Code of Practice for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections&quot; (which has already been placed in the Library). All acute NHS trusts are inspected annually against the &quot;Code of Practice&quot; by the Healthcare Commission. From April 2009, the new Care Quality Commission will assess compliance against the &quot;Code of Practice&quot; and will have a broader range of powers to ensure high performance in infection control.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.8/5">Improving patient safety has been a fundamental priority running through our policies to improve the quality of NHS care. We have put in place national standards for safety. We also established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) to promote reporting of adverse events and support the NHS to manage known risks. We have made good progress in the last decade on establishing a unified system for reporting and analysis when things go wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.8/6">&quot;Safety First: A report for patients, clinicians and healthcare managers&quot; sets out the Department's current agenda for patient safety. It made 14 recommendations to ensure that patient safety remains a priority for the Government and the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.8/7">The final report of Lord Darzi's NHS Next Stage Review, &quot;High Quality Care For All&quot;, states that continuously improving patient safety should be at the top of the health care agenda for the 21st century. To achieve this, from April 2009, the NPSA will run an additional, dedicated national patient safety initiative to tackle central line catheter-related bloodstream infections. It will continue to run regular patient safety initiatives like this in future. The Agency will also work with stakeholders in this country to draw up its own list of 'Never Events' such as wrong site surgery. From next year, primary care trusts will select their own priorities from this list in their annual operating plan.</p>

A copy of the Government's Treasury Minute response (Cm 7453) to the PAC report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-16">16 October 2008</phrase>, is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1243W.2/2">The Government are committed to the provision of safe, high quality neonatal services. While improvements have been made over recent years, we recognise there is still more to do. In the 2008-09 national health service operating framework we identified neonatal services as a priority and asked primary care trusts to ensure that sufficient numbers of neonatal teams are in place to meet local needs. In addition, the Department has established a Neonatal Taskforce, chaired by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, to support the NHS to identify and deliver further improvements to neonatal services. As part of its work programme, the Taskforce is working to develop quality standards for a comprehensive neonatal workforce and will develop targeted action plans to assist local decision making regarding staff shortages, incorporating skill mix, staffing levels, retention, recruitment and commissioning of education and training.</p>

	<p pid="b.1245W.0/1">The Government have asked Lord Bradley to consider the diversion of offenders with mental health problems and learning disabilities away from prison and we look forward to considering his report which we expect will be available at the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.0/2">The Department, in partnership with the Ministry of Justice, will publish its strategy &quot;Improving Health Supporting Justice&quot; next year, incorporating our views on the quality and future direction of health care in prisons following a public consultation. The strategy will take account of the recommendations that Lord Bradley will make.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.0/3">This builds on the work already taking place each year over 500 mentally disordered offenders are diverted to secure hospital settings and over 900 people a year are transferred from prison if they need specialist treatment in hospital. In 2007, 28 per cent. more prisoners, with mental illness too severe for prison were transferred to hospital than in 2002&mdash;up to 926 from 723. Tighter monitoring identifies prisoners waiting an unacceptably long period for transfer to hospital, and a protocol has been issued setting out what must be done when a prisoner has been waiting for a place for more than three months following acceptance by the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.0/4">All prisoners assessed at the point of reception into prison and those at risk of having a mental health problem, or vulnerable to suicide, are referred for a mental health assessment to the mental health in-reach team. Nearly &pound;20 million per annum is being invested recurrently in mental health in-reach. There are 102 mental health in-reach teams with all prisons having access to them: a total of 360 extra staff altogether.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.0/5">There are new systems to monitor and support those at risk of harming themselves and prison officers are being trained in mental health awareness. &pound;600,000 has been invested over three years to 2009 to train frontline prison staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.0/6">Furthermore, in relation to the small number of people with a severe personality disorder who are dangerous, the Department and Ministry of Justice is investing in special secure services. This programme has a capacity of over 300 places in two high security prisons (Frankland and Whitemoor); a female prison (Low Newton in Durham) and two high security hospitals (Broadmoor and Rampton). They provide essential clinical services for dangerous offenders whose offending is linked to severe personality disorder.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251W.11/1">Specific funding is not provided to police authorities for the provision of in-country special branch units. Police authorities assign funding for these units from the funding available to them through the main police grant and locally raised police precept. A direct comparison between the 2005-06 and 2008-09 levels of main police grant would be misleading because the creation and discontinuation of a number of specific grants in this period have impacted on the level of main police grant, but not on the overall level of funding provided to the police. Nevertheless, since 2005-06 total Government grants to Lancashire police authority has increased from &pound;210,385,869 to &pound;243,114,829, an increase of &pound;32,728,960.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251W.11/2">Dedicated security posts (DSP) funding is provided to police authorities as a contribution to the costs associated with a number of security-related policing functions, including special branch units at ports. It is a longstanding policy not to disclose the capacity of special branches, including providing details of funding for individual forces. The percentage of the total DSP grant allocated to Lancashire constabulary has however, remained relatively static since 2005-06.</p>

A third party right of appeal would mean that planning permissions could not be implemented pending an appeal, resulting in delays and uncertainty for all. This would run counter to the Government's aim of increasing the efficiency of the planning system and to speed up decision making. Furthermore, the introduction of a third party right of appeal could be used perversely to veto many otherwise acceptable developments, which would bring benefits to local communities in terms of homes, jobs and regeneration of neighbourhoods.</p>

However, housing associations must operate in furtherance of their objects (which must be consistent with the permissible purposes specified in the Housing Act 1996). Section 9 of the Housing Act 1996 requires that the association must obtain the consent of the Housing Corporation to any disposal of its land by way of charge.

	<p pid="b.1274W.5/1">The Code for Sustainable Homes came into effect in April 2007 as the standard for sustainable new build homes in England. It is currently voluntary for the private sector to build homes to the levels set in the code unless they are building on English Partnerships' land (where they will need to build to at least code level 3), or are subject to a planning requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.5/2">However, the Government are committed to ensuring that all new homes are built to the highest levels of sustainability and as such in 2010 are increasing the energy efficiency standards set out in Part L (Conservation of fuel and power) of the Building Regulations and in 2009 introducing water efficiency into Part G (Hygiene). In addition all homes that are designed and built with funding from the National Affordable Housing programme will need to be built to code level 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.5/3">Both English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation have committed to raising sustainability standards over time. English Partnerships stated that homes built on their land would need to be built to at least code level 4 from 2010 and code level 6/zero carbon from 2013. For the Housing Corporation their commitment was tied to the timing of the National Affordable Housing programme funding stream. Therefore they would require homes built to code level 4 from 2011 and code level 6/zero carbon from 2014 (subject to the technology needed being cost effective).</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.5/4">The new Homes and Communities Agency is currently considering how to harmonise the standards and commitments made by English Partnerships and Housing Corporation and will, subject to a cost-benefit analysis, confirm the timetable for building to higher levels of the code in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.5/5">In practice homes are being built today to the higher levels of the code, both on English Partnerships' sites, with funding from the National Affordable Housing programme and by private developers. Code homes have been built or are going through the final assessment process at levels 3, 4, 5 and 6.</p>

	<p pid="b.1275W.5/1">New homes built in the Thames Gateway must meet the same standards as in the rest of the UK. The long-term goal is to reduce UK carbon emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050. The intention is for all new homes to be zero carbon from 2016, to be achieved through a progressive tightening of the energy efficiency standards in building regulations&mdash;with a 25 per cent. improvement on current standards in 2010 and a 44 per cent. in 2013&mdash;up to the zero carbon standard in 2016. Our planning policies on climate change enable councils to drive things further and faster than the national timetable through their planning strategies, where local circumstances warrant and allow this. In addition, homes built with funding from English Partnerships, Housing Corporation or the two Thames Gateway Development Corporations are required to be built to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 3. We also announced in the November 2007 Thames Gateway Delivery Plan that we envisage the Thames Gateway as an eco-region. Work continues to develop the eco-region concept and next steps will be announced in a prospectus, to be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1287W.0/1">The Prime Minister stated in July 2007 that the main Planning-gain Supplement Bill was provisional because if a better alternative was found the Government would be willing to defer it from the current legislative session. Following discussions with the development industry, the Government deferred the introduction of a Planning-gain Supplement Bill from this parliamentary session to take forward CIL in preference.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287W.0/2">The Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Act 2007 is three sections long and cannot be used to introduce PGS. It does not set out the detailed policy, nature or operation of PGS. Its sole purpose is to allow certain authorities to spend money in order to prepare for the introduction of PGS, for example to develop IT systems. In the event, no expenditure has been incurred in relation to PGS which would not have been permitted in the absence of the Preparations Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287W.0/3">There is no need to repeal the Preparations Act as it is a narrow preparations measure designed to ensure the regularity and probity of Government expenditure in accordance with the usual Government accounting rules.</p>

	<p pid="b.1288W.2/1">Local planning authorities have a wide range of discretionary enforcement powers to enable them to deal with unauthorised development that is harming amenity in the neighbourhood. If they consider that unauthorised development is unacceptable on planning grounds, they have the power to take enforcement action. It is for the local planning authority to decide in each case which is the most appropriate course of action, taking account of local circumstances. Guidance is available to local planning authorities in PPG 18 &quot;Enforcing Planning Control&quot; and DoE Circular 10/97 &quot;Enforcing Planning Control: Legislative Provisions and Procedural Requirements&quot; with its accompanying Good Practice Guide.</p>

It is concerned only with whether a proposed use of a site is acceptable in land-use planning terms. The system works on the principle that if permission is granted to one applicant it should be available to anyone else wishing to develop the site in the same way. This means that land with the benefit of planning permission could be sold, whether the land owner is based in the UK or abroad.</p>

This is one in which a contractors basis assessment of the existing buildings, plant, machinery, site infrastructure and other site improvements is added to the rental value for the bare site to arrive at its overall rateable value. For a lesser number of facilities, primarily energy from waste and transfer stations, their rateable values are determined by reference to either a full contractors or rentals valuation approach.</p>

The PPS advises planning authorities that they should not require applicants to demonstrate the overall need for renewable energy because new renewable energy projects provide crucial national benefits. Planning authorities are also asked not to question the energy justification for why a proposal must be sited in a particular location as this involves considerations of technical and commercial feasibility (including meteorological and economic viability) which are for the developer concerned.</p>

The Government are pleased with the collaborative approach which institutions and the council have successfully adopted in relation to sustaining strategically important vulnerable subjects.</p>

	<p pid="b.1296W.5/2">The debate that has been started by these strands of work underlines the ability of the higher education sector itself to think radically and creatively about the future. But many other people too have a huge interest in the success of our universities and colleges. That is why the next stage in the debate is for a group of people whose cultural activities, businesses, public services depend on the success of our universities to articulate their perspective on what a world class higher education sector would look like in 10 to 15 years' time to support their needs. They will also provide challenges and responses to the recommendations that the original contributors put forward. In addition, the National Student Forum will provide the student angle.</p>

	<p pid="b.1297W.2/1">We have not made any specific assessment. There is a wide variety of postgraduate courses, and the decision to undertake postgraduate studies is influenced by a range of factors, and not just debt.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.2/2">Income contingent student loans are not like commercial loans. Student loans only attract an interest rate linked to inflation, so borrowers will repay no more, in real terms, than they borrowed. Borrowers repay at a rate of 9 per cent. of their income over a threshold of &pound;15,000 a year. Repayment is progressive and therefore rises as income does. No payments are due if a borrower is not earning or income falls below the threshold.</p>

There is no separate offence under prison discipline rules of attempted murder.

	<p pid="b.1305W.5/1">The review of the Dedicated Schools Grant is wide-ranging and includes specifically looking at the funding for sparsity and for early years. The aim of the review is to develop a funding formula which distributes resources in line with relative need, recognising the different costs of educating particular groups of pupils and providing education in different areas. Our aim is to support schools and LAs in raising the educational achievement of all pupils and narrow achievement gaps, particularly those from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.5/2">All stakeholders, including schools themselves, have the opportunity to contribute to the review according to their interests. We have established a DSG Formula Review Group with representation from central and local government, teaching associations, unions representing support staff and governors' organisations. Papers and minutes from the group are published on the TeacherNet website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/dsgformulareview/">http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/dsgformulareview/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.5/4">It would not be appropriate to give any guarantee about the outcome of the review while it is still in the process of gathering evidence on the main issues. We expect to go out to consultation on proposals for a new funding formula in early 2010 after which proposals will be further developed in the light of the consultation responses.</p>

	<p pid="b.1305W.8/1">As both of these questions relate to A*-C achievement in GCSE modern languages in each year since 1997 we linked these two PQs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/2">If the information requested could be produced, it would come from the Achievement and Attainment Tables data. That data is essentially hierarchical&mdash;each pupil can sit many exams, each school has many pupils and each local authority has many schools. To deal with that, DCSF manage the data as a series of pre-specified, separate and distinct data files: exam, pupil, school, local authority and national.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/3">That allows the Department to quickly and easily answer questions and produce analyses at a range of different levels and on a range of different measures and indicators. However, those measures and indicators must be pre-specified and the data files are produced under contract for, and delivered to, the Department. A lot of work is put into ensuring the fullest range of relevant measures and indicators are pre-specified and available and updated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/4">However, it becomes more difficult and expensive to produce analyses where a measure or indicator has not been pre-specified. Essentially, that requires going much further back into the data file production process&mdash;agreeing classifications, developing and agreeing production rules and processes, aggregating data (for e.g. from examination level to pupil level), matching data across levels (for e.g. to identify whether a, pupil is in a comprehensive school), extensive quality assurance to check the results and then actual production of the tables and analysis required.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/5">The key point is that, at school and pupil level (for the range of yearn requested), there are not pre-specified variables relating to Modern Foreign Languages&mdash;which would be required to answer these two questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/6">The initial estimate of &pound;4,000 was based on the assumption that DCSF would need to ask contractors to create additional variables, aggregations and matches across levels&mdash;with associated development and quality assurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/7">In some cases, we have the option of carrying out the work ourselves, without involving our contractor in going back to a very early stage in the production process. We have reconsidered on that basis and estimate that would cost &pound;2,200. An explanation of this cost is given as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/8">The main tasks are as outlined earlier&mdash;developing and agreeing classifications, production rules and processes, aggregating data across levels, matching data across levels, quality assurance and final production. This is a complex data production and manipulation process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/9">As PQ 224479 asked for 11 years worth of information, at approximately half a day's work per year, plus a day extra for checking, this would result in a cost of around &pound;1,300. (circa 45 hours).</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/10">PQ 224500 does not require an aggregation up to school level so producing the information is slightly simpler but the process would still require implementing the production rules, creating a suitable variable, aggregating up to pupil level and matching to the pupil lie. Again, substantial quality assurance checks would be needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305W.8/11">This process would need to be repeated for each year and would take longer than the disproportionate threshold of at least three and a half days of HEO-equivalent grade's work and at least another day for a different HEO (or higher) to verify it. This amounts to &pound;900. (circa 32 hours).</p>

However, all schools are required to have an up-to-date sex and relationship education policy which, among other things, sets out how sex and relationship education will be provided and how it will be monitored and evaluated. Primary school policies should have clear parameters on what children will be taught in the transition year before moving to secondary school; secondary school policies must set out how the relevant National Curriculum Science topics will be taught and how sex and relationship education will be provided as part of personal, social and health education.

	<p pid="b.1313W.2/1">In the Children's Plan we announced new investment of &pound;225 million for play over the CSR period 2008-11, and in April we committed a further &pound;10 million to this agenda. This will fund up to 3,500 public play areas and 30 staffed adventure playgrounds nationally. 30 pathfinder authorities will receive on average &pound;2.1 million of capital and &pound;500,000 of revenue each; and every other authority will receive on average &pound;1 million capital and a small revenue grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313W.2/2">There are currently 63 local authorities receiving their allocated funding as part of a first wave. These authorities are being supported by Play England, who have been appointed as the external support body to directly assist local authorities in delivering their allocated funding. The timing of funding for all remaining local authorities will be announced by the end of November.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313W.2/3">This investment is in recognition of the important part play has enabling children to enjoy a happy, healthy childhood. It will provide new capital funding for every local authority in England, and will provide a real opportunity for Children's Trusts to transform local play areas throughout the country. Underpinning our new investment will be the first national Play Strategy for England. We consulted on the draft strategy 'Fair Play' over the summer, and received a very strong and positive response. We will publish our response to the consultation and final Play Strategy shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313W.5/1">The review of the dedicated schools grant is wide-ranging and includes specifically looking at the funding for sparsity, deprivation and special educational needs. The aim of the review is to develop a funding formula which distributes resources in line with relative need, recognising the different costs of educating particular groups of pupils and providing education in different areas. Our aim is to support schools and LAs in raising the educational achievement of all pupils and narrow achievement gaps, particularly those from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds. It will therefore take into account the contribution of small rural primary schools, alongside other schools, in achieving those aims.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313W.5/2">All stakeholders, including schools themselves, have the opportunity to contribute to the review according to their interests. We have established a DSG Formula Review Group with representation from central and local government, teaching associations, unions representing support staff and governors' organisations. Papers and minutes from the group are published on the TeacherNet website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1314W.2/1">Responses to the Staying Safe consultation, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase>, included concerns about safety on bus journeys to and from school. In the Staying Safe Action Plan (February 2008), the Government committed to launching new guidance and training on tackling bullying which takes place outside of schools. Following a competitive tendering process, we have appointed the charity 4Children to develop guidance and training tools and materials on tackling bullying outside of schools. These will be published early in 2009. The guidance and materials will specifically include advice to help practitioners tackle bullying during journeys to and from school and on public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.2/2">Ofsted's Tellus 3 survey, published in October 2008, includes for the first time a question on the frequency of bullying both inside and outside school, including journeys to and from school. Although the survey does not include a measure specifically relating to buses, it does include a question on how safe children feel on public transport and journeys to and from school. Responses to these questions provide a valuable source of information on the scale of bullying outside school.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.2/3">My Department promotes local good practice to monitor and tackle bullying, such as having school prefects act as bullying monitors on school buses. It also encourages local initiatives to tackle bad behaviour on buses, such as the Purbeck Bus Forum which operates in the hon. Member's constituency. To improve monitoring at a local level, my Department is also proposing to introduce a statutory requirement for all schools to record, although not report, incidents of verbal or physical abuse which are linked to bullying. We intend to consult key stakeholders on this over the coming months and will legislate at the earliest possible opportunity in 2009. We will continue also to recommend that schools supply this recorded data to their local authority, so that trends across the authority can be identified and area-wide initiatives evaluated.</p>

This is consistent with the Government's principles of public service inspections and Ofsted's statutory functions, both of which require inspection to be proportionate to risk. Subject to the passage of legislation, the new school inspection arrangements will be introduced in autumn 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315W.2/1">The Government consider that schools are more likely to achieve high standards when they take responsibility for their own future. Control of land and buildings, together with the other freedoms that self-governance brings, is part of this. The land is held in trust for the school by the governing body or the trust. There are protections relating to the disposal of any publicly provided land.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.2/2">The majority of academies occupy their land and buildings through a lease from the local authority (LA). There are in some cases arrangements where academies are built on land owned by a third party (other than the LA) but the land and buildings are leased to the academy trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.2/3">Those academies that were built early in the programme were typically given the freehold of their land by the LA as part of the overall package of transfer of responsibility and control. Since 2006 lease arrangements have been favoured.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.3/1">There are significant, unexploited deposits of coal, gas and oil in Afghanistan and the sector therefore represents an opportunity for both economic growth and rural development. Due to their experience in this sector the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and United States are the main supporters of mining and power generation projects. The Department for International Development's (DFID) development support in Afghanistan focuses upon support to state-building, economic management and sustainable livelihoods. We currently have no plans to fund the construction of power stations in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.6/14">The Education for All&mdash;Fast Track Initiative (FTI), was established in 2002. The FTI is a partnership consisting of all the major donors in education, over 30 developing countries and five major civil society organisations. It seeks to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals of universal primary education and gender parity in education by 2015 through providing further aid and building local capacity. FTI works by forming a compact between development partners based on the principle of one country, one plan, one process. National government with donor partners prepare an education sector development plan linked to the broader poverty reduction strategy and the budget. This is evaluated against the FTI indicative framework and endorsed if found to be compliant. FTI endorsement of national plans provides an assurance to donors that those plans are credible and bankable thereby encouraging bilateral and multilateral investment. The indicative framework also provides the basis for ongoing national progress monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/15">FTI partners expect the FTI to contribute to increasing access to good quality education for all, particularly girls and address the particular challenges of education in fragile states. The FTI process follows best practice on harmonisation and alignment in line with the Monterrey Consensus and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness resulting in increased impact and reduced transaction costs. Further details on FTI are available on the FTI website at</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.6/17">There are now 19 African countries that have benefited from funding from within the FTI Umbrella. Eighteen of these (Benin, Cameroon, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal and Sierra Leone) have received support as a result of a fully endorsed plan through the Catalytic Fund. Liberia has received support from the UNICEF administered transition fund established to meet the needs of fragile states that are not in a position to prepare the detailed plans demanded for Catalytic Fund support. The Central African Republic is currently in the advance stages of securing Transition Fund support.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.6/32">Improving the quality of education in Africa continues to be a concern in all countries where DFID supports education. It has long been a key consideration in the design of our interventions in the education sector. Some of the main areas where qualitative improvements are targeted include enhancing the quality of teachers, reducing class sizes, improving both the content and the availability of textbooks, providing more supplementary reading material and improving the monitoring of learning achievement through diagnostic testing and primary school examinations. These and other factors that contribute to improved education services in Africa should be priority areas in the support that we are providing to education and we will continue to ensure that they remain so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/33">In addition, DFID is funding an education research consortium on Education Quality (&pound;2.5 million, 2005-10), led by Bristol University. This is investigating different aspects of education quality (eg school effectiveness, language and literacy issues) in partnership with the Universities of Bath, Witwatersrand, Cape Coast and Dar es Salaam and the Kigali Institute of Education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/34">The nature of our involvement in the education sector varies from country to country. In some, our support is through general or sectoral budget support, whereas in others it is through technical assistance or through third parties such as UNICEF or NGOs. We cannot therefore generally attribute construction of schools directly to DFID's funding. However, some examples of what is being achieved are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/35" class="indent">In Tanzania, we provide General Budget Support of which 18 per cent. is allocated to the education sector, with half of that going to primary education. In 2007-08, the Tanzanian Government built a total of 1,263 classrooms, 277 teacher's houses and 939 pit latrines for primary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/36" class="indent">In Kenya, we contribute more than a third of the US$325 million of donor funding supporting the Education Sector Support Programme, the Kenyan Government's five-year sector plan for 2005 to 2010. It covers 23 investment areas, of which primary school infrastructure is one. These funds have enabled the following to be achieved to date:</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/37" class="indent">4 new primary schools completed and a further 16 are 80 per cent. complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/38" class="indent">4,000 primary schools have received infrastructure improvement grants which have enabled the following</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/39" class="indent">1,882 new classrooms built, 3,868 classrooms refurbished and 32,406 new desks supplied</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/40" class="indent">4,200 new latrines built.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/41" class="indent">1.7 million children have benefited from the infrastructure programme so far and a further 500 schools will receive infrastructure grants within the next two months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.6/42" class="indent">In Malawi, it is possible to attribute the construction of 602 primary classrooms and 157 teachers' houses to DFID funding in 2007-08. A further 654 primary classrooms and 291 houses are planned for this year. Some 4,000 classrooms have been constructed since 2001.</p>

	<p pid="b.1324W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) expect the countries to which we provide direct support to have plans in place to remove tuition fees. To be successful, and to protect standards, the removal of fees needs to be part of a comprehensive, long-term plan for universal primary enrolment. Support from DFID, in the form of long-term predictable funding, is helping governments, achieve this aim but other donors also need to provide long-term flexible funding to ensure the removal of primary tuition fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.5/2">Many of the countries that DFID prioritises for support have already removed tuition fees or are working towards their removal. The high cost of education is the biggest deterrent to poor families educating their children, particularly for girls. In addition to tuition fees, other direct costs include uniforms and textbooks, teachers' and Parent Teacher Association fees, transportation as well as 'hidden' costs such as lost household and/or paid labour. Such costs have a significant impact on whether and which children are educated.</p>

	<p pid="b.1325W.0/1">Civil Society Organisations have regularly raised this issue and I agree it is important that wage ceilings do not restrict the ability of governments to hire teachers. The Department for International Development welcomes the recent changes agreed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to significantly reduce the use of wage ceilings. If any ceilings are agreed with the government as part of an IMF programme, they will need explicit justification and the need for them will be subject to regular reassessment. The IMF's new approach makes clear that ceilings should allow for full spending of higher aid flows and take measures to safeguard priority sectors, such as education.</p>
