The Government's policy is that pay should reflect local labour market conditions. Key to addressing this is to foster and encourage the development of a strong private sector with well paid jobs in Wales, so the pay arrangements in HMCS should reflect the wider labour market fundamentals for this work force, especially recruitment and retention. But I am aware that our approach needs to ensure careful consideration of all the potential effects of regional pay, to ensure that our pay policy promotes economic growth in regions.</p>

A small number of people whose circumstances we do not know, for instance because they are not on State Pension or other benefits administered by DWP, need to make a claim so that their eligibility can be assessed.

We can only assess eligibility for those people who are in contact with the Department and whose circumstances are known to us.</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.2/1">Following European and wider negotiations, we agreed to introduce new retro-reflective markings requirements for new trucks exceeding 7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW) and new trailers exceeding 3.5 tonnes GVW by <phrase class="date" code="">10 October 2009</phrase>. Implementation will be via our national lighting regulations and no further discussions with European counterparts are planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.2/2">The markings are mainly expected to affect side or rear impact heavy vehicle incidents taking place in the dark and/or in poor visibility, where poor conspicuity would otherwise be a contributory factor. Estimates suggest that if all goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes GVW and their trailers were fitted with these markings 10 fatal, 33 serious and 142 slight accidents per year might be mitigated or prevented; but this is likely to be an over-estimate for Great Britain, where such vehicles already benefit from various conspicuity aids.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.2/3">We estimate that each year an additional 8.9 per cent. of the over 7.5 tonne GVW vehicle parc and their trailers will be fitted with the markings. Assuming all relevant new vehicles registered from October 2009 are so fitted we calculate that by the end of <i> (a)</i> 2009 approximately 2 per cent. of relevant vehicles will be marked, <i> (b)</i> 2010, 11 per cent. and <i> (c)</i> 2011, 20 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.218W.3/3">My Department is providing &pound;75 million in 2007-08 to the Regional Development Agencies' (RDAs) Single Programme, which contributes to delivery of a range of Government policies, including those for business support, enterprise and economic development. RDAs' objectives for the next spending period, including those for business support, will be set out in their corporate plans which will be published in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.218W.3/4">In addition, there are other programmes and activities funded by DEFRA to deliver a range of objectives with businesses, the public sector and consumers. These include axes 1 and 3 of the Rural Development Programme for England (which provide assistance to make agriculture and forestry more competitive and sustainable and to enhance opportunity in rural areas), support on resource efficiency and waste (delivered through a number of bodies including the Carbon Trust, WRAP, Envirowise and NISP), the Agriculture Development Scheme (now closed to new applications) and activities carried out by English Farming and Food Partnerships, Food from Britain, the International Agri-technology Centre and the National Non-Food Crops Centre. Total spending on these programmes and activities in 2007-08 amounts to approximately &pound;228.22 million. However, it is not possible to separate out the business support, promotion of enterprise and economic development elements of this spending without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.218W.3/5">Decisions on the budgets for these programmes for the years 2008-09 to 2010-11 which follow the comprehensive spending review settlement last autumn have not been finalised yet. These are expected before the start of the new financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.219W.8/1">DEFRA does not keep centrally held records of staff who work from home and this information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.8/2">Home working commences because it enables DEFRA to both recruit and maintain a diverse work force. Home working helps staff maintain a work life balance. DEFRA is committed to helping its staff maintain a work life balance and recognises that home working can help to reduce the need to travel to work thereby removing journey time and potentially reducing overall transport congestion and pollution as well as individual stress levels. Therefore, DEFRA believes that home working contributes not just to staff welfare but ultimately to delivery of a high quality service to our customers. DEFRA supports home working and is taking steps to ensure that the necessary tools and technologies are in place to facilitate this as part of its overall policy on flexible working. Home working can include the occasional day or days taken to complete a specific task or address a particular situation and is available to all staff subject to business needs. Alternatively it can be a permanent arrangement with regular home working days appropriate to the individual's situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.8/3">Managers and individuals are encouraged to think creatively about working patterns so that efficient working can most easily be combined with other responsibilities and with employee's interests, responsibilities and personal circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.225W.8/1">A number of key statutory duties are placed upon every local authority in England and Wales by the Environmental Protection Act 1990, as amended:</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.8/2" class="indent">(i) the duty to inspect its area from time to time to detect any statutory nuisances which ought to be dealt with;</p>

	<p pid="a.225W.8/4" class="indent">(iii) the duty to serve an abatement notice where the local authority is satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists or is likely or occur or recur within the area of the authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.8/5">Night noise (11 pm to 7 am) from dwellings and licensed premises can be addressed under the Noise Act 1996, as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. The night noise offence for licensed premises was introduced by section 84 and Schedule 1 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, which came into force in England on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>.

Alternatively, the local authority can prosecute under the Noise Act 1996 or consider issuing an abatement order under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which also allows for immediate confiscation of equipment responsible for the noise.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.8/7">The new permitted level is 34 dB(A) where the underlying level does not exceed 24 dB(A), or 10 dB(A) above the underlying level where this exceeds 24 dB(A). This permitted level applies to both domestic and licensed premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.8/8">The Environmental Noise Directive applies to environmental noise from sources including agglomerations and major airports, roads and rail. The Directive requires member states to produce strategic noise maps and action plans to manage and reduce noise from these sources where necessary. English local authorities will be encouraged to participate in the process of drawing up action plans for agglomerations. Where action plans identify a local authority as responsible for a particular action, the authority is required to treat the action plans as its policy insofar as it relates to that action.</p>

	<p pid="a.232W.2/1">The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has appointed an independent panel to consider the West Midlands regional spatial strategy (RSS) phase 2 revision which sets out planned levels of housing development for the West Midlands. The panel will need to consider and test the proposals set out in the revised draft submission as prepared by the regional planning body as well as any additional evidence relating to this at the examination in public of the RSS phase 2 revision.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.2/2">My noble Friend Baroness Andrews has requested the Government office for the West Midlands to commission work to look at housing options which could deliver higher housing numbers than those set out in the phase 2 revision.

	<p pid="a.232W.2/3">In asking for this additional work to be undertaken, my noble Friend Baroness Andrews, was clear in her letter to the West Midlands regional assembly that she does not wish to fundamentally question the spatial strategy for the region in advance of the public examination. However, she is also concerned that the very rigid applications of some of the principles of the spatial strategy may be unnecessarily constraining longer-term development with implications on affordability of housing. This will also be an issue for the panel to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.2/4">At this stage, it is inappropriate for the Secretary of State to comment on emerging proposals for housing development and the evidence underpinning these in advance of the examination in public as these matters need to be independently tested. Furthermore, as the Secretary of State has a statutory role in the issuing of the final RSS, any comments at this stage on the merits of emerging proposals could prejudice her future decision-making role.</p>

	<p pid="a.238W.2/1">Sections 121-124 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) make a number of changes to the right of collective enfranchisement for tenants of flats under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (the 1993 Act). In particular, the changes would require collective enfranchisement to be carried out by an &quot;RTE company&quot; that is defined under new section 4A.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.2/2">Section 74 of the Finance Act 2003 provides for stamp duty land tax (SDLT) relief for RTE companies exercising collective enfranchisement. The provision is designed to ensure that the members of the RTE company have to fund SDLT at a rate broadly appropriate to their own contribution to the purchase and do not suffer a higher rate of tax because they are acquiring the freehold under a collective arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.2/3">Sections 121-124 of the 2002 Act have not yet been commenced because there appear to be a number of practical difficulties with the provisions which will need further investigation. As such, new section 4A has not been introduced and as a result tenants exercising their right of collective enfranchisement do not yet benefit from the SDLT relief provided for in section 74 of the Finance Act 2003, although this remains the intention once the practical difficulties have been resolved.</p>

	<p pid="a.239W.0/15">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) is due to come into effect in April 2008. The levels of the RTFO are set out in the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (SI 3072). It will be up to transport fuel suppliers to decide how to meet their obligations. Some, for example, may choose to supply more biodiesel than bioethanol, particularly in the early years of the obligation. The Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA) will be reporting regularly on these matters. The Government currently estimate that total biofuel consumption in the UK is likely to be in the region of 1.2 billion litres in 2008, 1.8 billion litres in 2009, and 2.5 billion litres in 2010.</p>

Staff are encouraged to use video conferencing and to consider how they travel to meetings. Bike loans are also available to staff and environmental awareness campaigns are regularly conducted.</p>

	<p pid="a.247W.5/2">The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) runs schemes such as the Mailing Preference Service (MPS) that provide UK consumers with a choice to reduce the amount of unsolicited mail they receive, though the MPS does not cover mailings from overseas companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.5/3">In 2007, the DMA received just over 500 complaints about unsolicited mailings from overseas companies. The majority of these complaints were in relation to perceived scams, which were referred to the Office of Fair Trading for investigation. In such cases, the OFT will investigate and where appropriate will have such mailings stopped.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.5/4">Only 2 per cent. of these complaints were from consumers who had found that the MPS had not stopped an unsolicited approach from an overseas company. Such mailings are not covered by the MPS, as the company and product have no link with the UK. In such cases customers had found themselves on a mailing list as a result of past contact with the company, in which case they are advised to contact the respective company direct to ask for their details to be removed from the mailing list.</p>

A record is only included once in each count, even if a procedure is mentioned in more than one procedure field of the record.  3. Tracheostomy operations: HES uses the following codes to determine between what is known as the creation and a modification tracheostomy operation. <sup>(1)</sup>Creation of tracheostomy: E42.1 Permanent tracheostomy E42.2 Cricothyroidostomy E42.3 Temporary tracheostomy. <sup>(2)</sup>Modification, closure, or other types of operation on a tracheostomy: E42.4 Revision of tracheostomy E42.5 Closure of tracheostomy E42.6 Replacement of tracheostomy tube E42.7 Removal of tracheostomy tube E42.8 Other specified exteriorisation of trachea E42.9 Unspecified exteriorisation of trachea.  4. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  5. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).

In particular, the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 2002 (as amended) require duty holders to prevent, or if this is not reasonably practicable, to adequately control exposure to hazardous substances such as diacetyl.</p>

Personal medical services plus pilots where developed not only to offer the full range of general practice services but also offer the opportunity of piloting the extended role of the general practitioner and deliver more traditional secondary care services in a community setting bringing services closer to patients. This could cover anything from extended minor surgery provision to extra skills such as endoscopy, ophthalmology and dermatology. Piloting ended in 2004 and these are now permanent arrangements that primary care trusts can enter into.</p>

	<p pid="a.272W.2/2">There is no legislative procedure relating to the maintenance, or otherwise, of a violent patient register. Therefore, as there is no mandatory register there can be no specific legal right of appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.272W.2/3">However, primary medical care contractors can immediately remove patients from their list on the grounds of violence if the patient has committed an act of violence or behaved in such a way that made someone fear for their safety, and the incident has been reported to the police. Where a patient is removed from a primary medical service contractor patient list, on these grounds, the contractor is required to note in the patient's medical records that they have been removed and the circumstances leading to their removal. A patient removed from the list of a primary medical services contractor has no right of appeal. Each primary care trust is required to have a scheme in place to ensure that where patients are removed from a practice's registered list for violent behaviour that such patients can still access a general practitioner so they can receive the care they need.</p>

	<p pid="a.273W.2/1">The Government recently published a cross-Government strategy on obesity &quot;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives&quot; and supporting healthy growth and development of children is one of the key elements of this strategy. A copy of the strategy is available in the Library. A &pound;75 million, three-year marketing programme has been announced in this strategy, which will inform, support and empower parents in making changes to their children's diet and levels of physical activity. The programme will particularly focus on the early years including: maternal nutrition, encouraging breastfeeding and supporting healthy weaning and healthy diets in young children.</p>
	<p pid="a.273W.2/2">In addition, through the Healthy Start Scheme, the Department provides advice on healthy eating and vouchers to low-income families with children under the age of four years, that can be exchanged for milk, fresh fruit, vegetables or infant formula. A range of key publications are also made available to mothers which includes advice on healthy eating, breastfeeding, weaning and &quot;Feeding your Toddler&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.275W.0/2">Regarding prostate cancer, the national health service prostate cancer programme was published in 2000 with a commitment to improve the early detection of prostate cancer; improve treatment and care for patients with prostate cancer; and to enhance research into prostate cancer in the United Kingdom. Specific initiatives have included the Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme, reducing waiting times, raising public awareness, improving treatment, and improving information for prostate cancer patients.

	<p pid="a.276W.5/1">&quot;The Cancer Reform Strategy&quot;, published in December 2007, noted that as we place a new emphasis on the quality of experience reported by people with cancer, including prostate cancer, it will be important that we are able to measure progress, tracking improvements in the qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of cancer care. That is why the strategy stated that a new national health service cancer patient experience survey programme will be established and surveys conducted annually. To take this forward an expert group, including patients, will be convened to design the technical specifications. A national contract will then be let for the collection, management and analysis of cancer patient experience surveys. The development of the programme is in the early stages, and announcements will be made in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.276W.5/2">In addition, the strategy noted that detailed consideration needs to be given to the services needed by survivors of cancer. The National Cancer Director will lead a new National Cancer Survivorship Initiative to take this forward in partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support and other cancer charities. The initiative will consider a range of approaches to survivorship care and how these can best be tailored to meet individual patients' needs.</p>

An evaluation of the PCRMP was funded by the Department to help inform the future direction of the programme and the PCRMP information pack is currently being reviewed. A consultation will be published in the spring, with the intention of launching the revised PCRMP packs in the summer of 2008.

	<p pid="a.282W.2/1">The UK Government are assisting the Cameroon Government's response through a contribution to the United Nations (UN). The UN has recently released $4.72 million for the delivery of emergency relief to the refugees. This has come from the UN's Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF), to which the UK is the largest donor. The UK's share of the contribution in this response is approximately 20 per cent., giving a UK contribution of &pound;462,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.282W.2/2">The contribution helped support the World Food Programme (WFP) with the provision of high energy biscuits (HEB) in the first few days of the crisis, and with the ongoing provision of cereals, pulses and vegetable oil to the refugees still remaining in northern Cameroon. These number approximately 15,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.282W.2/3">The contribution is also being used by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to address the immediate nutritional needs of refugee children suffering from acute malnutrition.</p>
	<p pid="a.282W.2/4">The UK contribution is also being used by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the provision of shelter for refugees, both at the immediate crossing point from Chad, and at a more secure and appropriate site to which the refugees are being transferred, some 30 km away from the border.</p>

Local authorities have until 2010 to complete the final phase of the roll out of their children's centre programmes. All local authorities have been given indicative numbers of centres required to reach the remaining children under five in their areas and will be supported by our deliver partner, Together for Children, in planning their remaining centres. Children's centres provide a range of services depending on local need. They do not offer a set number of places but it is expected that on average a children's centre will serve a community with about 800 children under five years old. Centres in the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged areas offer child care to some children in their area. Information is not held centrally about the number of child care places in each centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.310W.5/2">There is no statutory age of consent for cosmetic piercing (cosmetic body piercing and ear piercing). Cosmetic piercing of a minor is lawful provided valid consent is given. A minor is able to give valid consent if he or she is capable of understanding the nature and consequences of the act to be done. Furthermore, the courts have held that a parent's right to decide on behalf of his or her child yields to the child's valid consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.5/3">Cosmetic body piercing for sexual gratification is unlawful. Children under the age of 16 are not able to consent lawfully to a piercing that would be regarded as indecent assault. Genital or nipple piercing performed on someone under the age of 16 might be regarded as indecent assault under sexual offences legislation, depending on the facts of the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.5/4">Guidance on issues relating to the age of consent for cosmetic piercing is contained in the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) Local Authority Circular (LAC) 76/2: &quot;Enforcement of skin piercing activities&quot;. This guidance recommends that businesses are advised to adopt reasonable age restrictions and involve parents where appropriate. The guidance is available on the HSE website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.5/1">In order to implement their power-sharing agreement, Kenya's leaders are committed to a number of important new mechanisms. These include both transitional constitutional arrangements, such as the office of Prime Minister, and others such as a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, a Commission of Enquiry on Post Election Violence and an independent Review Committee on the 2007 elections. The international community, including the UK, strongly supports the terms of the agreement as the basis on which Kenya can return to the path of prosperity, democracy, and stability. We are committed to lending our support to the development of robust mechanisms to deliver reconciliation and reform.</p>

	<p pid="a.335W.8/2">International monitoring of the forthcoming Zimbabwean elections will play a key role in determining whether they meet international norms and standards, including the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, and the Southern African Development Community principles and guidelines concerning elections, to which Zimbabwe is a signatory. The Government of Zimbabwe has stated that organisations may only observe the elections by invitation. A number of organisations, including the Southern African Development Community governments, have been invited to send observation teams. Regrettably, invitations have not been extended to a number of countries and a range of major democratic institutions, including the EU. We are concerned that this will constrain the ability of the international community to assess the conduct and outcome of the elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.352W.5/1">There is no single definition of a vice-related offence, but there are a number of offences which, in some cases, relate to vice.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.5/2">The Home Office collects statistics on notifiable offences recorded by the police. These offences fall into two categories&mdash;those which are indictable or triable either way, and some closely related summary offences. Table 1 gives the numbers of three of the former offences (trafficking for sexual exploitation, exploitation of prostitution and soliciting of women by men) during the last three years in Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.5/3">Other offences, such as kerb crawling, brothel keeping and offences by prostitutes, do not feature in the recorded crime statistics because they are summary offences. However, the Office for Criminal Justice Reform collects information in the court proceedings database which shows the numbers of people proceeded against at magistrates courts, found guilty at all courts and cautioned for a range of sexual offences. This information for Essex is given in Table 2.</p>

At local level, the security of an airport, and the related costs, are for the airport operator, police and other security stakeholders to decide based on the threats and risks at that particular airport. The Home Office has therefore not directly spent any money on airport security at Liverpool John Lennon Airport since 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.365W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-11">11 March 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question pursuant to the Answer of 4th March 2008, Official Report, columns 2315-9W, on foreign workers, what the most recent estimate is of non-UK born persons in employment as a percentage of all in employment in (a) each county of the UK and (b) the UK as a whole in each of the last five years. (193479)</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on migrant workers for local areas from the Annual Labour Force Survey and the Annual Population Survey (APS). The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women) and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.5/5" class="indent">APS estimates at this detailed level are only available consistent with population estimates published in February and March 2003 and are not comparable with the estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-13">13 February 2008</phrase>, which are based on latest population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.5/6" class="indent">The table attached, shows the percentage of persons of working age in employment, who were not born in the UK for each UK county, Unitary Authority and Metropolitan County and the UK, during the twelve month periods ending in March for 2005, 2006, 2007 from the APS and, for the 12 month periods ending in February for 2003 and 2004 from the Annual LFS.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.5/7" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important to bear in mind that the APS/LFS are not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.5/8" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.369W.8/4" class="indent">The retail prices index (RPI) is an average measure of change in the prices of goods and services bought for the purpose of consumption by the vast majority of households in the UK. There are no plans to introduce an index to represent the specific spending patterns of pensioners. It is recognized that very few individuals will conform to an average profile, as used in the RPI and it is for this reason that ONS has produced a personal inflation calculator, based on the RPI. It allows individuals to input their own spending on the main categories of good and services, and then it reassembles the RPI price indices using these expenditure patterns. This gives an indication of an individual's personal inflation rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.373W.12/1">The cost to the public purse is not kept centrally. Costs have been met by individual local authorities in respect of coroners who have conducted inquests. Other costs have been met by the Ministry of Defence in respect of support provided to families and where as an Interested Person it has engaged legal representation, and by the Legal Services Commission in respect of representation of bereaved families at inquests. Central Government funding has also been provided since June 2006 to the Oxfordshire and Wiltshire and Swindon coroners, because of the singular burden in these jurisdictions in consequence of the decision to repatriate overseas military fatalities via RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and, since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, via RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire. The total costs authorised in relation to legally aided representation for families at inquests into military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan are around &pound;100,000 since <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-19">19 March 2003</phrase>. To date, &pound;385,112 has been spent by central Government in Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Between 2003 and 2007, the costs incurred by the Ministry of Defence on its own legal representation amounted &pound;1,160,281.66. This figure includes external legal advice on inquest-related matters, as well as costs for representation at inquests. This is normally when potentially complex issues could arise and MOD Counsel could assist the Court in the relevant questioning of witnesses to elicit a clear and full understanding as possible of what took place. The costs incurred by the Ministry of Defence on support to bereaved families are not kept centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.374W.5/1">No. All those located in open conditions have been risk assessed and categorised as being of low risk to the public. Time spent in open prisons affords prisoners the opportunity to find work, re-establish family ties, reintegrate into the community and ensure housing needs are met. For long-term prisoners, these are essential components for successful resettlement and an important factor in protecting the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.374W.5/2">The number of absconds is at its lowest level since centralised reporting of this type of incident began in 1995. Since then, the number of absconds has fallen steadily across most years. In the last two years, the number of absconds recorded has been just over half the levels recorded in 1997.</p>

	<p pid="a.379W.5/1">The Government's priorities for increasing the skills and employment outcomes of offenders are outlined in the document 'Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment: Next Steps' published in December 2006 and 'Prison Policy Update' in January 2008. It emphasises the need to make many prisons places of work and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.5/2">We have recently launched our plans to increase the range of constructive work available to offenders inside prison, and in turn their job opportunities in the community. Through the Reducing Re-offending Corporate Alliance over 100 employers are working with us to improve the employment and employability of offenders. We are seeking to engage private, public and voluntary organisations in providing a range of constructive work activities through prison workshops and industries. The Prison's Minister is to host a forum shortly to seek to expand this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.5/3">There are more than 700 employers working with the Prison Service open and resettlement estate providing work experience and training to offenders as they near release.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.5/4">The number of workshops and training centres in existing prisons obviously depends on the size, design and original purpose of the establishment. Training and/or work facilities are a key part of new designs of prisons for appropriate categories of prisoners. Some prisons, for example Category C prisons, are dedicated as whole prisons to training, work and rehabilitation.</p>

	<p pid="a.379W.8/1">Prisoners may be denied association for contravening prison rules, to prevent bullying or other threats to good order and discipline in the prison or for medical reasons or as a result of specific intelligence or requests from the police or courts to keep prisoners apart. Prisoners at risk of attack may at their own request be held without association while an alternative location is found for them. Those prisoners on the basic level of the incentives and earned privilege scheme may also be denied association.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.8/2">Those committing less serious breaches of discipline may be held without association as an alternative to being held in the segregation unit. Prisoners at risk of attack from other prisoners may be held on normal location, with limited or no association, if dedicated units for these prisoners are full. The duty governor has overall responsibility for decisions on the allocation of prisoners. I am satisfied that these arrangements are working despite the increased prisoner population.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.11/1">The Integrated Domestic Abuse Programme (IDAP) has already been implemented. All probation areas in England and Wales are equipped to deliver either IDAP or the Community Domestic Violence Programme. IDAP is normally delivered at the rate of one session a week, but three probation areas are piloting a more intense pattern of delivery. Whether we promote this intensive method, will depend on the outcome of the evaluation, which is expected shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.382W.0/2">To date, long-term work force planning has been conducted in a limited manner within the probation service and has largely been undertaken in concert with the annual intake on to the Diploma in Probation Studies (DiPS), which is led by NOMS probation area co-ordination unit. Responsibility for all other recruitment and work force planning rests with each of the individual probation areas. With the forthcoming cessation of the DiPS and the development and implementation of its replacement, the process by which work force planning will be conducted nationally and locally, is currently being reviewed in order to align it to future arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.384W.5/1">The Government have just completed its consultation on the new Strategic Plan for Reducing Re-offending 2008-11. The plan will be published in the late spring and will effectively link cross government partners to the delivery of objectives to reduce re-offending and protect the public. The consultation period ensured that the Government gathered the views of our partners at a national, regional and local level on how we can best build on our successes to date, such as the roll out of offender management for those offenders who pose the greatest risk of harm to the public, and working with Local Strategic Partnerships in negotiations around Local Area Agreements, both actions contained in the Five Year Strategy for Protecting the Public and Reducing Re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.5/2">In terms of the two specific recommendations highlighted:</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.5/3" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Intermittent custody: following trials of intermittent custody at HMP Kirkham and HMP Motion Hall from January 2004 to November 2006, the Government decided to make no further use of the sentence for the time being.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.5/4" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Community prisons: the current strategy for the prison estate was outlined in &quot;Penal Policy&mdash;a background paper&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May 2007</phrase>. In her &quot;Review of Women with Particular Vulnerabilities in the Criminal Justice System&quot; Baroness Corston recommended that existing women's prisons should be replaced with suitable, geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. Such centres have aspects in common with a community prison concept. A small project is presently under way as part of the Government's response to the report of Baroness Corston looking at the merits of a pilot unit to test how a small, multi-functional, custodial centre for women might work.</p>

Ministry of Justice analysts are currently developing the knowledge-base concerning the costs of re-offending and how this varies by the persistence and frequency of re-offending and the type of offences committed.</p>
