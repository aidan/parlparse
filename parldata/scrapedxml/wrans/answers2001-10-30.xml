	<p pid=".563W.3/1">Before 1975, and currently, pensions were awarded to Service personnel who completed at least 22 years' reckonable service (or 16 years' reckonable service in the case of officers). Gratuities were awarded to those who did not qualify for a pension but had completed 12 years' reckonable service (or nine years in the case of officers).</p>
	<p pid=".563W.3/2">It has been the long-standing policy of successive Governments that changes to improve benefits from public service pension schemes should normally be implemented from a current date for future service only.</p>
	<p pid=".563W.3/3">In the case of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme, in order to calculate the precise cost of awarding pension rights retrospectively, my Department would have to identify and assess the potential entitlements of all service men who left service before April 1975 without completing enough service to qualify for a pension. There are probably several hundred thousand if not more than a million former service men in this category. An accurate estimate could, therefore, be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".563W.3/4">None the less, we can be clear that the cost of awarding pensions retrospectively would be considerable. In addition, such a retrospection could not be applied solely to former service men, and would require a change for all public service pension schemes.</p>

The Ministry of Defence has established a Veterans' Affairs Secretariat and I have chaired two meetings of the Veterans' Forum comprising the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations (COBSEO) executive committee members, and officials from Government Departments with an interest in veterans' affairs.

The Plenary programme included a presentation from the DTLR's National Housing Federation which gave veterans advice on how to get the most out of the &quot;Supporting People&quot; initiative currently being taken forward by local government. The Veterans' Forum has fully endorsed the Strategic Action Plan to take forward the Veterans' Initiative and I will now present the plan to my ministerial colleagues at the Veterans' Task Force on <phrase class="date" code="">6 November</phrase>.</p>

Regrettably, a British Army Officer, Major Vanessa Lang, sustained head injuries in the crash, and subsequently died of her injuries in hospital in Kenema. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I extend our deep condolences to Major Lang's family.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/2">Major Lang was working from the British Military Headquarters in Freetown as a media adviser to the Sierra Leone armed forces. She was travelling in the helicopter to provide advice to the Sierra Leone Army on their information strategy in relation to a planned border security operation. The other five occupants of the helicopter included a British Non-Commissioned Officer and an Australian Major: none received serious injuries in the accident. British accident investigators are assisting the Government of Sierra Leone in the investigation into the precise cause of the accident.</p>

	<p pid=".571W.15/1">The decision to put Railtrack into administration will have no immediate implications for the planned improvements to the east coast main line (ECML). The development studies for the ECML upgrade are being jointly carried out and funded by the Strategic Rail Authority and Railtrack. This will continue unchanged until the end of this financial year. The review of the upgrade objectives is a continuous process as part of the project's development. Decisions on planned improvements will be subject to the outcome of these reviews regardless of whether or not Railtrack is in administration.</p>

	<p pid=".579W.7/2">In addition to the physical challenges of distributing food to distant villages on poor roads, obstacles include: a lack of hauliers willing to undertake the work; local NGO staff unable to show up for work to oversee secondary distribution; limited communication with local staff; and the fact that case load lists are becoming outdated due to further population displacement. The fear of harassment and looting of supplies by some elements of the Taliban is further compounding an already difficult situation.</p>

WFP is looking into all options for delivering food, including opening up new land routes from the north, as well as air operations, to support the people of Afghanistan in the coming weeks and months. We have already allocated &pound;3 million to WFP for its response to the Afghan crisis.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/2">The Government strongly support Enterprise Insight, a 10-year private sector-led national campaign for enterprise. The campaign is led jointly by the British Chambers of Commerce, Confederation of British Industry and Institute of Directors in partnership with enterprise programme providers including Young Enterprise, Shell LiveWIRE and the Prince's Trust. Its aim is to promote enterprise by fostering an entrepreneurial spirit across the UK through four key initiatives: Enterprising Education, Enterprising Communities, Enterprising Media and Enterprising Business.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/3">The first step started with the launch of the Enterprising Education campaign in July 2001. Since its launch, 246 businesses have registered their interest in promoting enterprise within schools. A further 750 are expected to do so by 2002. The aim over the next two years is to get 40,000 more young people engaged in enterprise learning in schools and 5,000 new business people to support its delivery. This will be achieved through a number of activities including roadshows and the development of a website enabling businesses to register their interest online. In addition, the Entrepreneurs in Residence scheme, which matches businesses to local enterprise projects, is under way and the first five matches have already been made.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/4">Enterprise Insight also aims to promote enterprise positively across society and, in particular, plans to work with the media, using case studies and role models, to help spread knowledge about entrepreneurship and business.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.5/1">Demand for gas is dependent on a number of factors, including energy prices, GDP growth and the impact of other measures such as the Climate Change Programme. Future demand levels are therefore uncertain and, consequently, the extent to which the UK will need to import gas from Norway or elsewhere cannot be accurately predicted. Against that background, current best estimates are that the UK is likely to become a net importer from around 2005&ndash;06 with the possibility of 90 per cent. of the UK's gas being imported by 2020.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/2">Figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate show that Norway has about 2,100bcm of remaining discovered gas resources in the North Sea and expects to be able to produce at least 90bcm of gas a year until 2050. The extent to which those resources might be available to meet further UK demand will depend on a number of variable factors, including movements in gas and oil prices, which may affect the anticipated level of production; any growth in Norway's domestic demand for gas; competition for Norway's gas from other purchasers in Europe and elsewhere; and the availability of capacity in infrastructure linking Norwegian supplies to the UK. Although there will be a point at which Norwegian gas will be unable to meet further UK demand, it is difficult to give a meaningful estimate of when that might be.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/3">I am, however, fully aware of the need to secure longer term security of supply from a range of sources and this is one of the issues under consideration as part of the Performance and Innovation Unit's current review of energy policy.</p>

	<p pid=".589W.2/3">The CMRC reports show that there has been a fall of almost 7.5 per cent. in the percentage of payments that are reported as being late by the businesses that they survey. This fall relates to the period between their first survey and their most recent published survey, ie the quarter ending June 1998 and the quarter ending June 2001. During the same period their reports show that the number of debtor days for small businesses has fallen by almost 24 per cent. and that the mean number of debtor days for all businesses has fallen by almost 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.2/4">Finally, the &quot;European Business Survey&quot; for 2001, produced by the accountants Grant Thornton, shows the UK as having a payment period almost a week (five days) shorter than the EU average (52 days).</p>

The banking industry will meet the costs of providing post office access to their own accounts. The cost of the POCA, which will be met by Government, together with a fixed contribution from the financial institutions, is subject to commercial negotiations between Consignia and the Paying Departments and between Consignia and the potential supplier of the banking engine for POCA. The estimate of costs are confidential under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, because they are subject to commercial negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.0/1">DEFRA is funding a great deal of work in relation to BSE in sheep. This includes experiments to assess susceptibility, infectivity and possible transmission in sheep, particularly in relation to different genotypes and breeds. This work will underpin the national scrapie plan.</p>
	<p pid=".592W.0/2">At their meeting in September 2001, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee reviewed the latest data from the current programme of strain typing work to assess whether BSE is present in the current sheep flock. To date, about 180 individual scrapie brains have been inoculated into mice. Results for 163 brains have reached a point where the mice might have been expected to display signs characteristic of BSE, if the disease was present. This has not happened. However, it is too soon to draw firm conclusions from these on-going experiments. Work is also in hand to develop molecular methods of differentiating BSE from scrapie to enable many more brains to be screened rapidly.</p>
	<p pid=".592W.0/3">During the development of a molecular method at Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA), 460 sheep brains have been screened. None has indicated the presence of BSE, but the test is not yet fully validated and it is therefore too early to draw firm conclusions.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.3/1">The England rural development programme already allocates funding for conversion to organic farming, which would triple the organic area by 2006. We intend to produce a strategy for the future direction of organic farming when we have the report of the Commission on the Future of Farming and Food, taking account of any recommendations it makes for this sector. The strategy will assess potential growth both for UK production and for the organic market, and will need to take account of the large variation between different products. It is likely, for example, that UK production of organic fruit and vegetables can take a significantly higher share of the market for these products, while the scope for increasing organic milk production will be much more limited given the relatively slow growth of this market.</p>

Until August 2000, the Edmonton incinerator mixed bottom ash and precipitator ash. From August 1998 to May 1999, this mixed ash was reprocessed and used in the production of concrete building blocks. This ash has also been used as an aggregate.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.5/2">As the reply to the first of these two questions said, neither the Department nor the Environment Agency routinely held information on the dioxin content of ash from incinerators. However, in July 1998 the Environment Agency was given an estimate of the dioxin content of the mixed ash, based on a 1997 analysis of the fly ash. I was not advised about this when I replied to the second of these questions and regret any consequent inaccuracy in my answer. I have written to both Members and have placed a copy of the letter and the analysis in the fax in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.5/3">The Environment Agency is currently carrying out a full and thorough investigation into the destination of ash from incinerators, the environmental implications of its use and what steps may be needed in the light of these findings. This thorough investigation will establish the true picture for all municipal waste incinerators. Its results will be made public and any necessary action will be taken.</p>

	<p pid=".601W.11/1">Any future Afghan government must be broad-based and representative of the great diversity of the country's ethnic groupings. The form of that government and the process leading to its establishment must be up to the Afghan people themselves. However, the international community has to engage with the widest possible range of community leaders within Afghanistan, which would include women's organisations. We would expect any future government to respect the internationally agreed norms of behaviour towards its own citizens.</p>

We believe that it is important to tackle the potential threat from weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles as their means of delivery with a comprehensive strategy that includes arms control and counter-proliferation, diplomacy, deterrence and defensive measures. We will continue to work closely with the United States in all these areas. We understand the role that missile defence can play as one element of that comprehensive strategy, but as yet we have had no specific proposal from the United States.</p>

We also support practical measures to address the inter-connected problems of human rights and internal conflict. Earlier this month, I visited Colombia to discuss these and other issues with Colombian Government representatives, the Human Rights Ombudsman, members of non-governmental organisations, trade unions, peace activists, and representatives of the media and UK business community. In addition, I believe that more concerted international action needs to be taken to tackle the problems of illegal small arms, precursor chemicals and money laundering by the Colombian illegal armed groups. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will host a series of meetings in London later this year and early next year on these themes in order to look at ways we can further assist the peace process, and reduce the ability of extremist groups to use violence for political ends.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.0/1">Records for prosecutions for incitement of racial hatred under part III of the Public Order Act 1986 have been kept since 1988. The records relate to the year that the application for consent to prosecute was dealt with and so it is not possible to state with any certainty how many prosecutions resulted in convictions in any given year. The number of applications for consent to prosecute for each year since 1988, the number of prosecutions arising and the convictions obtained are summarised in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.0/2">Also, figures published in the Crown Prosecution Service Racist Incident Monitoring Annual Report 1999&ndash;2000 show that the number of racist incidents sent for prosecution rose from 1,603 in 1998&ndash;99 to 2,417 in 1999&ndash;2000. Prosecutions were brought against 1,832 defendants (76 per cent.) on 2,651 charges. Guilty pleas were tendered on 66 per cent. of the charges and there were convictions after trial on another 12 per cent. of the charges. In total 2,078 (79 per cent.) of the 2,651 charges prosecuted resulted in convictions.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.0/3">Almost half the prosecutions prosecuted were new offences of racially aggravated crime brought under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which came into force in September 1999. A high proportion of the remaining offences contained admissible evidence of racial aggravation and were prosecuted under other legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".617W.3/1">In the light of evidence that some asylum applicants are falsely posing as nationals from countries with high grants rates of asylum or exceptional leave, we have decided to undertake a language analysis pilot at the start of November 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.3/2">The purpose of language analysis is to provide expert evidence which helps to identify the place of origin of asylum seekers. Language analysis is used in a number of European countries and the results are generally successful. We will be piloting the scheme to see how well language analysis works in the United Kingdom, and for the purposes of the pilot we will be covering asylum seekers of three nationalities where we believe the problem of false nationality claims to be most pronounced. Those nationalities are Afghanistan, Somalia and Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.3/3">The authorisation made by my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Rooker will enable staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, where there are objective reasons for doubting the nationality of a person claiming to be from one of these three countries, to request them to undertake a further interview which will be taped and sent to a language expert for analysis. Individuals may refuse to consent to this further interview, but this refusal can be taken into account when determining whether the applicant has established the facts of their case. This may lead to their claim being refused.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.3/4">We will review the need for this authorisation once the pilot has been completed. In addition, the race monitor to be appointed under section 19E of the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) will report to Parliament via the Secretary of State on the likely effect of authorisations made by Ministers and on how they are operated in practice by officials.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.9/1">ILAs were an innovative initiative that put learning power in the hands of the individual. The system was designed to make the learning process as simple and straightforward as possible, cutting down on bureaucracy, in order that the individual could access learning opportunities in an easy, user-friendly way.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.9/2">We have undertaken audits and inspections in cases where we received complaints that learning providers were misusing ILAs or provided poor value for money. We introduced a revised learner provider agreement that made it harder for providers to act against the ethos of the programme. We also made changes to the applications process, for the same purpose. It is our careful monitoring of the scheme that has enabled us to take prompt action to safeguard public funds.</p>

Individual Learning Account holders have reported many of these instances to us and to Trading Standards Officers, as have other learning providers who did not want to see an innovative, progressive and successful initiative being exploited.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.11/1">In July of this year, the Department started to receive increasing numbers of complaints from individuals and local Trading Standards Officers. In response the Department took action to tighten up the ILA system to address these problems. We re-registered all learning providers, withdrew blank application forms, suspended all new provider registrations, introduced a revised learning provider agreement that made it harder for providers to act against the ethos of the programme, and made changes to the applications process, for the same purpose. Everyone who opened an ILA received a copy of 'Choosing Your Learning', explaining the full range of options in using their ILA. However, it became clear that these changes were not sufficient by themselves to prevent the mis-selling of ILAs. At that point we decided we had no option other than to withdraw the programme.</p>

Current guidance to School Organisation Committees (which decide proposals and on which the local education authority is represented) will be revised to ensure that proposals from promoters of new faith schools are given the same consideration as other proposals for new schools. Guidance on the factors to be considered in deciding whether there is a need for a new school more generally is given in the Guidance on Statutory Proposals which will be updated as necessary. We will also issue guidance to local education authorities about the new arrangements for inviting proposals when they consider that a new secondary school is required that is not to replace existing provision.

	<p pid=".623W.8/1">There is no rule on the permitted level of surplus places. The focus of all our policies is raising educational standards. In planning school provision, local education authorities should look for opportunities for removing surplus capacity, with a view to bringing supply and demand for school places into better balance. Their initial focus should be on those schools with 25 per cent. or more of their places unfilled, having particular regard to standards at those schools. The overall aim should be to maximise parental preference and to provide good quality education in the most cost-effective way. The Department's annual survey of surplus places allows us to monitor how local education authorities are meeting this challenge.</p>

	<p pid=".632W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from John Kidgell to Mr. Charles Hendry, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-30">30 October 2001</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question on local area estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head (10789). I am replying in his absence.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) does not produce estimates of GDP per head for the geographical breakdown requested. Instead, estimates are produced by Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (NUTS) areas. There are five levels of NUTS in the UK and GDP estimates are produced for the first three. NUTS level 3 is the geography that is most closely aligned to county councils, unitary authority and metropolitan areas and is also the lowest geographical level that data are available.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/5" class="indent">GDP is a workplace measure of economic activity in a given area regardless of whether the persons engaged in the activity live in that area. GDP per head is calculated by using the resident population in the area. In the absence of another indicator this has been used as a measure of well being at the sub-regional and local area level. However, a better measure would be household income per head as this would be a truly residence based measure. This is not currently available but the ONS is planning to produce estimates of household disposable income for sub-region and local area in early 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.2/6" class="indent">Estimates of GDP per head and GDP per head as a proportion of the NUTS level 3 area with the highest GDP per head (Inner London-West) are shown in the following table. The GDP per head for Inner London - West is much larger than any other area due to the high amount of commerce in the area and a fairly small resident population in comparison, which makes proportionate comparisons on this basis more difficult. For this reason, I have additionally provided a third column, showing the same data on our more usual basis of comparison, GDP per head expressed as a ratio to the UK average. Some NUTS level 3 areas correspond exactly to county council boundaries and these are marked with the letters cc.</p>

	<p pid=".637W.5/4" class="indent">In answer to the first question, extensive consultation was carried out among government departments, public authorities and private sector organisations on the needs and requirements for information to be collected from the 2001 Census. The purposes for which information from each census question is required were set out in the Government's White paper <i>The 2001 Census of Population</i> (Cm 4253), published in March 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.5/5" class="indent">The Government needs information that must be authoritative, accurate and comparable for all parts of the country in order to form policy, to plan services for specific groups of people and, in particular, to distribute resources effectively to local and health authorities to enable them to direct resources to where they are needed.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.5/6" class="indent">Those Government Departments that primarily depend on census information for the purposes of the distribution of public funds include the Departments for Health; Work and Pensions; Education and Skills; Transport, Local Government and the Regions; the Home Office; and the National Assembly for Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.5/7" class="indent">Extensive use is also made of census information by each local government authority and health authority in the distribution of funds and resources at the more local area level.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.5/8" class="indent">With regard to the second question, the extent and nature of any under-enumeration in the 2001 Census will be more accurately assessed than in any previous census by the extensive, separate, follow-up Census Coverage Survey carried out by interviewing around 300,000 households shortly after the Census enumeration was completed.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.5/9" class="indent">Once the interview responses and all the Census returns have been analysed, we will have a definitive picture of how well we have done at both the national and local authority area level. Information from the Census Coverage Survey will thus enable the extent of any under-coverage to be assessed and the characteristics of the population missed in the Census to be estimated. This information will be used to supplement the counts from the Census itself to provide a more complete base of the population for statistical purposes.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.0/1">Article 9 of the Council Decision, of <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-29">29 September 2000</phrase>, on the system of the European Communities' own resources replaces Article 10 of the Decision of <phrase class="date" code="1994-10-28">28 October 1994</phrase>. Like the Article it replaces, this simply allows the European Commission to undertake a review of their own resources system and to put forward proposals for modifying the system if necessary. What modifications the European Commission will choose to consider at the time is, of course, a matter for them. However, it will remain the case that any proposals for modifying the system of own resources which they decide to put forward would then have to be considered, and agreed, by all member states unanimously.</p>

	<p pid=".644W.2/2">Where an overpayment has arisen as a result of a claimant's misrepresentation or failure to disclose a change of circumstances, section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 allows recovery of that overpayment. This covers most of the overpayments we seek to recover. However, there are also other regulations permitting recovery of overpayments, for example, where means-tested benefits are overpaid due to the late payment of income or other benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.2/3">The Department's policy is to obtain recovery of the sum overpaid as quickly as possible, and by the most cost-effective method, without causing hardship.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.2/4">Where the person overpaid receives benefit, deductions can be made from future payments of that benefit. The Social Security (Payments on Account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1998 place restrictions on those deductions, including limits on the amount which can be deducted from certain benefits. The regulations allow higher rates of recovery to be made in cases of fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.3/1">The Government believe that all those who are unable to work, for whatever reason, should have the opportunity to play as full a part in the community as possible. In &quot;Towards Inclusion&quot;, our response to the Disability Rights Task Force, we set out proposals for improving disabled people's lives&mdash;whether or not they can work&mdash;in areas including education, transport, health and social services. Taken together, these measures will create a much fairer and inclusive society for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.3/2">From April 2001, we introduced a package of changes, providing extra help for disabled people in greatest need. For severely disabled people who cannot work and are receiving Income Support, the Disability Income Guarantee ensures an income of at least &pound;142 a week for a single person aged 25 or over and &pound;186.80 for a couple. It also benefits families on low incomes who are caring for a severely disabled child. In addition, from last April, we increased the disabled child premium in income- related benefits to &pound;30 a week&mdash;substantially more than the normal uprating.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.3/3">Sick or disabled young people who have never been able to work and pay National Insurance contributions will in future be able to receive a higher level of support from access to Incapacity Benefit. Those aged under 20 on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-06">6 April 2001</phrase> and receiving Severe Disablement Allowance will transfer to the long-term rate of Incapacity Benefit from April 2002, providing an increase of &pound;27.60 a week at current rates.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.3/4">We are also introducing changes to the Vaccine Damage Payments Act 1979, by means of a Regulatory Reform Order, to extend significantly the time limit for making a claim, and to reduce the level of disability necessary for a claim to succeed. Those severely disabled people whose claims were previously disallowed for being over the current time limit and under the disability threshold will be able to make a fresh claim.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.3/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-28">28 February 2001</phrase> my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced that a National Service Framework would be developed for long-term conditions, and that this would have a particular focus on the needs of people disabled by neurological disease and brain and spinal injuries.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.3/6">Last year, the Government announced a package of measures to enhance the current social security provision for carers, worth more than &pound;500 million over a three-year period. From April 2001, we increased the carer premium in the income-related benefits by &pound;10 a week above the normal uprating. We also helped those carers who can undertake some work, by increasing the earnings limit in Invalid Care Allowance from &pound;50 to &pound;72 a week: in future the carers' earnings limit will be increased in line with the lower earnings level for National Insurance contributions. We plan to amend the law, by means of a Regulatory Reform Order, to allow people aged 65 and over to claim Invalid Care Allowance, and to extend entitlement for up to eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.3/7">For those who may have difficulties with child care, the Government have already introduced a new child care tax credit in Working Families Tax Credit, and will continue to help working families meet the costs of child care.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.3/8">The Government are committed to providing an accessible public transport system in which disabled people will have the same opportunities to travel as everyone else. Accessibility regulations for new trains, buses and coaches have been introduced under Part V of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Similar regulations for taxis are planned. The 10-Year Transport Plan introduced a new commitment to ensuring that access for disabled people is a condition of all new public investment in transport.</p>

	<p pid=".647W.6/1">We are implementing a range of measures to improve recruitment and retention in the National Health Service for all staff, including in London. Examples include investing in fair pay, encouraging the NHS to become a better employer, increasing training commissions for all professional groups, providing additional funding to support those undertaking a return to practice programme, and supporting more effective, collaborative international recruitment where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.6/2">For example, between April 2001 and the end of September 2001, 138 mental health and learning disabilities nurses returned to the NHS, 18 of these were in London.</p>

	<p pid=".647W.6/4">Included in the WAT programme of work was a key area group looking at recruitment and retention issues. The Group made some 23 recommendations for action which the mental health care group workforce team, working in conjunction with the human resources directorate of the Department and the relevant professional bodies, will be considering as part of an implementation plan to take forward the work of the WAT.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.6/5">In conjunction with this work, the National Director of Mental Health has set up a specific working group to look at ways of improving recruitment and retention of psychiatrists.

	<p pid=".648W.0/1">In the financial year 2000&ndash;01, the Department spent &pound;573,000 on the mind out for mental health campaign. &pound;900,000 is allocated to the campaign in the year 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.0/2">The mind out for mental health campaign is a sustained programme of activity with partners in the voluntary sector, the media and business working together to change attitudes and behaviour surrounding mental health. Through such partnerships (both on a national and local level), and through high profile communications and events, mind out for mental health is reaching out to key audiences. For example, mind out for mental health is working with UK Youth, the Guides and the Scouts to develop an activity pack to help groups explore mental health issues. It is also working with journalist colleges in the development of training seminars and packs for student journalists. In addition, a stop the stigma information pack has been developed for individuals or local groups&mdash;a step by step guide to planning effective action to help change attitudes towards those with mental health problems. A copy of this action pack has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.0/3">&quot;Working Minds&quot; is the employer programme of mind out for mental health. This part of the campaign works in partnership with employers to create positive shifts in workplace attitudes and behaviour surrounding mental health. Its objectives are far greater than helping people with mental health problems to find employment; the programme seeks to bring about a fundamental, long-term change in employers' policy and practice so that people with mental health problems are able to participate fully in the workplace. Its success will be measured against this objective.</p>

There is, however, marked variation in use with some authorities being more proactive.

We are committed to raising awareness of domestic violence and its impact on children. We have done this through commissioning resources such as the Making an Impact&mdash;Children and Domestic Violence Training Pack, which helps front-line staff to deal effectively with families where domestic violence is occurring.

	<p pid=".650W.5/2">The information requested is given in the tables.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.5/3">A proportion of patients who have waited over 18 and 24 months are awaiting tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures. This is because the National Health Service has been advised only to carry out these procedures (when routine) using single-use supply instruments, due to the theoretical risk of contracting vCJD. There are now sufficient supplies of these instruments; therefore, patients awaiting these procedures should not be waiting as long in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.5/4">Two NHS trusts were responsible for the number of patients waiting over 24 months during the quarters ending March and June 2001. Appropriate corrective action is in place to ensure these patients are treated.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.5/5">We are determined to reduce waiting times through implementing shorter maximum waiting times. By the end of March 2002, the maximum in-patient waiting time will be 15 months and the maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment will be six months.</p>

	<p pid=".655W.9/1">The latest figures on delayed discharges for each health authority and National Health Service trust are shown in the table. The decision on which councils should receive extra help was taken on the basis of the councils with the highest rate of delayed discharge and also councils, which the Department has identified as needing extra help through our performance monitoring arrangements. Newcastle city and North Tyneside borough social services did not meet these criteria.</p>
