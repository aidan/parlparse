In the final version of the House of Commons Resource Accounts (HC 1423) the equivalent figure fell to &#163;55 million owing to later accounting adjustments. The amount paid in total salaries to staff in the House of Commons plus PICT for the financial year 2010-11 was &#163;64 million. PICT is a joint department of both Houses and the equivalent net cost to the House of Commons is &#163;62 million after taking account of the House of Lords contribution.</p>

	<p pid="a.836W.0/7">&#8220;efficiencies that release financial resources whilst maintaining outputs and output quality, thereby enabling the resources that are released to be diverted to other services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/8">Savings are recorded as the total amount claimed excluding VAT rounded to the nearest whole pound. Cashable savings are reported as 'in year' savings (the pro rata saving enabled during the financial year in which the initiative was delivered) and 'full year effect' savings (the initiatives impact on the following financial year)</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/9" class="italic">Cost pressures</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/10">Cost pressures are recorded against MoJ categories of spend and are forecast for the 2011-12 financial year. These pressures are reported across Procurement Major Contracts, Category Management, ICT Procurement and Transport and Logistics. Cost pressures are recorded against the following 'types&#8217; of pressure;</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/11">Inflation</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/12">Change in legislation/Policy</p>

	<p pid="a.836W.0/15" class="italic">Cost avoidance savings</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/16">Cost avoidance savings enabled by MoJ Procurement are calculated by comparing projected spend with counterfactual spend whereby a saving results when spend is lower than it would have been otherwise had the cost avoidance exercise had not been undertaken. Counterfactual spend is based on a 'do nothing' approach ie if the MoJ did nothing then spend would rise in line with inflation. Cost avoidance, if enabled, will be recorded against relevant forecasted cost pressures. Non-cashable savings are not recorded unless they are to negate a recorded cost pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/17">The <i>net savings effect</i> is provided for MoJ as a whole and by MoJ Corporate, NOMS and HMCTS business groups. The net savings effect = enabled savings + remaining forecast savings - forecast annual cost pressure + enabled cost avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/18"><i>(b)</i> The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) does not hold centrally information regarding the methodology used by NDPBs to estimate savings to the public purse made in respect of its procurement and purchasing. This information can be obtained only at a disproportionate cost to the Department, by requesting this information from every NDPB.</p>

Onshore gas exploration has a long history in the UK and the technologies employed&#8212;including hydraulic fracturing (fracking)&#8212;are well understood. Fracking is already subject to the same regulatory and environmental requirements as any other onshore drilling activity and I therefore have no current plans to introduce regulatory guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.6/1">Trafficking is by its nature a hidden crime and therefore it is difficult to get a full picture of the numbers involved. Entry to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) is voluntary so we cannot force those we suspect of being victims to participate against their will. But we are committed to bringing as many victims as possible into the NRM. To do this we continue to raise awareness of trafficking with frontline partners such as the police, local authorities and health service and have recently increased the number of voluntary sector partners who are able to make direct referrals into the NRM. Working in partnership with the UK Border Agency's audit team and the Strategic Monitoring Group, who are responsible for overseeing the functioning of the NRM, we are also enhancing the way we identify victims of trafficking from those who are referred to us. Details of the steps we are taking can be found in the Government's Human Trafficking Strategy, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-19">19 July 2011</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="a.854W.2/4">Looking at the impact of tax credit changes in 2011-12 would only show a partial effect as it is only in 2012-13 that they are fully implemented. Also, presenting analyses of tax, tax credit and benefit changes further into the future may not be representative of the impact of Government policy.

	<p pid="a.861W.8/1">It is not possible to provide an answer to the question in the format requested as HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) do not allocate on this basis. Overall funding for HMRC's compliance activity cannot be broken down in this way as its activity - from policy making, through support and education, to audits and investigations - covers all aspects of compliance behaviour from error through to evasion as well as countering criminal attacks and avoidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.862W.0/1">There is no option to extend VAT relief on fuel to charities that carry out other charitable activities. EU VAT agreements, entered into by successive Governments, do not allow the UK, or any other Member State, to unilaterally extend the scope of existing zero rates, or introduce new ones. However, the Government gives very generous support through tax reliefs to the charitable sector. These reliefs allow charities to purchase medicines, medical equipment and certain other specialised equipment, and charities which provide rescue or assistance at sea to purchase fuel, VAT-free.</p>

Making work experience and internships available to young people from all walks of life is a key element of this. I am pleased that the Government are leading by example in Whitehall with a new internship programme for under-represented groups. The new Whitehall Internship Scheme has been developed in response to a pledge in the coalition agreement which states that the Government will provide internships in every Whitehall Department for under-represented groups, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities. Government Departments began their participation in the scheme over the summer, with the Cabinet Office committed to offering 20 places by the end of the financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.865W.5/4">The figures requested come from the Annual Population Survey (APS) household dataset. The latest data currently available is for 2009. The table shows estimates for Sunderland and the North East. Further information can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.868W.3/2">As of <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-01">1 July 2011</phrase> the Prime Minister's office and Deputy Prime Minister's office had no individuals undertaking unpaid work experience or any unpaid interns, or individuals in unpaid positions in either office. However, there were 16 individuals on paid placements within the entire Cabinet Office, including the Prime Minister's and Deputy Prime Minister's offices, on either apprenticeships or graduate internships.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.3/3">The Social Mobility Strategy published in April.2011 clearly states that we want to ensure that everyone has a fair opportunity to fulfil their potential. Making work experience and internships available to young people from all walks of life is a key element of this. I am pleased that the Government are leading by example in Whitehall with a new internship programme for under-represented groups. The new Whitehall Internship Scheme has been developed in response to a pledge in the coalition agreement which states that the Government will provide internships in every Whitehall Department for under-represented groups, including black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Government Departments began their participation in the scheme over the summer, with the Cabinet Office committed to offering 20 places by the end of the financial year.</p>

The KPCS imposes strict requirements on its members to enable them to certify that shipments of rough diamonds are &#8216;conflict-free&#8217;. Since the launch of the KPCS, &#8216;conflict diamonds&#8217; now represent less than 1% of the global trade in rough diamonds, compared to 15% in the 1990s.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.8/1">The Government are greatly concerned by the allegations of serious human rights abuses in some parts of Ethiopia's Somali regional state. We receive frequent reports of human rights abuses by both Government security forces and the Ogaden National Liberation Front. We have on many occasions called on the Ethiopian Government to allow a credible and independent investigation, both in private conversations and in public, such as during the British Government's statement at the last UN Universal Periodic Review of Ethiopia's human rights. One option that we would support would be an investigation under the auspices of the UN. Our requests, however, have consistently been rejected.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.8/2">With regard to access, of the nine zones in the Somali region, five are subject to varying access restrictions (Gode, Degaxbur, Warder, Korahe and Fik). UK officials travel frequently to these zones, and I visited as well in July, although permission is needed for most travel, even in the less conflict-affected areas, and is sometimes problematic.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.8/3">The Government are also extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Somali region, where some 1.5 million drought-affected people need assistance. Access by humanitarian agencies is very limited due to a combination of security threats to aid workers and restrictions imposed by the Somali Regional Government. We have urged the Ethiopian Government to increase access to allow greater provision of humanitarian assistance.</p>

We receive frequent reports of human rights abuses by both Government security forces and the Ogaden National Liberation Front. We have on many occasions called on the Ethiopian Government to allow a credible and independent investigation, both in private conversations and in public, such as during the British Government's statement at the last UN Universal Periodic Review of Ethiopia's human rights.

The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), as part of its programme to promote sexual and reproductive health in The Gambia, works hard on this issue, alongside a range of non-governmental organisations and civil society organisations such as the Gambia Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children (GAMCOTRAP). The EU also works closely with and supports GAMCOTRAP, as does our high commission in Banjul.

	<p pid="a.879W.6/1">Careful consideration has been given to the cost to schools', local authorities and other organisations involved in the conversion of schools to academy status. Costs to local authorities will vary depending on the complexities of local arrangements and are, for example, associated with their responsibilities to conduct the TUPE consultation, land transfer and where relevant agreeing a Commercial Transfer Agreement. We have sought to minimise costs by making the process simple and straightforward. This includes producing model documentation, such as leases. Each conversion is also assigned a dedicated Project Lead who will aim to hold early discussions with the local authorities and the schools involved to agree an approach in order to make the conversion process as efficient and cost-effective as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.902W.5/2">Since the beginning of the academy programme, there has been a principle that academies should be funded on the same basis as maintained schools in their local area. In addition to their school budget share, Academies are paid a Local Authority Central Spend Equivalent Grant (LACSEG) to cover the costs of those services that were previously provided without charge by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.902W.5/3">Tables have been placed in the House of Libraries which detail the amount of LACSEG paid out in academic years 2005/06 to 2010/11 and the amount of LACSEG recouped from each local authority since the inception of recoupment in 2008 to <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-31">31 August 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.902W.5/4">The two sets of figures are not comparable. Only funding for LACSEG within the Schools Budget is recouped from DSG. The bulk of LACSEG relates to local authorities' non-schools education budget. Up to and including 2010-11 none of this funding was recovered from local authorities. In 2011-12, &#163;148 million was topsliced from the local government settlement. The level of the reduction to local government funding relating to local authority LACSEG in 2011-12 and 2012-13 has recently been subject to a consultation. The Government are considering the responses to that consultation and the outcome will be announced shortly.</p>

The purpose of the directive is to ensure the protection of temporary agency workers by applying the principles of equal treatment so that after a qualifying period, they enjoy the same terms and conditions as teachers who have been recruited directly by schools and local authorities. The Department's guidance will help teachers, employers and agencies to implement the regulations so that present levels of flexibility are still available for supply teachers and employers.</p>

	<p pid="a.906W.2/2">&#8220;the Government would give due consideration to the UNCRC articles when making new policy and legislation&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/3">and that:</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/4">&#8220;in doing so, we would always consider the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's recommendations but recognise that, like other state signatories, the UK Government and the UN committee may at times disagree on what compliance with certain articles entails&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/5">This year marks the half-way point between the UN Committee's Concluding Observations from 2008 and our next reporting due in 2014. The UK Children's Commissioners are due to publish an independent report later this year which will provide an assessment of the UK's progress. The Government will want to consider their conclusions and plan next steps in light of that report.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/6">Each of the UK jurisdictions is approaching implementation of the UNCRC in a way which reflects its own local circumstances and priorities. In England, the detailed review of the Children's Commissioner's remit and functions marked significant progress. By accepting the review recommendations, the Government have signalled that they intend to strengthen the role of the Children's Commissioner to promote the rights of children and young people in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/7">There are no plans to incorporate UNCRC into domestic legislation. In general the UK Government does not incorporate treaties and international conventions directly into UK law. There is no requirement in the UNCRC that it be incorporated into a single piece of legislation. Our approach to deliver the UNCRC outcomes is through a mixture of legislative and policy initiatives. The analysis published by Government in March 2010, in response to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights of <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November 2009</phrase> demonstrated how existing legislation underpins implementation of the UNCRC in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/8">The Welsh Assembly Government has taken the step of introducing a duty on its Ministers to have due regard to the UNCRC. I will be taking a very close interest in how this develops. However, the UK Government's priority is to raise awareness of the UNCRC and introduce practical measures to promote and protect children's rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/9">It is not possible to provide accurate information on the proportion of the public spending allocated either directly or indirectly to children. This is due to a number of factors, including the devolved nature of decision-making on spending priorities and differing ways in which budgets are allocated. However, the Department for Education's planned expenditure on children and schools is &#163;56.1 billion in 2011-12 compared to expenditure of &#163;45.9 billion in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/10">No assessment has been made of the level of knowledge of UNCRC among children, parents, child care and education professionals. The Department's website publishes information about UNCRC principles and provisions. To support awareness-raising among children, the UNICEF Rights Respecting Schools Award is a way in which schools can demonstrate, through self evaluation and external assessment, that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) is embedded in their ethos and curriculum. &#163;500,000 was provided by Government over three years to March 2010 to UNICEF to support the rollout of the Award.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/11">Learning about rights and responsibilities currently features within the National Curriculum as part of the Programme of Study for citizenship. The Department for Education is undertaking a review of the National Curriculum in England. The purpose of this review is to reform the National Curriculum and restore its original purpose so that it sets out only the essential knowledge, concepts and processes that children should be expected to acquire in key subjects during the course of their school career. This reduction in prescription will free up teachers to use their professionalism to design and plan lessons that inspire their pupils, and also give schools much greater scope to innovate in how they teach about important topics such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.2/12">It is not anticipated that compulsory education on the principles and provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will form part of either the initial training or continuous professional development for early education and child care professionals. However, candidates undertaking training and assessment in order to attain Early Years Professional Status are required to demonstrate that they have a sound working knowledge and understanding of current legal requirements, national policies and guidance on health and safety, safeguarding and promoting the well being of children.</p>

	<p pid="a.909W.2/1">The shared accommodation rate limits the level of financial help available from housing benefit rather than deciding what type of property a person can live in.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.2/2">The one bedroom shared accommodation rate is based on the rents of one bedroom properties, excluding anything self contained but including all other one room lettings. While the level at which it is set will be influenced by the rents of bedsits, the rents of studio flats would have no influence as they are self-contained.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.2/3">However, this does not mean that all self-contained accommodation will be unaffordable. Some cheaper self-contained studios or bedsits may have rents that are at or below the shared accommodation rate, and others may be affordable if the claimant is able to make up any shortfall from other sources of income.</p>

	<p pid="a.910W.5/1">Jobcentre Plus does not publish information on the number of people placed into employment by each Jobcentre Plus office, nor does it publish information on the number of people placed into a job by each Jobcentre Plus office which they hold for more than <i>(a)</i> six months and <i>(b)</i> one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.5/2">The main measure of labour market performance is the rate at which people leave jobseeker's allowance, income support and employment and support allowance and move into employment. The measure supports the Department for Work and Pensions 2011-15 Business Plan and the coalition Government's structural reform priorities. Jobcentre Plus reports on monthly progress against this measure across all levels of the business. The data will be published at both a national and Jobcentre Plus district level early next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.5/3">The measure of people moving into work is assessed using employment data from HMRC. This provides useful trend information but is not a complete picture of all employments, and is not robust at a local level. For the very large numbers of Jobcentre Plus claimants, it is not cost-effective to measure the number of people each Jobcentre places into employment, nor what happens to them after they have been successful in finding work. Jobcentre managers therefore focus on maximising off-flow rates from benefit, and also receive supporting information about potential destinations from benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.5/19">The Government recognise the pressures that those on fixed incomes such as pensioners face when prices increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/20">We have restored the earnings link for the basic state pension and given a &#8220;triple guarantee&#8221; so that the basic state pension will increase by the highest of the growth in average earnings, price increases (as measured by the consumer prices index) or 2.5%. The restoration of the earnings link and the triple guarantee will benefit both existing and future pensioners by providing a more generous state pension, giving a solid financial foundation from the state, which is essential as part of the pensions system. We also have a long-term commitment to uprating the standard minimum guarantee aspect of pension credit at least in line with earnings.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.5/23">1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS).

	<p pid="a.918W.5/25">3. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/26">4. Figures have been presented on an after housing cost basis. For after housing costs, housing costs are deducted from income.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/27">5. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/28">6. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/29">7. Numbers of pensioners have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/30">8. Proportions of pensioners in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.5/31">9. Changes between periods are calculated based on unrounded figures and then rounded to the nearest 100,000. Therefore they may differ from the difference between the rounded figures.</p>

From April 2011 incapacity benefit recipients will begin also to undertake this assessment. The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement to IB or ESA.

Finished consultant episode (FCE): FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. 2. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. ICD-10 codes for asthma are as follows: J45.0 Predominantly allergic asthma J45.1 Nonallergic asthma J45.8 Mixed asthma J45.9 Asthma, unspecified J46.X Status asthmaticus 3. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. 4. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. 5. In-patients: In-patients are patients who are admitted to hospital and occupy a bed, including both admissions where an overnight stay is planned and day cases. <i>Source</i>: Hospital Episode Statistics.

In October 2006 there was a re-organisation of PCTs and the existing PCTs in Suffolk were amalgamated into one, Suffolk PCT. 2. The asthma register covers patients with asthma excluding patients with asthma who have been prescribed no asthma-related drugs in the previous 12 months. 3. QOF was introduced as part of the new general medical services (GMS) contract on 1 April 2004. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most personal medical services (PMS) practices also taking part. 4. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national information technology system developed by NHS Connecting for Health. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. 5. QMAS captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists. 6. Patients will only contribute to the figures in QOF if they are registered with a general practice participating in QOF. Not all practices participate in QOF and some participate in only some parts (especially PMS practices, which are paid under different arrangements for providing services which are part of QOF for GMS practices). Most indicators in QOF have rules that allow for patients to be excluded (e.g. patient refuses treatment) and so the denominator for a given indicator may be less than the number of patients on the register for that disease. It should be noted that some indicators have age limits and so exclude some patients on the register. <i>Source:</i> QOF, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

Information on NHS dentistry in the community dental service, in hospitals and in prisons are excluded. 3. The data in this report are based on NHS dentists on PCT lists. These details were passed on to the BSA who paid dentists based on activity undertaken. A dentist can provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or has agreed with the PCT. In some cases an NHS dentist may appear on a PCT list but not perform any NHS work in that period. Most NHS dentists do some private work. The data does not take into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by dentists. 4. Figures for the numbers of dentists al specified dates may vary depending on the date the figures are compiled. This is because the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA) may be notified of joiners or leavers to or from the GDS or PDS up to several months, or more, after the move has taken place. 5. SHA and PCT data include all dentists practising in that area. Some dentists may have an open GDS or PDS contract in more than one PCT or SHA and therefore they have been counted more than once. The total number of dentists given for England does not include duplication. 6. The boundaries used are as at 31 March 2006. <i>Sources:</i> 1. The Information Centre for health and social care. 2.

The public sector too will be playing its part and in July of this year, the Cabinet Secretary announced a Civil Service Physical Activity Challenge to encourage all civil service organisations to promote physical activity through the workplace.</p>

TPR has already written to the largest companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.5/11">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is working closely with TPR to develop an integrated programme of communications for employers explaining the reforms through a variety of media including national press, business websites and online.</p>

	<p pid="a.949W.2/2">The Department is in regular contact with the enforcement authorities, package travel organisers and their representative organisations and consumer representatives.

	<p pid="a.949W.2/3">The Department has no plans to amend the relevant regulations. We expect the European Commission to propose changes to the European directive which these regulations implement in the course of next year.

However, the Department has commissioned a number of research projects, collectively known as the &#8220;Biofuels Modes research&#8221; to investigate the potential supply and use of biofuels in the UK out to 2020 and 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.2/7">This Biofuels Modes research is considering the availability of biofuel feedstock supply from UK, EU and non-EU imports and will be published later this year. Further details on this work are available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.953W.9/2">The operation protocol set out the conditions which have to exist for a senior HA official to consider whether the Dartford Crossing charge can be suspended on a case by case basis. The conditions are that there has been or is likely to be an emergency situation, where continuous queues, travelling at less than 10 mph, extend back&#8212;or have the potential to extend back&#8212;to the junctions 4 or 28 of the M25 or beyond, and where the suspension of the charge would ease the congestion and assist in managing the emergency situation.

	<p pid="a.959W.2/6">In respect of the unplanned outages at Milford Haven, the failures have been traced back to a root cause of excess moisture in the power and equipment space and remedial work has been undertaken to rectify this.

The services would be connected to two separate data centres housed away from the local operations rooms, and as such any local power or server failure would only affect the local operator's ability to connect to the resources and other operators around the UK would be able to maintain operational communications within the area(s) affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.964W.6/1">Figures for the number of vehicles which have failed their MOT tests solely because of issues with the vehicle registration plate are not available. However, in 2009-10, the latest year for which figures are available, 135,809 cars, light vans and motorbikes failed an MOT due to an issue with the registration plate or VIN number. These vehicles could have also failed the MOT for additional reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/2">A vehicle can fail an MOT due to the registration plate being missing; insecure; faded, dirty, deteriorated or obscured to the point that it is not easily legible to a person standing 20 metres from the vehicle; or the letters and figures being incorrectly spaced, of unequal width over the whole length, or likely to be misread.</p>
