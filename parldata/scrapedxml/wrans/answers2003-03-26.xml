	<p pid=".215W.7/1">On the most recent figures I have available, in Wales we have paid &pound;197 million under the respiratory disease scheme and &pound;83 million under the Vibration White Finger Scheme, with full and final payments having been made to 13,762 and 8,632 claimants respectively. In Bridgend over &pound;1.5 million has been paid out in respiratory disease payments and over &pound;760,000 has been paid to Vibration White Finger claimants.</p>

The Government intends to keep up the pressure to get justice for our miners, their widows and their families, and I will continue to make every effort as part of this process. The Welsh Sub Group has seen the major stakeholders in the process working together in a highly constructive way, identifying real improvements to the system which have speeded up payments to miners in Wales and across the UK. It has also provided a model for similar groups across the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".217W.12/1">There is no Armed Forces Act 1955. The Army and Air Force Acts of that year and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 have a finite life, and Parliament considers their renewal every five years in the form of an Armed Forces Bill. This is also the main vehicle for amending the 1955 and 1957 Acts. The Armed Forces Act was last renewed in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".217W.12/2">All the procedures covered by the Service Acts are kept under review and it is envisaged that any proposals for further change that may be considered necessary would be included in the Armed Forces Bill due for introduction in the 2005&ndash;06 session. We intend to introduce legislation to bring the three separate Acts together into one tri-Service Act, but whether it will be possible to include this in the 2005&ndash;06 Bill will depend on the availability of parliamentary time.</p>

	<p pid=".222W.12/2">The Government is committed to ensuring all sectors are responsive to consumer needs, getting rid of unnecessary regulations that inhibit innovation. The Enterprise Act will strengthen the role of the competition authorities in tackling markets that do not work well for consumers and business. The OFT report provided a useful analysis of the market impact of the current control of entry regulations on consumers and competition and highlights the need for the present regime governing pharmacies to be updated. We have already taken steps to open up the pharmacy market by allowing for mail order and internet pharmacies. At the same time, the Government wants to see an increased role for community pharmacists in providing services to NHS patients and we are currently developing a new contractual framework to make that happen.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.12/3">The Government needs to take into account wider policy objectives in responding to the OFT report. It argues for abolition of entry controls on the grounds that there would be consequent benefits for consumers in terms of reduced prices, improved quality of services and better access. We strongly support these objectives. We want to improve access and choice (including improving out-of-hours access for NHS patients) so that more NHS patients can use the skills of community pharmacists, who are trained clinicians, for advice, information and services. The OFT report also noted that in a more competitive environment problems could arise through the possible effect of deregulation on the ability of patients in some areas to access high quality pharmacy services, and that these problems could be addressed through targeted measures. It was not in the OFT's remit to examine how mechanisms such as the Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme could be developed to address a more competitive environment, and we therefore propose to examine these issues further before reaching a final decision on a balanced package which most effectively promotes competition, new entry and increased choice alongside our wider social and health objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.12/4">We therefore favour change to open up the market and improve quality and access without diminishing the crucial role that pharmacies play, especially in poorer and rural areas. The Government intends to come forward with proposals before the summer recess and will publish a progress report at the end of June. All changes will then be the subject of a full consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.12/5">The OFT report raises particular issues for the devolved administrations and they are making their own announcements today regarding their responses to the OFT recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.12/6">The OFT's work on this area has taken forward our understanding of the impact on quality, innovation and consumer choice of the existing entry controls. Their regulatory challenge function is an important one. We look forward to receiving further reports on markets where regulation may be distorting competition.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.12/7">As part of our work moving forward we will consider the impact of any changes on all sectors of the pharmacy market, including small businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".224W.7/1">At present precise data demonstrating a yearly percentage of batteries recycled in the UK is unavailable, although it is estimated that approximately 90 per cent. of automotive batteries, 25 per cent. of nickel cadmium industrial batteries, 90 per cent.of lead acid industrial batteries and less than 1 per cent. of household batteries are recycled.</p>
	<p pid=".224W.7/2">There is data available on the tonnages on batteries collected for recycling by local authorities, as reported in the Department's Annual Municipal Waste Management Survey (MWMS). However, the percentage of batteries recycled cannot be measured, as the tonnages of disposed batteries are unknown.</p>
	<p pid=".224W.7/3">It should be noted that MWMS has only reported on batteries that surveyed Local Authorities collect for recycling, and it is known that there is a considerable amount of private recycling undertaken, especially car batteries, that is not recorded.</p>

	<p pid=".228W.6/1">We shall be advertising in the press from today to seek applications from people willing to serve on the new Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM), which will be responsible for delivering recommendations to UK Government and the devolved administrations on the best means of managing the UK's radioactive wastes over the longer term under the &quot;Managing Radioactive Waste Safely&quot; programme. CoRWM's terms of reference have been finalised and are as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/2" class="italic">Terms of Reference for the Members of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM)</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/3" class="italic">Objectives</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/4">1. CoRWM is appointed jointly by Ministers of the UK Government and devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, to oversee a review of options for managing solid radioactive waste in the UK and to recommend the option, or combination of options, that can provide a long-term solution, providing protection for people and the environment. This follows the announcement by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to the UK Parliament, and by devolved administrations, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-29">29 July 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/5">2. CoRWM must ensure that this review of options is carried out in an open, transparent and inclusive manner. The process of review must engage members of the UK public, and provide them with the opportunity to express their views. Other key stakeholder groups with interests in radioactive waste management, must also be provided with opportunity to participate. The objective of CoRWM's programme is to arrive at recommendations which can inspire public confidence and are practicable in securing the long-term safety of the UK's radioactive wastes. It must therefore listen to what people say during the course of its work, and address the concerns that they raise.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/6">3. CoRWM will have a corporate responsibility to deliver its recommendations to sponsoring Ministers in accordance with agreed work plans. It must aim to supply recommendations to them no later than the end of 2005, and sooner if possible. It will be for Ministers, with appropriate reference to their respective Parliaments and Assemblies to decide future policy for the long-term management of the UK's solid radioactive waste and to make arrangements for its implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/7" class="italic">Committee characteristics</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/8">4. Size of the Committee. CoRWM will consist of a Chair, and 12 Members which will include a Deputy Chair.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/9">5. Composition of the Committee. CoRWM will include people with a range of expertise: people with a perspective of environmental, health, social or ethical issues, as well as people with technical experience and expertise in radioactive waste matters. Ministers hope to find these skills and perspectives: radioactive waste, nuclear materials and how they can be managed; regulation of UK processes that give rise to radioactive waste; public engagement, consensus building and resolving conflict on contentious issues; applying ethical principles to scientific and technical decision-making; national and international environmental law; scientific and technical issues such as earth science, materials and their properties, and civil engineering; radiation protection principles and their implementation; radionuclides and how they affect the environment; environmental, health and safety issues and how they interact and conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/10">6. All members will need to be effective team workers, with good analytical skills and good judgment besides a strong interest in the process of decision-making on difficult issues. A number of them will need experience of managing complex projects, drawing on public and stakeholder group involvement and discussion, excellent drafting and communication skills, or business experience and knowledge of economics.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/11">7. The Chair, in addition, will be capable of successfully and objectively leading committee-based projects, grasping complex technical issues, managing a diverse organisation effectively and delivering substantial results, presenting progress and outcomes in public, a person with appropriate stature and credibility.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/12">8. Access to other sources of expertise. CoRWM itself will have to decide how best to secure access to other appropriate sources of expert input during the course of its work. Within this, it will have the option of setting up expert sub-groups containing both Members of CoRWM itself and other appropriate co-opted persons. A member of CoRWM will chair any sub-group of this nature and ensure its effective operation, as well as provide a clear line of responsibility and accountability to the main Committee, and hence to Ministers. This approach will enable them to draw on a broad range of expertise in the UK and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/13">9. The number of such sub-groups will be kept to the minimum necessary. Their role will be that of providing advice for the main Committee to consider and assess as it sees fit, and managing any activity which CoRWM delegates to them. It will be for the main Committee to assess and decide upon the advice it receives from such sub-groups. CoRWM may also utilise other appropriate means of securing expert input, such as sponsored meetings and seminars. The Chair will ensure that sub-group work and all other activities are closely integrated with the Committee and with one another.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/14">10. Length of appointment. Initial appointments will be for three years. Sponsoring Ministers retain the right to terminate appointments at any time in light of individual members' performance appraisal, changes in CoRWM's work requirements, or completion of the work required of CoRWM.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/15" class="italic">Programme of work</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/16">11. CoRWM's objective is to recommend to Ministers the best option, or combination of options for managing the UK's solid radioactive waste that can provide a long-term solution, providing protection for people and the environment. The UK's waste inventory contains, or will contain, a wide range of high and low activity, short and long lived wastes. CoRWM's priority task is to recommend what should be done with the wastes for which no long-term management strategy currently exists&mdash;that is, high and intermediate level waste now in storage or likely to arise over the next century or two, and some low level waste unsuitable for disposal at Drigg. However, for some of these wastes, the Nirex &quot;Letter of Comfort&quot; system has provided a framework which has enabled helpful progress to be made on conditioning and packaging. (Ministers have other sources of advice on other wastes for which a long term management strategy already exists but where there may be long or shorter term issues needing attention. CoRWM may wish to offer advice on these issues but this should not divert it from its priority task set out above.)</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/17">12. CoRWM will take a strategic approach to the review and assessment of options for the long term management of radioactive waste. It will start by gathering information and familiarising itself with the issues, including meetings and presentations as appropriate. The outline framework within which CoRWM is then expected to complete its work is:</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/18" class="indent">(i) setting the framework for the review through identification, on the basis of sounding public and stakeholder views, of:</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/19" class="indent">the inventory of materials to be covered (this will include not only the materials currently classified as waste liable to arise over the next century or so but also materials which may have to be managed as waste during that period, such as some plutonium and uranium as well as certain quantities of spent nuclear fuel);</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/20" class="indent">the options for the long-term management of the various waste materials; and</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/21" class="indent">the criteria against which each of the options being carried forward to the main assessment are to be assessed. (These criteria are likely to be wide-ranging, reflecting among other things, the potential risks involved, concerns been expressed by the public and stakeholders, and practicability of implementing each option.)</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/22" class="indent">CoRWM should take the earliest possible opportunity to identify those options which have no realistic prospect of being implemented within the reasonably foreseeable future, so that the main effort during the assessment stage can be focused on those which are practicable.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/23" class="indent">(ii) implementation of the review. This will involve evaluation of each of the remaining options, for each of the wastes concerned, against the agreed set of criteria. The assessment will take account of existing information and any new research that CoRWM judges necessary. An initial assessment report will be produced by CoRWM and subjected to appropriate soundings of public and stakeholder group views. A final version will then be produced taking due account of the views expressed.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/24" class="indent">(iii) formulation of recommendations. The final assessment report will be used to formulate Committee recommendations to its sponsoring Ministers. We also anticipate that, during the course of its work, CoRWM will have acquired views relevant to subsequent stages of the policy programme. For example, the assessment of options will not consider potential radioactive waste sites; but it will raise sitting issues&mdash;including whether local communities should have a veto or be encouraged to volunteer, and whether they should be offered incentives. CoRWM will need to consider these issues, and may want to make recommendations to Ministers on them.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/25" class="indentitalic">Formulation and agreement of work programme</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/26">13. CoRWM will prepare a detailed draft work programme, within this outline framework, that will enable it to deliver its recommendation to Ministers within the required timescales. The programme will include any proposed sub-groups or other activities or events that are likely to involve significant time and effort by the Committee. CoRWM will send this draft work programme to its sponsoring Ministers for discussion and agreement at an appropriate early stage of its work. Such discussion may lead to appropriate adjustment and refinement. In considering this programme, CoRWM and sponsoring departments and Ministers will be able to take account of the parallel work with Government in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/27">14. In familiarising itself with the relevant background and issues, CoRWM will make itself aware of the UK Radioactive Waste Inventory and the nature of current and expected future UK holdings of plutonium, uranium and spent nuclear fuel. It will take account of existing technical assessments and research into radioactive waste management, and reports arising out of the Defra and devolved administrations public consultation on radioactive waste. It will work closely with Nirex and other organisations with relevant experience and expertise. CoRWM is also recommended to meet and take presentations from appropriate key-player organisations and to visit a selection of key UK and, possibly, other European nuclear sites. It will also take a account of other relevant policy developments, including the UK energy review. In particular, it is recognised that CoRWM will need to engage with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and it's predecessor, the Liabilities Management Unit, given that the former's output will directly impinge on the long-term responsibilities of the NDA.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/28">15. CoRWM is recommended to aim to complete its first phase (familiarisation work and proposals for the waste inventory, the waste management options, and the criteria to be used in their assessment) after about a year from the date of its appointment. It is thereafter recommended to aim for completion and reporting of the assessment work itself (the second phase) after about a further year. Provision of recommendations to sponsoring Ministers would follow as soon as possible after that.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/29">16. CoRWM should indicate the timing proposed for its work in the draft work programme sent for discussion with sponsoring Ministers. The intent is that CoRWM's recommendations should be delivered around the end of 2005. If the Chair anticipates that CoRWM will be late in completing any current phase or overall delivery of its work programme, he or she should inform the sponsoring Ministers as soon as possible, together with an indication of whether and how the committee can catch up during any subsequent phases of its programme. CoRWM will agree with Ministers how to proceed so as to be able to carry its programme forward.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/30" class="italic">Public engagement</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/31">17. CoRWM must inspire public confidence in the way in which it works, in order to secure such confidence in its eventual recommendations. Hence, its work should be characterised by:</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/32" class="indent">a transparency policy;</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/33" class="indent">an active programme of public and relevant stake holder group debate, using innovative appropriate techniques to ensure public involvement and support;</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/34" class="indent">encouraging people to ask questions or make their views known, listening to their concerns, ensuring that they are addressed and that people get a response;</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/35" class="indent">public meetings and other consultative processes, well advertised in advance and involving a variety of interested stakeholders including members of the public;</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/36" class="indent">holding a significant number of its own meetings in public;</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/37" class="indent">clear communications including the use of plain English;</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/38" class="indent">making information accessible to as many people as possible, including use of the internet, as well as ways of reaching people who do not use the internet; and</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/39" class="indent">providing opportunities for people to challenge information, for example by giving them access to alternative sources of information and points of view.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/40" class="italic">Chair</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/41">18. The Chair will be responsible for supervising the work of CoRWM and ensuring that its objectives are achieved. He or she will be the main point of contact with the public and the media, in presenting progress and answering questions. The Chair will meet Ministers on appointment, and then six-monthly to report progress. Notes of these meetings will be published. The Chair will provide an annual written report to Ministers, by <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, which he/she may be required to present to Parliament or Assembly representatives as appropriate. The report will set out, among other things, CoRWM's work programme, progress made, and costs incurred. Ministers will also appoint a Deputy Chair who can assist the Chair as the latter sees fit.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/42" class="italic">Members</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/43">19. Members will work, under the Chair's supervision, to the programme agreed with sponsoring Ministers so as to ensure its satisfactory delivery. Members will have a collective responsibility to ensure achievement of CoRWM's overall mission. It is not envisaged that Committee Members themselves will be responsible for day-to-day work activities but rather in deciding what these should be, overseeing their delivery, and reviewing and being responsible for the reports and other output delivered under CoRWM's name. Individual Members may be appointed by the Chair to undertake specific, active roles, for example chairing sub-groups or in representing CoRWM in meetings with the public, organisations who are contributing to the work, or the media. All Members will be subject to individual performance appraisal as laid down by the Cabinet Office guide (see next paragraph).</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/44" class="italic">Standards</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/45">20. CoRWM is set up by, and answerable to Ministers and is funded by the taxpayer. It must therefore comply with the Cabinet Office guide &quot;Non-Departmental Public Bodies&mdash;a Guide for Departments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/46">21. These and other relevant procedural requirements, including working to standards laid down by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, are set out in the &quot;Code of practice for members of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management&quot; to which Members will agree prior to appointment.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/47" class="italic">Resources</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/48">22. Sponsoring Ministers will provide CoRWM with resources&mdash;both staff and financial&mdash;to enable it to carry out its agreed programme of work. These will include a secretariat which will help CoRWM carry out its programme including, at the outset, providing reading material and arranging for further briefings and visits. The Chair and Members will have a collective responsibility for delivering the work programme within the agreed budget, although the Chair may request sponsoring Ministers for adjustment to this budget should this be considered necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/49" class="italic">Payments</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/50">23. The Chair and Members will be paid for their work for CoRWM. They will also be fully reimbursed for all reasonable travel and subsistence costs incurred during the course of their work.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/51">These terms of reference and other relevant information concerning CoRWM will be included in information packs for prospective applicants. Copies of this material will also be published on the Defra website and placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.6/52">Under its terms of reference, CoRWM will be required to engage the public and stakeholder groups widely in the formulation of its recommendations. The Committee will itself decide how best to do this. However, to provide some initial ideas for CoRWM to consider, a workshop involving about 50 persons with relevant expertise of public and stakeholder engagement processes was held in Manchester on 10&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-03-11">11 March 2003</phrase>. University College London were appointed on a single tender basis to run the workshop. Their report of the workshop and its outcome will be published.</p>

	<p pid=".234W.0/1">Government are taking a number of steps aimed at reducing waste arisings and increasing re-use.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.0/2">In agriculture, we have set up the Agricultural Waste Stakeholders' Forum to inform the development of the Regulations for applying the Waste Framework Directive to agricultural waste. The Forum's terms of reference include identifying and encouraging opportunities to reduce the production of agricultural waste and are available at <a href="http://www.defra.qov.uk/environment/waste/aqforum/index.htm">http://www.defra.qov.uk/environment/waste/aqforum/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid=".234W.0/3">Re-use of construction and demolition waste, and some types of mineral waste that can be substituted for newly won aggregates, will be encouraged through exemption from the Aggregates Levy which was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> at a rate of &pound;1.60 per tonne for virgin aggregates. The Levy also encourages economy of use and less waste of aggregates at construction sites. Some funding from the Levy has also been set aside to fund projects which aim to minimise the demand for primary aggregates.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.0/4">On commercial waste, Defra jointly with DTI, funds the Envirowise programme which provides free independent help and advice on environmental issues, resource efficiency and sustainable business solutions to UK companies. Waste minimisation and effective resource management are central to its aims. It is based on the principle that good environmental sense makes good business sense, and that companies can save money through resource efficiencies. Launched in 1994, Envirowise delivers its messages principally via a freephone national Helpline; On-site Resource Efficiency visits to small and medium sized enterprises by a Helpline advisor; training events; a website; and the dissemination of case studies and good practice guides. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) also includes removing the barriers to waste minimisation and re-use as part of its mission.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.0/5">The Strategy Unit's report 'Waste Not, Want Not' made a number of recommendations on waste minimisation and re-use. The government is considering its response to these recommendations, which it aims to publish around the time of the Budget.</p>

	<p pid=".236W.4/1">The humanitarian strategy for Iraq is firstly to ensure that the military are able to provide support in the areas they occupy then, as quickly as possible, to ensure that, the UN system returns and that Oil for Food is re-established.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.4/2">The reinstatement of Oil for Food is crucial since 16 million Iraqis rely on it. The traditional role of NGOs in post-conflict situations is to help deliver emergency services at community level using supplies provided by the UN system. There are strong Iraqi organisations delivering services for the Oil for Food programme. International NGOs will have a role to play but obviously it is better to employ Iraqi organisations wherever possible.</p>

Their engagement is key to the reforms that are needed to move the economy forward and to secure an agreement on debt rescheduling and a reparations strategy that will enable the Iraqi economy to recover and grow. I held detailed talks last week with officials of the UN and the US Administration about how that might be achieved and I am hopeful that we will soon make progress in line with the agreements reached between the Prime Minister and President Bush in the Azores.</p>

	<p pid=".240W.8/1">60 per cent. of the people of Iraq&mdash;around 16 million people&mdash;are currently dependent on the UN Oil for Food programme (OFF).</p>
	<p pid=".240W.8/2">The UK has been in discussion with the UN humanitarian agencies, Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement and international NGOs to determine what resources they require to procure food to cover any temporary gap in the OFF programme. The UN is currently planning on a medium case scenario under which up to 10 million people may require food assistance during and immediately after conflict. We have committed &pound;50 million to support the contingency preparations of these partners (covering food and other relief). This includes &pound;8 million for the World Food programme. We have set aside a further &pound;40 million for the immediate humanitarian response and are considering further assistance in line with emerging humanitarian needs.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.8/3">DFID also provides 19 per cent. of EC funding for Iraq. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-21">21 March</phrase> the College of European Commissioners proposed to release an additional Euro 9 million from the Emergency Aid Reserve, increasing their total commitment to Euro100 million. This funding is still to be approved by the Council.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.8/4">We have had many representations and discussions on the continuation of the OFF programme with the UN Secretariat, Security Council members and others. Preparations are in hand for a new Security Council Resolution to allow the UN Secretary General to take charge of the Oil for Food (OFF) programme. A draft resolution will be tabled very soon.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.8/5">The first priority for oil revenues post-conflict must be to get the OFF programme back up and running. There are substantial unspent oil revenues in the escrow account. We are in discussions with partners about the level of funds which could be released for new commitments under OFF and how this might be done.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.8/6">We are also in discussions with our partners over arrangements for the post-war administration of Iraq. A UN mandate will be required to provide legal authority to a new transitional government in Iraq. We are holding ongoing discussions with key partners to ensure such a mandate is put in place.</p>
	<p pid=".240W.8/7">OFF accounts are prepared by the UN and audited by their independent auditors.</p>

	<p pid=".244W.11/1">The Afghanistan Transitional Administration has just hosted the first Afghanistan Development Forum in Kabul, to present its budget to donors for the next three years. The collective assessment of the Administration and donors there was that tremendous progress has been made since the fall of the Taliban in November 2001 but that great challenges remain. 2003 will be a critical year for Afghanistan&mdash;improving security beyond Kabul, extending the writ of the central Administration, increasing domestic revenue collection, agreeing a new constitution, preparing for elections, stimulating private sector growth, creating sustainable livelihoods and providing essential services for people, reintegrating more returning refugees and disarming, demobilising and reintegrating militias. To achieve this, Afghanistan will require very effective international support. Donors and the Administration agreed at the Development Forum that this meant that donors must focus their aid on the priorities set out by the Administration in their budget. This assistance should be channelled through a blend of the most effective instruments, reflecting the limited absorptive capacity of each of them: direct funding of the Government through multi-donor trust funds, funding of UN programmes, and direct funding of NGOs and private sector contractors.</p>

It is already evident that the crisis in food production will persist for a third year, as the structural causes of agricultural decline have not been addressed. Detailed assessments and the plans of the Zimbabwe government are awaited; from there we will develop specific programmes. We expect to maintain support for humanitarian needs for a further year along similar lines to our activities during the last year, working with the UN and non-governmental agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".245W.8/1">Total DFID expenditure in Bangladesh in 2001&ndash;02 was reported as &pound;62 million. However an additional &pound;10 million which was spent in that year will be included in the figures for 2002&ndash;03 due to changes in DFID's end of year accounting procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.8/2">Statistics on DFID's programmes are based on our internal accounting and management information systems. In accordance with government policy, DFID has moved to Resource Accounting and the figures for 2001&ndash;02 were the first to be produced from the new system. For 2001&ndash;02 onwards, all payments are counted in the year in which they are made whereas in previous years, during a limited period of time, payments relating to the previous year were attributed to the earlier year. The figures for 2001&ndash;02 are therefore &quot;light&quot; by the amount of these prior year payments.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.8/3">It is estimated that total expenditure on development assistance in 2001&ndash;02 was understated by around &pound;140 million. This is a global aggregate which cannot be broken down by country, but includes the &pound;10 million mentioned above for Bangladesh. Hence some individual country expenditure may appear to have dropped in that year. It is anticipated that the figures for Bangladesh will return to their earlier level of over &pound;70 million in 2002&ndash;03, increasing to around &pound;80 million for the next three years.</p>

	<p pid=".247W.3/1">In 2003&ndash;04 I expect my Department to spend over &pound;1 billion on EC development assistance, which, with some exceptions, under performs both in effectiveness and targeting on poverty reduction. The Commission spent only 43 per cent. of its official development assistance in 2001 in low-income countries and although an improvement from 38 per cent. in the previous year. The Government's aim is to ensure the Commission seeks to spend 70 per cent. of the development budget in low-income countries by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".247W.3/2">We have been working since 1997 to improve the effectiveness and poverty focus of EC development assistance. We welcome the positive steps that were taken by the Commission to reform the management of external assistance and are pressing the EC to continue and deepen the reforms. Prioritisation needs radical overhaul. Allocation decisions too often reflect the political consensus by the Council of Ministers and European Parliament to maintain spending at historical levels in middle-income regions, which reflect domestic or foreign policy considerations. We want to see the pledge, explicit in the EC's Development Policy Statement of November 2000, to focus on poverty reduction reflected in annual decisions over resource transfers.</p>
	<p pid=".247W.3/3">We will continue to push for basing allocations on developmental needs of the poorest countries through all the channels available to us including the annual budget negotiations, the revision of the Asia and Latin America Regulation, the mid-term review of MEDA and the country strategy paper process which determines individual allocations. We have had some initial success eg in 2002 securing additional Euro100 million from the EC's External Actions Budget for Asia and a commitment of Euro1 billion for the rehabilitation of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".247W.3/4">In the longer term the discussions of the Convention debate on the Future of Europe and forthcoming debates on the EU budget ceilings for the period 2007&ndash;13 offer opportunities to reinforce the poverty efforts of the EC's external actions. I believe the EC should focus efforts on where they will be effective and can add value in their impact on economic growth and poverty reduction. Otherwise the EC should cut back its activities.</p>

Around 4 per cent. of these contain incomplete or incorrect identifying details and cannot be allocated to an individual national insurance account without further information. Most of these non-matching items have no or little impact on people's benefit entitlements. The Inland Revenue works with employers to trace and match contributions, concentrating on cases where they are likely to have a significant impact on entitlement. Information about the value of these and number of contributions received but which remain unrecorded on individual's national insurance records for each of the last 10 years would be available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".254W.8/3">It is a fundamental principle of the VAT system that businesses may only recover VAT relating to taxable supplies.

	<p pid=".256W.2/1">The question of the accountability of military and police actions in Chechnya is one which is regularly raised with the Russian government. Most recently, during human rights talks at senior official level, with the Russian government earlier this month, we stressed that all allegations of human rights violations should be thoroughly and transparently investigated, and those responsible punished. We added that the vigorous protection of the human rights of the civil population was an essential precursor to a lasting political solution to the conflict in Chechnya.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.2/2">On this occasion, senior Russian officials acknowledged that violations had been committed and that action needed to be taken to prevent further abuses. Their aim was to increase the protection of the civil population's human rights through the introduction of a new constitution for Chechnya, the phased withdrawal of Federal troops and the transfer of their security duties to the Chechen Interior Ministry.</p>

	<p pid=".259W.2/1">This year Sierra Leone celebrated its first year of peace in over a decade. Disarmament was completed and the war declared over in January 2002. Credible and peaceful elections were held in May. But, much remains to be done to consolidate peace. The UN peacekeeping mission, UNAMSIL, remains deployed throughout the country. It has begun to withdraw, in a phased process, which should last 18 to 20 months.</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-10">10 March</phrase> the Special Court for Sierra Leone indicted seven people suspected of war crimes. Five are now in custody. This action represents an important step forward for the Court and signals Sierra Leone's determination to end impunity. At the same time, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is making good progress with statement-taking. Over 4,700 statements have been recorded to date. We welcome the TRC Chairman's recent announcement that donors have pledged an additional $3.7 million (US) in support of its work.</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/3">The UK continues to play a leading role in building a lasting peace. This month a deployment of Gurkhas undertook joint exercises with the Sierra Leone armed forces as a demonstration of the UK's support for the settlement process. Key post-conflict challenges include helping the Government of Sierra Leone to:</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/4" class="indent">reform the security sector;</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/5" class="indent">train and strengthen the capacity of the armed forces and police;</p>

	<p pid=".259W.2/7" class="indent">tackle corruption;</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/8" class="indent">promote justice (including through the establishment of the Sierra Leone Special Court) and reconciliation (through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission);</p>

	<p pid=".259W.2/12" class="indent">develop industry and the economy.</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/13">The UK is committing over &pound;120 million of development assistance, including substantial budgetary support, to Sierra Leone over the next three years.

	<p pid=".270W.2/1">A new burden is defined as any policy or initiative which increase the cost of providing local authority services. Under the new burdens arrangement Government Departments are responsible for fully funding the costs of their policies which impact on local authorities. The new burdens requirement does not apply to policies which apply the same rules to councils and to private sector bodies (for example a change in the rate of employers' national insurance contributions) except where those policies apply disproportionately to local government. The Government have however guaranteed an increase in grant of at least above the rate of inflation for all local authorities. The increases announced in SR2002 took into account all pressures, including the increase in national insurance contributions, along with the ability of local authorities to make savings. As a result total Government grant to local authorities has increased by &pound;3.8 billion in 2003&ndash;04. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimates the change in national insurance contributions will increase local authorities' pay costs on average by 0.7 per cent. or some &pound;250 million.</p>

This currently does not suggest that new dwellings should be provided with residential sprinklers. However, the Building Regulations are kept under review and in April 2001 research was commissioned into the effectiveness of sprinklers in residential properties. This work is addressing a number of areas, including the undertaking of a series of experimental tests, which should assist with the identification of the potential effectiveness of such sprinkler systems. To date the tests that have been undertaken include 25 benchmark fire tests to evaluate the draft British Standard specification for residential sprinklers, BS DD 252, and eight fires staged in a converted three-bedroomed detached house as part of an experimental programme using realistic fires. Preparation for the final stage of this experimental programme is currently under way. The final results and conclusions from this work should be available around the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid=".272W.6/2">The Legal Aid Department of the Law Society has a Fraud Investigation Unit, which will investigate any information that has been passed to them.</p>
	<p pid=".272W.6/3">If anyone has information to suggest that an applicant for legal aid may not have made a full declaration of their assets, I would encourage them to share that information with the Legal Aid Department and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".272W.6/4">The Government do not however comment on, or intervene in decisions made about the grant or refusal of legal aid in individual cases.</p>
	<p pid=".272W.6/5">Although the Lord Chancellor has ministerial responsibility for legal aid in Northern Ireland, the Law Society of Northern Ireland, through its Legal Aid Committee and the Legal Aid Department, makes decisions on applications for civil legal aid in accordance with statutory principles. It is important that decisions on the merits of individual cases are, and are seen to be, free from political influence.</p>

	<p pid=".275W.2/1">At the end of February 2003, the overall National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF) balance stood at &pound;3.24 billion, the lowest end of month total since October 1997. In addition, at the end of December 2002, the distributors collectively had made commitments totalling &pound;3.74 billion, significantly in excess of the amount held in the fund. This level of over commitment shows that the money resident in the NLDF does not constitute a 'reserve'.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/2">DCMS is actively working with the distributing bodies to further reduce the amount of money held in the NLDF. It is revising the Financial Directions issued to distributing bodies to allow the more rapid transfer of grants to their recipients. It also plans to issue guidance to all distributors about balance management, asking distributing bodies to publish their own NLDF balance management policies, with targets for future balance levels.</p>

	<p pid=".277W.3/1">The &pound;100 million lottery funded people's network programme has enabled &pound;4,085 libraries in the UK to be connected to the internet, including all the libraries in Essex. This represents 99 per cent. of libraries in England, 95 per cent. in Scotland, and 100 per cent. in Wales and Northern Ireland. Only 39 English and 30 Scottish libraries, have still to be connected and we expect all but two of these to be online by summer 2003. This is a very significant achievement.</p>

At Key Stage 2 (ages 7&ndash;11) children are taught about school rules, health and safety, basic emergency aid procedures and where to get help. Learning continues through Key Stage 3 and 4. At Key Stage 4 (ages 5&ndash;16) young people learn to recognise and follow health and safety requirements and develop skills to cope with emergency situations that require basic aid procedures, including resuscitation techniques.</p>

For the first year of the new scheme, eligible new entrants received support for living costs through both grants and loans. Grants, which were assessed against family income, on average formed about a quarter of the support available.

Grants for students with dependants and single parent students are income-assessed but the Disabled Students' Allowance is not.

However, the award of HRP for Child Benefit payees caring for a child under 16 is automatic and therefore the take-up for those entitled to HRP via this route will be 100 per cent. Most people caring for a severely disabled person will receive Invalid Care Allowance (ICA). People getting ICA will be credited with National Insurance contributions so they will not need HRP. Where ICA is not appropriate, or the carer decides not to claim it, various leaflets, including the PM9, specifically designed for carers, does give information about claiming HRP. Where the carer is receiving Income Support for a full tax year and is not required to register for work because of their caring activities, HRP will be available automatically. However, it is not possible to identify and provide specific information to people who give up work to care for a disabled person and who do not make any claims to benefit or inquiries about protection of their state pension, but the Department publicises the availability of HRP. From April, HRP will also be available to registered foster carers who do not currently get HRP by virtue of caring for a child of their own under 16.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.9/29">2. Numbers are in millions. Estimates of numbers from the Family Expenditure Survey are not considered sufficiently reliable to be presented here.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.9/30">3. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that, in the case of the Family Resources Survey, control for tenure, Council Tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).</p>
	<p pid=".288W.9/31">4. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are provided including the self-employed.</p>

	<p pid=".294W.5/1">Benefit help with mortgage interest payments is calculated using a Standard Interest Rate which is based on the weighted average of basic rates charged by the top building societies. The figure is calculated by the Financial Services Authority and published monthly in the Office for National Statistics' Financial Statistics table 7.1L. Changes in the rate are triggered by a 0.25 per cent. move in the published figure.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.5/2">We have no plans to change the current arrangements, which give effect to changes as quickly as is practicable. Once the information is received from the Office for National Statistics of an alteration in the interest rates, the Department immediately sets in motion the procedures to amend the relevant computer systems and legislation. Regulations are laid at least 21 days in advance of their coming into force to allow for proper parliamentary procedures to be followed. The same timetable applies when the standard interest rate increases as when it decreases.</p>

We do not press the parent with care to provide information about the alleged other parent if there are reasonable grounds to believe that to do so may harm or distress the parent with care or any child living with him or her&mdash;this is known as &quot;good cause&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".295W.2/1">Understanding how employment constraints facing lone parents in London compare to other areas is complex. We have commissioned research into this issue <sup>1</sup> and this research found that lone parents in London reported the same barriers to work as lone parents elsewhere in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/2">The three main barriers to moving into work reported by lone parents are availability and cost of child care, concerns about financial uncertainty on moving into work and the cost of housing and council tax. We have introduced a number of measures to help lone parents to overcome these barriers, including the National Childcare Strategy and Tax Credits, which are helping to make work possible and make work pay.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/3">We are continuing to examine the problems lone parents face when moving from benefit dependency into work and finding ways of helping them to overcome them. The New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) provides support tailored to the individual circumstances of lone parents, which takes into account any particular problems they face because of the area that they live in. NDLP has already helped over 160,000 lone parents move into work, including over 16,000 in London.</p>

	<p pid=".299W.2/1">In order to become entitled to the basic State Pension, a person has to satisfy two conditions. The basic State Pension is available to both the employed and self-employed. In addition, anyone may make voluntary contributions, subject to a time limit, if this is necessary to build up entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/2">The first basic State Pension entitlement condition is that a person has either: one qualifying year since <phrase class="date" code="1975-04-06">6 April 1975</phrase> which is derived from the payment of Class 1, 2 or 3 National Insurance contributions or from Class 1 contributions treated as paid; or paid 50 flat rate contributions at any time before <phrase class="date" code="1975-04-06">6 April 1975</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/3">The second basic State Pension entitlement condition relates to the number of qualifying years a person has. Currently to get a full basic State Pension a man needs 44, and a woman 39, qualifying years. The number of qualifying years can be reduced if a person is entitled to Home Responsibilities Protection. The basic State Pension cannot be paid if a person has less than 25 per cent. of the qualifying years needed for a full State Pension.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/4">A qualifying year for the basic State Pension is a tax year in which a person receives, or is treated as receiving, qualifying earnings of at least 52 times the National Insurance Lower Earnings Limit for that year.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/5">In certain circumstances a person may be credited with earnings to help them get a State Pension if they do not have enough earnings in a tax year to reach the level needed to make it a qualifying year.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/6">The State Second Pension is only available to employees and to certain carers and people who are disabled or long-term ill.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/7">The entitlement condition to the State Second Pension depends on the level of earnings a person has, or is treated as having, between the Lower Earnings Limit and the Upper Earnings Limit in any tax year from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-06">6 April 2002</phrase>. Entitlement to the State Second Pension will be reduced or extinguished for any period where a person has contracted-out into an occupational or personal pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/8">Only earnings on which Class 1 contributions have been paid, or treated as paid, count towards the State Second Pension. Earnings of married women and widows who pay contributions at the reduced rate do not count.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/9">Employees who earn above the Lower Earnings Limit but less than the Lower Earnings Threshold are treated as having earnings at the Lower Earnings Threshold. Certain carers and people who are disabled or long-term ill who earn less than the Lower Earnings Threshold, including those with no earnings at all, are also treated as having earnings at the Lower Earnings Threshold.</p>

The Department and the Association of Chief Police Officers have recently signed an agreement setting out the principles for legitimate, mutual operational support, to enhance co-operation in the investigation of benefit crime.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.2/3">Other agencies who provide assistance or work in partnership with our investigations include local authorities, the Northern Ireland Social Security Agency, the National Asylum Support Service, the Inland Revenue, Trading Standards, the Passport Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, the Immigration and Nationality Division, and the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.2/4">Co-ordination of all joint working is the responsibility of the Chief Investigation Officer, working as necessary with Regional Directors, to develop a unified approach with both local government and other Government Departments.</p>

	<p pid=".304W.0/1">Income-related benefits are intended to help people whose resources are insufficient to meet their day-to-day living expenses. Any income that is available to meet those expenses is normally taken fully into account. However, there is a special disregard in income-related benefits in respect of War Widow's Pension which was increased from &pound;5 to &pound;10 in April 1990. We believe that the current disregard strikes the right balance between acknowledging the special reasons for these pensions and prudent use of public funds.</p>
