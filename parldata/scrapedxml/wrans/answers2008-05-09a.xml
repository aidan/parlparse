	<p pid="a.1192W.0/21" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192W.0/22" class="indent">The childcare data tables attached have been derived from the Ofsted Early Years summary reports produced annually and from internal Ofsted data reports. The data for financial years 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 are taken from the Early Years summary reports. The data for years 2003-04 and 2004-05 are taken from Ofsted data reports which provide cumulative data recording the number of inspections during the given financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192W.0/23" class="indent">The figures for each financial year are derived from the snapshot of providers undertaken on the first working day of April each year and include active providers only. For each financial year our figures use the most recent inspection visits, where the reports have been quality assured or have not been withdrawn from publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192W.0/24" class="indent">Please note that the outcome judgements changed from a 3-point scale in April 2005 (good, Satisfactory or unsatisfactory), to a 4-point scale (outstanding, good, satisfactory or inadequate) thereafter. Direct comparisons should therefore not be made between these reports scales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192W.0/25" class="indent">The selection of providers for inspection each year is not random. As a result, it is possible that groups of 'stronger' or 'weaker' providers are selected, biasing the inspection outcomes. The distribution of inspection grades in any one year, therefore, does not necessarily reflect the national position.</p>

	<p pid="a.1196W.2/1">We expect all Sure Start Children's Centres to provide outreach services, although the level and intensity of such provision will vary according to the needs of the local community. Outreach is part of the role of a wide range of practitioners. While many practitioners engaged in outreach to families with young children will be employed in a children's centre or by a local authority, we encourage local authorities to build on other existing local capacity, such as health visitors, relevant third sector workers, and trained volunteers. Our priority is to support children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas to build their outreach capacity to meet local needs. In this context, children's centre revenue funding provides local authorities with resources for two additional outreach practitioners per children's centre in the most deprived (super output) areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1196W.2/2">We will be reviewing the delivery of outreach in a range of settings with a view to establishing core principles and standards for effective and comprehensive outreach services. We will support this with appropriate training materials and courses and provide additional funding for practitioners in children's centres to take up new training opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1197W.3/1">It is crucial that all young people leave school with the skills and confidence to manage their money well. Personal finance education is already part of Personal, Social and Health Education at Key Stages 1 to 4. However, the revised curriculum for secondary schools, includes a new dedicated programme of study for 'Economic Well Being and Financial Capability' as part of a revised Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education. The new curriculum will begin teaching from September 2008 and will add a new focus on financial education in secondary schools. Sir Jim Rose is currently carrying out an independent review of the primary curriculum. He is due to report to Ministers in March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.3/2">Additionally, Citizenship education, which is statutory at Key Stage 3 and 4, requires that 14 to 16-year-olds be taught how the economy functions, including the role of business and financial services. We are also introducing functional mathematics to the maths GCSE, which means that from 2010, all pupils who achieve a grade C or above will have mastered the basics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.3/3">To support schools in meeting these curriculum requirements we are investing &pound;11.5 million over the next three years to support good financial education in schools. This investment will support revised curriculum guidance for financial capability, innovative curriculum resources with the Child Trust Fund as a focus, and more high quality training and support for teachers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1203W.5/9" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response to part (a). The Department for Children, Schools and Families will respond separately to part (b).</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/10" class="indent">Our current data do not enable us to count or estimate how many lessons in England are set by ability. The attached tables show the data Ofsted has on the proportion of lessons observed during inspections carried out in the academic year 2006/07, by subject, phase of education and year. Inspectors record whether classes are setted, streamed or banded, as one category, or are mixed ability in composition. A third category is used for lessons in which other forms of grouping are used. When a lesson observed is setted, streamed or banded by ability, a note is made of the ability level of the class concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/11" class="indent">The data are based on the use of setting, streaming or banding in lessons observed during inspection. Some explanation of these figures may be helpful. Since September 2005, the recording of class organisation has been based either on discussions with the head teacher or teacher by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons is observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may therefore not represent pupil grouping in the school as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/12" class="indent">For clarity, setting is the term used to describe the organisation of pupils in classes on the basis of their prior attainment in the particular subject being taught. The term banding, which is very similar to streaming, is used when the decision as to which pupils are included in a class is based on the prior attainment in a range of subjects. Ofsted does not differentiate between setting, streaming and banding in the data collected during lesson observations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.5/13" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1208W.2/1">The Armed Forces' Benefits Calculator (ABC) is a new initiative which builds on the success of the pension calculator to provide service personnel with the means of working out an indicative value for their total remuneration package, incorporating basic pay, specialist pay, individual allowances, pension, and other benefits. As such, it is retention focused: the calculator has been developed to better communicate to service personnel the value of their 'total reward' package and other associated financial remuneration information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208W.2/2">The MOD also regards strongly the ABC's value to recruiting, because it provides those thinking about joining the armed forces with a means of investigating the type of remuneration and benefits available. In future, the single services will be able to understand its impact, and the role it plays in determining why an individual wishes to enlist, from initial interviews. The calculator uses a combination of existing pay rates and allowances (details of which can be found at <a href="http://www.mod-abc.co.uk">http://www.mod-abc.co.uk</a>), and some new values, which have been agreed with subject matter experts and the single services. These new values are included to provide a broad indication of what some of the other benefits personnel receive in return for military service (such as dental care, and health and fitness facilities) might cost to replicate in civilian life.</p>

	<p pid="a.1209W.3/2">The four tonne vehicle referred to in this question is defined as a Dual Purpose Vehicle (DPV). When used to carry passengers, the DPV can be used on public roads for single journeys of not more than 40 miles and not exceeding one hour. This distance and time may only be exceeded when carrying out operations, training for operations and conducting formal field training exercises.</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.3/3">DPVs fitted with troop carrying vehicle enhanced seating are exempt from these time and distance restrictions, when travelling on metalled roads. Where they are used to carry passengers in off road scenarios, journey times should not exceed one hour at 20 to 25 mph over an eight hour period. Enhanced seating is being progressively phased in throughout the DPV fleet.</p>

	<p pid="a.1223W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question on the assessment of the effect on the quality of labour market statistical information from (a) the manufacturing industry and (b) the furniture industry of the reduction in sample size of the Monthly Production Inquiry (MPI). (201982)</p>
	<p pid="a.1223W.0/4" class="indent">The MPI collects turnover and employment information from businesses in Great Britain, which is used mainly for the compilation of National Accounts and Labour Market Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1223W.0/5" class="indent">Monthly series for employee jobs in the manufacturing sector are published on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) website. In March 2008, when ONS published estimates for January 2008, the MPI sample of businesses was reduced by around 10 per cent, as part of a wider ONS efficiency programme and to meet ONS' targets to reduce the burden it places on business. The sample was reallocated across the sample cells (defined by business size-bands and industries) to make the best use of the survey information. This offset the quality impact of reducing the sample size and enabled us to meet our aim of maintaining the quality of estimates at the aggregate level. At the more detailed level, some industries gained in quality at the expense of others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1223W.0/6" class="indent">Sampling errors are a key measure of survey quality, and were estimated to inform the sample changes and assess the impact on quality. The coefficient of variation is simply the sampling error given as a percentage of the actual estimate, which allows for a relative measure of error for comparative purposes. Please note that estimates of sampling error are themselves subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1223W.0/7" class="indent">(a) The estimate of GB employee jobs in manufacturing in January 2008 was 2,806 thousand. The previous coefficient of variation of 1.2 per cent gave us 95 per cent confidence that the estimate was between 2773 and 2839 thousand. The changes resulted in a small increase in precision, with a coefficient of variation of 1.1 per cent, giving us 95 per cent confidence that the estimate was between 2776 and 2836 thousand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1223W.0/8" class="indent">(b) The estimate of GB employee jobs series in furniture manufacturing in January 2008 was 102 thousand. The previous coefficient of variation of 5.9 per cent gave us 95 per cent confidence that the estimate was between 96 and 108 thousand. The changes resulted in a small decrease in precision, with a coefficient of variation of 6.9 per cent, giving us 95 per cent confidence that the estimate was between 95 and 109 thousand.</p>

(202455)</p>
	<p pid="a.1233W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles employment statistics for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) and its predecessor the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1233W.5/5" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the number of people aged 16 and over, resident in the Jarrow constituency, South Tyneside, the North East and the UK who were self employed in the construction industry in each year since 1997. Estimates are obtained from the annual LFS for each 12 month period from 1997 to 2004 ending in February. For time series comparisons, the APS estimates from 2005 to 2007 are provided covering the 12 month periods ending in March, but the most recently released estimate is also included, which covers the 12 month period ending in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1233W.5/6" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1233W.5/7" class="indent">In order to produce estimates for small geographical areas, APS and annual LFS estimates are provided based on survey microdata. It should be noted that the estimate provided is weighted to population estimates consistent with those published in 2003.

PRTRs are publicly accessible compilations of data that describe the releases of substances to the environment and waste transfers. The E-PRTR regulation is a directly binding piece of European legislation and does therefore not need to be transposed into domestic law. In August 2007 DEFRA published a consultation document concerning among other issues proposals on designating competent authorities, enforcement, reporting requirements and quality assessment of the collected emissions data.

The UK will now be entering into negotiations with other member states and the Commission and will also be releasing a formal consultation soon.

	<p pid="a.1242W.2/1">Separate collections of food waste are relatively novel in the UK. In the 19 trials being conducted by WRAP early indications are that public participation in collections is of the order of 60-80 per cent. Of the food waste being put out for disposal around 70 per cent. is being captured by the food waste collection. The remainder is being disposed of in the residual bin. This excludes any food waste that may be home composted. Many of the trials are being conducted in urban areas where the uptake of home composting is low as properties have either very small or no gardens. However, a customer survey in some of the trial areas indicated that between 58 per cent. and 74 per cent. of respondents indicated that the availability of a food waste collection had not changed what they put in their home composting bin.</p>
	<p pid="a.1242W.2/2">WRAP proposes to continue to monitor the food waste collection trials and will be reporting on their findings in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1242W.2/3">Some local authorities are trialling the collection of food waste with garden waste collections. The partial evidence available so far suggests that these arrangements are not generally successful in capturing food waste from the residual waste stream, Furthermore, separate research carried out by WRAP in 2007, indicates that the existence of kerbside garden/organic collections has limited impact on levels of home composting by home composting households. The main reasons given are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1242W.2/4" class="indent">1. They consider home composting to be more environmentally friendly and divert as much via that route as they can, using collection services only for items that they decide are unsuitable for home composting (pernicious weeds, large and woody items etc.)</p>
	<p pid="a.1242W.2/5" class="indent">2. As they are keen gardeners they want to make as much compost as possible, and will use the collection service only for items that don't readily compost</p>
	<p pid="a.1242W.2/6" class="indent">3. At certain times of the year their gardens produce an excess of certain waste materials and they will consider using the kerbside service to get rid of this excess material.</p>
	<p pid="a.1242W.2/7">The inference is that food waste collected with garden waste has little overall impact on the amount of material which is home composted.</p>

The payments for salt marsh options available under the environmental stewardship higher level scheme were, in common with all the other options, calculated in 2004. There are a number of options available ranging from the maintenance of coastal saltmarsh (30/ha) to the creation of inter-tidal/saline habitat on arable land (at 700/ha).</p>

	<p pid="a.1244W.6/1">Local authorities are best placed and responsible for deciding the most appropriate waste management facilities for their areas. Recovering energy from waste is a sustainable option for residual waste that would otherwise go to landfill. It is important that plans for energy from waste facilities emerge out of local waste strategies, so that all options for reuse, recycling and composting can be explored first.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/2">The Government wish to encourage local authorities to consider using anaerobic digestion. Other than this, we do not generally think it appropriate to express a preference for one technology over another. Any given technology is (where applicable) more beneficial if both heat and electricity can be recovered. Particular attention should therefore be given to the siting of plant to maximise opportunities for Combined Heat and Power.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/3">The current Waste Private Finance Initiative (PFI) criteria were issued in May 2006. Projects must meet these criteria in order to be considered for PFI credits. The criteria aim to ensure that PFI credits are allotted to projects that are value for money and enable the investment in residual waste infrastructure necessary if the demanding targets in the Landfill Directive and Waste Strategy for England 2007 are to be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/4">The following criteria are included:</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/5" class="indent">2. PFI credits are awarded to authorities primarily to deliver increased diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. Proposals should demonstrate how the schemes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/6" class="indent">contribute to or complement longer-term national targets for recycling and composting as well as diversion of biodegradable and other municipal waste from landfill, indicating the amount of biodegradable and other municipal waste expected to be diverted from landfill over the whole life of the project;</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/7" class="indent">support or complement the authorities' plans for recycling set out in their Municipal Waste Management Strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/8" class="indent">5. The use of residual waste treatment options involving recovery, including energy from waste solutions, will have an integral role in treating the waste we cannot 'design out', re-use or recycle. Such options should be considered while also demonstrating that there is no future barrier to meeting reduction, reuse and recycling targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/9" class="indent">6. Proposals should demonstrate that other relevant authorities, the public, and interested parties have been consulted and that there is a broad consensus supporting a recognised long term waste management strategy which is reflected in the proposed solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/10" class="indent">10. Preferential consideration will be given to capital projects which focus on residual treatment plant only, including, but not limited to, Energy from Waste, Mechanical Biological Treatments and Anaerobic Digestion. The full criteria are available on the DEFRA website.</p>

We have no plans to convene a conference, of all these countries, to discuss peace across the whole region. These countries, along with Djibouti, are the constituent members of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). IGAD was created in 1996 as an intergovernmental body for development in the East and Horn of Africa. The African Union has also identified IGAD as one of Africa's sub regional intergovernmental organisations that can help contribute to peace and security in Africa. The Government actively support IGAD's work to promote peace and stability across the region.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.3/2">During the parliamentary election in December 2006 and the presidential elections in March 2007, the UK, along with the EU and international observers raised concerns as to the degree of democracy exhibited throughout the election periods. Of particular concern were the unacceptable conditions Russia placed on international observers, limits to restrict the field of candidates and the lack of equal media access for opposition candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/3">According to recent reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, both the non-governmental organisation law and the law on extremist behaviour have been used to target and restrict certain individuals and non-governmental organisations. Media freedom and the situation facing human rights defenders are recurrent themes during both the bilateral and EU/Russia human rights dialogues. As a result, we welcome President Medvedev's focus on the need to strengthen the rule of law in Russia.</p>

	<p pid="a.1266W.8/1">Loans for tuition fees to higher education students from other European Union (EU) member states began in September 2006. The Student Loans Company has established payment arrangements for borrowers from those countries. They are informed of the methods of repayment available to them; and the SLC is putting in place enforcement procedures which will include the use of external trace agents, international debt collection companies and&mdash;where necessary&mdash;litigation against those defaulting on their repayments. Legal action against defaulting borrowers across the EU is underpinned by EC regulation 44/2001 which allows the SLC to obtain judgments in UK courts which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.8/2">The salary thresholds above which borrowers repay have been set at levels appropriate to each EU member state, taking into account living costs, so that borrowers' repayments take local circumstances into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.8/3">Some students from EU member states will stay in the UK to work after graduation, in which case they are expected to obtain a national insurance number and make loan repayments through the UK tax system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1266W.8/4">While there is not yet enough information about repayments from EU students accurately to estimate a default rate there is no evidence to suggest that these students will be less likely to honour their loan repayment obligations than UK borrowers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1267W.5/1">We estimate that students beginning higher education degree courses in 2008 are likely to graduate with personal debt, on average, of some &pound;16,000. However, the average will depend on: how many students choose to take-up a loan for tuition fees; whether those students who are eligible for grants thereby reduce how much they borrow for maintenance; and whether trends in the level of commercial debt remain stable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1267W.5/2">Student loans have very different features to most commercial loans. Repayment is based on income, not the amount owed. Graduates only repay once they are in work and only when their annual income reaches &pound;15,000. Interest is charged at the rate of inflation, so students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1267W.5/3">In July last year we announced plans to introduce greater flexibility in the repayment of student loans by allowing borrowers to take repayment breaks of up to five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1267W.5/4">A generous package of support is available to students, particularly those from low income households. In 2006/07 over half of eligible full-time students received a full or partial maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,700. From 2008/09 onwards, the minimum threshold (of household income) for a full maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,835 per year will be extended from &pound;17,500 a year to &pound;25,000 a year; with a partial grant available up to an income threshold of &pound;60,005. This will mean that two thirds of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008/09 are expected to be entitled to a full or partial non-repayable grant&mdash;compared to just over half now.</p>

In 2006/07, we introduced the most generous package of financial support ever for part-time students in England.

	<p pid="a.1268W.5/1">We have not made specific estimates of the proportion of students at each household income level. For full-time students, the recently announced reforms for 2008/09 mean we estimate that around one third of eligible students will be entitled to a full grant. These students will have a residual household income of &pound;25,000 or less. We also estimate around a third will be entitled to a partial grant, equivalent to an income between &pound;25,000 and &pound;60,005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1268W.5/2">Due to these reforms for full-time students, by 2011, the number of students receiving some level of grant will increase by around 100,000. As part of this change, an extra 50,000 students will receive a full grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1268W.5/3">For part-time students the uncertainties are greater as the student support package is generally not available to students above a household income of around &pound;26,000 (2007/08 support).</p>

	<p pid="a.1270W.2/1">A court may impose a curfew as a condition of a community order or suspended sentence order. It would be open to the court when sentencing to make specific direction as to the start date of the curfew condition, under the general powers to impose such a condition set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It is also open to the court subsequently to vary such a condition, should it see fit, upon application by either the offender or the Offender Manager.</p>

	<p pid="a.1276W.3/1">The Northern Ireland Office, along with the majority of central Government Departments, is a member of the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund (GCOF). The GCOF aims to fulfil the Government's commitment to offset emissions attributable to all official and ministerial air travel in central Government. It is available to all central Government Departments and provides a simple and cost effective way to offset, as well as ensuring high environmental integrity. The GCOF runs for an initial period of three years (2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.3/2">The GCOF is being managed by EEA Fund Management Ltd, which won the contract to source and deliver 255,000 Certified Emission Reduction Credits, with a provision for a further 50,000 credits, over three years from a range of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. Credits will be supplied from the project portfolio of Trading Emissions plc, to which EEA is the investment adviser.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.3/3">My Department paid &pound;11,384.56 into the GCOF for 2006-07, to offset some l,148 tCO2e from air travel. Data is currently being collected for the 2007-08 reporting year and will be available later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1277W.8/1">A number of initiatives have been introduced since the last amnesty and are now in operation across Northern Ireland to reduce the level of knife crime. PSNI have rolled out the use of metal detectors and also introduced a stop and search policy. New legislation has been introduced to make it more difficult to obtain knives by raising the minimum age limit for purchase to 18. Last month, it became illegal in Northern Ireland to manufacture, sell, hire or import samurai swords. The recent Criminal Justice (NI) Order contains powers which double the penalties for possessing a knife in public and also for selling/manufacturing/marketing knives to under 18s.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.8/2">Knife disposal bins have been retained on site at civic amnesty locations and PSNI education officers continue to raise awareness in schools on a number of key issues, including the dangers of carrying a knife.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.8/3">Knife crime is totally unacceptable. While the Government currently have no plan to re-run the knife amnesty, we will continue to consider a range of policies and initiatives to tackle knife crime in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.1281W.5/1">The UK is not currently party to the agreement between Japan Tobacco International and the European Community and its member states (&quot;the JTI Agreement&quot;). Since the launch of the Government's Tackling Tobacco Smuggling Strategy in 2000, a comprehensive range of new measures has been introduced to counter the threats from tobacco smuggling. In particular, HM Revenue and Customs have Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with all major UK tobacco manufacturers, which form a strong framework for cooperation with the industry to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco. In 2006, when the strategy was refreshed, these MoUs were underpinned with the introduction of new supply chain control legislation, which places a legal obligation on tobacco manufacturers not to facilitate smuggling, along with penalties of up to five million for those who fail to comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281W.5/2">The MoUs and the legislation cover many of the same issues contained in the JTI Agreement, though with some key differences in detail. For example, the legislation contains no significant exclusions, whereas the JTI Agreement does not cover products that have been duty paid in another EU member state and then smuggled into the UK. This would limit the Agreement's impact on the UK tobacco smuggling problem and could also cause legal difficulties if the Agreement and the UK legislation were to operate in parallel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281W.5/3">It is important also to note that the UK legislation and MoUs cover all major manufacturers. This ensures a level playing field for manufacturers, as well as guarding against the risk that smuggling is displaced to products not covered by an Agreement. We are committed to keeping our position on Agreements such as the JTI Agreement under review, to take account of any further Agreements that might be signed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1282W.0/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) publishes details of the cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco seized in its annual reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.1282W.0/2">The Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) agreed between HMRC and leading UK tobacco manufacturers form one strand of the Government's &quot;Tackling Tobacco Smuggling&quot; strategy&mdash;a comprehensive package of measures which together have resulted in a steady decline in the size of the illicit tobacco market, from around 20 per cent. in 2001-02 to around 13 per cent. in 2005-06. Levels of seizures can be affected by a number of factors, so it is not possible to attribute changes in the proportion of seizures made up of a tobacco manufacturer's genuine brands directly to a MoU. Even if it were possible, the level of seizures would be only one indicator of the effectiveness of the Government's strategy. The key indicator is the size of the illicit market. HMRC publishes estimates of the illicit market share annually in the 'Measuring Indirect Tax Losses' report, which can be found in the Commons Library. In the last few years, seizures of genuine cigarettes made by HMRC have made up a progressively smaller share of total seizures, which is a further indicator of the positive effect of the MoUs.</p>
