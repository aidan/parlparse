	<p pid=".644W.11/1">We remain extremely concerned about these sentences. During her visit to Nigeria in September the Minister responsible for Africa, my noble Friend the Baroness Amos, raised with President Obasanjo HMG's concerns about the harsh sentences imposed under the Sharia penal codes, including that of stoning for adultery. She emphasised the strength of feeling against them in the UK and reiterated HMG's opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.11/2">The British High Commission in Abuja, together with EU partners, follows all such cases closely and keeps in close contact with local human rights organisations. The High Commission regularly raises our concerns about the sentences with the appropriate authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.11/3">The Federal Government has made clear its opposition to the extreme Sharia penalties. It has declared them discriminatory and unconstitutional. Exercise of the Sharia penal code is, however, entirely under the control of the relevant States. The Federal justice system only comes into play if the defendant appeals to the Federal Appeal Courts.</p>

This framework is designed to ensure Government operations contribute positively to the UK's sustainable development headline indicators. These targets are being applied to the whole of the FCO's UK estate, although timescales may vary depending upon the location and nature of the site. We have a specific SDA target of achieving efficiencies from the existing energy target of reducing carbon emissions by an ongoing 1 per cent. per annum.</p>

In the energy crops scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme, we have funding of &pound;29 million which could see around 20,000 hectares of crops planted. Each hectare of biomass crops yielding the equivalent of 8 tonnes per annum will save 2 tonnes of carbon per annum. Purpose grown energy crops and other biomass will provide feedstocks for the projects developed under the bio-energy capital grants scheme from which we expect electricity generation of up to 120MW in addition to the development of combined heat and power and heat only projects.</p>

	<p pid=".649W.2/2">Developing a bovine TB vaccine is a long-term aim. The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISO) has cautioned that such a vaccine is a potential policy option only in the longer term and has set up, this year, a Vaccine Scoping Study. A report is expected to be submitted to Ministers early in 2003 on the feasibility of pursuing a vaccination strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.2/3">A test which is able to distinguish vaccinated from infected cattle would be a great asset in the development of a vaccination strategy. Development of such a test is part of our wide-ranging research programme. Once a test has been developed we would need to approach the European Union to seek its acceptance of the new test as showing cattle to be free from the disease. This would require a change to European law.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.2/4">Any new vaccine would need to meet the EU criteria of safety, quality and efficacy for the authorisation of veterinary medicinal products.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.2/5">The BCG vaccine is being used a starting point for much of the current research. We are looking at how BCG protects animals and what environmental factors affect this. Some of the possible new vaccines under development are mutated or altered forms of BCG.</p>

Of those that can be enumerated, climate change levy exemption on fuel inputs to Good Quality CHP and Good Quality CHP electricity outputs were valued at up to &pound;90 million, while eligibility for Enhanced Capital Allowances is worth in the region of &pound;10 million per annum to the industry. In addition, CHP is one of the measures that operators who are participants in Climate Change Agreements are encouraged to use to meet their targets and therefore qualify for the 80 per cent. reduction in Climate Change Levy.</p>

	<p pid=".651W.2/2">At the meeting of the Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-17">17 October</phrase> member states agreed that the Community was unwilling to agree to a resumption in commercial ivory trade unless it was satisfied, following consultation with all range states, that there would be no resulting increase in illegal killing of elephants and no unfavourable impact on the conservation of elephant populations. The Community would continue to support the cooperation of range states to this effect.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.2/3">In Santiago the UK supported the EU view that the initial set of proposals put forward by the range states did not meet these criteria for a resumption in commercial ivory trade. Following a meeting between representatives of range states and the EU, a revised set of proposals was prepared which sought only a one-off sale, subject to strict conditions which must be fulfilled before the sale could go ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.2/4">On these, the EU agreed to abstain because it was clear that there was no prospect of achieving an agreed view, even on qualified majority voting, to support or oppose the revised proposal. The UK does not believe that the necessary conditions are currently in place, even for a one-off sale. However, if the strict requirements of the agreement (which include a minimum 18-month delay, strict control of the market, stringent monitoring requirements and a condition that the proceeds of any sale are used solely for the benefit of elephant conservation) are met in full and verified, we believe that this agreement strikes the right balance between meeting the legitimate expectations of the southern African states that they should be able to engage in sustainable utilisation of their natural resources, whilst establishing strict controls to secure the conservation of wider elephant populations, as envisaged in the Environment Council decision.</p>

Samples of organic produce are included in the surveillance, but the results have not been kept separately. The Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for residues of veterinary medicines are set on an EU-wide basis. Substances not authorised for use will not have an MRL. For such compounds and also for approved substances without an MRL for a particular tissue, an 'Action Level' is applied; this is normally that any confirmed residue is reported.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.2/23">All of the results, highlighting any exceedances of MRLs and Action Levels, are published quarterly in the VMD's newsletter. They have been published annually in the VMD's annual report and accounts up to 1994, in a dedicated VMD report on surveillance for veterinary residues between 1995 and 2000, and in the veterinary residues committee's annual report on surveillance for veterinary residues in 2001.

	<p pid=".656W.2/41" class="italic">Note:</p>
	<p pid=".656W.2/42">The definition of MRLs for pesticide residues and veterinary residues is not the same; they have different meanings.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.2/43">For pesticide residues, MRLs are maximum residue levels. These are intended primarily as a check that pesticides are being used correctly and to assist international trade in treated produce. Maximum residue levels for pesticide residues are not safety limits, and exposure to pesticide residues in excess of a maximum residue level does not necessarily imply a risk to health.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.2/44">For veterinary residues, MRLs are maximum residue limits. For veterinary medicines, they are statutory limits&mdash;if any tissue from an animal presented for slaughter is found to contain a residue above the maximum residue limit, an offence may have been committed. In Europe, the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP), part of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, sets MRLs. Because of the way veterinary MRLs are set, exposure to a residue over the MRL is in itself not necessarily a cause for concern. The VMD take toxicological advice from the Food Standards Agency where residues over the relevant MRL or actions levels are detected.</p>

We have put proposals to the US for the full liberalisation of the UK-US aviation market, but these have not been accepted. More recently, we put proposals to the US Government for a partial liberalisation of the market, which would have allowed bmi British Midland to operate a limited number of Heathrow-US services, but the US felt unable to accept them either.

	<p pid=".667W.5/1">XTransport 2010: The Ten Year Plan&quot; sets out our vision for a fairer and more effective transport system, while the Highways Agency's XStrategic Roads 2010&quot; sets out the framework for delivering the strategic road network elements of the plan, which includes reducing congestion across the strategic motorway and trunk road network. This needs to be considered in the context of measures to improve other forms of transport, which will also contribute to delivery of the congestion target.</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/2">Pilot studies to actively manage the traffic and make better use of the existing road space will be undertaken, and where necessary, programmes of works such as the Targeted Programme of Improvements and the recently announced 92 priority junction schemes will be delivered. Both will provide increased capacity and improve conditions on the network.</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/3">To help deliver the reduction in congestion, the Highways Agency is also developing its role as a traffic manager to help motorists deal with congestion on motorways and other strategic routes, and has appointed a director whose prime purpose is to take this role forward. A number of initiatives are being pursued. These include the Traffic Control Centre project that will provide advice to motorists about travel conditions on the trunk road network, allowing them to plan their journeys more effectively to avoid congestion. In conjunction with the Police and other emergency services, the Agency is improving the way it deals with accidents and incidents on the network so that they are dealt with more effectively, reducing the time roads are disrupted to minimise congestion.</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/4">The Department for Transport has monitored trunk road and motorway speeds in 1995, 1998 and 2001. Surveys show that while, in general, overall speeds have fallen since 1995, average speeds on motorways were 2.5 mph faster in 2001 in the morning peak period when compared to the equivalent speeds in the 1998 survey. In the evening peak, they were 3.3 mph faster.</p>

	<p pid=".668W.2/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the cost per mile of using a noise&mdash;absorbing surface on motoways. I am replying in the absence of Tim Mathews the Chief Executive who is currently away on Highways Agency business.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/4" class="indent">The cost varies considerably depending on site specific issues such as:</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/5" class="indent">the overall size of the contract,</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/6" class="indent">wheather the existing surface is to be planed out and to what depth, or overlaid,</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/7" class="indent">the thickness of the material to be laid and the number of layers,</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/8" class="indent">whether the work is to be carried out during the day or at night, re-opening the carriageway during the day,</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/9" class="indent">the complexity and duration of the traffic management necessary and,</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/10" class="indent">whether it is necessary to resurface the hard shoulders or carry out adjustments to other road items.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/11" class="indent">The cost per mile for surfacing laid on both carriageways of a dual three&mdash;lane motorway would be expected to range between &pound;200,000 and &pound;450,000. These costs are for the quieter surfacings currently being used on the trunk road network in line with Government policy. They do not include the cost of porous asphalt for which no recent prices are available. Based on past experience however, this would be considerably more expensive; we estimate perhaps &pound;600,000 to &pound;700,000 per mile.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/12" class="indent">If it would be helpful, John Williams in our pavement engineering team, would be pleased to discuss the quieter surfacings in current use on the trunk road network with you. His telephone number is 01234 796116.</p>

	<p pid=".675W.2/1">We are not aware of a particular problem (e.g. of abandonment) in respect of the very small number of unregistered vehicles in the UK. However, we are aware of the considerable problem of unlicensed vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.2/2">Local authorities have various powers to deal with abandoned vehicles. Among these will be a number that are also unlicensed and in determining whether a vehicle is abandoned, the absence of a tax disc may be a significant, but not the only factor. Section 4 of the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978 Act provides that a local authority may destroy a vehicle immediately which is in their custody and on which no current vehicle excise licence (tax disc) was displayed at the time of its removal.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.2/3">Although local authorities have however, no general power to deal with unlicensed vehicles as such, powers now exist for the Driver Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) to devolve its powers of enforcement in dealing with unlicensed vehicles to local authorities wishing to use them. To date six local authorities have been given devolved powers to clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles on behalf of the Secretary of State. These are the London Boroughs of Croydon, Lewisham, Newham and Wandsworth, together with Hastings and Southend-on-Sea borough councils.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.2/4">These councils seek authorisation from DVLA to clamp any unlicensed vehicles. If the vehicle is not claimed after 24 hours it is removed to a secure vehicle compound. The vehicles are kept in the compound for a minimum of 7 days to allow DVLA to write to the registered keeper informing them of the whereabouts of the vehicle and what steps they will need to take to reclaim the vehicle. If the vehicle still remains unclaimed, DVLA will give authorisation for the vehicle to be disposed of, this is usually by crushing.</p>

Young people wishing to start their own businesses in deprived areas will also benefit from our measures to support enterprise and tackle market failures in these areas more generally. These measures include designating 2,000 Enterprise Areas in the most deprived areas in the UK, where policies to support businesses are now being concentrated. Businesses in these areas already benefit from an exemption from stamp duty on property transfers between 60,000 and 150,000. We have announced that we will remove stamp duty on all commercial transactions in those areas, introduce a more flexible planning regime and a tax credit to encourage community investment, and offer greater support from the Small Business Service and the Inland Revenue.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.6/2">In relation to the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, employees travel by public transport. Should the use of a private car be essential for work, rather than personal, reasons, the Department would bear the cost of the charge. It is not expected that any such occasion should arise.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.6/3">The policy of the Treasury Solicitor's Department is to encourage its employees not to use private vehicles on official business and to encourage them to use public transport. The Department will, however, pay road tolls, including the central London road user charge, where use of a private vehicle is essential or where the journey remains cost effective in comparison to the use of public transport.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.6/4">The Crown Prosecution Service has not yet published a policy in relation to the reimbursement of the central London road user charges.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.6/5">The Serious Fraud Office does not intend to amend its terms and conditions to include reimbursement of central London road user charges incurred by its employees for travelling to work.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.6/6">In respect of HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, it is Departmental travel policy that employees should not use cars to commute to and from work in London. Where the use of a car in London is essential for work, not personal, reasons, charges will be reimbursed.</p>

	<p pid=".683W.3/1">At the award stage, the proposed new directive makes it clear that contracting authorities are able to use environmental criteria where these are justified by the subject of the contract and provide a benefit to the contracting authority. Such criteria can include whole life cost factors, such as energy usage, disposal costs, and recyclability, as well as those related to qualitative aspects of the product. However, it will often be more appropriate and sensible to take environmental issues into account earlier on in the procurement process, in defining the subject of the contract and the specification. There is much scope to do this, provided that such specifications do not discriminate against suppliers across the Community, and that buyers respect the rules in the directives on technical specifications. Contracting authorities can, for example, specify green production processes (eg timber from sustainable sources, recycled paper, green electricity etc) and can refer to relevant eco-label criteria. Contracting authorities can also define one or more variants to the standard specification to allow, for example, bids to be submitted which offer a higher environmental performance.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.3/1">The UK with eight other countries signed the Charter of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) in July 2001. The initiative foresaw a need for advanced nuclear energy systems in the future to help meet growing international demands for carbon free energy; and that to meet public concerns, future systems must meet exceptionally high standards of safety, sustainability and proliferation resistance, while operating economically in liberalised markets. The aim is to develop a framework for collaborative R&amp;D to facilitate the deployment of such advanced reactor systems from 2030 and beyond. The GIF meeting in Tokyo in September 2002 agreed a XRoadmap&quot; for R&amp;D development based on six systems selected as best satisfying these goals. Further information is available from the following website -<a href="http://energY.gov/HOPress/releases02/scppr/GIFupdate.pdf">http://energY.gov/HOPress/releases02/scppr/GIFupdate.pdf</a></p>

	<p pid=".693W.14/1">Each medical syndrome comprises a set of physical signs and/or symptoms that distinguishes it from other medical conditions. As a group, Gulf veterans have reported more ill-health than other comparable groups. The pattern of their ill- health is not unique but they have reported symptoms with greater frequency and of more severity than those in comparable groups. Some Gulf veterans have recognised medical conditions, but a large number of non-specific, multi-system, medically unexplained symptoms have also been reported. The consensus of the international scientific and medical community is that this diversity of symptoms means that ill-health among Gulf veterans cannot be characterised as a unique Gulf related illness or syndrome. The Ministry of Defence's approach must be guided by medical science and so does not recognise XGulf War Syndrome&quot; as a medical condition and has no working definition of such a syndrome.</p>

Two comprehensive and independent epidemiological studies were carried out on the Ministry of Defence's behalf by the National Radiological Protection Board, in conjunction with the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. The studies showed that participation in the test programme has had no detectable effect on the participants' expectation of life or on their risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases.

	<p pid=".699W.2/1">The National Coalfield Programme, managed by English Partnerships, has an agreed budget of &pound;385m to remediate up 98 coalfield sites and to bring positive change by encouraging new business and job creation. The programme also creates public open space, as well as leisure and social facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".699W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has agreed new flexibility within the programme allowing English Partnerships to invest in projects outside of the immediate site boundaries where this approach offers greater benefit to that coalfield community. In these cases basic remediation of the programme site will still be carried out.</p>
	<p pid=".699W.2/3">There is no system of bidding for projects under the programme. However, English Partnerships work closely with other stakeholders including local authorities, regional development agencies, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust and community groups in formulating proposals under the flexibility agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".699W.2/4">Projects to enhance community capacity are supported separately by the coalfield regeneration trust, including the recent appointment of a second midlands regeneration manager to help develop the capacity of community groups.</p>

	<p pid=".702W.3/1">The Government's rent restructuring policy aims to achieve a more coherent and fairer structure of social rents, while keeping rents affordable and well below market levels. Over the next ten years, social landlords are being encouraged to move their rents towards a common rents formula, which links rents to relative property values, local manual earnings levels, and property sizes.</p>
	<p pid=".702W.3/2">We believe that the arrangements are fair both to landlords and tenants. We shall be reviewing the implementation of rent restructuring after three years. We have no proposals for a rent restructuring authority. The level of social sector rents is a matter for local authorities and registered social landlords, taking account of rent restructuring policies.</p>
	<p pid=".702W.3/3">The effective repeal of Section 24(3) of the Housing Act 1985 in England is not expected to have any significant effect on the level of public sector rents. Section 24(3) applies only to local authorities and requires them to have regard, when setting their rents, to the pattern of private sector rents. This might, towards the end of the ten year rent restructuring period, have impacted marginally on an authority's ability to set rents in line with the rents formula.</p>
	<p pid=".702W.3/4">The changes proposed in the Local Government Bill to the Social Security Administration Act 1992 will not affect the policy of rent rebate subsidy limitation, which will continue to operate in line with our rent restructuring policy as now.</p>
	<p pid=".702W.3/5">The repeal to subsection 7 of section 1406 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 would not confer any additional powers on my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. This subsection made unclear the true extent of my rt. hon Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's powers in relation to determining subsidies and we believe it should be repealed. Authorities will be required to provide information to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) in relation to rent allowance subsidy and council tax subsidy. In relation to rent rebate subsidy, and in particular rent rebate subsidy limitation, authorities may be required to submit information to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in England (ODPM), or the National Assembly in Wales (NAW), who could pass this information to the DWP along with representations as to the form of rent rebate subsidy limitation formulae. This would be possible as an alternative to requiring authorities to send that information directly to the DWP. It is not intended that authorities should have to provide the same information to both the DWP and the ODPM/ NAW.</p>

Just as billing authorities will have to act compatibly with the Convention rights in investigating whether a dwelling is vacant for the purposes of the council tax, they will have to act compatibly with Convention rights in making any further use of the data as will be permitted by clause 85.</p>

The resources are classified as Annually Managed Expenditure and as such are drawn down on an annual basis. Provision for 2003&ndash;04 is currently &pound;616 million, and all payments would go to the Public Works Loans Commissioners. Provision for future years will relate to the 2003 transfer programme onward, for which applications from local authorities have yet to be invited. A local authority will be eligible where it has been accepted onto the housing transfer programme and where on disposal of its stock the receipt it will receive will be less than its housing attributable debt.</p>

	<p pid=".706W.0/1">Under the arrangements proposed in the Local Government Bill, authorities with an assumed surplus on their Housing Revenue Account (HRA) will be asked to pay the whole of that assumed surplus to central Government. The surpluses, together with a contribution from the Exchequer, will be redistributed to those authorities whose assumed expenditure on their housing stock exceeds their rental income. This will not involve direct transfer between authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.0/2">This redistributive mechanism operates already at present, as an authority's assumed HRA surplus is netted off against the rent rebate subsidy due to them in the HRA subsidy calculation, thus providing the national resources to pay subsidy to deficit authorities. However, that will not be possible once rent rebates are removed from the HRA and subsidised separately; hence the need for the new mechanism in the Bill. As surpluses are effectively captured at present, this proposal will not, therefore, have any effect on the financial position of most councils, or their ability to deliver their housing strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.0/3">The assumed surpluses and deficits will continue to be determined annually as now. Authorities will be consulted on the formulae proposed each year in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.0/4">The pooling of a proportion of housing capital receipts will also ensure that resources are targeted to those areas where housing need is greatest so that all authorities can meet national housing priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.0/5">As with HRA surpluses, it is proposed that pooled receipts should be redistributed in full. The amount of pooled receipts will depend on levels of Right to Buy sales at the time.</p>

	<p pid=".709W.3/1">The draft Bill proposed the merger of Revenue Support Grant (RSG) and redistributed national non-domestic rates (NNDR) into a single grant stream. The intended purpose was to simplify the grant distribution mechanism by paying the combined total of central government unhypothecated grant support for local authorities and the amount of support raised via business rates using a single basis of distribution. The Government believed that this change would make the grant system more transparent and easier for stakeholders to understand.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.3/2">A number of local authority responses to the consultation on the draft Bill agreed that the proposed changes would simplify the grant distribution system. However the overwhelming majority of consultation responses argued that the two funding streams should not be merged. The Select Committee also recommend against the proposed merger.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.3/3">Having considered carefully all the consultation responses and the views of the Select Committee, the Government decided to not to proceed with the merger because it evidently did not achieve the desired objective of improving the clarity of the grant distribution system.</p>

	<p pid=".711W.7/1">The Government are committed to the modernisation of public services. Advance Passenger Processing is the framework for a modernised immigration control. It will comprise a range of operational and analytical initiatives which will provide a balance between expediting clearance of genuine passengers and targeting those passengers who present an immigration or security threat. Over the last few years, we have been building a platform of legislation to support this strategy: the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000; the Immigration (Passenger Information) Order 2000; and the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.7/2">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND), with .private sector partners, have recently completed a three month feasibility study to examine whether a system of advance passenger processing, akin to the electronic travel authority which operates in Australia, might be applicable to the United Kingdom. The initial conclusions are positive and IND are currently engaged in an evaluation of the study, which is being conducted in consultation with key stakeholders. It is expected that the evaluation will be completed by Spring 2003 and we will then consider the best way forward.</p>

	<p pid=".712W.5/1">A four tier screening process is in place for all new asylum applicants. Those holding documentation establishing their identity and nationality undergo the first level of screening, which is photographing, fingerprinting and taking personal details. In all other cases, more in-depth screening is undertaken to ascertain nationality and identity along with the route taken to the United Kingdom. The highest level of screening is used in cases where prosecution is a possibility and these interviews are conducted under caution by specially trained officers. Country information is available to immigration officers to assist in establishing nationality.</p>
	<p pid=".712W.5/2">A pilot project took place at the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon exploring ways of identifying nationality by the use of language analysis experts. Samples of conversations were forwarded to language experts to establish if the asylum applicant's language and dialect were consistent with his nationality. The results of this project are still being assessed.</p>
	<p pid=".712W.5/3">Flights identified as potentially 'high risk' for carrying passengers who destroy their documents en route to the United Kingdom are met by specially designated and trained immigration officers who escort them to the immigration control for further examination. On a number of occasions full document checks are carried out on arriving flights to ascertain that passengers have the appropriate travel documentation.</p>
	<p pid=".712W.5/4">In addition specialist expertise and advice on passport and visa documentation is readily available from the British High Commission in Pakistan and this resource is used by the airlines when denying boarding to inadequately documented passengers.</p>

	<p pid=".714W.5/1">Drug courts are not presently being piloted in England and Wales, but the STEP Project, a court based treatment initiative, ran in Wakefield and Pontefract from summer 1998 to autumn 2000. The nearest comparison now is with the court review process of the drug treatment and testing order (DTTO), which shares with drug courts in other jurisdictions sentencer review of the progress of offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".714W.5/2">The Government believe that getting drug misusing offenders into treatment through court-based interventions can be effective in reducing drug misuse and crime, and officials are currently developing proposals for piloting drug courts drawing upon the good practice of dedicated DTTO review courts.</p>

	<p pid=".714W.8/1">The Home Office is working to develop an action plan on a National Rehabilitation Strategy. The plan will respond .to issues highlighted in the recent Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) and Sentencing Enforcement Unit (SEU) reports and will draw on the experience and skills of a range of Departments and agencies working with vulnerable and excluded groups. Partnership between the prison service and national probation service will be important in the joint delivery of support to offenders both during and after custody and helping them to reintegrate successfully into the community on release.</p>
	<p pid=".714W.8/2">The National Probation Directorate (NPD) provides funding to several voluntary sector organisations, including the Society of Voluntary Associates (SOVA) and the National Association for Care and Resettlement of Offenders (NACRO). Both NPD and the Prison Service work closely with partner agencies in the voluntary and not for profit sector to address offenders resettlement needs. Partnerships typically deliver services supporting offenders to access housing, prepare for and obtain employment and enter basic skills learning.</p>

	<p pid=".726W.0/2">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".726W.0/3">Numerous academic studies have attempted to estimate the average percentage increase in hourly or weekly earnings attributable to having various higher education qualifications. These studies control for a range of factors that affect earnings, other than having a HE qualification&mdash;such as age, gender, prior educational attainment&mdash;although they do vary in the extent to which other influential factors are taken into account. The studies do not tell us exactly what a particular graduate would have earned had they not have obtained a higher education qualification. We can only observe one reality for any individual&mdash;i.e. their actual earnings given that they did get a HE qualification. However, they do provide the closest estimates that we can get of the earnings they could have had.</p>
	<p pid=".726W.0/4">There is, unsurprisingly, some variation in the results of these studies, indicating that the increase in earnings from having a first degree compared to two or more A-levels is in the range of around 20&ndash;30 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".726W.3/2">The cost-benefit studies we have undertaken relate to the private and social rates of return to a degree. Private rates of return compare the costs and benefits of higher education to individuals, including their contribution towards course costs and post-tax earnings benefits. Social rates of return include these private costs and benefits, but also take into account the costs and benefits to society as a whole. Social rates of return estimate the value to the economy of investment in higher education by, broadly, expressing the net increase in national output relative to the resource cost of the higher education courses. The increase in national output is proxied by the difference in graduates' pre-tax earnings compared to those with only two or more A levels, after taking into account non-wage labour costs, which also reflect the value associated with employing a graduate.</p>
	<p pid=".726W.3/3">The table provides the results of the studies undertaken in the last five or so years. They show that social rates of return have held up, with current estimates around 8&ndash;10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".726W.3/4">Private rates of return to a first degree are higher than social rates. This is primarily because individuals contribute only partially to the costs, but also because social rates are likely to be under-estimates because they exclude social benefits that are difficult to quantify in financial terms, such as health benefits, longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality and reduced crime.</p>

	<p pid=".727W.2/1">The available information, showing participation by young people in higher education for each of the standard social class categories, is shown in the following table. Participation rates for individual occupations within these categories are not held centrally. There was an increase in entrant numbers in 1997 related partly to the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.2/2">The Government is committed to raising the participation rates for people from less affluent family backgrounds, and has introduced Excellence Challenge, including the AimHigher campaign, which is targeted at raising attainment and aspirations among young people who traditionally would not consider going to university.</p>

	<p pid=".732W.9/1">The New Deal has helped over 380,000 young people move into work throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.9/2">We are building on the programme's success, focusing more help on the most disadvantaged unemployed people in the most deprived areas of the country. We are, for example: introducing StepUP pilots in 20 deprived areas to provide transitional jobs for people who remain unemployed after the New Deal; starting to roll out the second phase of progress2work, providing recovering drug misusers with the extra help they need to move into work; running the Minority Ethnic Outreach programme in wards within five areas to strengthen the support available to jobless people from minority ethnic communities; and starting pilots in nine areas giving extra support for other disadvantaged groups such as ex-offenders, alcohol misusers and homeless people.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.9/3">In addition, Action Teams for Jobs and Employment Zones are operating in areas with persistently high levels of unemployment, and have so far helped nearly 78,000 people into work. We are currently developing proposals to extend Employment Zone help to other client groups including New Deal returners.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.3/1">The Department for Work and Pensions will be converting people to direct payment over a two-year period, with the first payments going into accounts in April 2003. An information campaign will support the conversion.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/2">Informing people about the availability of the Post Office card account is part of this campaign rather than a separate advertising initiative. We need to ensure that people are aware of the range of options open to them, and in a position to choose what is appropriate and convenient for them. Our information campaign will take customers through the changes, including getting their money from their account at the Post Office and the availability of the Post Office card account.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/3">There will be two main elements to our campaign. Customers will be supplied directly with information, which clearly sets out their Xaccount options&quot; and enables them to decide which account is right for them. Customers do not need to take any action until they receive a letter about the change. Until then they can keep their order book or giro.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/4">In addition, we plan to make more general information available and also undertake some advertising. This activity will be timed to coincide with the build up of the number of people transferring to direct payment into accounts. Again, this activity will include reference to all of the Xaccount options&quot; including the Post Office card account.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/5">The Government and Post Office Limited are working together to ensure that front-line Post Office staff have all the information they need to answer any questions from customers about banking facilities in Post Office branches.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/6">The first invitation letters asking for account details started to go out to some Child Benefit customers at the end of October, other customers will be contacted in due course. The Veterans Agency started writing to its customers in early October.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/7">The Post Office plan to have their card account service available from April 2003. The banks' own basic bank accounts are scheduled to become available through Post Office branches at the same time.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/8">Since many people will rely on the card account to collect their benefit, pension or tax credit, it is essential that the systems supporting the card account are reliable and robust. The Post Office are carrying out extensive testing of systems, and also intend to undertake some piloting work in advance of April 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.3/9">In line with good practice, and in order to minimise risk, the intention is gradually to build up (starting from April 2003) the number of benefit customers and pensioners that we pay through the Post Office card account. As the system proves itself in live running, we will increase the number of people paid through the card account. And, at an appropriate time, those new tax credit customers who have asked for a Post Office card account will start to have their payment made in this way. In the intervening period, Tax Credit customers opting for a card account will be paid by giro and DWP customers by order book or giro as appropriate.</p>

These will be piloted in six areas across the country starting from late 2003, combining support to find jobs with health-focused rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/4">The programmes will be complementary to any clinical care already being provided by primary care and community services in pilot areas. Their key focus will be to help those with conditions such as depression, back pain and heart disease understand the impact that their condition has and increase their confidence to work or train and lead as normal a life as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/5">In addition, the Job Retention and Rehabilitation Pilot Project, a joint initiative with the Department of Health, is currently exploring ways in which we can support people faced with losing their employment through prolonged sickness or disability. The pilot will run from early 2003 to 2005, and will aim to provide robust evidence about the relative impact of three intervention strategies (boosting healthp are, boosting workplace support and a combined approach) in helping people to return to work.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.5/1">The existence of empty property can be symptomatic of an underlying and complex interaction of wider social problems, including urban and rural decay, unemployment, crime and vandalism, anti-social behaviour etc. Solutions, therefore, are not just about good housing management, but require more complex strategies and inter-agency initiatives. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, as the comprehensive regional housing authority for Northern Ireland, has put in place a number of measures to address the problem of empty homes in the public and private sectors throughout the province.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/2">Local strategies have already been implemented to address the range of problems occurring in difficult to let areas. The Housing Executive's existing action plan has been progressed as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/3" class="indent">Estate strategies involving improvement, sale and/or selective demolition have been put in place for numerous estates (currently 1,500 public sector properties are scheduled for demolition).</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/4" class="indent">The general over-supply problems of the 'new towns' growth centres (Craigavon, Antrim, Ballymena) have been systematically addressed and improved although further work is required.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.5/6" class="indent">Urban renewal programmes in private areas involving improvement, replacement or a combination.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/7" class="indent">Grant aid including group repair schemes in some private areas exhibiting signs of decline.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/8">Marketing, community safety and anti-blight measures in public sector estates including use of alarm systems, the appointment of neighbourhood wardens and other security measures. Improvement or demolition of unpopular, non-traditional housing including decapitation (partial demolition); privatisation and more intensive management eg concierge.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/9" class="indent">The emergence of a number of locations as existing or potential over-supply areas have been under investigation and individual estate strategies have been and are being brought forward.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/10">In addition, legislation is proposed that will provide for the introduction of a shorthold tenancy, to be managed by the housing associations. This is designed to allow vacant properties to be let for short periods where owners are reluctant to let for longer terms.</p>

	<p pid=".747W.9/2">We are seeking to strengthen the evidence base on the fluoridation of water so that health communities wishing to consider this option for reducing dental decay may have fuller information on the effects of fluoride on health. We have also introduced the XBrushing for Life&quot; scheme whereby Health Visitors provide oral health advice to mothers of infants and give them a pack containing a toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste to encourage the early establishment of good oral hygiene habits. The scheme is supported in areas with the highest rates of tooth decay in children.</p>

This requires primary care trusts (PCTs) to set in place policies to reduce smoking, to promote healthy eating, to promote physical activity and to reduce overweight and obesity.

Smoking cessation aids have also been made available on NHS prescription.

	<p pid=".757W.0/1">The Social Exclusion Unit Teenage Pregnancy Report was published in June 1999. This set out the Government's teenage pregnancy strategy with the goal of reducing the under 18 conception rate by 50 per cent., by 2010. An interim reduction target of 15 per cent., by 2004 is set out in the Government Manifesto and NHS Plan. A second goal of the strategy is to increase to 60 per cent., by 2010 the participation of teenage parents in education, training or employment to reduce their long term risk of social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.0/2">The strategy has a 30 point action plan. 26 of the action points have been completed with two action points, 11 and 20, due to be completed by the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.0/3">Action point 13 is to deliver guidance on the circumstances in which different health professionals may prescribe, supply and administer contraceptives to under 16s. Further work is being undertaken to identify the extent and nature of confusion among health professionals to inform the need and content of further guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.0/4">The target completion date for Action point 29 is 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.0/5">There are encouraging early signs that the strategy is working. There has been a 6 per cent., reduction in the under 18 and under 16 conception rate from the baseline year of 1998 with latest data showing a reduction in the under 18 conception rate for the 12th successive quarter.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.0/6">However, considerable further work is needed to ensure that activity is sustained and monitored. Our response to the first annual report of the independent advisory group on teenage pregnancy was published in June 2002 and sets out a further programme of work to deliver our headline goals. Our commitment is further underlined by the inclusion of the under 18 reduction target in the public service agreements for both the Department and local government.</p>

	<p pid=".765W.2/1">We have made it clear in the past that the National Minimum Standards will be continuously monitored. We had always proposed to review them within the first three years of operation, and in the light of the review consider any changes needed. Where significant changes are proposed, the Government have pledged that there will be another consultation process to ensure that the views of the sector are fully represented.</p>

	<p pid=".765W.2/3">The consultation document draws attention to the package of measures the Department launched in January 2002 to smooth the introduction of the national standards. This included comprehensive statutory guidance to the Commission, under section 6 of the Care Standards Act, setting out the supportive way in which the standards should be applied. The guidance indicates that the standards should be used to help guide all care homes on action they can take to improve their services. In addition, in August 2002, we issued guidance on the regulation of supported housing and care homes.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.2/4">Responses to the consultation have been received from a range of interested parties, including the voluntary and charitable sector organisations.

	<p pid=".773W.8/1">Ritalin is indicated as a part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children over six years of age where remedial measures alone prove insufficient. In October 2000, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published an appraisal of the use of the drug methlphenidate (main brand name Ritalin) in the treatment of childhood ADHD, and issued clinical guidelines for its use, including the need for regular monitoring of children receiving this therapy. NICE recommended long-term follow-up of adverse effects and the potential for misuse of the drug in assessing long-term benefits and health gain into adulthood.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.8/2">As with all medicines, the safety of methylphenidate is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency and the independent advisory body, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines. Comprehensive information on the use of methylphenidate, including possible side effects, contraindications and precautions is contained in the summary of product characteristics produced by the manufacturer and approved by the licensing authority. Review by NICE of its guidance on the use of methylphenidate is scheduled for August 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".776W.2/1">Following a three month consultation exercise, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will shortly make and lay before Parliament Regulations to transpose the Directive including its requirements under Article 7. These Regulations will ban the use of such terms, which suggest that a particular tobacco product is less harmful than others. The Directive requires this ban to be in effect by <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-30">30 September 2003</phrase>. Article 7 is subject to a challenge in the European Court of Justice and judgement is expected shortly. If necessary, the Regulations will be amended to reflect the judgement.</p>

	<p pid=".778W.0/1">Neither the BBC nor TV Licensing are subject to the powers of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and there are therefore no formal findings of maladministration against the BBC or TV Licensing. However, TV Licensing operates its own complaints procedures and if a member of the public remains unsatisfied with the outcome the BBC will also consider the complaint. Goodwill payments in relation to the administration of the television licensing system are made by TV Licensing rather than the BBC. Information on the number of such payments is available only for the period since Capita took over the TV Licensing contract in July this year. From July to October 2002, TV Licensing made a total of 825 goodwill payments.</p>

	<p pid=".778W.3/1">My Department continues to encourage the competitiveness of the UK broadcast-related industries through its wide-ranging support for the creative industries, working in partnership with all stakeholders within Government and the industry to examine ways of enhancing performance at home and overseas. As part of this work, in November 1999 DCMS published the report of the UK Television Exports Inquiry which specifically looked at how Government and the industry could work together to enhance export performance, to lower barriers to investment and to increase the international attractiveness of UK television programmes. DCMS continues to work with the industry and with Skillset in taking forward the recommendations of the Audio Visual Industries Training Group to meet future skills needs.</p>
	<p pid=".778W.3/2">We are also promoting competitiveness through targets set for BBC commercial income and through the promotion of digital broadcasting, where the UK has maintained world leadership, with 40 per cent. of households having access to digital television across the platforms. We have approved new digital BBC services which enhance the digital proposition. With the Department of Trade and Industry, and in consultation with broadcasters, manufacturers and consumer representatives, we have published the Digital Television Action Plan. This sets out what needs to be done by whom and by when in order to meet the criteria for full switchover. We have also taken steps to encourage digital radio development by aligning the licence period for digital and analogue licences. The Communications Bill provides the framework for enhancing competitiveness further and extending the take-up of digital television.</p>

	<p pid=".779W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-19">19 November</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State introduced the Communications Bill, which will establish the new regulatory framework for broadcasting and the communications industries. This framework recognises, both within Ofcom's general duties and the detail of the regulatory provisions, the importance of competition, of investment and of innovation in delivering the dynamic market for communications services which we want to see in the United Kingdom. A dynamic, competitive market will encourage the development and take-up of new technologies, to the benefit of business, consumers and the UK economy. The proposals in the Bill also address the challenges of technological convergence, in providing for regulation by a single body and for a flexible regime capable of accommodating further change.</p>

Furthermore, the role of this Department's new music industry adviser, Stephen Navin, includes the provision of advice on combatting piracy. The British Phonographic Industry estimates that the total value of commercially pirated singles and albums in 2001 totalled &pound;27.6 million; information on the number of illegally produced records in 2002 is not yet available.</p>

	<p pid=".783W.5/1">The Government appreciates that the present uncertainty about the completion of the National Football Centre has created some concern, both locally and among those with a general interest in the future success of the England team. However, this is entirely a matter for the Football Association. Neither I nor my right hon .Friend the Secretary of State have discussed the matter with the FA, and Ministers have no plans to visit the site. The Government's priority is the continued development of grass roots football, which my Department funds through the Football Foundation. The arrangements made for the coaching of elite players must remain the responsibility of football itself.</p>

	<p pid=".784W.0/1">During the course of the 2002 Spending Review, the Department has looked at the performance of its sponsored bodies and at the effectiveness of funding agreements as a means of performance management. The conclusions from our assessment are positive, but we have plans for further improvements: the introduction of more streamlined funding agreements that will focus on delivery of our four strategic priorities; and the earmarking of resources in the 2003&ndash;06 period, specifically to help non-departmental public bodies improve efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid=".785W.0/1">there are no regulations specifically to protect hand-painted street advertising. It is possible that such advertising can be protected by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, which requires the Secretary of State to compile lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest. An advertisement that has been painted on to a building would be protected if the building itself was listed.</p>
	<p pid=".785W.0/2">At the launch of the State of the Historic Environment Report on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November</phrase>, we announced plans&mdash;in partnership with English Heritage&mdash;to improve and refocus the way the UK's built environment receives statutory protection. These will include a review of the current designation system, with a view to changing it to one that sustains the historic environment as a whole rather than relating in a piecemeal way to its constituent parts. This review will take around a year to report.</p>

We have been looking at the current availability of equipment and videos, and emphasising the importance which we attach to access for the hard of hearing. DVDs normally include sub-titles.</p>
