	<p pid="a.201W.0/1">It is important that children and young people from across the UK are actively encouraged to participate in the wide range of opportunities created by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.0/2">Over 17,000 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games' (LOCOG) education programme Get Set, with 286 schools and colleges registered in Lancashire. LOCOG launched the official London 2012 mascots last year, which are now inspiring children and young people. LOCOG hosted a 'Get Set to make your mascot' school competition. The winning primary and secondary schools win a visit from Wenlock or Mandeville in the summer term-ideally to their school sports day.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.0/3">Over 1,100 cultural or sporting projects across the UK have been awarded the Inspire mark, with 143 of these in the north-west, such as Supporter to Reporter (S2R). S2R gives young people sports reporting opportunities at national and local events. Participants receive training to produce audio, video, text and image reports with content then published on the youth-led website.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.0/4">Young ambassadors is a London 2012 programme managed by Youth Sport Trust which has been running in England, Scotland and Wales, it was the first initiative to receive the London 2012 Inspire mark for education. It involves young people being recruited to be ambassadors, working in their schools and communities to champion sport and the values of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.0/5">The School Games will give every school the opportunity to get involved. Sport England has commissioned the Youth Sport Trust to test how to deliver School Games in nine pilot areas. In June or July 2011, these sites will host the first 'School Games' Days in 500 schools and the first nine 'Festivals of Sport'. All schools will be given the opportunity to participate from September 2011 with the first national finals taking place in the Olympic Stadium in May 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.0/6">In addition, I announced the 'Places People Play' programme, which will bring sporting legacy to life in communities across the country. This will be achieved by transforming the places where people play sport, inspiring people to make sport happen at a local level and creating sporting opportunities that give everyone the chance to become part of the mass participation legacy.

	<p pid="a.206W.8/1">The regime's crackdown against protestors' legitimate calls for reform has been totally unacceptable. Our interest throughout has been to protect civilians (both our own nationals and Libyans caught up in the violence) and prevent further bloodshed. UN Security Council resolution 1973 is designed to safeguard Libya's civilian population from human rights abuses carried out by the Libyan forces. After its adoption, the UK made clear that if Colonel Gaddafi did not comply with this resolution, it would be enforced through military action. Colonel Gaddafi's forces continued to advance on Benghazi and kill civilians. Our armed forces have therefore participated in a co-ordinated international coalition strike against key military installations.</p>

	<p pid="a.207W.3/1">The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I have been deeply concerned by events in Yemen since demonstrations began in mid-January. I have been shocked by the heavy-handedness of the Yemeni security forces, in particular the use of live fire to control demonstrators. In a number of public statements the Secretary of State and I have urged the Government of Yemen to respect the right to peaceful protest and to urgently acknowledge the legitimate concerns of protestors. In a press statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-18">18 March 2011</phrase> the Secretary of State condemned the violence in Sana'a, called for those responsible to be brought to justice and stressed the Yemeni Government's obligations to uphold the rule of law and its international human rights commitments. I too was appalled by the unacceptable levels of violence in Sana'a and raised my concern directly with the Yemeni Foreign Minister. The Government continue to emphasise to the Government of Yemen the importance of dialogue and the need to avoid undermining ongoing efforts to establish peace and stability.</p>

	<p pid="a.207W.7/1">The number of military working dogs (MWD) in each location fluctuates throughout the year. They are moved between locations to meet the specific needs of the armed forces, such as support to operations and standing commitments. This also ensures that each dog continues to be employed in both the best possible MWD team (handler and dog) combination and environment for each dog's welfare and veterinary needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.7/2">Information can therefore only be presented as a snapshot in time. As at <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-28">28 March 2011</phrase>, the Army had a total of 229 trained dogs and 138 dogs currently being trained across 17 different locations within the UK and overseas. The Royal Air Force had a total of 212 trained and five being trained across 21 different locations within the UK and overseas. The Royal Navy have no MWDs.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.7/3">MWDs fall broadly into two categories: protection and detection. Protection dogs are trained to guard. Detection dogs are trained to search for items and substances (such as drugs, arms, ammunition and explosives) and can also be trained to track or detect human scent.</p>
	<p pid="a.207W.7/4">I am withholding specific detail on the numbers of MWDs in operational theatres as its disclosure would, or would be likely to prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of our armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.208W.2/10">These figures are based upon the last site at which the dog served as retirement records do not show which service they were with. The figures do not include dogs within the Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency and other guarding organisations. The general principle followed for MWD in service is that without compromise to their health and welfare, the effective working life of all Ministry of Defence (MOD) dogs should be maximised. When a dog reaches the end of its working life the aim is to re-home it with a member of the general public. Primary consideration is given to what is best for the dog and public safety. Following an examination by a veterinarian to document current health status, all routine veterinary treatment is provided prior to leaving service, so that the dog moves to its new home in the best veterinary state. Once re-homed, the dogs are the responsibility of their new owner and no further provision is made for them by the MOD. Dogs are put down only as a last resort.</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.11/1">New and extensive use of employer financed retirement benefit schemes (EFRBS) to provide retirement benefits would create significant risk around the yield projected from the restriction of pensions' tax relief that is due to take effect from the 2011-12 tax year onwards. This would not be in keeping with the principle of creating a more affordable pensions tax regime. The Government are therefore introducing legislation in the Finance Bill 2011 to ensure that EFRBS are not more tax advantaged than for pension savings into registered pension schemes beyond the annual and lifetime allowances.</p>

	<p pid="a.215W.2/1">It is estimated that a 50% tax charge on contributions to employer financed retirement benefit schemes (EFRBS) would yield around &#163;40 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.215W.2/2">At Budget 2011, a measure was introduced to prevent tax avoidance through 'disguised remuneration', which includes the use of EFRBS. It will work by subjecting earmarking by EFRBS of sums and assets paid to them as contributions to tax and national insurance in the same way as cash remuneration. Importantly, the measure is expected to protect future tax revenues, by closing off opportunities to avoid restrictions to tax relief on pension contributions to registered pension schemes through the use of EFRBS.</p>

	<p pid="a.216W.0/3">The Government do not give out information on expected proceeds from individual asset sales.

	<p pid="a.216W.0/5">Neither Ministers or officials have had any discussions with the UK-based employees of Urenco or their trade union representatives on the implications of a potential sale.

	<p pid="a.224W.2/1">The Home Office has collected data on selected offences involving the use of a knife or sharp instrument via a special additional data collection since April 2007. Data are collected for the following offence categories: attempted murder, threats to kill, actual bodily harm (ABH) and grievous bodily harm (GBH), robbery, rape and sexual assaults. The collection does not include data on whether or not an injury was sustained, though the ABH and GBH categories may be of most relevance to the question.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/2">The data for ABH and GBH offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument for 2008-09 and 2009-10 are provided in table A. These data were published in tables 7.13 and 7.14 of 'Crime in England and Wales 2009/10' via the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs10/hosb1210chap7.xls">http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs10/hosb1210chap7.xls</a></p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/4">Data for 2007-08 are not comparable to those for subsequent years for a number of reasons. Firstly, in 2007-08, the offences that were included in the knife and sharp instrument collection were: attempted murder, GBH with intent, GBH without intent and robbery. In 2008-09, this was expanded to also include: threats to kill, ABH, sexual assault and rape.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/5">Secondly, there was a clarification in the counting rules for GBH with intent between 2007-08 and 2008-09. Some forces were classifying on injury sustained rather than intent. However, this does not affect the totals presented in the answer, as both GBH with intent and GBH without intent are included in both years.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/6">Finally, a 2009 audit of how bottle and glass offences are recorded in the knife and sharp instrument data collection identified that some forces were including unbroken bottle and glass offences in their returns, which are outside the scope of this collection. The offence most affected was ABH. Some forces resubmitted data for 2008-09 and these revised figures are included in the answer. However, four forces were unable to provide figures that separate out the unbroken bottle and glass offences, and a number of unbroken bottle and glass offences are included.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/7">Revised data were not requested for 2007-08, as ABH was not collected for this time period. Robbery and attempted murder offences are rarely carried out with unbroken bottles, so are largely unaffected.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/8">Data for 2007-08 are provided in table B and are also available in table 7.11 of 'Crime in England and Wales 2008/09' via the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/9" class="indent"><a href="http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb1109chap7new.xls">http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb1109chap7new.xls</a></p>
	<p pid="a.224W.2/10">Data for homicides involving the use of a knife or sharp instrument are collected via the Homicide Index. These are provided in table C.</p>

They do advise magistrates that the requirements imposed in a community order must be suitable for the individual offender and, among other things, will be influenced by the ability of the offender to comply, and the availability of the requirements in the local area. The guidelines also advise that whenever the court reaches the provisional view that a community order may be appropriate, it should usually request a pre-sentence report from probation. The pre-sentence report will provide information on the offender that will help the court to decide whether to impose a community order and, if so, whether particular requirements are suitable for an individual offender.</p>

	<p pid="a.239W.6/1">DEFRA does not collect definitive figures on the area of crops grown for the production of biofuels in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.239W.6/2">Some information on the area of oilseed rape grown for use in biofuel production is available from the Energy Aid scheme. The latest published information shows that in 2009 there were almost 86 thousand hectares of oilseed rape grown under this scheme in England. This is equivalent to around 16% of the total area of oilseed rape grown in England and less than 2% of the total croppable area in England. These figures may not capture all oilseed rape grown for biofuel production; only that declared under this particular scheme. Oilseed rape grown on other land which may have been used for biofuel production is not known because there is no way of identifying the end use of the crop.</p>
	<p pid="a.239W.6/3">Sugar beet is grown in the UK for bioethanol production. In 2009 we estimated that around seven thousand hectares was used to produce bioethanol. This is equivalent to around 6% of the total area of sugar beet grown in the UK and less than 0.2% of the total croppable area in England. It should be noted that this is a derived figure that includes an element of data extrapolation rather than final figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.239W.6/4">A UK biorefinery using wheat to produce bioethanol started production in 2009 but we are unable to provide information on its wheat use since this would breach data confidentiality requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.242W.0/1">The Government strongly supports the concept of collaboration by farmers. However decisions about whether or not to establish an agricultural co-operative can only be made on a commercial basis by the individual farmer, or group of farmers concerned. While the co-operative business model may not suit everyone, it is widely acknowledged that farmer-owned co-operatives and other forms of collaborative enterprise can offer a number of important benefits. These include increased purchasing and negotiating power for their members and the ability to enhance their members' returns by investing in facilities that give added value to their products. Support for co-operation and for the establishment of supply chain collaboration has been provided, and will continue to be provided, under the rural development programme for England.</p>

	<p pid="a.245W.2/1">The process of designation of European marine sites (Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas) is set out in the Habitats and Wild Birds Directives and the associated guidance issued by the European Commission. These directives are primarily transposed by the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, the Offshore Marine Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c.) Regulations 2007 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Proposals for all sites and their associated impact assessments are subject to public consultation. Recommendations for sites are made to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by the Government's statutory nature conservation bodies (SNCBs) based upon the best available scientific evidence. DEFRA considers whether the recommendations meet the criteria set out in the directives. It should be noted that socio-economic factors cannot be taken into account in selecting sites. If suitable, the sites are put forward to the European Commission for designation.</p>
	<p pid="a.245W.2/2">The principles for designation of Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) are set out in the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. For the areas where the Secretary of State has responsibility for selecting MCZs, the SNCBs-Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee-have set up four regional MCZ projects to identify potential sites and have provided guidance on the process that should be followed. Each project has established stakeholder groups made up of a variety of key stakeholders in their regions to examine the evidence and put forward site recommendations and associated Impact Assessments. In November 2011, the SNCBs are due to come forward with their statutory conservation advice on the creation of MCZs and formally submit the regional stakeholder project recommendations and Impact Assessments to DEFRA. These recommendations will be based on the best available evidence, and the impacts on social and economic factors will also be considered. The independent Science Advisory Panel will comment on the extent to which these recommendations would contribute to an ecologically coherent network of Marine Protected Areas in the UK. Government officials will consider this information and make recommendations to Ministers on proposals for a formal consultation exercise to be held in early 2012. The Government will take final decisions in light of responses to that exercise.</p>

	<p pid="a.246W.8/1">In England the hen harrier &quot;Circus cyaneus&quot; is an extremely rare bird and is afforded strong protection under domestic legislation and European directives which together provide a powerful framework for the protection of the birds, their eggs, nests and habitats. This includes two Special Protection Areas classified in part for their breeding hen harrier populations. In addition to this legal protection, raptor persecution is currently one of the UK's wildlife crime priorities as part of the Partnership Against Wildlife Crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.8/2">A number of measures are being taken to increase the hen harrier population. In 2002 Natural England launched the Hen Harrier Recovery Project which aims to investigate the factors limiting hen harrier population growth and develop jointly agreed solutions with stakeholders to enable hen harrier recovery. It has set up a programme of stakeholder dialogue facilitated by the Environment Council (an independent charity which works with different organisations, including Government and NGOs, with the objective of reaching a sustainable solution) to find ways improve hen harrier population growth alongside the needs of grouse moor managers. DEFRA contributed &#163;3,680 to this work in the 2010-11 financial year.

	<p pid="a.251W.8/1">The Work Programme funding model has been designed to strongly encourage providers to get people into long term sustainable employment. However, we acknowledge that in some cases people will move jobs, as may be the case in areas where seasonal employment is high. As such a period of employment for which a provider can claim an outcome does not necessarily need to be with one employer, but may be made up of two or more periods of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.251W.8/2">This allows providers to take into account the local labour markets in areas where there may be a high proportion of seasonal employment. However, the emphasis of the Work Programme will, quite rightly, remain in getting people permanent employment in which they can progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March 2011</phrase>, the Government announced that, following consultation, a carbon price floor for electricity generation will be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April 2013</phrase>. The carbon price floor will start at around &#163;16 per tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO2) and follow a linear path to &#163;30/tCO2 in 2020 (in real 2009 prices) to drive investment in the low-carbon power sector. The carbon price support rates for 2013-14 will be equivalent to &#163;4.94/tCO2. Accompanying the announcement, HMRC published a tax information and impact note, available online at:</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.6/3">Based on the market prices of fossil fuels and carbon, the economic determinants published at Budget, and assuming full pass through to the wholesale electricity price, average annual household electricity bills will increase by around 1% (&#163;6 in real 2009 prices) in 2013 and around 4% (&#163;17 in real 2009 prices) in 2016 compared to what they otherwise would have been. However, in the late 2020s electricity bills will be between 2-4% lower than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

Emissions from electrical appliances are also subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme arrangements.

In addition, in October 2010, Ministers held a roundtable discussion with senior councillors and local authority representatives to discuss mechanisms for increasing accountability in the setting of senior pay in local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.270W.2/2">The Secretary of State receives representations from local authorities on a broad range of issues. Of course, the Government's role in specific local government pay issues is extremely limited as they are, rightly, a matter for the individual councils as the employer. Councils must make sure, however, that their decisions on pay and work force are fully in the interests of communities they represent and give them the value for money they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.270W.2/3">The Department has also been consulting on proposed new transparency arrangements to increase public scrutiny of senior salaries in local government. A summary of the consultation responses will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.276W.2/2">The information provided about children who were reported as missing from their agreed placement was derived from the SSDA903 return which collects information on children looked after between <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase> each year. This return is completed annually by 152 local authority social services departments in England. Information on looked after children is available in the Statistical First Release 'Children looked after by Local Authorities in England (including adoption and care leavers)-year ending <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>' which is available on the Department's website via the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.276W.2/4">If an MP tables a PQ which would cost the Department more than &#163;800 to answer we may decline to respond on the grounds that the Department would incur a disproportionate cost. This roughly equates to one person incurring three and a half days work. Answering the first part of the question took around one and a half days.</p>
	<p pid="a.276W.2/5">The second part of the question asked about the type of placement from which looked after children went absent from. It was found, owing to the complex procedures required to extract and collate the data required, that producing the information would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold.</p>

	<p pid="a.278W.2/1">Our intention is to produce a new slimmed down national curriculum which sets out the essential knowledge that all children should acquire, and gives teachers greater flexibility to decide how to teach this most effectively and to design a wider school curriculum that best meets the needs of their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.2/2">We have announced that the statutory core subjects-English, mathematics and science-will remain compulsory at all four key stages in future, along with physical education. For all other subjects, we believe it is right that there should be a debate about whether they should remain part of the national curriculum, with statutory programmes of study, or whether it should be for schools to decide the content of their courses in those subjects as well as the way they should be taught. The Government's national curriculum review panels are currently seeking views on these issues as part of its call for evidence for the review, and we will announce our proposals early next year. At that point there will be a further period of consultation before final decisions are taken.</p>

There is clear evidence that any absence from school can have an impact on pupils' attainment. The aim should, therefore, be 100% attendance in school, except for reasons of illness or special circumstances such as the inflexibility of leave patterns for parents which make it impossible to take family holidays outside of term time, this is provided for under the pupil registration regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.289W.3/2"><i> </i>We are in the process of reducing the number of arm's length bodies (ALBs) and improving accountability. That process involves reviewing the functions carried out by each ALB and, for those functions that will continue, determining the most appropriate method of delivery. In most cases, delivery will be through new Executive agencies which are more directly accountable within the Department. The review of QCDA's functions has been completed and there are no plans to put QCDA's functions out to tender commercially.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.3/3">In terms of the commercial contracts which underpin each of the continuing functions, we are currently assessing each existing contract to determine the necessary action. This could be to terminate, novate, extend or re-tender, depending on the requirements of the Executive agency and the position of the contract. The national curriculum testing contract has already gone through the review process and is currently part of an <i> Official Journal</i> of the European Union (OJEU) tender exercise which aims to award a new one year contract (with the option to extend for a further year) for the testing service requirements.</p>

I met a cross-section of QCDA staff working on statutory assessment and testing on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-16">16 March 2011</phrase>.

However, officials in the Department and staff in QCDA with responsibility for the transition, are now engaged in consultation as part of a voluntary redundancy scheme. Where functions are transferring, individuals who work predominantly on those functions will have a right to transfer to the Department under the Cabinet Office Statement of Practice on Staff Transfers in the Public Sector (COSOP). We will-provide further detail as to the number of redundancies and transfers once members of staff, through the consultation process, have first been informed as to whether or not they will transfer.</p>

Funding of &#163;47 million has just been paid to school sport partnerships to fund their work up until the end of the summer term 2011. This is on top of &#163;71 million which was paid to partnerships in October last year. In addition, further new funding of &#163;65 million will be paid to secondary schools, including those in Bradford South, over the next two academic years. This will pay for the release of a PE teacher for one day a week to work with local primary schools to improve provision for competitive sport in their own school and in local primary schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.291W.5/2">Furthermore, at the Sports Colleges Conference in Telford in February, the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport announced outline plans for a network of school games organisers from September 2011. These organisers will be funded by the Department of Health and Sport England for three days a week to help schools sign up for the nationwide school games. Further details will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.291W.5/3">Taken together, this package of funding will enable schools to maximise the opportunities for competitive sport that they provide for their pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.292W.5/1">The Department is not funding school sport partnerships after this school year, and therefore we have no plans to monitor or evaluate them in future. Instead, the Government will make available &#163;65 million of new funding for schools to enable them to provide more opportunities for competitive sports. This funding will pay for one day a week of a secondary PE teacher's time to be spent out of the classroom, encouraging greater take-up of competitive sport in primary schools and securing a fixture network for schools to increase the amount of intra and inter-school competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.5/2">We have also lifted the previous Administration's requirements on schools to meet national targets, to monitor all pupils in all schools, and to complete an annual survey, as we think these were unnecessarily burdensome. Freeing schools from these requirements will give them more time to organise competitive sport for all pupils.</p>

I am pleased that the Speaker of the House of Commons has confirmed continuing support for the UK Youth Parliament in 2011-12 including for the annual debate in the Commons chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.0/4">Giving young people a voice in public decisions which affect them is a key principle underpinning the Government's youth policy. Members of the UK Youth Parliament make a valuable contribution to making the voices of young people heard within formal democratic processes and these measures will ensure that their work can continue.</p>

It also identified the UK as having one of the least onerous employment regulation systems. But perceptions can matter as much as facts or figures. We must make it clear that Britain is open for business and that employers need not fear taking on employees. The Government have just announced a number of measures to remove barriers to growth which contribute to the ongoing employment law review. The Government will also continue working to ensure that EU measures do not stifle UK labour market flexibility.</p>

We also propose that tuition costs for part-time students will be capped at a level which will be set pro-rata to the maximum amount chargeable to full-time students.

	<p pid="a.305W.5/1">e-skills UK is the Sector Skills Council for Business and Information Technology, working with employers, to produce the supply of technology skills the UK needs to succeed. They have developed a range of help for businesses and learners including IT professional apprenticeships which are meeting current and future skill needs and have been increasing their participation rates. A qualifications framework has been created to assess and develop skills in IT and enable learners to progress. A partnership of e-skills UK, employers and higher education has developed the Information Technology Management for Business Degree supported by major employers who offer placements and coaching, e-skills UK also supports small businesses to improve their IT skills through the Business IT Guide.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.5/2">In response to the IT skills needs of the most disadvantaged people, the Department is providing a further &#163;13 million in 2011-12 to UK online centres to provide support through internet access and IT skills training. UK online centres have provided support for 380,000 people in England since April 2010 to get online for the first time. The Online Basics qualification is now listed on the Qualifications and Credit Framework and fee remission will be available for those learners on work-ready benefits who require digital life skills.</p>

These ambitions are:</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.5/2" class="indent">1. to create the most competitive tax system in the G20;</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.5/3" class="indent">2. to make the UK one of the best places in Europe to start, finance and grow a business;</p>

	<p pid="a.307W.5/5" class="indent">4. to create a more educated work force that is the most flexible in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.5/6">The plan for growth also sets out major initiatives in relation to sectors covered by the growth review. The advanced manufacturing sector will particularly benefit from: changes to capital allowances; the establishment of a High Value Manufacturing Technology and Innovation Centre; the development of a new degree-equivalent higher level apprenticeship; and nine new university-based centres for innovative manufacturing.</p>

	<p pid="a.309W.0/1">The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) collects information on students in UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The most recent data available relates to the 2009/10 academic year. Figures for 2010/11 will be available in January 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.0/2">HESA use the Joint Academic Coding System (JACS) to code a student's subject of study, and Midwifery falls within the most detailed level of this coding system. However, it was only in 2009/10 that HEIs were required to record at this detailed level of coding. Therefore figures for years prior to 2009/10 will not accurately record the number of Midwifery students, as some HEIs may have coded these students as Nursing, rather than choosing the code at the more detailed level of Midwifery.</p>

Further information on these proportions can be found at:<br/> www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf<br/> The application of the NWPHO methodology was updated in summer 2010 and is now available directly from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Information about episodes estimated to be alcohol-related may be slightly different from previously published data.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup><i> Accident and emergency:</i><br/> Admission method codes 21 and 28 were used:<br/> 21: Emergency via Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E), including the casualty department of the provider;<br/> 28: Emergency: Other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another health care provider.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup><i> SHA/PCT of residence:</i><br/> The SHA or PCT containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br/> <i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. <i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> 2. <i> Data quality:</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.321W.0/4" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.0/5" class="indent">Table 1 provides the number of deaths where an alcohol-related cause was (i) the underlying cause of death, or (ii) mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, either as the underlying cause or as a contributory factor, in England and Wales, for 2007 to 2009 (the latest year available). The National Statistics definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption, as shown in Box 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.0/6" class="indent">It is not possible to provide figures for the number or proportion of deaths from (a) oesophageal cancer, (b) colorectal cancer, (c) breast cancer, (d) pancreatic cancer or (e) liver cancer which were caused by alcohol, from the information collected at death registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.0/7" class="indent">Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to the death to be recorded on the death certificate. Medical practitioners and coroners are not supposed to record all of the diseases or conditions present at or before death, and whether a condition contributed is a matter for their clinical judgment. Lifestyle and behavioural factors, such as the deceased's alcohol consumption, are not recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.0/8" class="indent">Estimates of alcohol-attributable mortality for specific causes of death in England have been published in a collaborative report by the Centre for Public Health at Liverpool John Moores University and the North West Public Health Observatory, The report, titled 'Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol attributable mortality and hospital admissions', is available at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.321W.0/10" class="indent">Table 2 provides the number of deaths where alcohol poisoning was the underlying cause of death, where the intent was (a) intentional (suicide), (b) accidental, or (c) undetermined, in England and Wales, for 2009 (the latest year available). The figures do not include deaths caused by suicide, accidents or other circumstances where the deceased had consumed alcohol before the event, as this information is not routinely recorded in coroner inquest reports or at death registration.</p>

	<p pid="a.324W.11/1">The provision of services by general practitioners (GPs) outside those contracted for under GP contractual arrangements is not a matter for the Department or for Government. As independent contractors this is something for the individual practice to determine. The Professional Fees Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) suggests fees for such services to help doctors set their own professional fees. However, these fees are guidelines only, not recommendations, and a doctor is not obliged to charge the rates suggested. Where doctors intend to charge for services to patients, the BMA advises them to forewarn patients, at the earliest opportunity, of the likely level of fees.</p>

	<p pid="a.327W.2/18">At the time of the spending review, the Department announced that capital grant funding for social care had been maintained in real terms for 2011-12, and would be allocated as a single funding stream. The capital grant will be worth &#163;124 million in 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.327W.2/19">Details of the allocations for the Learning Disabilities and Health Reform grant, and the social care capital grant, are contained within Local Authority Social Services Letter LASSL(DH)(2010)2. A copy of this letter has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.327W.2/20">Finally, the Department has made available &#163;162 million for 2010-11 and &#163;648 million for 2011-12 within the national health service in order to support social care and improve joint working between the two systems. Details about this funding have been set out in a letter from David Behan and David Flory to NHS and local authority chief executives, which can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.328W.2/1">The term &quot;Gold File&quot; refers to old paper files with a yellow cover which were held for each medicine on the United Kingdom market by the Medicines Control Agency (succeeded in 2003 by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)). These files are no longer used and cannot be considered a comprehensive record of the regulatory history of these products. They contain correspondence about the particular product licences and documents associated with routine regulatory procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.2/2">The marketing authorisation holder, not the MHRA, has a legal responsibility to retain all documents related to the product licence. Under MHRA record management policy, all files and data for licences are held for 15 years.</p>

This includes the file of interest related to Ativan which covers the period from July 1981 to June 1993. To redact this large file to make it public would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.331W.5/1">&quot;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&quot; sets out our commitment to expand radiotherapy capacity by investing around &#163;150 million in additional funding over the next four years. This will increase the utilisation of existing equipment, establish services where patients currently have long distances to travel for treatment and ensure that all high priority patients with a need for proton beam therapy treatment get access to it abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.5/2">Decisions to purchase high value equipment are made locally, and cases for procurement should take account of the available clinical evidence, potential demand and the costs of the different machines available that are capable of meeting the operational need. Cyberknife is a machine that delivers stereotactic body radiotherapy, and there are other machines on the market with similar capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.5/3">We recognise that ensuring patients have access to high quality modern radiotherapy techniques can deliver improved patient outcomes. We are investigating the potential development of a range of tariffs to incentivise high quality, cost-effective services, including the newest radiotherapy techniques.</p>

			<tr pid="a.336W.2/8"> <td colspan="5"><i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1. <i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><br/> FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> 2. <i> Main procedure</i><br/> The first recorded procedure or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (e.g. time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedures.<br/> 3. <i> SHA/PCT of residence</i><br/> The strategic health authority (SHA) or PCT containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br/> 4. <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> 5. <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.337W.2/1">Assessing and rewarding achievement of both locally and nationally defined Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) goals is the responsibility of local commissioners as part of their contractual relationship with providers and the Department does not collect specific data on the achievement of CQUIN goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.2/2">The National CQUIN goal on Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) 2010-11 is to ensure that 90% of admitted patients are risk assessed for VTE over three consecutive months. The period over which commissioners will assess achievement during 2010-11 is a matter for local negotiation between commissioners and providers, although published guidance states that achievement of the 90% must be over at least a full quarter to earn the related CQUIN payment. We understand that many providers are aiming to achieve the goal during the last quarter of 2010-11.</p>
