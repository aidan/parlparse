	<p pid=".128W.5/1">DFID is in regular contact with the Kenyan Government on this issue. DFID's Kenya Country Assistance Plan recognises that budget support is Kenya's preferred form of aid. It also makes clear that the level of British aid to Kenya, and whether or not DFID will provide bilateral poverty reduction budget support, will depend on the pace with which the Kenyan Government implements its Economic Recovery Strategy, especially in tackling corruption, preparing and implementing budgets that benefit the poor, and strengthening public financial management.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.5/2">Progress is not yet sufficient to enable us to provide such support. DFID is particularly concerned about recent reports of corruption allegedly involving senior members of the Kenyan Government and we have urged President Kibaki to ensure that appropriate and firm action is taken to investigate these reports, make the results public and take action against all those found to have acted corruptly. However, DFID will continue to use sectoral support and project aid where we believe that it can have a sustainable impact on poverty reduction and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in Kenya.</p>

	<p pid=".136W.5/1">DCMS encourages each of its sponsored museums and galleries to improve both intellectual and physical access to those collection items not on open display. Examples include the Natural History Museum Darwin Phase 1 Project which contains the Museum's remarkable collection of 22 million zoological items collected over the last 200 years and the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester's Collection Centre which opened up 70 per cent. of the Museum's collection to the public when it opened in 2001. The National Museum of Science and Industry will be opening a new branch of the National Railway Museum (Locomotion) at Shildon in September of this year. It will enable visitors to view up to 60 vehicles that they might not have been able to see previously. In each case the Department has contributed funding to these developments. We also encourage the development of virtual access. A recent example of this is 'Ingenious', the new website of the National Museum of Science and Industry which allows access to 30,000 images from its collections, which might not otherwise be seen.</p>

	<p pid=".137W.9/2">We have regular bilaterals on the cross-Government skills agenda. These bilaterals cover a host of skills related items including, where relevant, issues relating to gender and age in industry and academia. Women returners will be helped by reforms in the Government's Skills Strategy, including the new learner entitlement for those without qualifications, better learner support, and better Information Advice and Guidance. Steps have already been taken to improve services for adults such as the University for Industry (Ufi)/learndirect national advice service. DTI is also taking forward a strategy to improve women's representation in science, engineering and technology, including a resource centre with a specific women returners project.</p>
	<p pid=".137W.9/3">The Government are keen to ensure that everybody can access learning and qualifications and this is why the Access to Learning funds prioritise groups of students, like mature students who may have existing financial commitments, when allocating the funding. Other forms of financial support available are Career Development Loans, Parents Learning Allowance and the Adult Dependents Grant, which support students who have a financially dependent adult family member.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.3/1">Changes to the Apprenticeship programme recently announced will benefit all sectors including construction. We want to put in place a coherent ladder of high quality vocational opportunities responsive to the needs of young people, older workers and business. We intend to build a family of apprenticeship programmes to suit a variety of needs from aged 14 upwards. These will include: Young Apprenticeships for 14 to 16-year-olds, a pre-apprenticeship route within the existing Entry to Employment programme, Apprenticeships at NVQ Level 2, Advanced Apprenticeships at NVQ Level 3 and a strengthened progression route into higher education, including vocational Foundation Degrees.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.3/2">In addition we have set up a new network of employer-led Sector Skills Councils to work with government to meet the skill needs of their sectors. Construction Skills&mdash;the SSC for construction&mdash;was licensed in September 2003. A key role for SSCs is to encourage take up of apprenticeship places by young people and others.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.3/3">The number of new entrants to the sector rose by 4 per cent. between 2001/02 and 2002/03 and the construction sector is the second most popular Apprenticeship framework with over 23,000 young people in training. Construction was also the most popular sector for both young people and employers responding to the recent Apprenticeship marketing campaign.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.6/1">There are a number of ways in which the Government encourage people to resolve relationship difficulties in the interests of the child. The Marriage and Relationship Support (MARS) grant funds activities aimed at helping people establish, maintain and develop successful relationships with their partners. This includes encouraging people to resolve relationship difficulties in the interests of their children and meeting the needs of socially and commonly excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.6/2">The MARS programme (since 1997) provided grants as follows: 1997&ndash;98: &pound;3.4 million; 1998&ndash;99: &pound;3.0 million; 1999&ndash;2000: &pound;3.2 million. Following Sir Graham Hart's recommendations in his report to the Lord Chancellor on Marriage Support Funding (published in November 1999), the allocation was increased as follows: 2000&ndash;01: &pound;4 million; 2001&ndash;02: &pound;4.5 million; 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04: &pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.6/3">Additionally, Sure Start local programmes and Children's Centres provide a range of family support and counselling services and opportunities for couples to discuss relationship issues. Similarly, a Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) officer might be involved at court directions hearings in providing assistance to children and their families to help them reach agreement on arrangements for their children, primarily in respect of contact and residence.</p>

	<p pid=".142W.5/1">For Inner London, participation in education and training is only shown as a total because participation estimates for individual Inner London LEAs cannot be estimated reliably. This is due to considerable numbers of pupils who attend independent schools in an LEA other than the one in which they reside and residence information for independent school pupils is not available.

	<p pid=".148W.8/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mr. Rosindell dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-20">20 July 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question about the help available to those seeking employment in Havering. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/4" class="indent">There are two Jobcentre Plus offices delivering services to the people of Havering.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/5" class="indent">1. Romford Jobcentre Plus, 30 Main Road, Romford. Opened on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-07">7 June 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/6" class="indent">2. Hornchurch Jobcentre Plus, North Street, Hornchurch. Opened on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-24">24 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/7" class="indent">Both offices provide a range of services to customers seeking employment, including:</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/8" class="indent">access to a personal adviser to assist finding suitable employment;</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/9" class="indent">access to touch screen Jobpoints or the internet;</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/10" class="indent">entry to the New Deal programme;</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/11" class="indent">work trials, for customers to show employers what they can do or to try out a job.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/12" class="indent">Depending on personal circumstances there is other help available to help customers find employment. For example, lone parents may be able to get help with childcare costs. People with disabilities can get help from specialist Disability Employment Advisers or join New Deal for Disabled People. A range of training programmes is also available to provide extra support and help in getting, and keeping, a job. Further details on the services available are contained in leaflet PFL 2, available in Jobcentre Plus offices, or by visiting <a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk">www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/13" class="indent">Although these services are common to Jobcentre Plus offices, there are a range of local initiatives, specific to Havering, to help local people into work.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/14" class="indent">The Oldchurch Recruitment Centre, for example, opened in May 2004 and initially targeted the construction workers for the first phase of the development of the new Oldchurch Hospital. This positive partnership working with local employers has resulted in over 30 customers gaining employment at the site. To expand this scheme we are developing working agreements with the local Health trusts and have begun to match Jobcentre Plus customers with vacancies as they arise in local Hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/15" class="indent">Another initiative is with the new Asda supermarket, due to open in Romford in the autumn of 2005. Work is to begin on clearing the site in the autumn 2004 and we are in discussion to use our services to recruit people for the demolition and construction phases of the new store. Furthermore, we aim to undertake the entire recruitment of staff for this new supermarket.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/16" class="indent">We have also planned a number of events for the summer to specifically address the employment needs of customers in Havering. In partnership with the London Borough of Havering, Jobcentre Plus will be running a stand at the Havering Town Show on 29 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-30">30 August</phrase>. This will promote the services of Jobcentre Plus and assist customers in finding employment. Furthermore there will be a seasonal vacancy promotion in the Romford area on 21 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-22">22 September 2004</phrase> designed to match customers to upcoming Christmas vacancies.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/17" class="indent">The District Manager for North East London, has written to all local MPs offering to meet on a regular basis to discuss developments in the District.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/18" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".160W.3/30">2. The threshold '60 per cent. of median' (equivalised weekly household income) is the most commonly used in reporting absolute and relative trends in low income.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.3/31">3. The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, council tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error, and to remaining variability in non-response which is not corrected by the grossing regime.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.3/32">4. Equivalised incomes use the McClements equalisation scale.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.3/33">5. When reporting numbers of individuals in 'relative low income', we apply 60 per cent. of the median income for the year in question; therefore, this threshold changes from one year to the next.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.3/34">6. When reporting numbers of individuals in 'absolute low income', we take a single level of real equivalised income, which is set at 60 per cent. of the 1996&ndash;97 median income, which is &pound;166 before housing costs and &pound;140 after housing costs, at 2002&ndash;03 prices. Equivalised income adjusts household income for household size and composition. The corresponding cash values for this absolute threshold, for different family types are shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".164W.6/1">The national health service fitted very few, if any, digital hearing aids before September 2000. The modernising hearing aid services project began as a pilot project in September 2000, initially in only 20 sites. In the first 18 months of the project to April 2002, about 30,000 digital hearing aids were fitted. A further 42,000 aids were issued in the year to April 2003; and 80,000 were fitted in the year to April 2004. We are unable to give a breakdown of digital hearing aid provision by region.</p>

	<p pid=".171W.8/1">In FY 2002&ndash;03&mdash;the most recent year for which audited figures are available&mdash;separately identifiable expenditure by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) on UK advertising totalled &pound;743,783. Of this, &pound;716,234 related to media spend on advertising for recruitment purposes. The balance related to consular media advertisements which aimed to raise awareness among the British public of the importance of being properly prepared before travelling overseas and to advertising of the FCO's public open days. The total figure is based on the final accounts for FY 2002&ndash;03 and replaces the figure which I supplied to the right hon. Gentleman on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-07">7 January 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-01-07.411"><i>Official Report,</i> column 411W</phrase>, which drew on provisional calculations.

	<p pid=".171W.8/2">The FCO's central expenditure on public relations consultancy in FY 2002&ndash;03 totalled &pound;291,971. Of this, &pound;268,862 was paid to a single agency for work on the Consular awareness-raising campaign, 'Know Before You Go'.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.8/3">The FCO's overseas posts and its non-departmental public bodies also commission advertising and occasionally employ public relations consultants, but details are not recorded centrally. Information about the costs incurred by these activities could be provided only at disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid=".180W.6/1">European Structural Fund expenditure under the 2000&ndash;06 programmes is monitored on an annual basis. Under current regulations, each year's allocation has to be spent by the end of the second year following the year of allocation.</p>
	<p pid=".180W.6/2">Due to the late start of the Objective 2 programmes, only the Objective 1 and 3 programmes were required to spend their 2000 allocations by the end of 2002. For the UK Objective 1 programmes a total of &pound;622.3 million had to be spent and for Objective 3 the figure was &pound;402.1 million. These overall targets were achieved. The targets for the end of 2003 included both the 2000 and 2001 allocations for the Objective 2 programmes. A total of &pound;3,150 million had to be spent and this figure was surpassed by &pound;308 million.</p>

For example, the British Wind Energy Association states that the average wind farm in the UK will pay back the energy used in its manufacture within three to five months, and over its lifetime a wind turbine will produce over 30 times more energy than was used in its manufacture. This compares favourably with coal or nuclear power stations, which take about six months.</p>

Householders can get a grant of up to &pound;3,000 and &pound;4,250, dependent on size and type of installation. For public bodies, small to medium enterprises and larger bodies grants between 40 per cent. and 60 per cent. are available on a competitive basis, assessed independently at selection panels.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.9/4"><i>(c)</i> Solar Water Heating&mdash;Grants are available through the Clear Skies initiative; householders can get a grant of &pound;400 towards the cost of an installation. Community and not-for-profit groups can get a grant of 50 per cent., up to a maximum of &pound;100,000, towards the cost of installation. This is done through a competitive application process, at independent assessment panels, on a round by round basis. The &pound;10 million Clear Skies initiative was launched in January 2003 in order to promote the uptake of a number of renewable technologies including solar heating panels. Further details of the initiative, including grant levels for all the technologies supported, can be found on the website at <a href="http://www.clear-skies.org">www.clear-skies.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.9/5">The Scottish Executive has its own parallel scheme, the &pound;3.7 million Scottish Community and Household Renewables Initiative, which also offers grants for the installation of solar water heating panels. Householders can get a grant of 30 per cent. up to a maximum of &pound;4,000 for a solar water heating installation. Community organisations can get a 100 per cent. grant up to a maximum of &pound;100,000. Community applications are assessed on essential and desirable criteria and large-scale projects may also be subject to independent technical assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.2/1">I understand that the South West of England Regional Development Agency incurred expenditure of &pound;44 million for projects in Gloucestershire in the years 2001&ndash;04. This represents 13 per cent. of SWRDA's total programme budget for these years. This figure does not, of course, capture the total percentage of SWRDA's project and programme expenditure that benefits the county, as Gloucestershire also benefits substantially from a range of regional projects and programmes funded by SWRDA, where expenditure is not directly attributable to individual county areas.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.5/34"><sup>(15)</sup> Figures relate solely to the use of tyres as fuel in cement kilns.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.5/35">Not all industry returns have yet been received to enable presentation of the 2003 figures, but it is estimated that the use of tyres in cement kilns rose to almost 80,000 tonnes and other recovery approached 190,000 tonnes.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.5/36">Tyres disposed of to landfill arise from two principal channels, retail outlets and end of life vehicles (ELVs). In the former case, figures show a sharp drop from over 87,000 tonnes in 2001 to around 42,000 tonnes in 2002. The 2003 figures are expected to show a further significant diversion of tyres away from landfill disposal. Tyres are also disposed of to landfill as part of automotive shredder residue. The figures for 2001 and 2002 are similar at around 57,000 tonnes, although it should be noted that this total derives from an assumption that all ELV tyres not reused as part-worns or retreads are disposed of in this way.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.5/37">For both 2001 and 2002 this leaves around a 10 per cent. gap between estimated tyre arisings and stated recovery and disposal. The difference may be due to a number of factors including over-reporting of arisings and under-reporting of recovery and disposal, together with any tyres that are stored or are otherwise not consigned for immediate treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.5/38">Tyre fly-tipping takes a number of forms, including that dealt with by landowners and local authorities as well as those tyres that are dumped on the forecourts of tyre retail premises, and there are, as yet, no overall figures quantifying this illegal activity. However, The Environment Agency (EA) estimates that &pound;1.65 million is spent annually by local authorities on tyre related fly-tipping. In addition, a joint Defra/EA report estimated that 8,700 tonnes of tyres were fly-tipped on agricultural land in 2001, equating to a cost of &pound;1.3 million. There are a range of other affected landowners including British Waterways, Railtrack and the National Trust. In addition, there is fly-tipping on tyre retail premises where the retailer will subsequently meet the costs of disposal. A third of respondees to a 2003 survey by the representative body for tyre retailers reported that they had been subject to tyre fly-tipping. Since April 2004, Flycapture, a web-based fly-tipping database for England and Wales managed by the EA on behalf of Defra, has been operational. The database, populated with information provided by both the EA and local authorities, provides a systematic basis for the collection of information relating to all fly-tipped wastes, including tyres.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.12/5"><i>(b)</i> The Department's net expenditure with management consultants in the financial years 1996&ndash;97 and 2002&ndash;03 was &pound;1.09 million and &pound;5.75 million respectively. (Expenditure is only collected on an annual basis and the figure for 2003&ndash;04 is not yet available.)</p>
	<p pid=".185W.12/6">This increase in expenditure reflects the wide-ranging and fast-paced programme to modernise the Department's work, to increase efficiency, provide better customer service, and value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid=".198W.3/2">In addition, free travel is available to all Northern Ireland residents aged over 65 years of age, 57 per cent. of whom consider themselves to have a limiting long-term illness.

	<p pid=".198W.3/3">Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, half fare concessions have been available under the Northern Ireland Concessionary Fares Scheme to people who:</p>

The estimated cost of changing the Concessionary Fares Scheme to provide free-fare travel, rather than half fare concessions, to these groups would be likely to cost around &pound;500,000 per annum in addition to set-up costs.</p>
	<p pid=".198W.3/9">I therefore estimate that the cost of providing free travel on scheduled public transport to people with disabilities would be in the region of &pound;8.62 million in the current financial year. However, there are currently no plans to further extend the Northern Ireland Concessionary Fares Scheme to provide free public transport for the four groups of people who have received half fare concessions since April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".205W.3/1">Policy of the Office Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;as set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3&mdash;is not to set region-wide targets or quotas for affordable housing. Targets are more appropriately set at the local level as they are, necessarily, derived from local circumstances and assessments. The figures set out in Regional Planning Guidance for the South West (RPG10) are, therefore, not a target but an indicator against which the provision of affordable housing can be monitored. Better quality information than currently available is needed to assess how we are progressing against this indicator. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does know that we are not yet providing sufficient affordable homes. That is why the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has accepted Kate Barker's recommendation that there should be a step-change in housing supply. Over the coming months, we will be consulting on a package of proposals designed to achieve this, including the provision of independent advice to the Regions, which should improve significantly our ability to deliver and monitor the provision of affordable homes. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also committing more resources to the delivery of affordable homes&mdash;the 2004 Spending Review will allow us to increase new social house building by 50 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".207W.3/1">The additional funding provided in the Spending Review will, along with efficiency improvements, produce 10,000 extra social rented homes a year by 2007&ndash;08. Decisions have not yet been taken on how Regional Housing Pot funding for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, including the additional funding for affordable housing, is split between regions. This needs to reflect the different pattern of needs across regions and the Government's national housing priorities, including development of the growth areas, and targets. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aiming to complete this work, which raises some complex issues, by the end of the year. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will announce decisions on allocation of funding within regions next summer in the light of recommendations from Regional Housing Boards, which are due in May next year.</p>

	<p pid=".210W.8/1">Local authorities have powers in the Housing Act 1985 to deal with overcrowded or unfit Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs). Section 352 of the Act gives local authorities powers- to require works to be carried out to render an HMO suitable for the number of occupants. In addition section 354 permits local authorities to limit the number of occupants in an HMO to the number which the authority considers it to be suitable for. A failure to comply with a direction or notice under these sections is a criminal offence. These provisions are to be replaced by new measures in the Housing Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.8/2">The Bill includes provisions for a new Housing Health and Safety Rating System which will replace the current fitness standard and will enable authorities to take action to deal with health and safety hazards in all housing including HMOs. The Bill also includes provision for mandatory licensing of large HMOs, and local authorities will have powers to introduce additional licensing to tackle the smaller HMOs. In order to obtain a licence, the landlord will be required to satisfy the local authority that he, or the manager of the property, is a fit and proper person and the house is reasonably suitable for the permitted number of occupants. It will be a criminal offence to operate an HMO without a licence if it is required to be licensed or to permit such an HMO to be occupied by more persons than are permitted under the licence. In addition, local authorities will have powers to make management orders on individual HMOs that are not subject to licensing, if a tribunal agrees that it is necessary to make the order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents or other persons occupying properties in the vicinity.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.8/3">Under the Housing Bill, the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales will have power to amend by Order the statutory overcrowding standards in Part 10 of the 1985 Act and also the provisions in Part 4 of the Bill under which local authorities may serve notices to tackle overcrowding in HMOs. I will be consulting later this year on the ways in which this power might be used.</p>

This followed a review by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and HM Treasury. The Register is operated by English Partnerships.</p>

In many cases the information provided for the Register is confidential for commercial reasons. It is for the owners of individual sites to determine if information is made publicly available.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.0/1">We are developing urgently a programme for implementing the recommendations in the Bichard Report. The Home Office is co-ordinating this programme, but it will involve all the Government Departments responsible for implementation agreeing a timetable and key milestones for the work. We are committed to achieving substantial progress across the range of recommendations by the time Sir Michael Bichard reconvenes his Inquiry in six months.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.0/2">The current criteria of eligibility for Enhanced Disclosures have been under review. Proposals for revised criteria have been the subject of consultation and the results are being analysed. The recommendation that all posts working with children and vulnerable adults, including posts in schools, should be eligible for Enhanced Disclosures is being taken forward in the context of this review. Our aim is that new criteria should be in place by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.0/3">Work to develop a national IT system for police intelligence is being undertaken as a key priority. It may well be two years before such a system is fully up and running. However, the work we have done with the police service to develop a strategic approach to the delivery of national IT infrastructure is already producing great progress. The Police Local Exchange (PLX) system, which indicates where forces hold intelligence on specific individuals, will be introduced as an interim solution by spring 2005. Taking into account projects such as the &pound;500 million Airwave communication system, the new national DMA database and the investment we have put into the Criminal Records Bureau over the past three years, we have invested more than ever before. This commitment is further reinforced by the &pound;600 million that we allocated from 2002 to the whole criminal justice IT system to improve links between the courts, policing and social services.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.0/4">The other specific recommendations referred to are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. Officials in his Department are already in discussion with the National College for School Leadership about ways in which appropriate training might be developed for head teachers and governors to enable them to reflect the importance of safeguarding children when interviewing for staff appointments. It will be necessary to consider the practical issues associated with delivering additional training to many of the approximately 22,100 head teachers and a proportion of the estimated 350,000 school governors before making a commitment to a timescale for this to happen.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.0/5">As regards handling information about cases involving known or suspected offences against children, the Department for Education and Skills will be writing to local authorities very shortly to reaffirm the existing guidance in &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; and will set out how the relevant recommendations will be taken forward in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid=".218W.11/2">The Prison Service has reviewed the role of the Diversity and Equality Group, which has led to the formation of a new Race and Equalities Action Group. The new group will have three key teams:</p>
	<p pid=".218W.11/3" class="indent">Delivery Team;</p>
	<p pid=".218W.11/4" class="indent">Community Links Team; and</p>
	<p pid=".218W.11/5" class="indent">Policy and Programme Team.</p>
	<p pid=".218W.11/6">The change reflects the Prison Service's commitment to ensuring that significant improvements continue to be made to race and diversity issues, and that responsibilities and obligations under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, are implemented fully in every prison. The new group will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-19">19 July 2004</phrase>.</p>

Some are adaptations of programmes developed overseas, some have been developed by the independent and voluntary sectors, some began as local initiatives and others have been developed centrally by the Prison and Probation Services.</p>
	<p pid=".221W.5/2">The costs are, therefore, varied. We estimate, for example, that the cost of adapting and piloting the existing Think First programme was &pound;50,000, while developing the Women's Acquisitive Crime Programme from scratch, including the costs of piloting and accreditation, was in the region of &pound;115,000.</p>

	<p pid=".225W.6/1">The Victims' Code of Practice, provided for in the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Bill currently before Parliament, will place national obligations on criminal justice agencies to deliver specific services to victims of crime. Those bereaved as a result of death on the road will be entitled to the relevant police obligations and, where a charge is considered or brought, the relevant Crown Prosecution Service and courts' obligations. They will not, at present, be entitled routinely to the Code's personal support services, to be offered by Victim Support, as practice in this area is still being determined.</p>
	<p pid=".225W.6/2">Last year, at a cost of some &pound;500,000, we established three pilot sites to test different ways of organising and delivering services to road traffic victims. These pilots are subject to independent evaluation with a full report on their effectiveness envisaged for Summer 2005. Following this, we will need to consider, with voluntary sector partners and others, the key outcomes from the evaluation programme and how we can best implement a support service to address the needs of all those victimised by incidents on the road.</p>
	<p pid=".225W.6/3">The victims' legislation clearly sets out the procedures for making revisions to the Code of Practice and it is likely that, because it is statutory, there will be regular updates to reflect front line developments. So if, as seems likely, it is not possible to include obligations to provide personal support services for road traffic victims in the initial version of the Code, which is likely to become fully operational during 2005, then we should be in a position to do so when it is revised for the first time.</p>

	<p pid=".226W.4/2">We remain fully committed to buying two new aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy. There has been no change to our policy that Royal Navy warship hulls will be built in the United Kingdom. Given this position, we have not considered the possible purchase of United States carriers, nor have we therefore assessed the suitability of United States carriers to undertake projected CVF tasks. However, the Department regularly exchanges information with the US on our respective programmes, for example in areas such as the integration of the Joint Combat Aircraft. Our target in-service dates for the two carriers remain 2012 and 2015.</p>

	<p pid=".226W.7/2">The Ministry of Defence has not sought to fix the dimensions of the aircraft carriers during the assessment phase. The design of the ships will continue to evolve as we seek to balance the overall performance, time and cost parameters of this complex project as part of normal assessment phase activity. Decisions on the capability to be provided by CVF, including the number of aircraft capable of being deployed, and hence on the design and dimensions for the ships, will be taken at the Main Gate investment point.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.2/1">In keeping with our strong defence relationship with the United States of America, the United Kingdom works closely with the US Government on a range of defence projects and has dealings with both the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of Naval Research.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.2/2">Currently the Office of Naval Research is involved in collaborative programmes with the UK on anti-submarine warfare and unmanned underwater vehicle technologies. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency does not currently lead any of the collaborative programmes with the UK but may contribute indirectly through projects led by one of the US Armed Services.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.2/3">These collaborative links are to our mutual benefit, enhancing the military capabilities of both our nations and improving our ability to operate alongside one another. Typically, such collaborative activities involve both parties pooling the outputs of respective national defence research activities, on an equitable basis.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.2/4">It is unusual for the US Government to directly support or fund UK defence projects. The US does contract directly with UK companies and academia in support of their own defence programmes, but details of these contracts are a matter for the US Government.</p>

	<p pid=".234W.0/1">The original End to End Study reported its findings on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase>, leading to a six-month Demonstration Phase which has been a notable success. Many of the principles and recommendations put forward by the End to End Final Report have been proven through the pilot activities conducted thus far. It is the intention; therefore, to focus future activity on implementation and the early realisation of benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.0/2">As an example, the cost of delivering the first wave of End to End was far outweighed by the year-on-year savings. The MOD has invested &pound;18 million in this programme over the last 15 months. End to End Demonstration has identified efficiency benefit of between &pound;16 million to &pound;19 million per annum and identification of realisable benefit of around &pound;330 million. Potential exists for additional benefit, whilst at the same time preserving and in many cases improving, operational effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.0/3">The quick wins achieved by the End to End Programme and the ongoing and extremely successful DLO Change Programme, have been the catalysts for the launch of a defence-wide programme of logistics transformation.</p>

	<p pid=".234W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.3/2">The UK supports the work of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), and welcomes the work of the troops from Brazil, Canada and Chile, operating under Force Commander Lt. Gen. Heleno Ribeiro Pereira of Brazil. The UK is pleased that additional contingents from Argentina, Uruguay, Nepal and Sri Lanka and Peru should be deployed by the end of July.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.3/3">The UK is not currently providing personnel contributions to Haiti as we have strong and emerging commitments elsewhere&mdash;particularly in Africa. We will be contributing an estimated &pound;8.9 million in assessed contributions until October 2004. This contribution will support the UN troops in Haiti as well as other UN work set out in resolution 1542 (2004). Our financial support will continue beyond October, but the levels are dependent on operational needs which are not fully known as yet.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.3/4">In addition to financial support for the forces in Haiti, the UK has contributed to related work. The Department for International Development (DfID) sent &pound;1.9 million in bilateral support to Haiti to address civilian unrest. DfID also responded to the flooding in Haiti, sending &pound;250,000 to the World Food Programme (UN Programme), &pound;150,000 to Save the Children and &pound;109,400 to Action Aid.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.3/5">The UK also has a continued interest in raising the standard of peacekeeping. The UK funds world-wide 'train the trainer' programmes to support countries in developing their peacekeeping capacity. These focus on police training, but some of the personnel in Haiti may have benefited from this.</p>

	<p pid=".235W.2/1">Neither the Ministry of Defence, which is now responsible for veterans' matters, nor the former Department of Social Security, has commissioned research on this specific comparison. However, we recognise that, particularly in the past, noise injury arising from service in the Armed Forces has been a significant contributor to hearing loss among service personnel. The Government have therefore taken a close interest in the medical understanding of the causes of and prognosis for hearing loss, including instigating the 1997 Caiman review. The current scientific understanding of noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss is that it does not get worse on removal from the noise giving rise to the injury and that, in the context of the War Pensions Scheme, hearing loss due to noise and that due to subsequent effects of age are not more than additive. The aim remains that policy and individual decisions should reflect the latest published peer reviewed scientific evidence and, to that end, we carry out a regular scrutiny of emerging relevant scientific literature.</p>

	<p pid=".237W.11/1">The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) project is currently in its Assessment Phase and does not have a formally approved in-service date (ISD). At the commencement of the Assessment Phase, ISD was broadly forecast to fall in the period 2007&ndash;09. We now believe it will be achieved later than this, but endorsement of a firm planning date for ISD is subject to the outcome of negotiations with industry. The maximum whole life cost of the FSTA programme is currently estimated to be &pound;13.1 billion, at Outturn prices, which compares to an estimate of &pound;13.9 billion at the commencement of the Assessment Phase.</p>
