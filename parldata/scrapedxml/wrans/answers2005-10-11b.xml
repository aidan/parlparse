The final report of an independent study by Ilex Energy Consulting in 2004 on the impact of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme on the price of electricity for consumers across Europe is available on the Department of Trade and Industry's website (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml</a>)</p>

	<p pid="b.426W.0/1">The UK is participating in two greenhouse gas trading schemes: the national UK Emissions Trading Scheme and the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/2">The UK Emission Trading Scheme has been running since 2002, when 32 companies bid in voluntary emissions reduction targets for a share of Government incentive money. To date, the scheme has achieved emissions reductions of over 12 million tonnes of CO <sub>2</sub> . The scheme has proved a valuable experience for participants, brokers, verifiers and Government ahead of EU and international trading.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/3">The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is a cost-effective and efficient way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-24">Tuesday 24 May 2005</phrase>, the UK National Allocation Plan (NAP) was published, and the UK Registry went live allowing operators to begin trading.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/4">The total number of allowances allocated to industry is based on progress beyond our Kyoto target and towards our national goal of a 20 per cent. cut in CO <sub>2</sub> emissions on 1990 levels by 2010. In the first phase (2005&ndash;08), the scheme is set to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the UK by around 65 million tonnes carbon dioxide (around 8 per cent.) below projected emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.0/5">For Phase II of the EU ETS a major UK priority is to address any gaps, anomalies, or competitive distortions that may have arisen during Phase I, and to look at whether there is scope to include further carbon dioxide emissions from existing sectors. Member states share a desire to move towards greater consistency in coverage and implementation across the EU25 in the second phase, and we are working with other member states and the Commission to discuss harmonisation on a range of key issues relating to the shape and scope of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.427W.2/1">The purpose of site registration is to enable the Environment Agency to better identify those premises producing hazardous waste to facilitate the appropriate inspection of such premises as required by Article 4(1) of the Hazardous Waste Directive, and is consistent with our risk-based approach to regulation. It is recognised that some premises will in general produce only small amounts of relatively lower risk hazardous wastes such as fluorescent tubes and computer monitors, and they are exempt from the requirement to notify where they produce less than 200kg of hazardous waste per year. These premises include shops, offices, pubs, restaurants and farms as well as any establishments producing household waste. Industrial sites, including construction sites, are outside the scope of the exemption since they may produce higher risk waste such as soil contaminated by asbestos, coal tar or oil (all of which are carcinogenic). Nevertheless, there is provision for mobile service operators&mdash;such as painters and decorators&mdash;to be able to notify the site from which they operate rather than each site they visit where at each of those sites they produce less than 200kg of hazardous waste.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.1/1">The annual departmental report for the Department for International Development (DFID) sets out DFID's current spending plans and reports on outturn expenditure for previous years. Each departmental report's analysis of DFID expenditure covers: bilateral aid expenditure, including all forms of direct assistance; expenditure through multilateral institutions; DFID expenditure in support of the HIPC initiative and the multilateral debt relief initiative, for those years in which these initiatives have been in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/2">Reports outline DFID's expenditure plans and do not distinguish between pledges and commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/3">DFID's departmental report was first published in 1999. The Secretary of State for International Development has arranged for copies of the report from 1999 to 2005 to be placed in the Library of the House. Information on DFID expenditure is to be found in: Annex 1, Table 5 of the 1999 and 2000 reports; Annex 2, Table 10 of the 2001 report; Annex 1, Table 4 of the 2002 to 2005 reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/4">In the 2004 Spending Review, the Chancellor announced that DFID's budget would increase from &pound;4.5 billion in 2005&ndash;06 to &pound;5.0 billion in 2006&ndash;07 and to &pound;5.3 billion in 2007&ndash;08. The Department has set out its expenditure plans within this framework in its departmental report 2005. For ease of reference, the Department's total planned expenditure on bilateral aid programmes and through multilateral institutions for the period 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08 is set out in Table 1. This excludes the UK's share of the EC aid budget which is set against DFID's budget. It also excludes most UK expenditure on debt relief, although DFID's contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund is included. This is because most of our internationally agreed debt relief is provided on debts held by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). Debt relief that goes beyond what is required by international agreements is funded by DFID. DFID's bilateral and multilateral aid expenditure plans were not changed in light of the G8 Finance Ministers summit in June.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.1/16" class="italic">Debt relief</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/17">The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative provides qualifying countries with relief and cancellation of debts owed to multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF, as well as debts to bilateral governments. To date, debt relief worth $56 billion (in nominal terms) has been agreed for 28 countries, other countries are likely to enter the Initiative next year. The World Bank and IMF estimate that the HIPC Initiative has been freeing up around $1 billion a year from debt service payments for the 28 countries that have qualified under HIPC. The UK is the second largest contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, which assists multilateral institutions with the costs of providing debt relief under HIPC. We pledged a total of $436 million to the Trust Fund ($221 million, plus $88 million of the European Commission contribution in 2000, and a further $95 million, plus $32 million of an EC contribution in 2002). In addition, the UK also contributed US$43 million to assist the International Monetary Fund with its costs of delivering HIPC debt relief. 18 countries have qualified for Completion Point of HIPC (Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guyana, Ghana, Honduras, Mali, Mauritania, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). Another 10 have reached Decision Point (Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Sao Tome and Principe). A further 10 are eligible for debt relief under HIPC once they meet Decision Point criterion (Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo, Cote D'Ivoire, Lao Pdr, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Togo). A final list of countries eligible for HIPC under the Sunset Clause will be released early next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/18">On bilateral debt, the Government have cancelled the aid debts owed by the poorest countries (not just the HIPCs), worth some &pound;1.2 billion since 1978.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/19">In 1999, the Government agreed to cancel 100 per cent. of bilateral debts owed by HIPC countries to the UK when these countries completed the HIPC process. Since most aid debts had already been cancelled, these were export credit guarantee debts. For HIPC countries, total UK debt written off so far (to August 2005) is around &pound;1.2 billion; this includes traditional Paris Club debt treatment, as well as the application of our 100 per cent. bilateral cancellation policy under the HIPC Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/20">In 2000, the Government agreed that they would not benefit from debt service payments from HIPC countries, and that any payments received from December 2000 would be held in trust and reimbursed to the country once it had successfully completed the HIPC process.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/21">In 2004, recognising the poorest countries were still having to curtail spending on poverty reduction in order to service their debts, the Government proposed greater relief on debts owed by countries to international institutions. The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>, under which we committed to pay our share, 10 per cent., of qualifying countries' debt service payments to International Development Association of the World Bank and the African Development Fund. We expect to spend about $46 million on qualifying countries this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/22">In June 2005, the Finance Ministers of the G8 countries endorsed a proposal to cancel all the remaining debts of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank and African Development Fund (AfDF). Details are still under discussion, but when agreed by the international community, the deal will be worth approximately $55 billion in debt stock cancellations for the current 38 HIPCs. Donors will provide approximately $49 billion of this over the next 40 years to IDA and AfDF to compensate for foregone reflows. The cost of debt relief at the IMF ($6.1 billion) will be financed from internal resources, although the donors have committed to provide additional resources if needed to ensure that the IMF's ability to assist poor countries is not diminished. It is estimated that the annual resources freed up by the proposal will be around $1 billion in 2007, rising to around $1.7 billion in 2010&mdash;resources that will enable countries to tackle poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/23">The G8's proposal, when agreed, will supersede the MDRI for HIPCs. The precise costs to the UK are yet to finalised, but are likely to be in the region of $6 billion over the whole period of implementation. In addition, the UK will continue to meet its obligations under the MDRI to qualifying non-HIPC countries. This will cover IDA-only, low-income countries with a sufficiently robust public financial management system, the current proxy for this being budget support from the World Bank through a Poverty Reduction Support Credit. The value of this assistance will be $184 million until 2015 for currently eligible countries (Armenia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam), potentially rising to $463 million until 2015 for all potentially eligible countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.1/24">G8 Finance Ministers also reiterated in June their continued commitment to the full implementation and financing of HIPC. The UK already meets and exceeds its commitments under HIPC. Our commitment to HIPC and other bilateral debt cancellation policies continue and were not altered by the G8 Finance Ministers' decisions in June.</p>

Exchange rate risk is managed by either purchasing assets of the same currency as the liabilities with which they are associated or by using foreign currency swaps to match the currency exposure of the assets with the liabilities.</p>

Unfortunately we are unable to provide more specific details for this group of vehicles as the information is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.9/30" class="indent">By way of background, you may wish to be aware that first and second line maintenance for our vehicle fleet is provided by the local Light Aid Detachment (LAD) and REME Battalions or by the local army base repair organisation (ABRO) district workshop. First line maintenance can range from simple tasks such as replacing a blown bulb to changing an entire engine. Tasks conducted at second line repair are generally more complicated and time consuming and may require specialist tools and facilities. Fourth line repair is provided by ABRO and is generally programmed in depth repair (base overhaul) or structural repairs such as repairs to battle damaged vehicles. Fourth line repair is the most complex and in depth repair often involving stripping the vehicle of its components and paint removal before the whole vehicle is repaired and reassembled.</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.9/31" class="indent">It is worth noting at this point that all our vehicle fleets require regular maintenance and for this reason it is MOD policy not to have all of its vehicles available to the front line when not on operations. MOD maintenance and support policies are designed to ensure we maintain our Forces at the appropriate readiness state. Our maintenance programmes are sufficiently flexible to ensure that we can meet increased demands for vehicles from Front Line Commands to meet operational need.</p>

This is more likely to be the case in areas of low demand, but even in the nine market pathfinder areas the number of properties to be renovated is likely to exceed the number likely to be demolished by a factor of two.</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.6/4">We will also continue to support the work of the Empty Homes Agency in identifying and publicising best practice on bringing empty homes back into use.</p>

	<p pid="b.449W.2/1">It is not appropriate to issue supplementary public advice that would elaborate, gloss or qualify planning policy guidance documents to give a &quot;correct&quot; application. There can only be one statement of policy in force at any one time, and if this is to be changed a new text must be consulted on in the usual way. Minerals Planning Guidance 3 (MPG3) already provides sufficiently clear advice to mineral planning authorities and the coal industry in England on the tests to be applied when considering coal extraction proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.2/2">Planning applications for coal mining have to meet alternative tests. They must either be environmentally acceptable or, even if not, provide offsetting local or community benefits. The present policy clearly sets these considerations out as alternative tests, not cumulative ones. Paragraph 8 (i) and (ii) of MPG3 is clear in that respect. Staff in our Planning Directorate drew this to the attention of ODPM decision officers, planning Inspectors and Government Office staff in October 2004. Officials in the ODPM and the relevant Government Offices, will continue to examine and comment on draft regional and local planning documents dealing with coal mining development for conformity with national policy on this and other matters dealt with in MPG3, and will if necessary raise matters of non-conformity at the public examinations of plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.455W.2/2" class="indent">A large scale longitudinal survey of prisoners (the Surveying Prisoner Crime Reduction Survey), which will address decency issues across the estate, including in contracted prisons. Work is scheduled to start by the end of 2005 and it is expected that initial data, particularly on prisoners' experiences of the first few weeks of custody, will be available towards the end of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.461W.2/1">The Government believe that children benefit from a continuing relationship with both parents following divorce or separation, where it is safe and in the child's best interests. The Children Act 1989 supports this and under the Act it is the welfare and interests of the child concerned that are paramount, not the rights of parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/2">Where contact has been agreed or ordered by the courts, it is essential that the terms of court orders are followed. The Children and Adoption Bill has introduced legislation which, if approved by Parliament, will give judges additional powers to facilitate contact and enforce contact orders. In addition to the current system of fines and imprisonment, they will be able to refer parents to a counsellor or a parenting programme or make enforcement orders imposing requirements for unpaid work. Judges will also be able to award financial compensation, for example where the cost of a holiday has been lost. These additional levers will be available to the courts at any stage in a contact case, if the court considers they would assist resolution. These provisions will be available for use by the courts in relation to both mothers and fathers.</p>

The Government have established an Independent Licensing Fees Review Panel to consider whether the fees regime is meeting these objectives. The panel will deliver an interim review shortly, followed by a final report in autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.465W.8/1">The number of collection items in the DCMS-sponsored museums and galleries that have not been on public display in the past three years has recently been estimated to be around 105 million. These items are very diverse, and include large amounts of organic material and archaeological finds which are not suitable for public display; for example, a study in 2002 showed that the Natural History Museum has 70 million organic items in storage. Many of the items not on display such as books and archive material, prints, photographs and textiles are available to the public on request. The large majority of works of art not on display comprise of prints or items in need of conservation. Our museums and galleries actively pursue a policy of loans and touring exhibitions throughout the UK and overseas to ensure that their collections are accessible to as wide an audience as possible.</p>

We are fully committed to this policy and to the rigorous and transparent implementation of our export controls. European Union member states have adopted a Council Regulation (EC) No. 1236/2005 (O.J.L200, 30.7.2005), which will enter into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-30">30 July 2006</phrase>, concerning the trade in goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

Where at the end of the PFI contract a property reverts to the FCO, the difference between the expected fair value of the residual on reversion and any agreed payment on reversion is built up over the life of the contract by capitalising part of the unitary charge each year. Where the balance of risks and rewards of ownership of the PFI property is borne by the FCO, the property is recognised as a fixed asset and the liability to pay for it is accounted for as a finance lease.

	<p pid="b.472W.2/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the proposed reduction in opening hours for Wareham Jobcentre. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/5" class="indent">We have recently reviewed the way in which we deliver our services from our Jobcentre Plus offices and we are proposing that some of our smaller sites will be open for the number of days most appropriate to meeting the needs of our customers. Some of our offices have become too small to support all of the specialist advisory services which we will provide to those who need most assistance in entering employment. Wareham Jobcentre is one of those offices involved in the review.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/6" class="indent">We propose to deliver many of these services from nearby larger Jobcentre Plus offices together with improved access to our services through telephone and e-channels. We will, however, continue to deliver job search activity for jobseekers and some tailored advisory support to individuals from smaller offices such as Wareham, after the change in opening times.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/7" class="indent">Further proposals are under consideration with regard to opening on additional days, if this is considered necessary, to offer a targeted service to our most disadvantaged customers. This would be in addition to the days the office would normally be open, to meet the needs of our customers already actively seeking employment. This proposal is in the early stages of being considered and no decision has yet been made. The Jobcentre Plus District Manager for Dorset and Somerset, will inform you once a decision has been reached.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/8" class="indent">You have my assurance that it is our intention to continue to provide our customers with a service designed to target their needs. These changes will allow us to improve upon the services which we provide.</p>

	<p pid="b.475W.0/1">This information is not collected in the format requested and the information that is collected centrally cannot be disaggregated to practices as each practice is anonymised within the primary care access survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.475W.0/2">The latest information available, September 2005, shows that 100 per cent. of patients were offered a general practitioner consultation within two working days in each of the three primary care trusts that cover Bedfordshire (Bedford, Luton and Bedfordshire and Hertlands).</p>

	<p pid="b.475W.3/2">I have had no discussions with the Healthcare Commission on the waiting times targets for prostate cancer. The national health service cancer plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. There are two targets for cancer patients to be achieved from the end of December 2005, of a maximum 31 day wait from diagnosis of cancer to start of treatment and 62 days from urgent referral for suspected cancer to first treatment. Prostate cancer patients fall within these groups. Achievement of these targets will form part of the Healthcare Commission's assessment of existing targets for 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid="b.476W.2/1">For parliamentary work carried out by the Central Office of Information (COI), for example Command Papers, Acts and other departmental papers, the minimum recycled fibre content required is 75 per cent. for coated and 100 per cent. for uncoated papers, virgin fibre pulp being elemental chlorine free or preferably totally chlorine free. Mill broke is not included in the recycled fibre content. Applying the National Association of Paper Merchants definition for recycled content, the recycled fibre can include converter's waste, printer's waste and post consumer waste from homes and offices.</p>
	<p pid="b.476W.2/2">For all other printed publications produced in 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05, the Department has no central record of paper source and content, and could not obtain these without incurring disproportionate cost. However, the selection of paper stock and its recycled and environmental properties currently rests with the COI.</p>
