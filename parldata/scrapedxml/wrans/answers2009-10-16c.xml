	<p pid="c.1105W.2/1">We do not hold the information on each individual adviser or their cost for 2008-09. We estimate that the cost of collecting this would exceed the cost threshold of &#163;750 applicable to central Government. Furthermore, to provide information on individual advisers would infringe the rights of an individual's personal information and therefore be in breach of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="c.1105W.2/2">The estimate of &#163;90 million was derived from information collected through the Department's review of its field forces in 2008. It is difficult to provide a precise breakdown of expenditure on each of the field forces, since they are delivered through a range of mechanisms-some are directly contracted (so the cost of advisers is incorporated within a larger contract), some are located in Government Offices as secondees, and some are employed directly by DCSF or its NDPBs. The &#163;90 million includes some funding from other Government Departments in the delivery of improvement support where there is shared policy interest. It is difficult to disaggregate the proportion paid by this Department.</p>

	<p pid="c.1106W.0/2">The hon. Member will have received a copy of the Secretary of State's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-31">31 July</phrase>, which addresses all the points raised in this parliamentary question. I attach a copy for ease of reference.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/3" class="italic"> Letter from Ed Balls, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-31">31 July 2009</phrase> :</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/4" class="indentitalic"> The new Vetting and Barring scheme as it applies to Members of Parliament and schools</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/5" class="indent">I am writing to all Members of Parliament (MPs) representing constituencies in England and Wales about the new Vetting and Barring Scheme (VBS), with a courtesy copy to MPs representing constituencies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/6" class="indent">Following recent questions in the House, which were prompted by some misleading media coverage, I want to make clear how the VBS will operate and, in particular, how it will apply to MPs when they work for schools, but not when they make visits to schools without working for those schools. (The same principles would also apply in relation to work for children's centres.)</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/7" class="indent">As you may be aware the VBS is being introduced in response to a recommendation from the independent Bichard Inquiry, established following the Soham murders by school caretaker Ian Huntley. Sir Michael Bichard's Inquiry into these tragic events found that there was more we could reasonably do so that people who have already shown they pose a threat to children are prevented from taking up positions in schools. The VBS is designed to achieve precisely this in relation to schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/8" class="indent">All new entrants to the schools workforce will have to register under the VBS from November 2010. For those who were already doing such work before November 2010, starting with those who have never been subject to CRB checks, we will phase in registration between 2011 and 2015.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/9" class="indent">In the schools context, people who are not members of the schools workforce will be required to register with the VBS for one of only two reasons. The first reason is because they frequently work for a particular school or schools. Conversely, someone who just visits schools, for example to watch a school play or attend a prize-giving, to meet the head teacher or to observe a lesson in a classroom, will not have to register under the VBS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/10" class="indent">MPs will therefore not have to register with the VBS in the course of their normal duties such as visits to schools or children's centres in their constituencies. The only circumstances in which they would have to register are if, for example, an MP has arranged to go into schools to, say, teach politics to groups of pupils once a month for several successive months, as this means they would be classed as working for schools. Anyone doing this as paid work would have to pay a one-off charge of &#163;64 to register under the VBS, but if an MP is doing this as a volunteer the &#163;64 fee would not apply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/11" class="indent">The second and only other situation, in the schools context, in which people who are not members of the school and children's workforce will have to register with the VBS is by virtue of the particular post and decision-making powers they hold. For this reason some local councillors and council officers will be required to register, including all Lead Members for Children and Directors of Children's Services. On this basis, I and my DCSF ministerial team plan to register with the Independent Safeguarding Authority as soon as registration starts in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/12" class="indent">Further information about the VBS can be found at <a href="http://www.isa-gov.org.uk">www.isa-gov.org.uk</a> . In addition, I also enclose a note setting out the facts in response to some of the myths about the VBS which have appeared recently in the media.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/13" class="indent">My Department, which leads for the Government in relation to policy on the safeguarding of children, is the main funder of the VBS together with the Department of Health, which has the parallel lead for vulnerable adults. The VBS in England and Wales is being delivered for DCSF and for the Department of Health by the Home Office, which also leads for the Government on criminal records information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.0/14" class="indent">I am copying this letter to Gwenda Thomas AM, Deputy Minister for Social Services in the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.1110W.0/7">In the Department's view a person might normally be considered a minister of religion if his duties include at least some of the following:</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.0/8" class="indent">conducting religious worship;</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.0/9" class="indent">providing pastoral care, especially to those who are sick, distressed or needy;</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.0/10" class="indent">conducting weddings, funerals or baptisms (or their equivalent);</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.0/11" class="indent">providing leadership to local members of his denomination;</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.0/12" class="indent">overseeing the ministry of others who perform these functions, providing them with support and pastoral care.</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.0/13">It is also the Department's view that, in considering whether or not a minister conducts his duties from a property, regard may normally be had to whether he is available at that property to provide pastoral care, or whether business relating to his role as minister is conducted there. It is the Department's view that it would not normally be sufficient for a minister merely to reside in the property and undertake his private worship there.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.1123W.2/1">All local authorities are expected to have in place a local housing strategy. This provides an analysis of the housing needs of an area, covering housing across all tenures and provides a framework for ensuring that all parties act in a co-ordinated way to tackle housing problems. It is in local authority's interests to collect information across all housing tenures through housing condition surveys, including those privately owned, to ensure it has a plan in place for its current and future housing needs for all local residents. The Government do not stipulate either the precise detail of local housing condition surveys, the timetable of these or that local authorities share the information collected with Communities and Local Government. It is for local authorities to decide the best way to take this forward.</p>

Local authorities are not able to apply discretion to the regulations. Until the fees regulations are further amended later this year, the level of fee payable for an application to extend the time limits for implementation of an existing planning permission is as it would be for a new application for the same development. When the fees regulations are amended, a reduced fee level will be payable. Proposed fee levels, which are currently under consideration, are for &#163;500 for a major development, &#163;50 for a householder application and &#163;170 for any other application.

This policy was removed in PPS 3 (2006). PPG 13 makes it clear that there should be no minimum parking standards for development, other than for disabled people. The maximum car parking standards in PPG 13 remain unchanged since 2001. The requirement for maximum standards continues in the current draft Planning Policy Statement 4:Planning for Prosperous Economies.</p>

The sustainable site location policies set out in PPG 13 are repeated in other Planning Policy Statements (including 1, 3 and draft PPS 4) which do have impact assessments. The draft PPS 4 consultation impact assessment considers non-residential parking policy issues. The impact assessment is part of the consultation document available on the Communities and Local Government website:</p>

	<p pid="c.1138W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.11/2">Local authorities in England no longer have centrally imposed statutory targets on recycling and composting-this is consistent with Government policy to give local areas more freedom and flexibility on how they deliver national objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.11/3">The Government believe local authorities are better placed to make decisions on the best waste management strategy for their local area, so it does not direct or interfere in the decisions they make.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.11/4">DEFRA has not provided any specific guidance but provides a range of targeted support to help local authorities deliver their targets through bodies such as the Waste Implementation Programme and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP).</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.11/5">WRAP has also been working on a model to calculate how much waste is diverted from landfill via home composting. The model, once complete, could help councils include home composting in targets to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill under the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme.</p>

I am very pleased Paul Lee has taken on the role of Levy Board chair as I believe he will provide the kind of leadership needed to proceed with modernising the Levy. I am meeting him shortly and look forward to hearing his thoughts on the next steps.</p>

	<p pid="c.1145W.5/12">Typically assessments take several months to complete due to the complexity of each individual assessment and the volume of pre-planning applications consulted on. As a result 846 pre-planning applications submitted in 2008-09 are currently undergoing assessment. It is likely that concerns will be raised for some of these outstanding pre-applications. However, where concerns are raised, mitigation options will be suggested to the developer where possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.1152W.0/2">The Gas Act 1986 (as amended), which amongst other things set up the gas regulatory bodies, exempted heating oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from its provisions. The Gas Act principally addressed the issues of setting up a regulatory regime to ensure that the national transmission system for gas users was not exploited. In contrast, there is no natural monopoly in the transport of heating oil or LPG by road. The heating fuels market operates with a number of distributors competing for supply using alternative supply sources. In that sense, it is broadly similar to other products such as diesel and petrol. The Department therefore has no plans for the economic regulation of the heating fuels sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.1152W.0/3">The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI), which will encourage the uptake of renewable heat generation, to meet our renewable energy and carbon targets, will be funded through a levy on suppliers of fossil fuel for heat. It is intended that the scheme will be introduced from April 2011 with the detail of the scheme being set out in secondary legislation under Section 100 of the Energy Act 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1152W.3/1">It is difficult to reduce the carbon emissions and heating bills of park homes due to the lack of scope for key energy efficiency measures, such as cavity wall and loft insulation. Where scope does exist, such as through draught-proofing and high-efficiency lights and appliances, assistance is available to park homes residents through schemes such as the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target and Warm Front.</p>
	<p pid="c.1152W.3/2">Warm Front is currently working in partnership with a gas distributor and a local residents association to enable 61 residents of Elm Tree caravan park in Hartlepool to be connected to the mains gas network. This project meant these homes, previously utilising liquid petroleum gas, coal or forms of electric heating, reduced their likely energy bills and likely carbon consumption. The project considerably reduced the otherwise prohibitive cost that had prevented each park home individually connecting to the gas network.</p>
	<p pid="c.1152W.3/3">The Warm Front scheme has also begun a piloting exercise of external wall insulation for 100 park home properties. If this trial is successful, then this may be included as a main measure offered through the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.1153W.9/1">In December 2008 DEFRA published a report looking at the features of packaging deposit systems and the role they might play in increasing recovery and recycling and reducing littering in the UK. The report found little hard evidence to suggest that deposit schemes reduce littering and thought that the major impact of such a scheme would be to divert packaging from waste bins to recycling bins.</p>
	<p pid="c.1153W.9/2">Overall, the report concluded that resources could be more effectively used in improving current systems than in developing a parallel one for deposits on packaging. Improving household collections and developing the away from home recycling infrastructure are likely to be more cost-effective in increasing recycling and tackling litter.</p>

	<p pid="c.1154W.6/32">With regards to livestock disposal costs, no such estimate has been made. For most cattle compulsorily slaughtered on TB control grounds, DEFRA has received a net payment from abattoirs rather than incurred a cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.6/33">MHS officials inspect carcasses of such cattle when slaughtered in licensed abattoirs, a small proportion of TB affected cattle are condemned as unfit for human consumption e.g. if TB lesions are identified in more than one part of the carcase. In such cases DEFRA does makes a payment to the abattoir to cover its disposal costs. It is not possible to provide details of slaughter costs in the form requested: typically an abattoir will receive batches of cattle being slaughtered on disease control grounds rather than single animals-if one (or more) of these animals is condemned, the cost to DEFRA will be offset by the total salvage value received from those passed as fit for human consumption.</p>

	<p pid="c.1160W.2/1">The Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations (2008), which implement the EU Nitrates Directive in England, increase the area designated as nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) to approximately 70 per cent. of the country and tighten the mandatory action programme of measures that apply within these zones. The impact assessment estimates the total annual cost to farmers of complying with the regulations to be &#163;48.5 million-&#163;68.6 million. The UK's successful negotiation of a derogation from the livestock manure N farm limit, one of the more demanding requirements set by the Nitrates Directive, means these costs could be reduced by &#163;16.9 million to &#163;21.7 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="c.1164W.0/1">It is for primary care trusts to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) services they commission. The Department has set an operational standard that 98 per cent of patients should not spend more than four hours. in A and E departments. National annual performance against the standard was 98.1 per cent. in 2008-09. Performance of individual trusts is published on the Department's website, but performance of individual A and E departments is not collected centrally. As seen in the 2008 Healthcare Commission survey of A and E, nationally patient ratings of care are continue to be positive-patient satisfaction with the overall quality of care is high: 88 per cent., rate it as &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good&quot;.</p>

A defining characteristic of a service qualifying as a type 3 department is that it treats at least minor injuries and illnesses (sprains for example) and can be routinely accessed without appointment. A service mainly or entirely appointment based (for example a general practitioner practice or outpatient clinic) or one mainly or entirely accessed via telephone or other referral (for example most out of hours and primary care services)is not a type 3 A&amp;E service even though it may treat a number of patients with minor illness or injury.</p>

This will also establish if the patient may be accommodated by the particular MRI scanner. MRI scanners have table weight limits and aperture diameters which may differ between different manufacturers' models. In some instances, the imaging service may have an MRI scanner to accommodate an obese patient, but where they do not, the radiologist will select the most appropriate alternative imaging procedure, such as ultrasound.</p>

	<p pid="c.1180W.2/2"><i> </i>A member of staff in the Islamabad visa section was asked in 2006 to conduct an internal review of a number of visa cases for the purpose of maintaining and improving processes and decision-making. This was part of routine procedure to monitor and continuously improve performance. As such, the observations made in the review were one of many contributions to the continuous business improvement process within UKBA International Group, previously UK Visas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/3">As a result of this process, there have been significant improvements made to visa processing in Pakistan since 2006, for example:</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/4" class="indent">In 2007 we began recording biometrics of all Pakistani visa applicants, which are cross-checked against UK Police and immigration databases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/5" class="indent">We have increased verification checks on key documentation. For example, all education certificates are verified with the Pakistan Higher Education Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/6" class="indent">We have improved our risk profiling of Pakistani visa applications, meaning that extra checks are made on applications considered higher risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/7" class="indent">We have introduced the Points Based System, which has consolidated about 80 immigration routes into a five tier system and introduced still tougher standards on UK employers and colleges seeking to bring migrants into the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/8" class="indent">Since the beginning of 2007, we have provided counter-terrorism and forgery training to all entrance clearance and intelligence staff being posted overseas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/9" class="indent">We have run specific counter-terrorism training sessions in high risk posts, including Islamabad.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/10" class="indent">In 2008 we introduced paragraph 320 7a and 7b into the immigration rules which allows entrance clearance staff to ban those who use forged or fraudulent documents in visa applications from entering the UK for up to 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/11">As a result of these and other actions, refusal rates for visa applications for Pakistani nationals have risen 14 per cent. since 2006 (32 per cent. in 2006 to 46 per cent. in 2008-09).</p>

	<p pid="c.1184W.2/2">I have had no discussions with the Sentencing Guidelines Council on the length of sentences for murder committed by gangs. I have consulted the Council on the review of the starting point for determining the minimum term for murder using a knife and I await its formal response. Guidance on setting the minimum term to be served for murder is set out in Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Council guideline on the overarching principle of seriousness states that offenders operating in groups or gangs should be treated as an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing. I note that the Crown Court recently handed down sentences with 39 and 35 year minimum terms to the top members of a gang in Manchester and a 35 year minimum term for a gang member from Sheffield who ordered a murder from his prison cell.</p>

	<p pid="c.1188W.2/1">The Youth Crime Action Plan, published in July 2008, is the cross-Government strategy for dealing with the full range of issues around youth crime and justice through a triple track approach of prevention, non-negotiable support, and tough enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/2">The action plan is backed by &#163;100 million of new funding, including funding for 71 local areas to implement a package of intensive measures to address youth crime. In 2008-09, the 69 areas in England received a total of &#163;4.5 million, plus an additional &#163;1.7 million for positive activities on Friday and Saturday nights, and the areas report that this money has been spent in its entirety. The 69 areas will receive &#163;24.2 million in 2009-10, plus an additional &#163;1.4 million for summer alcohol activity, and a further indicative amount of &#163;24.2 million in 2010-11. In addition, two areas in Wales will receive a total of &#163;350,000 in 2009-10 and can expect the same in 2010-11 to implement the elements of the package that are non-devolved.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/3">The action plan funding covers expenditure to support the triple track approach. For example, to provide support for families in the greatest difficulty; police and social workers taking unsupervised young people off the streets at night; and to ensure that more young offenders carry out unpaid work to repay their communities in their leisure time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/4">The action plan's achievements so far are set out in Youth Crime Action Plan One Year On, published in July 2009, and build on the Government's earlier successes which have seen recently a fall in the number of children entering the criminal justice system for the first time and a fall in the rate of reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="c.1190W.8/1">In 1997 the Ministry of Justice's predecessor was the Lord Chancellor's Department, which had responsibility for appointing and advising on the appointment of judges, running the court system and a certain number of tribunals and assisting in the reform of the English law. To this end it controlled the Public Trust Office, the Courts Service, the Official Solicitor's Office, the Office of the Judge Advocate General, the Legal Aid Board and several more government agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1190W.8/2">Since 1997 there has been a number of machinery of government changes, which resulted in the establishment of the Ministry of Justice in May 2007. These changes included the establishment of the Department for Constitutional Affairs from the Lord Chancellors Department in June 2003; the creation of Her Majesty's Courts Service from the Magistrates Courts Service and the Courts Service in April 2005; the setting up of the Tribunals Service from other Government Departments in April 2006; and the transfer of HM Prison Service, as part of the National Offender Management Service, with the creation of the Ministry of Justice in May 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1190W.8/3">Along with the organisational changes, the management information systems and the data they hold have been subject to significant change. As a consequence, information on numbers of staff in all the Department's predecessors for 1997 could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.1190W.8/4">However, it is possible to provide for <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> published information on civil service staff numbers from the Cabinet Office website. The number of full-time equivalent staff recorded as working within the Lord Chancellor's Department was 10,652 and for HM Prison Service it was 37,704.</p>
	<p pid="c.1190W.8/5">The latest staff figures for the Ministry of Justice are published quarterly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and they form part of their public sector employment statistics. The latest published data for the Ministry of Justice (<phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June 2009</phrase>) are set out in the table.

The investment will also fund a new national co-ordinator who will help set best practice standards and work with areas to raise awareness with local agencies and funding commissioners. There will also be an increase in advocacy workers to help provide one-to-one tailored support and the community outreach team will also be extended with two link workers based within the UK Human Trafficking Centre to work in partnership with the police, UK Border Agency and other partners to help with victim identification and onward referral into support.</p>

There are two paybands for new Prison Officers, depending on the role undertaken. All new Prison Officers start employment in the Prison Officer 2 core officer role in the lower payband.</p>
	<p pid="c.1194W.11/71">The total appointment salary for new appointments in Prison Officer 2 roles is &#163;17,1871. This is composed of &#163;14,690 base pay plus &#163;2,497 for unsocial hours working. This rate may be reviewed by the PSPRB as part of their annual review of Prison Service salaries. These new staff may elect to work up to four additional hours on top of the standard 37 net hours per week. These additional hours will be paid at an enhanced rate to reflect they are non-pensionable. In parts of the country, officers will receive a location allowance also.</p>

The strategic approach includes designing permanent venues to make them 15 per cent. more energy efficient than the 2006 Building Regulations require and building a wind turbine that will produce the energy equivalent to supplying 1,000 homes over an average year.</p>
