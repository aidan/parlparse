	<p pid=".1W.3/1">Information concerning numbers of inquiries into accidents involving Ministry of Defence property or equipment is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/2">Current departmental policy requires the relevant operating authority to convene a Board of Inquiry or a Unit, Ship or Station Inquiry in the case of accidents, resulting in significant damage to buildings or equipment, or affecting operational capability. Less significant accidents are likely to be investigated at local level.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/3">Accidents involving MOD property or equipment may also be the subject of Boards of Inquiry convened to investigate serious injuries and fatalities.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/4">Treasury guidelines generally discourage public bodies from insuring risks unless it can be shown that the potential cost of claims paid, together with the cost of handling such claims, will exceed the cost of purchasing insurance. As the cost of premiums compared to the amounts paid in compensation would normally favour insurance companies, the MOD self-insures its core activities, and funds claims for compensation and the repair or replacement of lost or damaged property or equipment from its current expenditure.</p>

	<p pid=".2W.5/1">The Washdown Area within the nuclear complex at the former Chatham Dockyard was a purpose-built facility primarily for the decontamination of components from the submarine reactor and any associated tools and equipment that had become radioactively contaminated. Separate washing facilities were provided for personnel leaving radioactively contaminated areas.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.5/2">The Washdown Facility had a stainless steel floor and stainless steel dividers and barriers. Large components were lowered and raised through roof hatches using an electric crane. Tented enclosures within the facility were used for some decontamination and close inspection work. Smaller equipments and tools were cleaned in stainless steel open vats using a solution of special detergents or demineralised water as required. The vats were positioned in an annexe to the Washdown Area with a continuous stainless steel floor, behind a stainless steel barrier, so enabling the containment and ready cleaning of any spillages. Water from the Washdown Area was directed via specific-to-purpose stainless steel drains into holding tanks in the adjacent Effluent Treatment Plant.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.5/3">Decontamination facilities for personnel leaving radioactively contaminated areas consisted of hand wash facilities and associated monitoring equipment, to meet the requirements of the Ionising Radiations (Unsealed Radioactive Substances) Regulations 1968. In addition, there were showers for use in the extremely rare occurrences of bodily contamination.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.3/2">All civil servants are responsible for meeting the cost of their travel between home and normal place of work. The introduction of a Central London Road User Charge will not affect this basic condition of service. Accordingly, the Ministry of Defence has no plans for reimbursing the cost of the Road User Charge where it is incurred as part of normal commuting. However, civil servants travelling on detached duty to other establishments are entitled to claim the cost of the resultant travel. Where road user charges&mdash;whether these be urban congestion charges or road/bridge tolls&mdash;are incurred on such journeys, these costs can be claimed.</p>

We have made useful progress but our work with the company, including our assessment of the aircraft's capability, is not yet complete. We are seeking to make a decision as soon as practicable.</p>

We have received no formal representations as to the legality of operating low frequency sonar. A global Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been prepared for the United Kingdom's low frequency sonar (Sonar 2087) which is currently under development and an EIA will also be undertaken for each development trial that is specific to the area concerned. Legal advice is part of each EIA. In addition, the global EIA was subject to independent legal review.

He was deployed to Canada for adventure training, which had recently concluded. Within minutes of the accident, civilian paramedics attended the scene (the STARS (Calgary heli-born medics) and EMF Airdrie (Canadian civilian paramedics)) and pronounced Rgr McMaster dead. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were called to the scene at 15.35 hours and retained primacy of the investigation for the first 48 hours following the death; they concluded that there was nothing suspicious about the death. Jurisdiction was subsequently passed to the Royal Military Police (RMP) detachment at the British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS). An investigator from the Land Accident Investigation Team, working for the RMP, concluded that the accident occurred as a result of Rgr McMaster being unstable after exiting the aircraft.</p>

	<p pid=".12W.11/1">The allegations made recently refer to events that are said to have occurred in 1997 and earlier. In respect of the rape allegation, no formal complaint has been made to the Ministry of Defence and there is no specific investigation ongoing. Naturally, should the allegation be made formally, then the department will instigate a full and proper investigation. I can confirm that claims have been brought against the Ministry of Defence in respect of bullying which took place at Whittington Barracks in 1991&ndash;92. As the claims are the subject of litigation I cannot comment further. Bullying and harassment of any kind will not be tolerated in the Army and any such allegations will always be thoroughly investigated. If such allegations are proven, appropriate action will be taken against the perpetrators.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.2/1">We have recently announced a target of a 25 per cent. reduction in fraud and error in Housing Benefit for working age customers by 2006. This is in addition to the targets we have already set to reduce fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance for working age customers, which aim for a 33 per cent. reduction by 2004 and a 50 per cent. reduction by 2006. Latest figures show that we are on course to achieve more than double our March 2002 target of a 10 per cent. reduction.</p>

Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent.</p>

For example, the Pension Schemes Act 1993 in GB (which consolidated provisions originally in the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978) provides that certain unpaid pension scheme contributions can be claimed from the National Insurance Fund, through the Redundancy Payments Service, if an employer becomes insolvent. If a claim is successful funds are paid to the trustees of the scheme being wound up. In addition, the Pensions Act 1995 requires salary-related schemes to meet the Minimum Funding Requirement, and provides for a statutory priority order for the distribution of a scheme's assets if a scheme that is required to meet the MFR winds up.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.10/1">The time scale for having applications completed varies depending on the nature and scale of the work required. For Northern Ireland Housing Executive properties 50 per cent. of urgent heating cases are completed within 17 weeks while in non urgent cases 96 per cent. are completed in 52 weeks. In private sector cases it issues schedules of work in 82 per cent. of cases within 12 weeks of inspection and approves 97 per cent. of cases within six months of receipt of a completed formal application form. The times scales are influenced by factors such as having plans drawn up and approved as well as the need to have an assessment carried out to determine the needs of the disabled person.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.10/2">For its own properties the Housing Executive and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety have jointly carried out a review of the adaptation service. Significant progress has been made in reducing the requirement for assessment by the occupational therapy service through increased use of fast tracking and waiting times are expected to be reduced by the recruitment of additional Occupational Therapists (17 have been recruited). For private sector cases, the Housing Executive is setting up a working group to examine ways of improving the applications process and in the longer term, the new housing legislation will allow for fast tracking on agreement with the Occupational Therapy Service.</p>

	<p pid=".29W.0/1">Poor country producers can best be helped through a combination of supportive policies and programmes in country and significant trade liberalisation in areas of importance to them. Through the Doha Development Agenda agreed at the fourth WTO ministerial in November 2001, the UK is arguing for significant reductions in trade distorting policies and greater access for developing country products to OECD markets, particularly for agricultural goods and light manufactures.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.0/2">Specifically, the UK Government support the Integrated Framework, which aims to mainstream trade issues into a country's growth and poverty reduction strategies. This ensures that the right sort of complementary policies i.e. rural roads, access to credit or skill training, can be developed to reduce the impact on poor people of changes in their livelihoods and enable small producers to take advantage of new trading opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".29W.0/3">My Department provides support designed to meet the different circumstances and needs of a broad range of producers throughout the developing world. These include interventions designed to improve food security as well as to support the delivery of improved rural services. We also provide support to international agencies and works to enhance the impact of interventions made by these institutions. Details of our initiatives can be found in the 2002 Departmental Report, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.</p>

The European Commission has informed us that they have made available euro 23 million, of which the DFID share is nearly euro 4.6 million, which is equivalent to 97,000 metric tonnes of food aid, to cover food needs until the end of 2002.

	<p pid=".30W.2/1">DFID is working closely with the Governments of both India and Bangladesh to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. India has a significant HIV epidemic, with prevalence in some states at around 2 per cent. The number of people with HIV/AIDS is estimated at 3.9 million. In Bangladesh, although HIV prevalence is less than 1 per cent., even in high risk groups, we recognise as a priority the prevention of its further spread.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.2/2">We are currently considering what role there may be for DFID in working on HIV/AIDS in Indonesia, where evidence suggests that prevalence in certain places and in certain groups has risen quickly. Thailand is often held up as one of the world's success stories in combating HIV/AIDS, having reduced the number of new infections from 143,000 in 1991 to 29,000 in 2001. DFID has no bilateral programme there, but we do continue to monitor carefully the status of the epidemic.</p>

It outlines a post-conflict transitional phase focused on restoration of security, re-launching the economy, and provision of basic services to the most vulnerable groups. Longer term programmes for poverty reduction will be contained in a full PRSP that the Government of Sierra Leone intend to prepare by late 2003. Agreement of a full PRSP will be the key step for an agreed agenda between the Government of Sierra Leone and the donor community for poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.8/2">Peace was declared in Sierra Leone in January this year. Inevitably, the Government's initial focus has been on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants, and measures to assist the millions of internally displaced persons and returning refugees. After 10 years of conflict, Sierra Leone faces a huge task in developing and implementing policies to address poverty reduction and the Millennium Development Goals. There are some encouraging developments, for example, in improving primary school enrolment and immunisation rates, but much remains to be done in a country severely damaged by conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.8/3">We are supporting a major programme of support to reform and poverty reduction in Sierra Leone, including direct assistance with the preparation of a full PRSP. Under the Poverty Reduction Framework Arrangement signed with the Government of Sierra Leone this month, we have committed &pound;120 million over the next three years, as part of a 10-year commitment of support. This complements the US$172 million poverty reduction and growth facility agreed by Sierra Leone with the IMF in September 2001, and the US$950 million of debt relief available through the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, both of which will assist Sierra Leone to address recovery and poverty reduction.</p>

This is proceeding well: 600 school kits have already been delivered and more are on the way; rehabilitation of school buildings has also started. We are also supporting a range of scholarship programmes particularly targeting women and students from conflict-affected areas. My Senior Education Adviser visited north and south Sudan in October to review this work and to discuss plans to rehabilitate the education system in Sudan.

	<p pid=".37W.5/2">Urban reinvention is a modernisation and restructuring programme designed to ensure that urban sub post offices can operate as viable businesses for their owners and offer improved services from the right locations to serve their communities.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.5/3">As identified in the PIU report on the future of the network, the future viability of the restructured urban network will depend on the ability of the business to maximise commercial opportunities, improve efficiency and improve the quality of individual offices. It is anticipated that banking services will make a major contribution towards ensuring a viable future for many urban post offices.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.5/4">Universal banking services (both the card account and the banks own basic bank accounts), together with the Post Office's plans for an expansion of network banking (commercial arrangements between the Post Office and individual banks providing access to standard bank accounts over post office counters), should lead to a substantial increase in the number of people using post offices to do banking transactions. Wider access to bank accounts at post offices opens up a very much larger market than benefit recipients alone, and this should benefit sub-postmasters both directly and through increased footfall.</p>

The ITC advise that a relay station was built in 1975 specifically to provide analogue television coverage to Whalley, Billington and Langho, although a small area of South Whalley remains unserved. Digital terrestrial television (DTT) services are provided from the Winter Hill, Lancaster and Pendle Forest transmitters.

The programme commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-01">1 October 2002</phrase>. It applies to ICO members and requires that exports of coffee, accompanied by Certificates of Origin, shall comply with minimum standards specified in the Resolution. Exporting members are also required to develop and implement national measures to ensure that no exports of green coffee fail to meet the exportable standards. Discussions are currently on-going about how the exports of processed coffee should be dealt with.Exporting members are currently in the process of implementing the Council's Resolution within their countries. Members will report to the ICO Council on the measures they have taken to do so and of any difficulties encountered. This will feed into an ICO review of the programme planned for September 2003.</p>

This is in addition to the UK's target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/2">In November 2000, the Government published the UK climate change programme, which sets out a range of integrated policies and measures to reduce emissions in six broad sectors: the energy supply industry; business; transport; the residential sector, agriculture, forestry and land use; and, the public sector. Key policies in the programme include: the target under the Renewables Obligation that 10 per cent. of licensed electricity supplies will be generated from renewable sources by 2010; climate change levy and climate change agreements; the worlds first economy-wide emissions trading scheme; the voluntary agreements between the European Commission and the European, Japanese and Korean car manufacturers to reduce average carbon dioxide emissions from new cars, supported by changes to vehicle excise duty and company car taxation; and the Energy Efficiency Commitment on energy suppliers to encourage consumers to take up energy saving opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/3">We estimate that the quantified policies in the programme could help reduce the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by 19 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. Carbon savings, which have not been quantified, from additional policies could help us achieve our domestic goal.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.5/1">The Government has set local authorities a target to recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005. This national target has been underpinned by local authority specific statutory performance standards. These standards set levels of recycling and composting that all waste authorities must achieve by 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06. &pound;140 million was provided by the Government under its Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund to help local authorities achieve these targets. The Strategy Unit Report on Sustainable Waste Management, due to be published shortly, will also be considering recycling and composting targets and the help required to meet them.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.5/2">The Department commissioned a risk assessment that looked at the animal and public health risks posed by the composting/biogas treatment of catering waste and spreading it on land.

	<p pid=".47W.5/3">We are therefore developing processes that will allow catering waste to be composted safely, based on the results of the risk assessment (without the risk assessment, we would be obliged to follow the EU standard, which would be more restrictive). The aim is to get a draft SI out for public consultation by end November, and to amend the legislation early in the new year. The overall objective is to develop a set of rules that will allow composting of catering waste to take place economically while fully protecting animal and public health.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.8/2">Where there are clear safeguards, the Government would in principle support a limited trade in ivory that is authenticated as being derived from a properly managed source, i.e. where the elephants are managed in a sustainable manner that is not detrimental to the conservation of the species. However, we could only agree to such trade if we were satisfied that the intended market for this ivory was itself properly managed in accordance with the principles set out under the appropriate CITES Conference Resolution, and would not provide a cover for trade in illegally acquired ivory. We do not believe that the conditions to permit this are yet in place.</p>

This effectively bans the use of catering waste in commercial composting enterprises. The aim was to prevent livestock and poultry from having access to material which might introduce or spread animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease. It was not intended to prevent householders composting kitchen scraps for their own gardens. A proposed amendment to the Order to permit the composting of catering waste in approved premises will exempt domestic householders provided that they do not keep pigs or ruminants on the premises.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.8/3">Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act requires a person who deposits, recovers or disposes of waste (including compost) to obtain a waste management licence or to register an exemption from licensing. Current general guidance is that composting facilities should be at least 250 metres from residential areas. However householders who compost their own garden waste are not required to have a licence or a permit under waste management or pollution control legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.2/1">The Department has no specific information on the practices followed by other member states in relation to the composting of kitchen waste, although visits have been made to look at composting operations in Italy and the Netherlands. However, the new EU Animal By-products Regulation (expected to come into force in 2003) permits the use in composting/biogas operations of catering waste containing meat and low-risk animal by-products. For plants processing only catering waste, the Regulation allows national standards to be set, provided they guarantee an equivalent effect in pathogen reduction to the treatment standard in the Regulation (70&deg;C for one hour in a closed system).</p>
	<p pid=".52W.2/2">The Department commissioned a risk assessment that looked at the animal and public health risks posed by the composting/biogas treatment of catering waste and spreading it on land. This work concluded that, provided satisfactory controls are in place, composting/biogas treatment can be done safely.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.2/3">We are therefore developing processes that will allow catering waste to be composted safely, based on the results of the risk assessment (without the risk assessment, we would be obliged to follow the EU standard, which would be more restrictive and, possibly, counter-productive). The aim is to get a draft statutory instrument out for public consultation by the end of November, and to amend the legislation early in the new year. The overall objective is to develop a set of rules that will allow composting of catering waste to take place economically, while fully protecting animal and public health.</p>

The Agency is still finalising how the arrangement will be implemented. However, compensation will not be paid in any other circumstances.

	<p pid=".56W.6/1">This Department is not directly responsible for spending on social exclusion. However, various programmes administered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its agencies make a significant contribution.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.6/2">The Market Town Initiative is being taken forward on Defra's behalf by the regional development agencies, working with the Countryside Agency and local partners, and using &pound;37 million of Government funding announced in the Rural White Paper in November 2000 plus such match funding as can be secured from other public and private sources. Expenditure on the initiative in 2001&ndash;02 is estimated at some &pound;2.9 million by the regional development agencies and some &pound;2.5 million by the Countryside Agency. Information for the current financial year is not yet available but as most towns have now completed their action plans this should result in a substantial increase in project expenditure by rural development agencies and other partners.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.6/3">The following table shows amounts (in &pound;) spent on vital villages projects which address social exclusion. The Countryside Agency does not have a Xsocial exclusion&quot; label for its projects. The table picks up projects which target groups which can be social excluded (youth, unemployed, ethnic minorities, elderly).</p>

	<p pid=".58W.0/1">There have been no reported cases of Sudden Oak Death in Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.0/2">A strain of Phytophthora ramorum, the pathogen which has caused Sudden Oak Death in parts of California, has been found on rhododendron and viburnum plants in a number of European countries in recent years. There have been 122 findings in England and Wales since the first one in April this year. In each case infected plants and those adjacent have been destroyed. Plants in a surrounding cordon sanitaire have been held for further monitoring. In response to a UK initiative, EU measures came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-01">1 November</phrase>. These require member states to survey for the disease and apply precautionary measures through the plant passport system to prevent spread on nursery stock. Defra inspectors will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these measures.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.0/3">Defra and the Forestry Commission are funding research to address uncertainties in the risk assessment for the European strain of the pathogen, in particular to determine whether native European trees are susceptible. No effective eradicatory fungicides are known at present, but Defra and Forestry Commission scientists are closely following research into treatments in the affected areas of the USA. Further information is available on the Defra website at defraweb/planth/what.htm.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-20">20 November 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".58W.3/2">It is considered by this department and the Environment Agency that the controls for the management of waste, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, extend to the use of incinerator ash until it has been incorporated into a manufactured product (such as breeze blocks). These controls include a duty of care to manage waste safely through the prevention of harm to human health and the environment and through the prevention of the escape of waste. Furthermore, waste disposal and recovery operations are only permitted to take place under the terms of a waste management licence or an exemption from licensing.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.3/3">Until August 2000, the Edmonton incinerator was mixing bottom ash with fly ash. Following concerns about the levels of dioxins in this material, the Environment Agency launched an investigation into the destination and use of incinerator ash. The investigation found, among other details, that about 15,000 tonnes of mixed ash from Edmonton was supplied by Ballast Phoenix for the manufacture of construction blocks between 1998 and 2000. The investigation included research into the release of dioxins from construction blocks made using mixed ash from the Edmonton incinerator. The Agency found that mixed ash construction blocks do not release measurable levels of dioxins into the air, and that any dust from drilling the blocks is likely to contribute very little to typical overall exposures to dioxins.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.3/4">The Agency also recommended that subject to guidance and appropriate specifications, bottom ash could be a valuable secondary aggregate. Air Pollution Control residues and fly ash, on the other hand, are hazardous wastes and as such are subject to special controls and should be consigned to sites licensed or permitted to dispose of hazardous wastes.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.3/5">The Government commissioned the independent environmental consultants AEA Technology to produce a report on the use of incinerator bottom ash in road construction, and this is expected to be published shortly. The Agency's investigation is summarised in their report XSolid Residues from Municipal Waste Incinerators in England and Wales&quot;. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and it can also be found at: <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/105385/ashpdf4.pdf">http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/105385/ash pdf4.pdf</a></p>

As a result of the delayed implementation of the PPP, London Transport currently estimate that the final amount should be between &pound;103-&pound;105 million, an increase of between &pound;5&ndash;&pound;7 million over its December 2001 forecast. Around &pound;1.6 million of this increase arises from the Mayor's second unsuccessful legal challenge in July 2002. The court granted that these costs should be fully recovered from Transport for London.</p>

(82685)</p>
	<p pid=".64W.2/4" class="indent">The need to move to ICD-10 to maintain the value of mortality data to users is internationally recognised and it has been introduced in England and Wales on the recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO). ICD-10 more closely reflects current medical knowledge than ICD-9, which was developed in the early 1970s, introduced in 1979 and is now out-of-date. Many diseases or conditions that are now of particular interest to medical practitioners, and those working in public health and epidemiology, cannot be adequately classified using ICD-9, for example HIV/AIDS. In addition to this there is widespread demand for more modem data on heart disease and stroke. ICD-10 has been used for the classification of morbidity data in the NHS and in cancer registration since 1995. This created difficulties in comparing morbidity and mortality.</p>

	<p pid=".75W.5/1">White and brown signs giving directional information about tourist destinations are controlled by traffic authorities as part of their statutory responsibility for securing the safe and efficient movement of traffic. The main purpose of white and brown signs is to guide visitors to their intended tourist destination along the most appropriate route during the latter stage of their journey, particularly where the destination may be difficult to find. The design of signs to direct traffic to tourist attractions and facilities, and of directional traffic signs generally, is controlled through the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD). Revised TSRGD, which we expect to lay within the next few weeks, will add to the range of symbols and designs available for traffic authorities to use.</p>
	<p pid=".75W.5/2">Decisions about the provision of signs at particular locations are the responsibility of the relevant traffic authority in the light of their local circumstances and signing policies. My Department consulted earlier this year on proposals for updated guidance to local authorities and the Highways Agency on dealing with applications for new white and brown signs. We recognise the importance of getting an appropriate balance between the needs of local tourism, safety, efficient traffic management and the environment. The draft guidance has been further revised in the light of the responses to the consultation and to take account of the revisions to the TSRGD, and we expect it to be available early next year.</p>

	<p pid=".81W.0/1">We and our EU partners are working to ensure that the effect of enlargement on the EU's relations with Russia&mdash;and therefore on the UK's relationship with Russia&mdash;will be positive. The EU wants to help Russia maximise the considerable opportunities enlargement offers. EU work with Russia on WTO accession, the EU/Russia energy dialogue, the concept of a common economic space, and increased political and JHA co-operation are all contributing to this end. In addition, the EU is working closely with Russia to ensure that Kaliningrad, its Baltic sea enclave, remains a fully integrated part of the Russian Federation after enlargement.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.2/2" class="indent">XWhile the results so far are unofficial, they indicate that AKP will be the largest party in the Turkish Parliament. This is a clear expression of the popular will. As the Prime Minister said this morning, we look forward to working with the new government, as soon as it is formed. I am glad to note the commitment of AKP leaders to taking forward EU/Turkey relations. The UK is a longstanding supporter of Turkey's EU candidature. I stand ready to help Turkey move further and faster along the road to Europe. I also note AKP leaders' commitment to working with the IMF for continued economic recovery; and the stress they have placed on the promotion and protection of human rights.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.2/3" class="indent">Britain and Turkey have much to do together, particularly in the run up to the Copenhagen European Council. I very much hope this will include progress on Cyprus.

There is no reliable data on contaminated areas or numbers of landmines for the rest of the country.

All access routes to the border to be utilised by the demarcation survey and pillar construction teams have to be checked and cleared of mines where necessary. UNMEE has been mandated by the Security Council to conduct demining operations in support of the demarcation teams, and UNMEE MACC is co-ordinating and managing this project.

However, the second interim statement by the European Union Election Observation Mission, which was issued before the Presidential election in December 2001,alleged the use of Government resources for party political purposes. Evidence of this has been presented to the Zambian Supreme Court as part of the on-going petition challenging the legitimacy of the election result.</p>

	<p pid=".86W.10/1">The Department has carried out no specific assessment of the impact of university staff turnover on the quality of academic research and higher education. However, the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise showed that 55 per cent. of research staff now work in Departments containing work of international excellence compared with 31 per cent. in 1996. In addition, the recently completed QAA eight year cycle of HE subject reviews, which included an assessment of teaching quality, identified only 1 per cent. of unsatisfactory provision. The Higher Education Funding Council in September 2002 pointed to some subject areas where it is difficult to recruit including some shortage areas particularly ICT, business, science and engineering. We recognise these difficulties and the challenges our universities face recruiting and retaining in an international market. Top US universities, in particular, pay some academics and researchers salaries, which can be twice as much as their British counterparts earn.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.5/1">Schools are required under part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to take reasonable steps to prevent disabled pupils from being put at a substantial disadvantage compared to non-disabled pupils in respect of education and associated services. This would include, where appropriate, negotiating special arrangements for pupils with disabilities who are taking public examinations. What constitutes a reasonable step will depend on the circumstances of individual cases and schools will need to take into account any relevant factors, including the need to maintain academic, musical, sporting and other standards, the financial resources available to them and the costs of taking a particular step.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/2">In addition, both the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the examination boards make special arrangements for children with special educational needs, with and without statements, where it can be shown that they usually have additional or different provision in school. For pupils with Asperger's syndrome special arrangements are likely to take the form of extra time or rest breaks. The tests or examinations can also be taken in a separate room if that is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".88W.3/2">The Government announced its intention to promote better local systems for the identification, referral and tracking of children at risk as part of its street crime initiative last summer. Six local authorities, Bolton, Camden, Kensington and Chelsea, Knowsley, Lewisham and Sheffield, were selected as Trailblazers for funding of up to &pound;1 million to fast-track the development of appropriate systems, and the remaining 28 participating authorities were invited to bid for up to &pound;100,000 for initial developmental work.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.3/3">The Cross-Cutting Review on Children at Risk found that the failure to share information between agencies was a significant barrier to the provision of effective preventive services for children and young people at risk of social exclusion. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-16">16 August</phrase> I therefore announced that, as a result of the Spending Review 2002, additional funding would be made available to support all local authorities in developing local systems to identify, refer and track children at risk. The offer of &pound;100,000 has now been extended to all local authorities, and a further four Trailblazers are being identified to extend the geographical coverage and range of authorities. In both cases, authorities are due to submit their plans for taking this work forward to the Children and Young People's Unit (CYPU) for assessment and approval during December.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.3/4">Draft guidance based on the emerging experiences of the Trailblazer authorities will be published during March 2003 to support all local authorities in the further development of local systems. Concurrently, the CYPU is working with other Departments, including the Cabinet Office's Green Paper team, to develop coherent central approaches to the identification, referral and tracking of children at risk in the context of work to develop local preventive strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.0/1">Local education authorities and primary and secondary schools are not required to collect information about the drug use of their pupils' parents. There are inherent difficulties in collecting information about drug use; because of its often illegal nature, drug users are often reluctant to identify themselves to statutory bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.0/2">The Home Office is responsible for collecting information on the scale of drug misuse in England and Wales. The report of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs XThe Children of Problem Drug Users&quot; is due to be published next year and will contain estimates of the numbers of children affected by parental drug misuse. The report is also expected to make recommendations to address the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.0/3">When parents use drugs&mdash;especially problematic and illegal drugs like heroin&mdash;their children may be exposed to a range of emotional and physical hazards. Children may respond in a variety of ways, including: disturbed or anti-social behaviour; becoming withdrawn or introverted; turning to drink or drugs to escape unpleasant home situations; running away from home; losing concentration in class; and reluctance to form or develop friendships with schoolmates. The child may also be the subject of bullying if schoolmates perceive him or her to be 'different' or 'not fitting in' with the peer group. Schooling is likely to be interrupted if the child is depended upon to care for drug using parents.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.0/4">The Government recognise that the children of drug using parents are a vulnerable group. They should therefore benefit from the new requirement for every top tier or unitary local authority to prepare from April 2003 a local preventive strategy to improve outcomes for children aged 0&ndash;19 who are at risk of social exclusion. This was announced by the Minister for Young People on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-06">6 September</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-30">30 October</phrase> the Prime Minister announced to the House the Government's intention to publish a Green Paper on Children at Risk in the New Year. My Department is playing a full part in helping to make sure that vulnerable children and young people are identified as soon as possible, and that their needs are met with a coherent and effective response from the relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.3/1">Since April 2002 the LSC has been responsible for the funding of school sixth forms. In the Secretary of State's Grant Letter for 2002&ndash;03 we asked the LSC to widen council representation from the schools sector. Since then the LSC has been actively recruiting school teachers and head teachers and will continue to do so. Currently there are 19 local LSCs with teachers or head teachers of schools with sixth forms on their local councils. These are: Kent and Medway; Berkshire; Milton Keynes; Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire; Surrey; Bedfordshire; Cambridgeshire; Essex; Hertfordshire; Norfolk; Suffolk; County Durham; North Yorkshire; Greater Merseyside; Coventry and Warwickshire; Gloucestershire; West of England; London South; Northamptonshire; and Derbyshire. Three more local LSCs have head teachers of schools which do not have sixth forms.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.3/2">In addition the LSC is the process of recruiting a head teacher of a school with a sixth form to its national council.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.3/3">Further experience of schools' matters is brought by those local council members who come from local authorities and local education authorities (30 local councils have Directors of Education/Chief Education Officers, 40 local councils have elected members and 46 local councils have members with other local authority backgrounds). In addition 40 local LSCs have members who are school governors.</p>

	<p pid=".92W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> Drug, alcohol and tobacco education in the curriculum is funded via the Standards Fund. This funding, made available to local education authorities (LEAs) is to support the training of teachers and deliver effective drug, alcohol and tobacco education and prevention programmes. &pound;15.5 million has been made available in 2002&ndash;03 and this will rise to &pound;17.5 million in 2003- 04. The breakdown for 2002&ndash;03 is: Standards Fund Drug Prevention Grant&mdash;&pound;7.5 million; Standards Fund Drug Education Advisers Grant&mdash;&pound;5.7 million; Teacher training and Connexions Adviser training &pound;2.3 million. The breakdowns for 2003&ndash;04 have not yet been announced.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/3">This increase will improve the quality and coverage of drug, alcohol and tobacco education, fund drug adviser support in each LEA and help teachers deliver programmes tailor-made to meet the needs of young people across the country, including those most vulnerable to the risks of drug misuse.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/4"><i>(b)</i> Through our Behaviour Improvement Programme, we have allocated &pound;50 million to 34 LEAs with high rates of street crime and truancy to work with targeted schools in improving behaviour and attendance.

	<p pid=".92W.2/5">The Connexions Service brings together a wide range of agencies to provide information, advice, guidance and support to all young people aged 13&ndash;19, but with a sharp focus on those who need it most. I announced last week that funding for Connexions will rise to &pound;515 million by 2005&ndash;06. The vision statement for Connexions that I issued last week, along with ministerial colleagues across Whitehall, reaffirms our joint commitment to securing better outcomes for this age group, but specifically around increasing the number who participate in education training and employment and reducing the number of young people who become involved in crime.</p>

Chesham and Amersham is a district of Buckinghamshire Local Education Authority. In Buckinghamshire LEA, 36 schools had a fall in their cash budget share in 2002&ndash;03. Of these, six schools closed mid-year. Five of the 36 schools also had a fall in their cash budget share per pupil.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.5/3">Changes in pupil numbers are the principal reason for changes in budget share. 200 schools did not have a fall in their budget share, but of these, six had a fall in their cash budget share per pupil. This was largely in cases where small primary schools had rising rolls and, therefore, received less of the extra funding that goes to the smallest schools under the authority's formula.</p>

	<p pid=".95W.3/2">If no statement is maintained for a child, they must be educated in a mainstream school. Children with statements of special educational needs should also be taught in a mainstream school and the LEA should find a place for them where parents wish it, and it is not incompatible with the efficient education of other children. This will also apply to accommodation centre residents who subsequently remain in this country after leaving the centre. For children and their parents who are resident in an accommodation centre, local education authorities will be able to disapply the relevant provisions of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to name a mainstream school in a child's statement, having carried out a statutory assessment of a child's special educational needs, if they consider that the accommodation centre or a special school will not be able to meet the child's needs. We would, however, expect local education authorities to take this course of action only rarely, and the great majority of children will have their special educational needs met appropriately in the accommodation centres.</p>

The introduction of a Central London Road User charge will not affect this. Home Office staff who travel on official business are required to use the most efficient and economical means of travel, taking all costs into account. Subject to that, staff who are required to drive their own vehicles, or hire vehicles, within the charging zone will be reimbursed.</p>

	<p pid=".99W.5/1">There is no legal presumption to this effect, and the Government do not intend to introduce one. Road traffic law is based on the principle that the prime consideration in deciding how to deal with road traffic offenders should be the degree of culpability. In many cases, even though an accident between a driver and a cyclist might have had tragic consequences, the driver may not have been at fault. In the police investigation of such an accident, the cyclist and driver are treated on exactly the same basis. Any decision as to charges against either party will depend on an assessment of all the evidence available.</p>

	<p pid=".100W.2/1">The House of Lords has made decisions today in two cases that deal with the arrangements for the sentencing of adults convicted of murder. These judgments concern matters of fundamental significance for the criminal justice system and the role of Parliament and Ministers in formulating policy on the provision of adequate punishment for the guilty and the protection of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/2">In the case of Pyrah and Lichniak, the House of Lords has confirmed that the mandatory life sentence for murder is compatible with the rights protected by the European Convention of Human Rights. This sentence will remain in place.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/3">The case of Anderson deals with the Home Secretary's power to set the tariff, or minimum period a convicted murderer must remain in custody until he becomes eligible for release. This power has ensured ministerial accountability to Parliament within the criminal justice system for the punishment imposed for the most heinous and serious of crimes. When Parliament took its decision to abolish the death penalty for murder, this was the framework with which it was replaced. The House of Lords has not ruled that the Home Secretary's power is unlawful. All existing tariffs therefore stand. The House of Lords has declared instead that the Home Secretary's power to set tariffs for those convicted of murder is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The existing law and tariffs set according to it therefore remain until new legislation is in place.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/4">This judgment will affect only the issue of who sets the tariff in each case. As is proper in a democracy, Parliament will continue to retain the paramount role of setting a clear framework within which the minimum period to be served will be established. I am determined that there should continue to be accountability to Parliament for these most critical decisions. This is fundamental to our democracy and to the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/5">We need to study the judgment carefully before finalising our proposals but I intend to legislate this Session to establish a clear set of principles within which the courts will fix tariffs in the future. These principles will be debated and agreed by both Houses of Parliament and in setting a tariff, the judge will be required, in open court, to give reasons if the term being imposed departs from those principles. The Attorney General already has powers in relation to unduly lenient sentences and it will be open to him to challenge any tariff which he does not consider to be consistent with these principles.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/6">These principles will set a framework within which judicial discretion, which is an essential feature of sentencing, will operate. They will be robust and comprehensive. We envisage that they will comprise a statement of the major guiding principles followed by a series of clear messages about the tariffs Parliament expects to be imposed for different categories of murder. The principles will provide entry points for particular categories of murder, which would be adjusted up or down in line with specified aggravating and mitigating factors. The principles will set out that for the most serious crimes&mdash;such as the sexual, sadistic murder of children&mdash;life should mean life. The principles will incorporate the same aggravating factors upon which previous Home Secretaries and I have based our decisions. These factors will include murder committed in the course of armed robbery or the murder of prison or police officers in the course of their duty as set out to Parliament by my predecessor Leon Brittan in 1983. In the case of existing tariffs, these arrangements will ensure that any judicial reconsideration is on the basis of this same set of principles.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/7">I believe that coupled with the new arrangements for the determination of release of mandatory life prisoners by the Parole Board, under which I will have an opportunity to make representations on the impact of any future offending by the prisoner concerned, the provisions I have outlined will amount to a sensible and secure scheme for the management of life sentences generally. The new scheme will be compatible with our Human Rights obligations and will also ensure that Parliament has established the framework for dealing with the most dangerous and evil people in our society.</p>

Nor is he responsible for enforcing the law&mdash;this is a matter for those who hold the office of a constable or who have otherwise been given specific powers by Parliament.

	<p pid=".104W.2/1">Sir David O'Dowd's taskforce was commissioned to give the Government a police service view of what could be done to tackle the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices which keep police officers off the streets. The taskforce report highlighted ways to free up significant amounts of officers' time. We have now set up a steering group, co-chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office, to take the taskforce recommendations forward.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.2/2">The Government recognise its responsibilities to support this work, including considering changes to legislation where necessary. Indeed, in line with a number of taskforce recommendations, the Police Reform Act 2002 has already made the necessary changes in the law to enable chief officers to expand the range of functions that support staff can perform in the custody suite. We will also ensure that significant funding is made available to improve police information technology. This is a vital opportunity to change the culture and management of the police service and bring about a real difference to the everyday lives of officers on the front line.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.3/1">The research into strip-searching to be conducted by the University of Nottingham was commissioned as a response to the review of searching. The Prison Service accommodates large and diverse populations all of which may have differing experiences and attitudes to strip-searching. The research was commissioned to identify whether, and if so what, changes can be made in the procedures for strip searching to improve its effectiveness. The aim of the research is to consider the views of staff, their approach and demeanour while conducting strip searches and the perceptions of prisoners of strip searching. A copy of the review of searching is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.3/2">While some records of strip searches are kept, for example of cell searches, to record every search would pose an unacceptable administrative burden and could only be achieved at a disproportionate cost. Manual records do not allow for easy analysis or collation of statistics and it is for these reasons that an Information Technology (IT) solution is being developed.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.3/3">The IT provider for the Prison Service has been asked to produce a system that will enable all prisons to record the frequency and outcomes of strip searches, to provide information on the prisoner, such as age, gender and ethnicity, the reason for the search, the amount of time taken to conduct the search, a record of finds, and a facility that can generate statistical information on strip searches.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.8/1">In June this year, the London Borough of Redbridge was allocated just over 426,000 to help them reduce the number of homeless families with children in Bed and Breakfast hotels (B&amp;B) and to meet the national commitment of ensuring that by March 2004 no such household is in B&amp;B, other than in an emergency, and even then for no more than six weeks. Rebridge will also benefit from the increased housing benefit subsidy rates, estimated nationally at &pound;10 million, introduced in April this year. This provides additional subsidy to local authorities to secure self-contained temporary accommodation, rather than B&amp;B, for homeless households.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/2">The net costs to local authorities of securing accommodation for homeless applicants, apart from those costs related to the use of authorities' own housing stock, are funded through general grant. Grant is distributed through Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) and local authorities' responsibilities in this area are contained within the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) SSA block. The London Borough of Redbridge received an increase in it's EPCS SSA of &pound;1.35m which equals a 3 per cent. increase. For local authorities overall, the EPCS SSA is set to increase by an average of 4 per cent. a year up to 2005/06.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.3/2">In line with all employers in the public and private sector, the Government believes that the civil service should be allowed to determine retirement age policy with regard to its business needs while giving staff as much choice as possible about when they retire. Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.3/3">Against this background, 75 per cent. of the civil service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions. Those Departments and agencies which have decided that there is a strong case for retaining a retirement age of 60 in the current circumstances will be expected to continue to re-examine the issue and look positively at offering more flexibilities to older staff.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.3/4">The normal retirement age for the senior civil service is 60. However, Heads of Departments and Agency Chief Executives have the flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.</p>

	<p pid=".118W.5/1">Excellence in Cities (EiC) had a total budget allocation of &pound;182 million for the financial year 2000&ndash;01, of this some &pound;12 million was unspent and reverted to the departmental central budget.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.5/2">For the financial year 2001&ndash;02 the total budget was some &pound;303.1 million.

	<p pid=".118W.5/3">Neighbourhood Management Pathfinders (NMP) and the Business Brokers (BB) are two programmes which form part of the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit's New Ventures Fund (NVF). Plans for both programmes were put in place after the unit was set up in April 2001; there were no budgets for either in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.5/4">The NVF had a total budget of &pound;50 million for 2001&ndash;02. Of this &pound;6 million was allocated to NMP in 2001&ndash;02 and expenditure totalled &pound;2.4 million. BB proposals were less advanced and expenditure totalled &pound;41,000. Some &pound;22 million of NVF funding was unspent to be carried forward.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.5/5">Both programmes form part of the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit's spending plans for this year 2002&ndash;03 and for the SR2002 period.</p>

We are currently devoting a further &pound;154,000 over three years to the National Autistic Society project XIndependence and Autism: Good Practice for Service Providers&quot;.

	<p pid=".129W.5/2">The XValuing People&quot; White Paper directly covers every adult with autism who also has a learning disability. Implementation guidance, issued in August last year, makes clear that adults with Asperger's Syndrome or higher functioning autism are not precluded from using learning disability services, where appropriate, and may require an assessment of their social functioning and communication skills in order to establish their level of need. By bringing together a wide range of local statutory agencies, XValuing People&quot; gives us the scope to improve opportunities and services for people across the autistic spectrum.</p>
	<p pid=".129W.5/3">People with autism will also gain, along with others, from the investment we are making to improve standards in health and social care services. In particular they will benefit from the NHS Plan, the mental health national service framework, which covers the mental health needs of adults with autism, and fair access to care services.</p>

	<p pid=".131W.3/2">Ambulance services are required to maintain their capability to respond to a range of major incidents, including chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear incidents. But due to the changes in risk and scale, the Ambulance Service Association has been working in conjunction with other emergency services to produce a national approach based on a common doctrine, standard approach and common procedures. This work is approaching its conclusion and that we can expect recommendations shortly. National procurement arrangements for interim personal protective equipment have already been completed and higher specification equipment and decontamination units are now being delivered, which will ensure that each ambulance service will have access to common equipment.</p>

	<p pid=".131W.7/2">Ambulance services, based on their local risk assessment, were required to train teams of staff in dealing with a chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear incident. As they take delivery of decontamination units and newer protective equipment, further training programmes are being instigated on a cascade basis. The current number of staff trained is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".133W.6/1">The Government fully recognise the importance of ensuring that the needs of people with dementia and their carers are met. For that reason, the national service framework (NSF) for older people has a standard, a service model and milestones to monitor progress around the health and social needs of older people with mental health problems, including all people with dementia, and requirements around meeting the needs of their carers.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.6/2">A key element of the NSF requirements is ensuring early diagnosis of dementia. We are aware of concerns over this, and of the research funded by the Alzheimer's Society to assess ways of helping primary care teams with diagnosis and treatment of dementia. The Department's care group workforce team for older people's services is also looking at the training needs of staff working with people with dementia.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.6/3">Various other strands of work are under way to help with implementation of the NSF. For example, consideration is being given to the inclusion of a clinical guideline on the management of dementia within the programme of work of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.6/4">As a result of the national carers strategy, carers of people with dementia have a right to an assessment of both their needs and ability to continue caring. Ring-fenced money totalling &pound;85 million this year and &pound;100 million next year has been provided to allow carers to take short term breaks from their caring responsibilities. In certain circumstances, carers may also receive cash that they can use to purchase the services they need.</p>

It resulted in a large number of people requesting the information packs. The choice protects review is considering recruitment of foster carers and there is a clear message that the best recruitment campaigns are those delivered locally, so that the methods of recruitment can be responsive to local populations.

No help is available if a person has capital of more than &pound;8,000 (&pound;12,000 if they or their partner are aged 60 or over). In 2001&ndash;02, 29 people receiving contributory jobseekers allowance successfully claimed entitlement to free prescriptions.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.5/1">The Government and the Department of Health are committed to the enhancement of the professional status of those involved in social care work.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/2">The national social care recruitment campaign, launched in October 2001, has just entered its second year. It is aimed at informing the public about social work and social care, as well as encouraging recruitment and retention. The campaign includes both national and local press and radio advertising and particular efforts are being made in some areas such as London and the South East that have more severe problems with recruitment and retention of social workers.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/3">This commitment was further proven by the introduction of the Care Standards Act 2000, this brought into being, among other regulatory bodies, the General Social Care Council (GSCC). The GSCC is responsible for improving standards across the sector and registering qualified and competent social workers and social care staff. As part of this process, the GSCC published codes of practice for social care workers and employers on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-23">23 September 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/4">The training strategy implementation fund&mdash; &pound;15 million in the current year&mdash;is available to all employers in social care to support 26,500 staff to participate in skill development programmes. The focus of half of this funding will be to strengthen the National Vocational Qualification infrastructure within the workplace. With this investment, employers will be able to further train their staff and managers and establish a culture of lifelong learning and continuous professional development within social care.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/5">Introduction of the new three year degree and bursaries will be a unique opportunity to transform the status, image and position of social workers&mdash;making social work what it should be, a graduate profession in its own right&mdash;and build on the best of social work education and training.</p>

	<p pid=".146W.3/1">The Surrey and Sussex Strategic health authority has advised me the former West Sussex health authority did not have a deficit.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.3/2">The Princess Royal hospital was part of Mid Sussex national health service trust. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> the trust was dissolved and the management of the acute services provided by the hospital was transferred to the Brighton and Sussex University hospitals NHS trust. The final accounts of the Mid Sussex NHS trust presented an outturn deficit of &pound;2.7 million. However, the underlying deficit was &pound;4.7 million.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.3/3">In June 2002 the trust was allocated transitional funds of &pound;4 million from the NHS bank to offset the underlying deficit. The trust planned to manage the remainder of the deficit through cash releasing efficiency savings.</p>
