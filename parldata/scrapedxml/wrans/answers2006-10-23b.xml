	<p pid="b.1532W.5/1">No wards at Selly Oak Hospital are specifically reserved for military patients. Although Service patients are nursed with other Service patients when this is clinically feasible, the over-riding factor in the treatment of any patient must be their clinical condition and need. The patient must be placed in the most appropriate specialist environment, with associated equipment and trained personnel who have the necessary skill sets. Furthermore, the current requirement for hospital in-patient beds for military patients is relatively low. For example, a total of only 13 military patients were overnight inpatients at all the Birmingham hospitals on the night of 19-<phrase class="date" code="2007-10-20">20 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.5/2">Nevertheless, steps are being taken to ensure that military patients do not feel &quot;cut off&quot; from the military community. There is a significant military medical staff presence at Selly Oak, involved in the care of Service patients. They are assisted by the staff of the Aeromedical Evacuation Cell, the Military Patient Administration Cell and the Defence Medical Welfare Services. The military chain of command also works to maintain links between the individual patient and their parent single Service unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.5/3">As my right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-10">10 October</phrase>, we have increased the number of military nurses in Selly Oak; we are establishing a military managed ward in partnership with Selly Oak Hospital that we plan to have operational by the end of the year; and we are improving the welfare package for our injured troops at Selly Oak and in hospitals elsewhere&mdash;including a daily allowance to meet extra costs while they are inpatients and improved allowances for their families.</p>

	<p pid="b.1544W.10/1">Much of the banking sector in Iraq is state owned and in a very poor financial condition. The range of financial services available is very limited. Restructuring of the banking system is widely identified as a high priority in creating the conditions for non-oil economic growth. The United States (US) has led on banking sector reform in partnership with the Iraqi authorities. This will remain a priority for the Government of Iraq in the coming years. DFID works with the Ministry of Finance in Iraq to take forward other essential reforms including reform of state subsidies, promoting public investment and reforming the oil sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1544W.10/2">In Afghanistan the situation is similar. Despite some progress in recent years the banking sector remains extremely weak. As with Iraq, the sector is dominated by the state owned banks but in Afghanistan financial services, such as money transfers, are often carried out under the informal Hawala system. The US has also led on banking sector reform in Afghanistan. At the request of the Government of Afghanistan, DFID has focused on assisting budget planning and execution and on support to tax reform, where we are the lead donor.</p>

	<p pid="b.1545W.2/1">Since 2002, when the conflict ended, the World Food Programme (WFP) has provided humanitarian support to Angola. This has covered a range of activities, including feeding operations, re-building infrastructure to enable access to remote regions with populations in need, and providing passenger air transport service for the humanitarian community. Last year, DFID provided over &pound;1 million to WFP to support these activities in Angola.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.2/2">The food security situation in Angola has improved significantly since 2002. WFP's operations are scheduled to end by early 2007, with WFP retaining a residual presence for capacity building and monitoring for the remainder of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.2/3">DFID's assessment is that Angola's short-term humanitarian needs are much less significant than the levels of chronic poverty that make hunger a long-term problem in the country. Mortality rates in Angola are driven more by inadequate water, sanitation and health care than by food supply shortages. This is the situation for many countries in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.2/4">DFID is already providing substantial support in these areas through a &pound;3.5 million grant to UNICEF's operation in Angola.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.2/5">Over the next three years, DFID will provide at least &pound;7.5 million to support WFP's preparedness for, and ability to respond, to humanitarian crises. This is over and above any contribution we will make to individual WFP appeals. This will complement the work we are already doing in the Southern African region to improve food security information systems, so that we can respond quickly and appropriately to hunger needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.2/6">DFID will continue to carefully monitor the food security situation in Angola.</p>

	<p pid="b.1547W.2/2">The PCRU spent &pound;1.6 million in financial year (FY) 04/05, &pound;3.7 million in FY 05/06, and has an allocation of &pound;10.5 million for FY 06/07 and &pound;10.5 million in FY 07/08.

	<p pid="b.1547W.2/4">In Afghanistan, it facilitated an assessment and plan for all of the UK's involvement in Helmand Province including activities to help achieve security, promote economic development, to help reduce the production and trafficking of illicit drugs and to assist in the creation of a provincial government that is able to plan for, and deliver, basic services. It has then provided seven staff and consultants over the last eight months, prior to the establishment of longer-term staffing arrangements by DFID and FCO, to help design and implement specific programmes including establishing a Provincial Development Council to determine priorities for the province and enhancing coordination between the Afghan army and police. They have also helped deliver quick impact programmes such as better irrigation, more reliable power supply in a hospital, protection for police facilities and extending reception of the BBC World Service Pashto Service. PCRU has also provided the majority of the staff of the Strategic Delivery Unit in the British embassy in Kabul, which monitors the impact of all UK activities in Afghanistan and helps to ensure consistency in delivering UK's security, counter-narcotics and development objectives;</p>
	<p pid="b.1547W.2/5">In Iraq, it is providing the team leader and key support staff for the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Basra which coordinates and helps deliver UK, US and Danish assistance to the Iraqi government in the south, focusing on the Basra Province. The PRT has enabled the Basra Provincial Council identify its priorities and is helping the council turn these into specific projects in areas such as water supply and economic development, secure funding from central government and put in place the systems needed to ensure effective implementation. It has worked closely with the British military to ensure the complementarity of their quick impact projects with the priorities of the Council;</p>
	<p pid="b.1547W.2/6">In Sudan, it is helping finance and manage a project to enable the Africa Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to promote the benefits of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) to encourage non-signatories to join;</p>
	<p pid="b.1547W.2/7">In Lebanon during the war, PCRU supported cross-government assessments of the emerging crisis and identification of options for the UK's involvement in Lebanon's recovery. Subsequently, it has helped the British embassy develop projects to contribute to peace building and reconstruction through seconding a member of staff, and contributed to developing proposals for British Government support to enhancing the Lebanese government's ability to bring stability to the south;</p>
	<p pid="b.1547W.2/8">It has also provided advice on specific British security and justice sector programmes (including policing) in Yemen, Sri Lanka, the Balkans and the Occupied Territories.</p>

	<p pid="b.1560W.5/12">Between 1996-97 and 2004-05 (the latest year for which data are available) pensioner incomes increased by 25 per cent. in real terms, compared with a 15 per cent. real terms increase in utility bills between 1996-97 and 2006. It is important to note that while pensioner incomes tend to increase on a linear basis, with 4 per cent. real growth between 2003-04 and 2004-05 building on the growth in earlier years, utility prices tend to fluctuate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1563W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Anthony Douglas, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.2/4" class="indent">I am writing to you in response to the parliamentary question that you tabled recently: PQ94874&mdash;In what ways Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service officers are held accountable for the content of their reports under the organisation's complaints policy?</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.2/5" class="indent">The reports that CAFCASS practitioners submit in the range of Family Court proceedings are professional assessments made by practitioners to assist the court in reaching a conclusion in complex disputes concerning the best welfare interests of the children at the centre of those proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.2/6" class="indent">The individual practitioner is necessarily accountable to the court for the content of that report and the method that was used to compile that report, and the professional basis of the assessment that is made within it. The Court hearing offers parties to the court case the opportunity to challenge both the content of the report and the method used by the CAFCASS practitioner to produce their assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.2/7" class="indent">CAFCASS complaints procedures allow for any factual errors in reports to be corrected prior to the court hearing where CAFCASS has been informed or becomes aware of such errors in advance of that hearing. This would not include any issues of disputed facts, which would be matters that the court itself would have to consider, weigh up and form a judgment about, in the light of all of the available evidence before it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.2/8" class="indent">CAFCASS as an organisation holds the responsibility for ensuring that such reports are prepared to recognised standards and that the quality of work undertaken by practitioners on its behalf, in preparing and completing such reports, meets these standards. CAFCASS practitioners are directly accountable to their line managers or contract managers for their adherence to its Service Standards. Allegations that CAFCASS practitioners have breached CAFCASS Service Standards are specifically noted within CAFCASS complaints procedures as being matters that can properly be examined within those procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.2/9" class="indent">Complaints about CAFCASS in particular cases, which are not resolved by its complaints procedure, can be referred to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.2/10" class="indent">During the course of 2006 CAFCASS has introduced new quality assurance procedures in order to guarantee the quality of reports prepared on its behalf, prior to them being submitted to the Courts. CAFCASS is also currently consulting on new national standards to replace existing current Service Standards, for all its work including report writing, and is about to issue on 1st November a new Record Keeping Policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1564W.3/1">The DfES welcomes the Ofsted report &quot;Towards Consensus&mdash;Citizenship in Secondary Schools&quot; which recognises that much good work has taken place, that steady progress is being made in citizenship teaching and acknowledges that there is still much room for improvement. 200 initial teacher training places in citizenship education are being made available each year and the DfES is funding 1,200 Citizenship Continuing Professional Development (CPD) places over the next two years to enable citizenship teachers to broaden and deepen their subject knowledge. We have also published a CPD handbook and citizenship self-evaluation tools for both primary and secondary schools. We continue to support the Association of Citizenship Teachers and work with a range of organisations to provide resources and support for teachers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1565W.2/1">No. The proposed offence at clause 100 of the Education and Inspections Bill will require the parents of pupils who have been excluded from school to ensure that their child is not in a public place during school hours during the first five days of exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565W.2/2">The proposed legislation is framed in such a way that such parents could avail themselves of the defence of &quot;reasonable justification&quot; where circumstances prevent compliance with the duty. In the case of a child being in a public place, such as a public library, at the relevant time, it would be for the parent to prove their presence was reasonable. For example, the parent would have to demonstrate why the library could not have been visited outside of school hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565W.2/3">Ultimately it will be for the courts to decide whether reasonable justification has been proved.</p>

	<p pid="b.1565W.5/2">A scheme for the new Church of England and Roman Catholic Faith School has been agreed and the proposals have been approved by the local Schools Organisation Committee. The capital funding for the new build has been secured.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565W.5/3">Liverpool Archdiocese has informed the Department that although the scheme has been agreed with all concerned, the promised pupil numbers have not materialised. Over the last two years the numbers have actually reduced and the number on roll currently stands at 70 pupils plus 11 in the nursery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565W.5/4">Both the Liverpool Archdiocese and the Church of England Diocese are anxious to see some movement on the new school build programme. However, they are conscious that a new school cannot be justified with the current numbers on roll. The Dioceses and the local authority are currently trying to establish a suitable way forward for this school in line with the wider regeneration programme in Liverpool.</p>

	<p pid="b.1568W.0/1">Each local authority's total Dedicated Schools Grant for 2006-07 was calculated by multiplying their full-time equivalent pupils (aged 3 to 15) from the January 2006 pupil count by their Dedicated Schools Grant Guaranteed Unit of Funding (the Dedicated Schools Grant Guaranteed Unit of Funding is unchanged from that set in December 2005 and is available on Teachernet at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=9405">www.teachernet. gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=9405</a>.)</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.0/2">The Dedicated Schools Grant Guaranteed Unit of Funding for 2006-07 was based on actual spend per pupil in 2005-06, with a basic increase of 5 per cent. per pupil (5.1 per cent. for London authorities) and headroom allocated to reflect five ministerial priorities (personalisation at key stage 3, personalisation in primary schools, more practical learning options at 14 to 16, workforce reform and early years expansion). &pound;30 million was also distributed between authorities who spent below the level of undamped Schools Formula Spending Share in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.0/3">Where authorities were below 90 per cent. participation for their three-year-olds in January 2006, the number of three-year-olds for funding purposes was brought up to 90 per cent. of the projected population.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.0/4">Each authority also received a minimum cash increase of at least 4 per cent. over their 2005-06 Dedicated Schools Grant allocation to provide additional support for authorities with falling rolls.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.0/5">The methodology for calculating the Dedicated Schools Grant in 2007-08 will be the same as for 2006-07. An overview to the 2007-08 Dedicated Schools Grant allocation process can be found at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm">http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm</a>?id==10356.</p>

The Dedicated Schools Grant in 2006-07 was &pound;152.202 million in Medway (an increase per pupil of 6.8 per cent.) and &pound;718.205 million in Kent (an increase per pupil of 6.9 per cent. which includes the Gravesham constituency).</p>

	<p pid="b.1594W.2/1">The &pound;0.2 million expenditure mentioned in the previous reply on events for local authorities includes termly meetings of local authority attendance leaders in each English region. These meetings are organised and facilitated by the National Strategies' Assistant Regional Advisors for Attendance. The purpose of each meeting is to present current developments and to share effective practice on attendance management between local authorities. A separate conference was held on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-21">21 September 2005</phrase> for selected local authorities on improving school attendance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1594W.2/2">The eight attendance advisers who were seconded to my Department from local authorities were: Ron Collinson; Sandra Fletcher; Richard Harvey; Ken Johnson; Linda Rundle; Hilary Shaw; John Smail; and Ingvar Spencer. Their costs ranged between &pound;32,000 and &pound;71,000 and reflected their local authority salary. This was paid pro-rata as some of the advisers only worked for the Department on a part-time basis. Each received an amount for travel and subsistence and, in one case, for administrative support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1594W.2/3">The current Capita National Strategies Assistant Regional Advisors for Attendance team is made up of: Senior Regional Attendance Advisor: Sue Bainbridge; Current Assistant Regional Advisors for Attendance: Margaret Bleet; Heather Clapp; Chris Gabbett (from January 2007); Jean Gunning; Kenneth Hart; Colin Logan; Linda Rundle; Peter Walker; and Paul Wright. The previous Assistant Regional Advisors for Attendance were: Trevor Folley; Pippa Jackson; and Sam Penn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1594W.2/4">The salary scale for the Senior Regional Attendance Advisor is &pound;59,963-&pound;63,456. The salary scale for the Assistant Regional Advisors for Attendance is &pound;51,984-&pound;55,339.</p>

	<p pid="b.1596W.5/1">All children and young people should be able to achieve their potential, whatever their ethnic and cultural background and whichever school they attend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1596W.5/2">All unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) of compulsory school age receive the same educational entitlement as citizen children. All unaccompanied minors are cared for by the local authorities and therefore have the same entitlement as all looked-after children. Unaccompanied asylum seekers aged 16-18 are eligible for courses funded by the Learning and Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.1596W.5/3">The Department has issued a guide to good practice for local authorities and schools &quot;Aiming High: Guidance on Supporting the Education of Asylum Seeking and Refugee children&quot;. It explores the role of local authorities and schools and offers practical suggestions for the provision of good quality education for these vulnerable children. The guidance can be found on our website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1596W.5/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ethnicminorities/">www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ethnicminorities/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1596W.5/5">The Department does not collect information centrally on expenditure on the education of UASC in school or further education. Local authorities can spend their Dedicated Schools Grant on the education of these children pre-16, and this can include resources targeted through the local funding formula to schools with children who have additional educational needs or special educational needs. As aforementioned, UASC aged 16-18 are eligible for courses funded by the Learning and Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.1596W.5/6">The education of UASC is also supported by the Government through a number of specific grants. My Department provides funding to local authorities to support provision for bilingual learners and pupils from minority ethnic groups at risk of underachieving, through the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG). This is a ring-fenced grant allocated to local authorities and distributed on a needs based formula. &pound;173.6 million will be paid to local authorities for the period 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1596W.5/7">Children's Services Grant includes &pound;42 million in 2006-07 for vulnerable children which is intended to secure improved access to education for vulnerable children, in particular: to provide high quality education for those unable to attend school or whose circumstances make it difficult for them to do so, such as school age mothers, Gypsy, Traveller and Roma children, asylum seekers and young carers; and to support attendance, integration or reintegration into school.</p>
	<p pid="b.1596W.5/8">The Department also provides funding to local authorities towards the cost of supporting UASC care leavers (aged 18 and over) through the UASC Leaving Care Grant. This funding is over and above mainstream funding and can be used towards general costs of supporting UASC care leavers, including education costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1598W.6/1">As a member of the Inter-departmental Ministerial Group on Domestic Violence, I am actively involved in discussions with ministerial colleagues relating to this issue, and we all acknowledge the importance of taking appropriate steps to tackle forced marriage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1598W.6/2">A consultation was held from September to December 2005 on whether to create a specific criminal offence of forcing someone into marriage. We have considered fully the pros and cons of a specific offence before deciding whether or not to legislate, and Baroness Scotland announced the Government's decision not to introduce specific legislation on June 7 2006. Respondents feared that legislation would drive the problem further underground and increase the risk of forced marriage victims being taken overseas and held there.</p>
	<p pid="b.1598W.6/3">We have not ruled out the possibility of developing new legislation in relation to forced marriage in the future, but believe that a specific offence should only be created if there are gaps in existing legislation which cannot be filled. However, in order to tackle the issue more effectively, several recommendations for non-legislative activity will be taken forward. The Forced Marriage Unit is now pursuing the recommendations for non-legislative measures, including increasing training to professionals and more outreach work, increasing work with statutory agencies to implement guidelines, and making better use of existing legislation, civil remedies and the family courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1598W.6/4">There are many existing criminal offences which may be committed during a forced marriage, such as kidnap, false imprisonment, assault, rape and in some cases murder. The Government support forced marriage victims who choose to make prosecutions and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.1599W.3/1">Each of these bodies is required to cover its full economic costs within a permitted tolerance through charging for its services to Defra and other public and private sector customers. As such Defra does not set specific cost budgets in the same way as for other delivery bodies such as non-departmental public bodies. Rather it enters into negotiated contracts for services, some of which are demand led. Defra regularly reviews the expected levels of demand for these services and signals to agencies where throughput is lower than originally planned. The staffing implications of such changes are the responsibility of the agency's own accounting officer taking into account all of their business.</p>
	<p pid="b.1599W.3/2">So far during 2006-07 the only changes to the level of Defra's forecast business with these agencies was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1599W.3/3" class="indent">1. A &pound;2.35 million reduction in the expected volume of animal surveillance and post-mortem testing work purchased from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1602W.3/1">The bi-directional transmission of infection between badgers and cattle is undisputed&mdash; i.e. both are capable of being the source of infection for the other, and both are capable of maintaining the infection in their respective groups in the absence of the other. Transmission of infection can be either through direct (animal to animal) contact or indirect contact from the environment. Wild deer may in certain situations act as a reservoir of infection although a recent quantitative risk assessment has shown that the relative risk to cattle from wild deer is lower than that from badgers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.3/2">Research demonstrates that due to the combination of the differences in the pathology of the disease and the active surveillance, testing and culling policy pursued in cattle, a higher proportion of badgers are infected and when infected they are more likely to be infectious.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.3/3">We are continuing to carry out research to try to clarify the relative importance of the different routes of transmission. For example, recent research using data from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial has shown that during the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001 when cattle TB testing and badger culling was suspended, the prevalence in badgers increased and contributed to an increase in cattle TB.</p>

	<p pid="b.1603W.2/1">The chief veterinary officer recently issued a report on a reduction in the number of new tuberculosis (TB) incidents in Great Britain (GB). This report is available from the DEFRA website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/3">The report includes an assessment of the performance characteristics of the tuberculins manufactured by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) and by Lelystad in Holland in the context of GB's TB in cattle testing programme. It suggests that, although the two tuberculins perform slightly differently in the field, and that this could be a small contributory factor to the reduction in the number of new TB incidents, the difference is not significant enough to account for the whole fall.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/4">Both tuberculins are produced and assayed to the same standard, as part of European Union licensing procedures. However, as tuberculin is a biological product, there has always been variability between batches&mdash;even from the same supplier. Our reviews do not call into question the efficacy of either tuberculin supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/5">DEFRA has established arrangements to purchase further supplies of tuberculin from Lelystad as required to minimise the risk of disruption to the TB testing programme. Either Lelystad or VLA tuberculin will be released for field use as stocks become available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/6">We will continue to closely monitor and analyse the relative performance characteristics of the two sources of tuberculin currently used in GB.</p>

	<p pid="b.1606W.3/1">In England, legislation prohibiting the use of lead shot on named Sites of Special Scientific Interest, considered important for waterfowl, and all Ramsar (wetland) sites, came into force in 1999. It also prohibited the use of lead shot for shooting various waterfowl species. Minor amendments to the species and sites listed in the 1999 regulations were made in 2002 and 2003. Resources permitting, my Department is planning to undertake an assessment of compliance with lead shot regulations during 2007-08. The results of the compliance work will inform a review of the operation of the regulations that I hope will take place later in 2008.</p>

The extent of the measures that water companies undertake to promote water efficiency varies according to their water resource position. I expect water companies in water stressed areas to have a more comprehensive programme of measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1612W.5/2">In October 2005, the Government established the Water Saving Group, which I chair. It brings together key water industry stakeholders including water companies, Ofwat and the Environment Agency, to promote the efficient use of water in households. The group has a comprehensive action plan to deliver in a two year period. It includes work on measuring success, including looking at .possible targets and benchmarks, research into customers' perceptions of (and attitudes to) water use, the policy and regulatory framework, developing incentives for water efficiency and identifying and addressing gaps in the knowledge base.</p>

With our EU partners we will continue to encourage the Government of Pakistan to pass these reforms as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1625W.5/1">We are seriously concerned about the deterioration of human rights in Sri Lanka in recent months. Any abuse of human rights is to be deplored, and it is essential that all parties to the conflict refrain from actions that may result in violations of human rights. We have raised our concerns with the Sri Lankan Government at the highest levels, and our high commissioner in Colombo presses Sri Lankan Ministers regularly on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1625W.5/2">We note reports that at least sixty adolescents have died following bombing by the Sri Lanka Airforce of the Sencholai compound in Mullaitivu. It is tragic that so many lives, particularly of young people, have been lost in such circumstances. The full facts and circumstances of the bombing are not yet clear, and it is vital to establish the truth of this and other recent allegations not least for the relatives of those killed and injured. The frequent inability to establish the full circumstances and truth of such incidents is a clear and recurrent source of frustration to those directly affected and serves to increase the concern of the international community who are monitoring the situation closely. For this reason, we welcome President Rajapakse's initiative for a national commission to inquire into recent killings, disappearances and abductions in Sri Lanka and a panel of international observers to oversee the process. We agree with the views expressed in September by the UN rapporteur on extra-judicial killing that such a process must be independent, credible and empowered to make a difference.</p>

We are therefore not currently considering a Chapter VIII Article 53 operation, whereby the Security Council could authorise enforcement action by a regional organisation such as the African Union and its Mission in Sudan (AMIS) force. But as Article 52 of Chapter VIII permits regional arrangements to undertake the peaceful settlement of disputes, AMIS already is a Chapter VIII operation, which we have strongly supported.

We discuss our work before and during each session with non governmental organisations and others. The delegation's activities are also covered in other reporting mechanisms; for example the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 2006 Annual Human Rights Report described some of the work done at the Council's first regular and two Special Sessions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1635W.6/1">European agreements governing the application of VAT reliefs mean that while the Government can retain the existing VAT zero rates, such as those which apply to approved works of alteration to certain listed buildings, we cannot extend these or introduce any new zero rate reliefs. It is therefore not possible to introduce a zero rate for alteration or repair works carried out to unlisted church buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1635W.6/2">Outside the VAT system, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport operate VAT refund arrangements to return in grant aid the equivalent of the VAT incurred in making repairs to listed places of worship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1635W.6/3">Restricting VAT refund arrangements to listed buildings ensures that benefits are targeted on those places of worship that are formally recognised as having special architectural or historic interest. The refund arrangements remove any VAT costs associated with the repair, rather than alteration, of these buildings, and also recognise that their repair and maintenance generally requires specialist craftsmen and costly materials, the cost of which often fall on small congregations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1635W.6/4">HM Revenue and Customs is not able to estimate the cost of extending the VAT relief or VAT refund scheme to unlisted places of worship in conservation areas. This is because there are no central statistics on the number of unlisted church buildings, and no data on those located within conservation areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1644W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-23">23 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1644W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question about employment and unemployment. (95344)</p>
	<p pid="b.1644W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of employment for local areas from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions. For unitary and local authorities, the ONS produces estimates of total unemployment from a statistical model. For all other estimates of unemployment for local areas, ONS compiles statistics from the annual local area LFS and the APS following ILO definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1644W.2/5" class="indent">Table 1 shows the number of people in employment, by full-time and part-time status, for people resident in the Stroud District Council area for the 12 months ending in February from 1996 to 2004 from the annual local area LFS and for the 12 month periods ending in March from 2005 to 2006 from the APS. Unemployment levels and rates are from a statistical model.</p>
	<p pid="b.1644W.2/6" class="indent">Table 2 shows corresponding data for the administrative county of Gloucestershire and Table 3 shows data for the United Kingdom from the annual local area LFS and the APS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1644W.2/7" class="indent">These estimates, as with any from sample surveys, are subject to a margin of uncertainty. Changes in the estimates from year to year should be treated with particular caution.</p>
	<p pid="b.1644W.2/8" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (ISA). Table 4 shows the number of claimants of JSA resident in the Stroud District Council area, the administrative county of Gloucestershire and the United Kingdom for each September from 1996 to 2006 and as a proportion of the resident working age population.</p>

Our measures to ensure small businesses are on an equal footing include the new Supply2.gov.uk web portal, which aims to bring buyers and sellers together; regional training events; a guide for small businesses on how to tender; and the local authority concordat aimed at ensuring purchasing policies are small business friendly. These and other measures, are expected to lead to greater opportunities for small firms and a more competitive environment, for the benefit of SMEs and the economy.</p>

In 1983 the Appeal Court ruled in the case of R. <i> v.</i> West Yorkshire Coroner ex parte Smith that this duty applied (in respect of the legislation then extant and which remains unchanged) even in cases where both the death and its cause occurred outside England and Wales and was not discretionary. Under section 14 of the 1988 Act the coroner who has the body may request another coroner to hold the inquest if it is expedient to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1656W.5/3">In 1983 the Home Office (then responsible for coroners' law) issued a circular to all coroners drawing their attention to the Smith judgment and advising that, in cases involving a single death from outside England and Wales, the coroner local to where the funeral is to be held should normally deal with the inquest. It is for the coroner for the district where the body first arrived from abroad to make the decision whether to ask the local coroner to take the case in accordance with section 14 of the 1988 Act. The circular also advised that, where more than one death occurred abroad in the same incident, the coroner for the district where the bodies first arrived should retain jurisdiction.</p>

Planning authorities are asked to have robust policies which address crime prevention issues in their development plans. Crime prevention is also capable of being a material consideration in relation to planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1664W.2/2">The Government have also published 'Safer Places: The Planning System and Crime Prevention' (ODPM/Home Office, 2004), which provides detailed advice on the layout of all buildings and spaces to reduce the risk of crime, including, where appropriate, the incorporation of target-hardening measures such as CCTV, in new development. The guidance also urges planners, designers and crime prevention practitioners and the police to work together to develop solutions from an early stage in the design process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1664W.2/3">The location of cash machines is a matter for banks and other providers, who should work closely with local authorities and, for example, the police, security industry and town centre management, to ensure that they are located in as safe an environment as possible.</p>

The partnerships have already identified potential sites, tested the feasibility of the project proposals, whether housing, commercial or open space, and assessed current delivery mechanisms to bring projects forward. A total of eight projects are now being taken forward by English Partnerships with local authority, community and other partners. The next stage of the work will involve determining how each site could best be brought forward for development that meets local need.</p>

	<p pid="b.1668W.2/1">Local planning authorities are required to conduct a housing needs assessment and to consider the requirement for new affordable housing as part of the local development plan. The Regional Assembly is expected to assess the need for affordable housing to inform the Regional Housing Board decisions and the Regional Spatial Strategy. The Department has not conducted separate specific estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.2/2">Planning policy on affordable housing is set out at a national level in PPG3. Planning authorities are required to have regard to these policies when preparing their development plans and these policies may be material to individual planning decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.2/3">Regional policies on affordable housing are set out in Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) for the north-west of England, formerly known as RPG13. Policy in existing RSS states that development plans should make provision for a range of dwelling types, and sizes to meet the assessed need of all sectors of the community in both rural and urban areas based on up-to-date local housing needs studies. Regional policies provide guidance for local authorities when making decisions on the level of affordable housing in their local development plans; however they do not stipulate numbers for affordable housing. It is up to individual authorities to decide on the level of affordable housing required in their area in their local development plans in accordance with RPG13 and draft PPS3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.2/4">The RSS is currently in the process of being reviewed. The North West Regional Assembly published the revised Draft RSS for a 12 week consultation on March 20 2006. The responses to the consultation will be examined by a panel set up by the Secretary of State. The panel will then carry out an Examination in Public to debate selected topics, based on issues raised in the consultation responses, before making their recommendations to the Secretary of State. As RSS is being revised local authorities continue to refer to the existing RSS for regional policy on affordable housing until the publication of the final RSS document&mdash;which is expected to be late 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1668W.5/1">The current Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) for Yorkshire and Humber sets a target of 4,000 affordable homes per year in Yorkshire and Humber as a whole but does not break this down to individual local authority areas. The new draft RSS proposes to increase the regional target to 6,000 affordable dwellings per year and proposes to provide a figure for each local planning authority expressed in terms of the percentage of affordable homes on sites of more than 15 homes. For East Riding of Yorkshire council, it is suggested that there is a &quot;high level of need&quot; and that 40 per cent. of homes should be affordable on sites of more than 15 homes. This approach is currently being tested at the Examination in Public. The panel will make recommendations to the Secretary of State and the final RSS will be agreednext year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/2">Local planning authorities have responsibility for setting a numerical target for affordable housing provision in their area, taking account of relevant housing market assessments and local and regional strategies. The target should also take account of the anticipated levels of finance available for affordable housing, including public subsidy from the Housing Corporation and the level of developer contribution that can realistically be sought through Section 106 agreements. East Riding of Yorkshire council has set a target of providing 200 extra affordable homes per year to meet the loss of affordable homes and maintain the status quo. A Housing Needs Study has just been completed and is currently being assessed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1670W.2/1">Discussions about this issue are ongoing with Foreign Office colleagues in the Inter-Ministerial Group on trafficking of which I am a member. We are working internationally to prevent trafficking by investing in projects in source and transit countries to build capacity and raise awareness of trafficking with potential victims. The Home Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department of International Development have all funded schemes aimed at raising awareness of the dangers of trafficking and building capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1670W.2/2">We have provided a total of &pound;200,000 to fund various anti-trafficking projects in the Western Balkans, a key transit region. We have also given &pound;70,000 to Anti-Slavery International for raising awareness of the abuses suffered by the victims of trafficking and remedial action in West Africa (including Benin, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Niger and Togo). Additionally we have given &pound;8.9 million for the International Labour Organisation's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) programme in the Greater Mekong region (parts of Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam). This involves a number of inter-linked interventions to raise awareness and prevent trafficking, and to withdraw women and children from labour exploitation and reintegrate them back into their own, or new, communities.</p>

Planning Policy Statement 22 (PPS22) sets out the locational considerations, including for landscape, that should be applied to proposals for renewable energy. PPS22 is supported by a Companion Guide that provides practical advice for considering proposals for renewable energy, including any potential impact on landscape.</p>

	<p pid="b.1685W.3/1">Online markets and auction sites can potentially be used to facilitate a range of crimes including the sale of proscribed goods (from child abuse images to guns and knives, and pharmaceutical products), the sale of stolen and counterfeit goods, theft and fraud. Partly because of the clandestine nature of some forms of crime and partly because of the pace of development of the online marketplace we do not have figures on the level of criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1685W.3/2">Many online marketplaces have developed good working relationships with UK police forces. There have been a number of successful joint operations into the sale of stolen or proscribed goods. For example, a recent successful operation in London involving the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit (NMPCU) and eBay to tackle the sale of blocked or barred phones led to 13 arrests. Following that operation, eBay banned people selling stolen, blocked and barred mobile phone handsets on its UK site and produced joint guidance with NMPCU warning the public about the risks of buying stolen handsets and providing advice about how to avoid them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1694W.5/2">There have been no such prosecutions under the Communications Act 2003 and I do not expect any in the foreseeable future. This does not mean that spammers are evading the law. The vast majority of spammers work outside UK jurisdiction and problems within the UK are addressed by the Information Commissioner using powers granted under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003. These Regulations set out the consent rules for receiving unsolicited commercial emails. The Information Commissioner's investigations into breaches of the Regulations have resulted in enforcement actions that have been effective and have not needed to be progressed to a prosecution. Our approach to the problem of spam does not rely on regulation and enforcement alone. We pursue a more comprehensive approach that involves consumer education, technical solutions and effective enforcement through national action and collaboration with other enforcement authorities. My Department has been one of the principal drivers of the OECD's London Action Plan that exemplifies this multi-faceted approach.</p>

This will work as long as customers understand what they are paying for and can change service provider if they wish to quickly, easily and cheaply.

In 2003 and 2004 we agreed short-term additional obligations with the industry, which have ensured a surplus in most subsequent months. We also held a public consultation, and are working with industry on a new system, based on product from refineries or entering the UK as imports, capable of meeting the national obligation in the long term.</p>

Subsection (4) requires the Business Review to be a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the company's business, consistent with the size and complexity of the company's business. It is for the directors to judge whether information on suppliers overseas is relevant in this context. In the case of quoted companies, the Government believe it right that information on contractual and other relationships essential to the business should be included in their directors' Business Review to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the company's business.

The reforms are designed to support primary care trusts (PCTs) in improving access to NHS dental services. The Government have increased investment in primary care dentistry by over &pound;400 million since 2003-04. PCTs now have greater flexibility to use resources to meet the needs of their local populations. For the first time, PCTs also retain resources locally when a dentist ceases to provide NHS services and use these resources to commission services from other dentists. The overall level of services being commissioned by PCTs is now higher than in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="b.1715W.2/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidelines on the treatment of depression and anxiety in December 2004. The guidance is available on the website <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk">www.nice.org.uk</a>. NICE gave emphatic support to making evidence-based psychological therapies available as an adjunct or alternative to drug treatments for the treatment of mild to moderate depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. The Department of Health has taken the following actions to help implement the NICE guidelines:</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/2" class="indent">included psychological therapies alongside drug treatments in the &quot;National Service Framework for Mental Health&quot; (1999) to show they are just as important as drug treatments, and sometimes preferred by service users;</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/3" class="indent">published an evidence-based guideline &quot;Treatment Choice in Psychological Therapies and Counselling&quot; in 2001 to help GPs and professionals know more about the most effective treatments for particular conditions;</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/4" class="indent">published the booklet &quot;Choosing Talking Treatments&quot; in 2001 for service users and carers to help them know the questions to ask when seeking psychological therapies or counselling;</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/5" class="indent">published the practical guidance &quot;Organising and Delivering Psychological Therapies&quot; in July 2004 to help local services understand what best practice should involve. It contains recommendations for how to deliver:</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/6" class="indent">acceptable, user-friendly services which involve users and carers, provide information and enhance engagement and choice;</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/7" class="indent">accessible services which manage waits, co-ordinate services and ensure times and locations are appropriate;</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/8" class="indent">equitable services which reduce inequalities and ensure access for black and minority ethnic and other under-served groups;</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/9" class="indent">cost-effective services which are targeted, evidence-based, effective and provided locally; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/10" class="indent">safe services in which staff are well-trained and supported, and which are connected to clinical governance systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/11">The Government are committed to improving mental health services and this is why we support increasing the availability of evidence-based psychological therapies through our programme &quot;Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies&quot; (IAPT), which began in May. We made improving the availability of psychological therapies a manifesto commitment in 2005, and it was a commitment we also made in the &quot;Our Health, our care, our say&quot; White Paper. The need to increase access to psychological therapies was also highlighted by Professor Louis Appleby, the national director for mental health, in his 2004 report on the progress made in implementing the national service framework for mental health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/12">IAPT will provide a more effective and timely access to psychological therapies for people with mild to moderate mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, and by increasing the choice of treatments available to mental health service users.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/13">IAPT consists of two national demonstration sites in Newham and Doncaster and a national programme of local projects in each of the National Institute for Mental Health in England's eight regional development centres. The sites will test the theory that improved access to talking therapies can help tackle suffering, promote the well-being of the general population and have a significant economic impact by returning to work more people with depression or anxiety or help them stay in employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.2/14">IAPT forms a key part of the Government's &quot;Health, Work and Well-Being&mdash;Caring for Our Future&quot; strategy. IAPT, together with initiatives from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Health and Safety Commission, will define the best way to achieve these improvements over the next five to ten years. We expect IAPT to provide robust evidence in favour of increasing psychological therapy capacity and this will help to clarify the numbers of staff, the skills set and the training requirements needed to do this.</p>

This shows no change in the overall prevalence in mental disorder among children since the 1999 survey.</p>

	<p pid="b.1719W.2/1">We expect all national health service employers to provide newly-employed doctors and other staff with induction training when they take up post. August has traditionally been a time when doctors in training change jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1719W.2/2">This was the case under Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) when we successfully launched the foundation programme in August 2005. In August 2007, we will begin the introduction of new specialty training programmes. We plan to help NHS trusts to manage the transition to the new programmes by phasing the take-up of places in new programmes over a period to coincide with existing trainees completing training and leaving current training programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1719W.2/3">MMC is a major initiative aimed to improve both patient care and doctors' training. For this reason it is subject to significant governance processes involving both the Department and the NHS. We are satisfied that MMC is proceeding satisfactorily and we do not consider it necessary to delay it. I understand that the Junior Doctors' Committee has voiced a number of concerns in the press, though they have not made a direct approach. Departmental officials have met with their representatives to discuss these concerns and are keen to engage further with all stakeholders to ensure smooth implementation of MMC.</p>

	<p pid="b.1720W.6/2">As part of its package of guidance, ROC made specific mention of the need to facilitate access to medical records wherever appropriate. ROC completed its work in March 2004. Thereafter, the Department funded a helpline provided by the National Bereavement Partnership, which ensures an ongoing source of information and help for families.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.6/3">More recently, the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) was set up under the Human Tissue Act 2004, which applies to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Separate legislation was introduced in Scotland under the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006. The 2004 Act followed the fundamental review of the law. The HTA has now issued its own guidance in its code of practice on the &quot;Removal, storage and disposal of human organs and tissue&quot;, which builds on and supersedes the previous guidance. The code sets out how NHS trusts should ensure full and sensitive communication around all aspects of requests for information, and to consider locally whether there is a need for any further publicity. In cases following a coronial post mortem, family members can request a copy of the report via the coroner's office.</p>

	<p pid="b.1721W.2/1">General practitioners and health visitors undertake a series of checks on health and development in children, known as the child health development programme, which is informed by professional guidelines, principally &quot;Health for all children&quot;. This includes guidance on detecting abnormalities in skull development, which may include positional plagiocephaly caused by allowing pressure to one part of a baby's skull over a period of time, typically during sleep and rest periods. This can cause a temporary flattening of a baby's head on the side the head rests upon which is commonly remedied by enabling babies to experience a range of positions during waking hours. The Department's guidance to parents on the first five years of their child's life &quot;Birth to five&quot;, and on reducing the risk of cot death, advocates babies being encouraged to experience a range of different positions and to play on their front when awake.</p>
