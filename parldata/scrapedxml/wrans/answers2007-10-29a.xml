	<p pid="a.604W.8/1">I have been asked to respond to this question, which appears to relate both to those cases referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) pre-charge, in which the decision of the Service was that no further action should be taken; and post charge, to those in which a decision was taken to drop proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.8/2">Under statutory charging, the CPS is responsible for deciding whether a person should be charged with a criminal offence in all indictable only, either way and specified summary offences (which represent approximately 40 per cent. of all cases). In the remaining 60 per cent. of cases either the police retain the decision to charge, or proceedings are commenced by way of a summons.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.8/3" class="italic"> Pre-charge</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.8/4">CPS records show that during the year ending March 2007, the CPS took a pre-charge decision in 524,111 cases. Of these, the CPS decided that no further action should be taken in the following number of cases:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.604W.8/7"> <td><i> Pre-charge decision</i></td> <td><i> Number</i></td> <td><i> Percentage of all pre-charge decisions</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.604W.8/8"> <td>No further action-evidential grounds</td> <td>169,821</td> <td>32.4</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.604W.8/9"> <td>No further action- public interest</td> <td>16,276</td> <td>3.1</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.604W.8/12" class="italic"> Post charge</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.8/13">Where a defendant has been charged with a criminal offence, the case is subject to continuing review by the prosecutor. This process can reveal where there is no longer sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, or where new information weighs against a prosecution in the public interest. In these circumstances, the CPS will decide to stop the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.8/14">During the year ending March 2007, the CPS stopped proceedings in respect of 107,651 defendants in the magistrates' court, representing 10.8 per cent of the 998,910 cases completed in the magistrates' court; and a further 12,102 defendants in the crown court, representing 13.1 per cent. of the 92,340 cases completed in the crown court.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.8/15">The aim of statutory charging is to determine the correct charge and build an evidentially strong case from the outset. One of the major benefits of statutory charging agreed with the Police Service is a reduction in the post charge discontinuance rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.610W.9/1">Every one of the 64 Specialist Domestic Violence Courts provides support to victims via an Independent Domestic Violence Advisor service (comprising at least on IDVA). As there is a wide range of work patterns across the 64 areas, we do not have precise employment numbers; we prefer to focus on ensuring delivery of a service that holistically supports individuals who are victims of domestic violence. By autumn of this year, there were 130 Government-funded graduates or students on the accredited training for Independent Domestic Violence Advisers, with a further 75 Government-funded places in the spring 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.610W.9/2">In 2006-07 the Home Office provided &pound;1.85 million funding to support Specialist Domestic Violence Courts including Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs). In 2007-08, the Ministry of Justice has secured &pound;3 million to contribute towards the Independent Domestic Violence Advisors services supporting the existing 64 Specialist Domestic Violence Courts and for services outside these areas, with a commitment to ongoing funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.610W.9/3">A review of the original Specialist Domestic Violence Courts, selected in 2005-06, (which will include the specific contribution of the Independent Domestic Violence Advisors) is being undertaken at the moment which will be disseminated in November. Part of this review will include a quantitative data analysis of all Specialist Domestic Violence Courts. The review will examine what success looks like for Specialist Domestic Violence Courts in terms of criminal justice and safety measures. Based on the findings of the review, local areas will be advised on how they can measure performance, but we do not plan to have any national performance indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.610W.9/4">In addition to Specialist Domestic Violence Courts, IDVAs are also integral to the success of the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences. These conferences are the cornerstone of our approach to the safety of victims of domestic violence through the agreement of safety plans for identified high risk victims. Early data from those areas which have been trained in Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference is promising with significant reductions in repeat victimisation, not least due to the work of Independent Domestic Violence Advisors who often carry out over 80 per cent. of the actions agreed at the conference.</p>

	<p pid="a.612W.2/1">Closing the pay gap between men and women is a key priority for us, as I made clear in my statement to Parliament on priorities for the Ministers for Women. We see tackling the pay gap as an essential part of enabling families to have real choices about how they live their lives because the pay gap plays such a large part in the unequal division of labour in the home, preventing fathers from playing a more active role in their children's early years and preventing women from fulfilling their opportunities to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.2/2">To galvanise this, closing the pay gap is now one of the indicators in the new equalities public service agreement. This will help to build on other practical measures we have introduced, such as: giving the parents of young, or disabled, children and the carers of adults the right to request flexible working; since 1997, doubling the number of registered childcare places to 1.28 million; and guaranteeing all three and four-year-olds a free, 12&amp;frac12; hours a week 38 weeks a year Government funded, early education place.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.2/1">Departments have delegated authority to determine pay arrangements for their own staff below the Senior Civil Service (SCS) that best meet their own business needs. Under the delegated arrangements, it is for individual departments and agencies to determine what levels of pay are appropriate to recruit, retain and motivate their own staff, taking into account local labour markets where relevant. Where staff are required to transfer between civil service organisations, it is for the departments and agencies involved to ensure that there is no overall detriment to individuals' terms and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.2/2">For the SCS, which is managed centrally, departments and agencies have flexibility to differentiate pay between London and National regions. There are no plans to introduce more regionalised pay structures for the SCS.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.5/1">Departments have delegated authority to determine pay and conditions arrangements for their own staff below the Senior Civil Service (SCS) that best meet their own business needs. Under the delegated arrangements, there are 89 civil service departments and agencies that negotiate pay and conditions for their own staff as part of the wider management of human resource functions in their organisations. Such negotiations take place within the parameters set by the Treasury in its annual pay remit guidance and pay policy for the wider public sector. There are no central records for 2001. Pay for the Senior Civil Service is not delegated to departments (recommendations to the Government are made by the Senior Salaries Review Body).</p>

	<p pid="a.633W.0/1">The National Audit Office measures spending performance against plans by comparing outturns against final provision following Supplementary Estimates&mdash;rather than against plans at the start of the year&mdash;as plans can change during the year for a number of reasons, such as machinery of government and classification changes. The definitive figures for final provision and provisional outturn are published each year in the Public Expenditure Outturns White Paper. Changes to plans arising in-year are published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses, as are differences between provisional and final outturns.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.0/2">In 2001-02 the Capital outturn for DCMS was &pound;48 million less than planned expenditure. The under spend was due in the most part to the slow start to the Capital Modernisation Fund project &quot;Spaces for Sport and Art&quot;. The unspent funds were drawn down in subsequent years and the project was successfully completed in 2004-05.</p>

Both reports confirmed therefore that the current regulatory regime is satisfactory. However, following concerns expressed by some people, we worked with the games industry on a package of measures designed to ensure that parents had sufficient knowledge about a game's contents so that they could make an informed decision when purchasing the game for their children. These measures included bigger classification symbols; advice explaining the type of content; strengthened guidance for retail staff; all games for adults to be classified by the British Board of Film Classification even if there is no statutory requirement to do so; and a website publicised by five million leaflets where parents can learn about the content of games and their classification.</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.7/2"><i> :</i> The correct information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.7/3">The Department for Communities and Local Government and the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister before it has since 2000 provided a system of performance incentivisation for local authorities in England across a range of service areas. This system operated via the Local Public Service Agreements (LPSA), which have since been merged with Local Area Agreements (LAA). These agreements offered a reward grant to local authorities who could deliver outcomes over and above the level of performance Government would otherwise expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.7/4">64 local authorities chose to include in their LPSA or LAA a measure performance on adoption and/or stability of placements for looked-after children, though the targets would not refer specifically to babies under the age of six months. Reward would be payable to local authorities and their partners for achievement of these particular targets, and in a number of cases this has now been claimed. Details on each target have been made available in the Library of the House, though we do not have data on the age of the children adopted in local authority areas.</p>

Member for Surrey Heath of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-26">26 March 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1321W, to date, public expenditure related to the Millennium Communities programme, excluding the Greenwich Peninsula site amounts to a total of &pound;86,561,250.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.5/2">This amount relates to a wide range of start-up expenditure that is necessary to regenerate difficult brownfield sites and create thriving new communities, such as providing essential infrastructure, sustainable urban drainage systems, community facilities and so on. The Millennium Communities programme as a whole is bringing forward seven new schools and colleges, five new health centres, 10 new public parks and play areas, and eight new community buildings. In addition, over 70,000 sq m of commercial and retail accommodation will be created. As an example, at the New Islington Millennium Community in Manchester the public investment is creating a new canal network, roads and infrastructure, a new primary school, a state of the art health centre, car club, child care facilities, an energy centre and 6,000 sq m of employment floorspace in addition to the 1,400 new homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.5/3">It is anticipated that some 75 per cent. of this public investment will be recouped in due course through receipts. The precise final figure will be known when the sites have been completed and developments sold. In addition, a significant amount of private sector investment has been levered in to these seven regeneration areas. This is currently some &pound;749 million, which represents a private:public ratio of 8:1.</p>

Since 2001 the number of non-decent homes on the date of transfer has totalled 246,781; numbers of non-decent homes transferring were not recorded prior to this date but we estimate between 1997 and 2001 there were around 155,000 non-decent homes that were transferred. Nearly 139,000 of transferred dwellings have been tackled since 2001 according to RSL data returns, representing a 56 per cent. reduction in the number of non-decent homes.</p>

These reports have been accepted by the European Commission, and CLG and the programme managers have been acting on the recommendations within these reports.

	<p pid="a.665W.3/1">In April 2006 four social landlords began piloting Social Homebuy on a voluntary basis. The pilot scheme, which will run until March 2008, allows participating local authorities and housing associations to offer tenants living in social rented accommodation the opportunity to purchase discounted shares of their home starting with an initial share of 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.3/2">The majority of the 88 sales to date have come from completions with the first phase of participating landlords, most of whom joined in late 2006. 85 were from housing association and three were from local authorities. Since April this year a second phase of landlords have joined the pilot scheme and are now offering Social Homebuy to their tenants. As with normal home purchases it can take several months to reach completion.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.3/3">In all there are now 77 housing associations and nine local authorities who are offering tenants the chance to purchase a share in their home.</p>

	<p pid="a.666W.0/1">The Government set up the Affordable Rural Housing Commission to look into ways to improve the affordability of rural housing. Since its report in May 2006 we have taken a series of measures to help address rural problems, including changes to planning rules and a commitment to set a rural target for affordable housing over the next three years in light of the advice from regional housing boards which is done later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.0/2">The Government set out measures in the Housing Green Paper which will help rural as well as urban areas. The detail of where new homes should be built is a matter for local planning authorities to determine.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.0/3">In addition, the Prime Minister has asked <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> to conduct a review on how land use and planning can better support rural business and deliver more affordable housing. The review should be completed around July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.0/4">The Housing Corporation is also exploring whether Community Land Trusts can add to the delivery of affordable housing: with Salford University it is supporting a number of pilot Community Land Trusts in rural areas in order to establish the pros and cons of a number of different models.</p>

	<p pid="a.666W.6/1">It is vital that non-statutory organisations such as voluntary and community sector groups and businesses are fully involved in partnership working to agree and deliver local area agreements. Indeed in most areas they are already involved in collaborative working through the Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) for the area. The 2006 LSP survey showed that over 80 per cent. of LSPs have voluntary sector umbrella organisations among their membership and nearly two thirds involve businesses. We want LSPs to develop this further because these sectors have a valuable contribution to make to discussions and can help to deliver in ways in which mainstream public sector providers can find difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.6/2">The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, requires that the upper-tier or 'responsible' local authority must consult such other persons as appear to it to be appropriate, during the preparation of both the Sustainable Community Strategy and Local Area Agreement. While this will allow local authorities to exercise their discretion in this matter, we would expect responsible local authorities to consult with appropriate representatives of the local voluntary, community and business sectors, We will make this obligation clear through the statutory guidance to accompany the legislation,</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.6/3">In addition, all local authorities now have a local compact in place which, if utilised, can help deliver real change for communities by recognising the third sector's independence, partnership working, diversity and right to campaign. Local authorities and their partners should consider how compact principles can be embedded in local area agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.6/4">To help ensure third sector organisations are effectively involved in the LAA process we have also worked with national third sector organisations to develop guiding principles of representation, based on their experience of what have proved successful. We will shortly be releasing these principles as a discussion paper.</p>

Accordingly, the roles MPs take on Local Strategic Partnerships are varied and can range from non-representation through to chairing the partnership.</p>

	<p pid="a.673W.2/2" class="indent">i) In October 2006 we made the Environment Agency a statutory consultee on all planning applications in flood risk areas, and applications on large sites outside them, which might add to flood risk elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.2/3" class="indent">ii) On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase> this year we introduced a planning Direction on flooding, so that where a local planning authority intends to approve a major application against which the Environment Agency has a sustained objection, we consider whether to call it in for decision by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.2/4">Taken with the clearer and stronger policy in Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25), we think this will ensure that flood risk is taken account of at all stages in the planning process whilst retaining the decision making role of the local authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.681W.2/1">Estimates of the type sought will vary substantially according to the assumptions made on matters such as the range of developments to which local policies arc applied, the expected number of developments to be completed, their energy demands, the extent to which the provision of installed equipment complies with the original planning permission and whether the technologies installed in practice provide the predicted savings. However the Government have set out a timetable for all new homes to be zero carbon by 2016. This will require significant increases in the use of renewables and we have assessed that overall implementation of this policy will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.2/2">Using their own assumptions, the London of borough of Merton have estimated the demand for renewable energy arising from Merton style policies and, more recently, a study for the Greater London Authority by the London South Bank University has considered the energy performance of applications referred to the Mayor. More generally, an overview of the estimated impact of our energy measures is provided in our White Paper, &quot;Meeting the Energy Challenge&quot; and supporting publications.</p>

	<p pid="a.682W.0/1">The London borough of Merton adopted their Unitary Development Plan in 2003 with a policy that expects new non residential developments above a threshold of l,000 sq m to incorporate renewable energy production equipment to provide at least 10 per cent. of predicted energy requirements. In doing so they were the first local authority in the UK to include a policy of this kind in a UDP. The council has been heavily involved in promoting the approach leading it to be coined the Merton Rule.</p>

	<p pid="a.684W.3/1">It is for the Planning Inspectorate, and not the Secretary of State, to fix the dates of the inquiry. Transport for London has recently indicated that, by early 2009, it should be in a position to provide the information requested by the Secretary of State in her letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July</phrase>. We therefore consider that the earliest anticipated date for the re-opening of the inquiry is in spring 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.695W.5/49">We have taken a number of steps to tackle fuel poverty. DEFRA leads on the Warm Front programme in England. The Warm Front scheme, and its equivalents in the Devolved Administrations, has resulted in improvements to the energy efficiency of the housing of those on a range of qualifying benefits. Winter fuel payments significantly help with fuel costs in coldest months.</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.5/50">Other measures that have had a positive impact include CLG's Decent Homes Standard; local authority programmes; and the systematic approach adopted in a number of warm zone areas. The Energy Efficiency Commitment for 2005-08 requires electricity and gas suppliers to meet targets for the promotion of improvements in domestic energy efficiency to a priority group of low income consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.5/51">We have taken further steps to increase efforts to tackle fuel poverty in the Energy White Paper and we are currently taking forward the implementation of these actions, which include improved Government communications during winter, further encouragement of suppliers to direct assistance at their vulnerable customers, improvements to Government schemes and better use of information held by Government. Next steps will be set out in the Fifth Annual Fuel Poverty Progress Report.</p>

BERR does not collect information on regional petrol prices. A range of factors determine retail petrol and diesel prices. Price differentials between rural and urban areas reflect different costs in distributing and supplying petrol and diesel. Price setting is a commercial matter for individual companies. The Office of Fair Trading continues to monitor the UK petrol market to ensure that anti-competitive behaviour does not occur. Customers should refer any complaints concerning pricing and anti-competitive behaviour to the Office of Fair Trading. In the past five years there has been one investigation, carried out by the Office of Fair Trading in 2006, and this did not result in any action against the companies concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.697W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.697W.5/2">Such mechanisms already exist. As part of its economic regulation of airport charges at Heathrow (under Part IV of the Airports Act 1986), the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) put in place in 2003 a regime of service quality targets for BAA with financial penalties if these targets were not met on a month-by-month basis. Similar targets and penalties are also in place at Gatwick airport. As part of the current review of price controls and other economic regulation of Heathrow and Gatwick, the Competition Commission has recently recommended strengthening and extending this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.697W.5/3">In addition, the CAA through its price controls encourages timely investment in facilities, many of which are designed to improve conditions for passengers. This has provided sufficient incentive for BAA to bring forward investment in Terminal 5, which is scheduled to open in March 2008 as planned, and which should significantly enhance passenger experience across the airport. Looking forward, the Competition Commission has recently recommended that future investment at Heathrow be further incentivised through greater financial penalties for later delivery of projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.697W.5/4">The CAA will be consulting on its regulatory proposals, in light of the Commission's recommendations, in November, with a view to setting new controls on Heathrow and Gatwick in early 2008 for the five years 2008-13.</p>

	<p pid="a.701W.11/1">Steps have been taken to raise migrant workers' awareness of their workplace rights and how to report instances of abuse. All accession country (A8 and A2) workers required to register under the Home Office's Worker Registration Scheme now receive a one page 'Know Your Rights' leaflet alongside their registration documents. The leaflet&mdash;available in six languages&mdash;includes telephone numbers and website addresses for the workplace enforcement bodies and other advice bodies. 'Know Before You Go' leaflets are also available to Lithuanian, Polish and Portuguese nationals before they leave for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.701W.11/2">It is now easier for migrant workers, whose main language is not English, to report instances of abuse to the workplace enforcement bodies. Translation services are available for those who wish to use the various enforcement helplines, and complaints can be submitted by e-mail. Reports about abuses of the National Minimum Wage regulations, for example, can be made to the helpline on 0845 6000 678 or via e mail using the complaint form at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/nmw/complaint.htm">www.hmrc.gov.uk/nmw/complaint.htm</a>. Where migrant workers work through an employment agency, and they have concerns about mistreatment, they can contact the Employment Agency Standards helpline on 0845 955 5105, or send an email to eas@berr.gsi. gov.uk.</p>
	<p pid="a.701W.11/3">This year's enhanced National Minimum Wage publicity work includes a campaign targeted at migrant workers, including publicity for the NMW helpline. Other enforcement bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive and the Gangmasters Licensing Authority also have publicity and awareness-raising work in train aimed at migrant workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.701W.11/4">The Department's Vulnerable Worker Enforcement Forum, set up to look at employment rights abuses, and identify ways of improving the enforcement framework is considering, as part of its work, whether more can be done to encourage vulnerable workers, including vulnerable migrant workers, to report problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.702W.2/1">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) has a programme budget settlement of some &pound;2.47 billion for 2007-08. The Authority believes that this settlement will give it and its contractors the certainty they need without impacting on the planned programme of nuclear clean up work. The settlement strikes a proper balance between what is desirable and what is affordable, and it ensures that safety remains the paramount concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.2/2">Over the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) 2007 period, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will oversee the NDA to ensure that the UK's civil nuclear liabilities continue to be managed safely, securely and cost effectively. The NDA will be informed of their settlement shortly.</p>

All power plants suffer unplanned outages from time to time, which is precisely why there is a safety margin of extra generation for electricity. Even if the nuclear plants taken out of action this week remain out of service through the winter, National Grid still expects there to be 19 per cent. more available electricity generation capacity than will be needed at times of highest demand.</p>

	<p pid="a.706W.8/1">As stated in the Government's response to the public consultation on the post office network, closures will principally affect a combination of branches in areas of over-provision and those that are least used. Post Office Ltd. will be tasked with taking a strategic overview of service provision to ensure that in areas of over-provision, people should be able to find an alternative branch nearby and the vast majority will still be within walking distance of their nearest office. With the least used, the number of people affected will, by the nature of the offices, be low. The introduction of new access criteria will minimise the impact by ensuring that the network remains readily accessible across the UK&mdash;with far greater coverage than any other retailer, financial service provider or public service provider.</p>

There are currently 182 marine protected areas in UK inshore waters (up to 12 nautical miles), which include 81 Special Protections Areas with marine habitats for birds, 98 Special Areas of Conservation with marine habitats or species, and three statutory marine nature reserves. We are carrying out surveys of marine areas to identify further sites that will meet the obligations under the directives.</p>

The MCZ mechanism will provide a flexible tool which allows for the designation of a full range of sites, from areas of limited protection to areas of very high protection. It will be possible to designate MCZs anywhere within marine waters over which the UK Government exercises jurisdiction, namely UK offshore waters and the territorial sea adjacent to England.</p>

	<p pid="a.717W.0/1">The Department is in regular contact with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and has provided, when required, the latest scientific information on the state of the key EU fish stocks, based on advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The FSA is currently gathering a range of material to support a sustainability assessment on its advice that consumers should eat more fish, and will seek further input from DEFRA as necessary. In the meantime, the FSA advice, which I support, remains that consumers should be encouraged to eat two portions of fish per week (including one of oily fish).</p>

It is not however possible to assess what proportion of these increases has been as a direct consequence of the FSA advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.719W.2/1">Officials from the four UK Administrations have explored a number of methods for dividing the UK European Fisheries Fund (EFF) budget. These include the use of metrics (such as value of fishing industry output), numbers employed in the fisheries sector, number of fishing businesses and dependence on fisheries. It was concluded that none of these offered an allocation that was considered reasonable by all four Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.2/2">For this reason, the Administrations agreed that a budget-split based on the split for the previous grant scheme, Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFO), offered the most reasonable compromise.</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.2/3">While provisional agreement has been reached for use of the FIFG split for the non-convergence budget, Administrations have failed to reach final agreement on the use of this method for the convergence budget. I am continuing to seek a resolution and, if necessary, will do so through the dispute resolution procedures set out in the devolution agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.8/1">Flycapture, the national database of fly-tipping incidents, was set up in 2004 by DEFRA, the Environment Agency and the Local Government Association, to record the number of fly-tipping incidents dealt with by the Environment Agency and local authorities. Flycapture does not record fly-tipping tonnages.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.8/2">However, WasteDataFlow, the online system for local authorities to report on their municipal waste, does include a category for fly-tipping tonnages. In 2005-06 (the only year for which complete data are available), authorities reported around 140,000 tonnes of residual waste arising from the clearance of fly-tipped materials. However, this figure is likely to be an underestimate where authorities collect fly-tipped tonnages as part of their street cleaning or other regular waste collection rounds, or are able to send this waste for recycling.</p>

	<p pid="a.722W.6/1">Gyrodactylus salaris (Gs) is a parasite that has the potential to cause widespread losses in both wild and farmed Atlantic salmon. The UK is free of Gs and we have robust legislative safeguards on trade in live fish to help ensure this remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.6/2">DEFRA has carried out publicity campaigns in recent years to raise awareness among the public and advice on how to keep Gs out of the country is contained in our &quot;Keep Fish Diseases Out&quot; series of guidance leaflets. We are planning a further campaign before the summer of 2008 and although details have yet to be finalised, a key theme will be the danger of introducing Gs through travel to and from high-risk areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.6/3">DEFRA also has comprehensive contingency plans for combating Gs and officials are in regular contact with their counterparts in other Departments and the devolved administrations on measures to update these plans and awareness campaigns.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.6/1">The Waste Strategy Board has been established to drive forward and monitor delivery of Waste Strategy 2007 targets across Government. The board will develop new policy actions to achieve Waste Strategy objectives as necessary and in light of progress made in specific areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.6/2">The Waste Strategy sets out measures that the Government have put in place to secure the investment in infrastructure needed to divert waste from landfill. This includes working with Communities and Local Government to take forward specific aspects of the strategy, including planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.6/3">It remains vital that regional spatial strategies and local development documents look forward and make adequate provision for the appropriate types and scales of infrastructure and waste treatment facilities needed, including biological treatment plants. It is also important for specific, suitable sites to be identified in plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.6/5">DEFRA's New Technologies Demonstrator Programme aims to demonstrate innovative waste treatment technologies as possible alternatives to landfill. The programme aims to prove the economic, social and environmental viability of each selected technology, half of which are biological treatment technologies. Each site will have a visitor centre, which will be open throughout the plant's participation in the programme. These will enable representatives from local authorities and the waste sector to learn more about the particular strengths and weaknesses of each technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.6/6">As mentioned in the Waste Strategy 2007, DEFRA is also considering ways to raise public awareness of the options and issues relating to waste management infrastructure, including biological treatment plants. The aim is to provide evidence-based information which will aid public comprehension of the options. Communications activity is tentatively planned for early 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.728W.4/1">DFID monitors the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan very closely. We receive regular updates from The United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan and other UN agencies such as the High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Office for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).</p>
	<p pid="a.728W.4/2">Since 2001 over 4.8 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan, but it still has the largest number of refugees in the world. Over one-quarter of the country's population is reported to have sought refuge outside the country. As of August 2007, more than 120,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were spread across the country but mainly in the south. More long term IDPs are occurring in the south, caused mainly by drought and insecurity. Recent displacement is caused by human rights violations, inter-communal tensions, floods or drought. According to government figures, conflict in the south this year has displaced 15,000-20,000 families. Afghanistan remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world and estimates suggest that mines and unexploded ordinance kill or injure an average of two Afghans every day; 50 per cent. of these victims are children.</p>
	<p pid="a.728W.4/3">According to recent reports from the United Nations, humanitarian access has become a growing challenge, with at least 78 districts rated as extremely risky and inaccessible to UN agencies. At the end of August this year, the total number of reported incidents show that 41 humanitarian workers had been killed, and 70 had been abducted, with one tenth of those abducted killed by their captors.</p>
	<p pid="a.728W.4/4">In 2006-07 DFID provided &pound;1.6 million in bilateral humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Afghanistan is also one of the largest recipients of UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) support, to which the UK is the largest contributor (23 per cent. of total CERF value in 2006). Afghanistan received $32.3 million from CERF in 2006. We also provide core funding to UNICEF, the World Food Programme, and UNHCR, all of whom have operations in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.729W.6/1">Detail from the European Commission on how the blue card scheme would work is not yet available. This makes it difficult to assess the potential impact of the scheme on technical and engineering capacity of developing African countries both in conflict and post-conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.729W.6/2">However, DFID is very conscious of the consequences for developing countries of 'brain drain' and is taking measures to address skills shortages in key sectors in Africa. For example, DFID is working to strengthen the capacity of health systems in countries such as Malawi to retain health workers, and in some countries we are supporting efforts to attract skilled professionals back to key sectors. Countries in conflict are prone to losing skilled staff through out-migration. Post-conflict reconstruction and development programmes can create new job opportunities for engineers and some technical specialists, although it takes time to rebuild an adequate pool of skilled people.</p>

	<p pid="a.730W.5/1">DFID's aid to Burma increased from &pound;2 million in 2002 to &pound;8 million this year. A further &pound;1 million was agreed this month in order to meet urgent humanitarian needs following the violent crack-down of recent protests. Earlier today my right hon.

	<p pid="a.730W.5/2">DFID's programme in Burma is focused on health, education, rural livelihoods and support for transition towards democratic change. To improve access to basic education we are currently providing &pound;3.3 million through UNICEF and &pound;2.7 million through Save the Children, each over three years. We are providing &pound;4 million over four years through the United Nations Development Programme to improve food security and enable people in rural areas to increase their family incomes, and we are funding community development programmes through non-governmental organisations. We are also providing &pound;1.8 million over three years to help meet the needs of Burmese refugees on the Thai border. Part of the additional &pound;1 million agreed for urgent humanitarian needs in October will be used to improve access to food by poor and vulnerable people in Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.731W.2/1">DFID is providing &pound;35 million in humanitarian aid for DRC in total for 2007. Most of this money (&pound;30 million) is provided to the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund which brings together several major donors and allows the Humanitarian Co-ordinator to allocate funds to UN agencies and NGOs. The Pooled Fund&mdash;now totalling some $100 million&mdash;allocates resources for priority humanitarian food, health, water and sanitation and protection activities. A recent emergency allocation of $5 million from the Pooled Fund was provided to UNICEF, WFP and others for additional food, health and shelter items for the displaced population. The UK is the largest humanitarian donor in DRC and the largest contributor to the Pooled Fund. The Humanitarian Co-ordinator has also called upon the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to provide an additional emergency allocation of $5 million for the current crisis in the east. DFID is one of the main contributors to the CERF.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.2/2">DFID also provides direct support (&pound;5 million in 2007) to other humanitarian organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, Merlin, the International Rescue Committee, the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development and Medicins Sans Frontieres, all of whom are currently working in North Kivu. In addition, we have lobbied for all agencies to focus all available resources on those areas most in need in DRC at this time.</p>

The UK is one of the largest contributors to the GEF, and DFID provides the largest share of the OTEP across HMG. Our research programmes, notably the Ecosystem Services and Poverty Reduction (&pound;30 million over five years) and our contribution to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research institutions (&pound;10 million/year) will also deliver important collateral benefits to conservation. Our contribution to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (&pound;6 million/four years), our work on advising the UN Convention on Biological Diversity on forest and fisheries governance, and the incorporation of environmental issues into national development programmes, will also benefit conservation.</p>

	<p pid="a.737W.5/1">The humanitarian situation in Darfur is deteriorating. The seasonal 'hunger gap' has been more acute this year with higher than expected rates of malnutrition, particularly in the camps. Furthermore, ongoing clashes have meant that the number of people displaced continues to rise: a further 260,000 people this year alone, adding to the more than two million people already living in camps across the region. The camps are overstretched and becoming increasingly volatile. Recent violence in Kalma camp, South Darfur, has re-displaced up to 30,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.5/2">The increase in needs has been compounded by an escalation of attacks by armed groups against humanitarian agencies. Since the start of the year, over 100 humanitarian vehicles have been hijacked, often violently, and five humanitarian aid workers have been killed. This is having a serious impact on the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver vital aid to those in need.</p>

	<p pid="a.738W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.3/2">Multiple sclerosis is a disorder whose cause is currently unknown. There is no published peer-reviewed scientific or medical evidence to suggest any link with particular occupations including between any factor of service in the armed forces and development of multiple sclerosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.3/3">Information is not held centrally as to the total number of serving and retired service personnel suffering from multiple sclerosis and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.3/4">Records do however show that there are 380 former service personnel currently in receipt of a war disablement pension under the War Pension Scheme (WPS), with an accepted claim for multiple sclerosis. The records do not identify when these pensioners were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or whether it was the reason for their discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.3/5">The WPS provides no-fault compensation for all former service personnel disabled as a result of their service in the armed forces before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. Awards are made under the WPS where, on the individual case facts and under the legislation, a casual link to service can be accepted. The WPS onus and standard of proof mean that casual links may be lawfully recognised which do not reflect contemporary medical evidence. Where a disablement has clinical onset during service and leads to medical discharge, claims are automatically considered. In that situation or where a claim is made within seven years of service termination, entitlement will be certified unless it can be shown by evidence beyond reasonable doubt that service has played no part in the cause or course of the disorder. In these circumstances claims for multiple sclerosis may succeed on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.3/6">Any service personnel who develop multiple sclerosis in service and are medically discharged may be entitled to ill-health benefits under the terms of their occupational pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.3/7">Information is not held centrally which can identify former service personnel released on non-medical grounds, who have subsequently been awarded war pensions for suffering the symptoms of multiple sclerosis while in service. To obtain the information would involve the examination of individual files which could be done only at disproportionate cost&mdash;there are currently around 178,000 people in receipt of a war disablement pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.3/8">No service personnel have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and awarded attributable benefits under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. Less than five service personnel have been discharged without benefits. The scheme provides no-fault compensation for all serving and former service personnel for injury/illness caused on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. It awards benefits where the evidence shows, on the balance of probabilities, that service is the predominant cause of the injury or disorder.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.2/5" class="indent">The Agency begins to process new applications as soon as they are received and continues until they have been cleared. It should be noted that that an outstanding or uncleared application is not necessarily the same as an unprocessed one. The amount of work required to clear a case and the time involved varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they co-operate with the Agency. Uncleared applications will be at varying stages in the application processes, with very few being completely unprocessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/6" class="indent">As at the end of September 2007, the Agency had 160 uncleared new scheme cases over 5 years old in the East of England of which 20 were in Suffolk. New scheme uncleared cases over 5 years old are those which were previously under the old scheme, and have been converted to the new scheme via a new scheme calculation. When a new child support application is made, it may be established that the case has one or more links, through the parent with care or non-resident parent or their partners, to existing cases. If a link is established to one or more cases on the old computer system (CSCS), these cases will be transferred to the new computer system (CS2), along with any further cases that are linked to this chain. This is known as reactive migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/7" class="indent">As at the end of September 2007, the Agency had, 1,750 transitional cases uncleared over 5 years old in the East of England of which 130 were in Suffolk. Transitional cases are those subject to the rules of the old Child Support Scheme but which are held on the new scheme computer system, CS2.</p>

	<p pid="a.746W.2/2">The three page claim form that has been introduced means less bureaucracy and better service for pension credit customers. One phone call can give customers access to four benefits&mdash;pension credit, state retirement pension, council tax benefit (CTB) and housing benefit (HB). This form is completed for the customer. All they need to do is check it, sign it and send it back.</p>
	<p pid="a.746W.2/3">We are taking other measures to promote the take up of CTB. There are annual awareness campaigns. We have provided local authorities with best practice guidance that contains information about barriers to claiming, ways of overcoming them, and case study examples of good practice to improve take-up. We have supported the three page form arrangements with computer scans run by The Pension Service to discover people getting pension credit but not CTB and this information is passed to local authorities. We encourage local authorities to do take-up activity through our performance standards and have awarded &pound;2.2 million to 38 authorities to increase CTB take-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.746W.2/4">In the longer term, we want to deliver CTB as accessibly, simply and securely as possible. We want to research the feasibility of using data held &quot;across Government&quot; to build profiles of people likely to be entitled. We also want to develop the concept of a &quot;single point of contact&quot; for pensioners, coupled with alignment of application processes that will provide greater efficiency and a better public service.</p>
	<p pid="a.746W.2/5">Our assessment shows that enabling people to access CTB and HB via the Pension Service has resulted so far in over 65,000 more people being paid those benefits.</p>

This represents 3.36 per cent. of the Department's total budget. In line with Treasury guidance the total budget figure used in this calculation comprises both the Department's departmental expenditure limit and annually managed expenditure.

During the 2003-04 financial year DWP reviewed its accounting policy in respect of capitalisation of expenditure on improvements to leasehold properties.

	<p pid="a.756W.2/1">The 'core' pension as defined by the financial assistance scheme standardises some pension features for ease of administration and to protect the public purse. For example, payments start from 65 rather than scheme pension age and no indexation is provided. The cash and NPV costs of paying 90 per cent. of core pension are in the following table and sum to approximately &pound;10 billion in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.756W.2/2">We do not have the data to estimate accurately an 'expected' pension. Schemes that qualify for the financial assistance scheme have very different scheme rules, for example, on indexation and revaluation (particularly for pre-1997 pension accruals), and it is not possible to make precise estimates of these differences.</p>
	<p pid="a.756W.2/3">In the Government response to the report by the parliamentary ombudsman on occupational pensions (Trusting in the Pensions Promise, June 2006), we estimated the total cost of meeting expected pensions at between &pound;13 billion and &pound;17 billion in cash terms to reflect this uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.759W.3/7" class="indent">At the end of September 2007, the Child Support Agency had 67,900 cases assessed under old rules where the non-resident parent lived in Scotland and in 1,400 of these cases, the non-resident parent lived in the Angus constituency. These figures cover all cases, including those with a positive assessment as well as those currently with a nil maintenance liability. The available information relates to cases only, a non-resident parent may have more than one case.</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.3/8" class="indent">The number of cases transferred from the old to the new system of assessment is provided in the attached table. When a new child support application is made, the case may have one or more links, through the parent with care or non-resident parent or their partners, to existing cases. If a link is established to one or more cases on the old computer system, then these cases will be transferred to the new computer system, along with any further cases that are linked to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.3/9" class="indent">It is expected the number of old scheme cases will reduce from around 740,000 to around 300,000 before cases move into the new statutory maintenance service expected to start in 2010-11. The reason for this is predominantly the age and nature of these cases. It is also expected that a number of clients will wish to leave the statutory maintenance service and make their own arrangements following the removal of compulsion. Separate estimates have not been made for Scotland or the Angus constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.0/1">The latest information available indicates that at the end of the financial year 2003-04 there were almost 4.5 million women and around 150,000 men between state pension age and age 80 who had accrued 30 or fewer qualifying years for basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.0/2">However, individuals with 30 or fewer qualifying years can still qualify for a full basic State Pension under the current arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.0/3">Entitlement to a basic state pension depends on a number of factors including the number of qualifying years accrued, home responsibilities protection and the spouse's contribution record.</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.17/2"><i> </i>The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is intended to pay compensation based on those benefits generally provided on the winding up of a pension scheme, and so does not incorporate additional benefits beyond basic retirement and survivor's benefits. The Government took a policy decision to focus the PPF compensation on these basic benefits to avoid an excessive burden on the Pension Protection Levy, which is paid by other pension schemes. For that reason, the costs of providing additional benefits such as ill-health early retirement were excluded from consideration at an early stage and were not costed during policy development for the Pensions Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.17/3">The Department has, however, estimated indicative costs for the PPF introducing early compensation on ill health grounds; these estimates are highly sensitive to the underlying assumptions. If, for example, 5 per cent. of PPF deferred members qualified for ill-health compensation without actuarial reduction, they lived on average until the same age as those retiring in normal health and the average age at which they qualified was 50, the reserves of the PPF in respect of deferred members would have to rise by approximately 2 per cent. The PPF estimate that such an increase would require an increase in the Pension Protection Levy from &pound;675 million by 10 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.767W.5/2" class="indent">0845 numbers are charged at local call rates and the current guidance by the Committee of Advertising Practice Code applies to the cost of these calls. Current guidance is that calls provided by BT will be charged at up to four pence per minute at all times. A call set up fee of three pence per call applies to calls from residential lines. Mobile and other providers' charges may vary.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/3" class="indent">0800 99 1234 Pension Credit Application Line is a free phone number and there is no charge for calls to this number from a BT Landline. Mobile and other providers' charges may vary.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/4" class="indent">0191 218 7777 (International Pension Centre&mdash;for Overseas Customers). Calls to this number are charged at the standard rate for the territory from which the customer is calling.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/5" class="indent">0113 numbers in existence relate to:</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/6" class="indent">MP Helpline</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/7" class="indent">Comments on Customer Charter</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/8" class="indent">Calls made to each of these numbers from within the 0113 area are charged at Local Call Rates; calls made to each of these numbers from outside the area are charged at National Call Rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/9">The Pension Service always offers to call customers back if the customer expresses any concerns about the costs being incurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/10">All Public Service providers are currently assessing the impact of migrating call numbers to the new '03' range. The Pension Service will also review the existing range of telephone numbers and consider simplifying access to our services for our customers. As part of that review, cost implications and the merits of free-phone numbers over local call rates will be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.768W.11/35">We have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty. Based on income measured after housing costs the number of pensioners in Great Britain living in relative poverty has fallen by more than one million between 1996-97 and 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.11/36">We will continue to build on this good progress. A new Public Service Agreement 'Tackle poverty and promote greater independence in later life', published as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2007 clearly demonstrates that tackling the problems of low income amongst older people remains a key government priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.770W.8/1">The requested information is unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.8/2">The standard measure for state pension claims is to clear 95 per cent. of claims in 60 days. The Pension Service computer system therefore measures against this target.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.8/3">60 days takes into consideration the fact that customers need to supply a considerable amount of evidence (including marriage and birth certificates) after the initial date of claim. It also takes into account the fact that customers can make an application to state pension up to four months prior to retirement.</p>

This assumes that on average eligible male and female members of a FAS qualifying scheme attaining age 65 in 2010 will live for a further 22.6 years and 24.9 years respectively, rising by 2025 to a further 24.2 and 26.4 years respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.772W.2/19">The youngest scheme members will not be eligible for financial assistance for a number of decades. A member who was 20 years of age when their scheme started to wind-up in 2005 would not qualify for payment of assistance until 2050. Therefore it could take at least 40 years before full assistance starts being paid to all members eligible for FAS.</p>

	<p pid="a.774W.5/4">The Secretary of State has now requested a final report from the Remploy board on the modernisation of the company, no later than <phrase class="date" code="">12 November 2007</phrase>. We recognise that despite substantial progress, significant issues remain unresolved. Nonetheless, these remaining differences can and should be bridged. We continue to believe that a negotiated settlement represents the best outcome for Remploy.</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.5/5">A decision on the future of Remploy will be made by the Secretary of State once a final report from the board is received. Until then, no Government decision will be made concerning Remploy's factories.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.2/1">At July 2007, &pound;264.3 million was outstanding in social fund loans to beneficiaries no longer in receipt of benefits from which deductions can be made. This figure is, generally speaking, obviously inversely proportional to success rates in moving customers off benefits and into work</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.2/2">To ensure that the recovery of theses monies continues once benefit deduction are no longer possible, these cases are in the process of being transferred to the Department's Shared Services Debt Management organisation. This transfer will be completed by the end of March 2008. This will ensure that Debt Management's specialist skills and technology can be used to the best effect to recover these loans.</p>

The total net increase is 524,000 rounded to the nearest thousand.

	<p pid="a.783W.2/2"><i> </i>The figure of 0.8 million was a calculation of the number of foreign nationals estimated to have arrived in the United Kingdom since 1997 and be in employment (1.4 million) less the number of foreign nationals in employment in 1997 who are no longer in employment (or no longer foreign nationals) (0.6 million). Using a revised methodology we now estimate the net difference to be 1.1 million rather than 0.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.783W.2/3">In addition, there are an estimated 0.05 million foreign nationals in employment in 2007 who were in the United Kingdom in 1997 but not in employment. Adding this figure to the 1.1 million gives a total net increase of foreign nationals in employment of 1.1 million rounded to the nearest 100,000, as set out in the answer to PQ/07/158012.</p>
	<p pid="a.783W.2/4">A note placed in the Library provides an explanation of both the methodology and the sources used, as well as a broader context for changes in employment since 1997.</p>
