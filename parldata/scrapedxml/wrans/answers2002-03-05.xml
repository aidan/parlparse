	<p pid=".147W.3/1">None. So far as I am aware, no approach has been made to the Church of England's national organisations on this topic, and I do not know whether it has arisen in any parishes.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.3/2">Anyone who was resident in a parish or who died there, whatever his or her faith, is legally entitled to burial in a Church of England parish churchyard, provided it has not been formally closed for burials and space is still available there. It would not be possible to use a non-Christian religious rite in the churchyard, but the Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880 lays down a procedure under which the burial can take place without any religious service, subject to the conditions set out in the Act, for example as to the day and time of the burial. The design of grave markers would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Church's consistory courts.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.3/3">I understand that issues of timing may also arise in the case of interments in local authority-maintained burial grounds, although that is not a matter for the Church authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".152W.8/1">As with any large project, the process of constructing a nuclear power station will lead to carbon dioxide emissions but these will be negligible in relation to the lifetime generation capacity of the plant. Generation of nuclear electricity does not produce any significant carbon dioxide emissions. It is estimated that in 2001 in the absence of nuclear generation, emissions of carbon dioxide would have been between 11 and 22 MtC higher, depending on the mix of generation used to replace it.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.8/2">The climate change levy (CCL) falls on supplies of electricity to business users rather than on electricity generators. The amount attributable to nuclear generation will depend on the extent to which consumers of nuclear electricity are domestic consumers or are businesses which are eligible for reductions in the rate of levy. For each terawatt hour of electricity supplied to business customers the CCL at the full rate would amount to &pound;4.3 million.</p>

This was set up in 1998 under the chairmanship of the Director of Fleet Operations at the Ford Motor Company to develop, and oversee the implementation of, initiatives to meet the Government's target to reduce vehicle crime by 30 per cent. over five years. Members of the action team include the chief executives of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Retail Motor Industry Federation. It meets three times a year, with additional meetings of its executive committee, and has in our view been an outstanding success.</p>

	<p pid=".161W.2/1">The special voucher scheme was introduced in 1968 in recognition of the specific hardship being suffered at that time by British Overseas Citizen (BOC) passport holders and their dependants, who were under political pressure to leave their countries of residence in East Africa, but who held no other citizenship and had nowhere else to go. Several thousand BOCs and other United Kingdom passport holders took advantage of the scheme and settled in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.2/2">However, the world political situation has now changed and BOCs are no longer under threat of expulsion. They have, over the intervening years, either settled with their families in the new independent East African countries or, alternatively, some have moved with their families to India. Their families have now grown up and have families of their own.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.2/3">There are relatively few applications for special vouchers these days and those who do apply are not being pressured to leave the country in which they reside. The scheme no longer serves the purpose for which it was set up. The Government have therefore decided that the time has come to abolish the scheme, with immediate effect. No new applications for special vouchers will be considered.</p>

	<p pid=".169W.11/1">Section 225 of the GLA Act 1999 provides powers for the Secretary of State to appoint a PPP Arbiter. It also requires the Secretary of State to make such an appointment if requested in writing by a party to a PPP Agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.11/2">London Underground is currently consulting the Mayor and Transport for London. Following this consultation, the Board of London Transport is expected to take a final decision on whether to proceed with the PPP contracts. If the LT Board confirms its decision of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February</phrase> that it is minded to sign contracts, and subject to the Secretary of State's statutory decisions in relation to the PPP agreements, it is the intention of the Secretary of State:</p>
	<p pid=".169W.11/3" class="indent">(a) to appoint a PPP Arbiter as soon as possible after completion of the PPP contracts, on a permanent basis;</p>
	<p pid=".169W.11/4" class="indent">(b) to ensure that the PPP Arbiter is supported by appropriate staff with technical, legal and financial expertise and understanding of the contracts;</p>
	<p pid=".169W.11/5" class="indent">(c) to consult London Underground, Metronet, Tubelines and Transport for London before making an appointment.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.11/6">Given the requirements for making public sector appointments, this will necessarily take some time. However, the Secretary of State recognises the need to prepare the Arbiter's office and ensure continuity with the negotiation of the PPP contracts. The Secretary of State therefore intends to take steps to put in place interim staff before a permanent appointment can be made.</p>

	<p pid=".173W.8/1">As announced to the House on 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-13">13 February</phrase>, we have given approval to 31 local authorities to run electoral modernisation of the pilot authorities to run electoral modernisation pilot schemes in the May 2002 local and mayoral elections. In addition to using traditional voting methods and all-postal voting, over half of the pilot authorities will explore innovative ways in which people can vote electronically. This programme will test new and easier arrangements while at the same time maintaining the integrity and security of the ballot. It will mark an important step towards making the electoral system easier to use and more relevant to today's society.</p>

	<p pid=".181W.9/1">Supporting People will consolidate the following Funding Streams:</p>
	<p pid=".181W.9/2">SHMG (Supported Housing Management Grant from the Housing Corporation). This is a revenue grant which is paid to RSLs (registered social landlords) to fund the cost of support services. Only RSLs can receive this grant as the Housing Corporation only funds RSLs. It is a block grant, which is paid quarterly in advance.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.9/3">THBS (Transitional Housing Benefit System) this is an individual welfare benefit. It is paid as part of an individuals Housing Benefit entitlement to cover the cost of housing support. It was introduced in April 2000 as a means of identifying the amount of Housing Benefit paid for support, prior to transfer to the Supporting People pot. Providers must separate out the cost of support services that was previously just charged as part of the rent. From April 2003 support costs will be ineligible for housing benefit and transitional housing benefit will be transferred to the Supporting People pot.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.9/4">PAGS (Probation Accommodation Grants) this is a grant paid by the probation service for housing service for offenders. Each local probation service has a number of contracts with providers. The contract value will transfer to the pot. Until recently, part of the PAGs funding came from local authorities, this is no longer the case.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.9/5">HIA (Home Improvement Agencies) funding this is paid by the DTLR to local authorities to fund the cost of home improvement agency services. It has to be match funded by the authority. Continuing the local authority match funding for the life of the existing funding period will be a condition of the Supporting People grant paid to the authority by DTLR.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.9/6">Income support&mdash;this welfare benefit is paid to owner occupiers. It is used to fund housing support services in the leasehold sheltered sector. This will not be a big element of the pot but we are not sure yet of the precise size. We are working with DWP and the Benefits Agency on how to identify the recipients and costs.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.9/7">Funding from sources other than those listed above will not transfer to the Supporting People pot. We expect that there will continue to be a range of funding sources for housing related support. Authorities will be expected to establish all funding paid for services to ensure that they understand the full picture.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.2/1">The Secretary of State's general approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. Parliament has entrusted them with responsibility for day-to-day planning control in their areas. Local planning authorities are normally best placed to make decisions relating to their areas and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly, with the minimum of interference.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.2/2">There will be occasions, however, when the Secretary of State may consider it necessary to call in a planning application to determine himself instead of leaving it to the local planning authority. His policy is to be very selective about calling in planning applications. He will, in general, only take this step if planning issues of more than local importance are involved and if those issues need to be decided by the Secretary of State rather than at a local level. Each case is, however, considered on its own facts.</p>

	<p pid=".192W.4/1">Concerted action has been taken in the Department to reduce the number of outstanding parliamentary questions. The Department is now receiving questions at the rate of around 45 a day, almost double the rate of the last session. Last week the Department responded to over 500 questions. There are currently 411 outstanding questions due for reply before <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-14">14 February 2002</phrase>. I aim to have provided right hon. and hon. Members with answers to those outstanding questions by <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-12">12 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.4/2">Several Members have raised concerns about unanswered questions and the length of time it has taken for questions to be answered. Last week in the course of dealing with these inquiries evidence came to light of what appears to be systematic falsification in recording the handling of parliamentary questions in the Department's parliamentary section. This included recording questions as having been answered when no such reply had been given to the Member or to the <i>Official Report</i>. Some of these questions date back to the beginning of this session.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.4/3">The falsification that took place meant that both officials and Ministers were wrongly led to believe that Members had received replies to their questions when they had not. A full investigation is now under way to ensure that all the facts are known and that the necessary remedial action is taken. An official from the Department's parliamentary section has been suspended and is now the subject of a disciplinary investigation. The decision to suspend the official was taken by the line manager of the individual concerned in accordance with standard departmental disciplinary procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.4/4">Ministers and officials within the Department are fully committed to supporting the system of accountability to Parliament which underpins our democracy. We aim to provide timely and accurate responses to parliamentary questions. There has been a serious failure in honouring that commitment which I deeply regret. All possible steps will now be taken to deal with the backlog of outstanding parliamentary questions. As soon as I am able I will also report to Parliament on the outcome of the investigation that is now under way.</p>

The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations are therefore being tightened to ensure workers know where asbestos is in premises and can take appropriate precautions.

This includes a relatively small number of Government buildings open to the public, and also includes the estimated costs of complying with the provisions in the regulations arising from the Chemical Agents Directive. This cost is equivalent to &pound;2.9 billion once costs are discounted to present values following Government costing conventions. The average yearly cost over the first six years the proposals would be in force is &pound;460 million.</p>

	<p pid=".194W.5/3">White asbestos is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, on behalf of the World Health Organisation, as a category 1 carcinogen hazardous by inhalation. The most recent and comprehensive study carried out on the relative risks of asbestos &quot;The Quantitative Risks of Mesothelioma and Lung Cancer in Relation to Asbestos Exposure&quot; suggests there is a real risk of cancer from white asbestos (1 in 5,000) at levels of exposure realistically experienced by maintenance workers. The quantification of risk at these levels of exposure is however highly uncertain. The same paper implies the arguable range of risk runs from a quarter to seven times the central estimate.</p>

Once the proceedings have been completed, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland will give further consideration to whether any prosecution should follow. Following the decision of the ECHR in the case of Jordan <i>v</i>. UK the Director has reviewed his policy on the giving of reasons. I would refer my hon. Friend to a written reply the Attorney-General gave on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-01">1 March 2002</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, <i>House of Lords</i>, column WA 259 which I reproduce here:</p>
	<p pid=".195W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The Government are considering a package of measures which, taken together, should meet the concerns expressed by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgments in a series of cases from Northern Ireland, including that of <i>Jordan v The United Kingdom.</i></p>
	<p pid=".195W.2/5" class="indent">In furtherance of that objective, I have had a number of discussions with the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland (the Director) regarding the giving of reasons when a decision is reached not to initiate or continue a prosecution. We have agreed that the following statement should issue.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The policy of the Director in the matter of providing reasons for decisions not to initiate or continue prosecutions, is to refrain from giving reasons other than in the most general terms. The Director recognises that the propriety of applying the general practice must be examined and reviewed in every case where a request for the provision of detailed reasons is made. This policy is based on a series of public interest considerations. It also reflects the duties owed by the Director to a range of parties as a public authority under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The lawfulness of the policy was upheld by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in <i>Re Adams Application for Judicial Review</i> (2001) NI 1.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.2/7" class="indent">The Director, in consultation with the Attorney General, has reviewed his policy in the light of the judgments delivered by the European Court of Human Rights on the <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-04">4 May 2001</phrase> in a number of Northern Ireland cases, including the case of <i>Jordan v The United Kingdom</i>. Having done so, the Director recognises that there may be cases in the future, which he would expect to be exceptional in nature, where an expectation will arise that a reasonable explanation will be given for not prosecuting where death is, or may have been, occasioned by the conduct of agents of the State. Subject to compelling grounds for not giving reasons, including his duties under the Human Rights Act 1998, the Director accepts that in such cases it will be in the public interest to reassure a concerned public, including the families of victims, that the rule of law has been respected by the provision of a reasonable explanation. The Director will reach his decision as to the provision of reasons, and their extent, having weighed the applicability of public interest considerations material to the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".196W.5/1">The Lord Chancellor today issued a consultation paper seeking views on the detail of the legislation the Government intend to introduce to outlaw payments to witnesses. The legislation proposed is that it should be a criminal offence to make, or agree to make, or to receive, a payment to a witness or potential witness in criminal proceedings for his or her story with a view to publication.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/2">Also, following the abandonment of the first trial of R <i>v.</i> Woodgate and others the Government intend to amend s.19 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to empower the court to order a third party to pay costs incurred as a result of his or her unnecessary or improper act.

	<p pid=".199W.0/2">The independent steering group overseeing the voluntary package of measures to minimise the environmental impact of pesticides is made up of signatories to the package, an equivalent number of environmental organisations and an independent chairperson. The steering group reports to DEFRA. Publication of its reports is a matter for DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.0/3">Reports from the independent steering group will help the Government's assessment of the success of the package. The assessment of whether the package is delivering environmental benefits over and beyond those that would result from a pesticides tax will consider the uptake of the measures in the package, their coverage, effectiveness and cost. It will therefore take account of the impact of the measures on pollution that has to be cleaned up by water companies.</p>

	<p pid=".212W.11/2">During last year's outbreak, diagnosis of foot and mouth disease (FMD) was normally confirmed by the National Disease Control Centre on the basis of clinical observations of a veterinary inspector on the spot. Some cases were confirmed on the basis of laboratory tests which confirmed the presence of FMD antibodies or virus. It is nearly five months since the last outbreak of foot and mouth and confirmation of any future case would need to be based on laboratory tests that confirm the presence of the virus.</p>

	<p pid=".213W.2/2">I am satisfied that we have effective arrangements for monitoring the presence of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the national flock and herd. These are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/3" class="indent">(i) Any person who suspects that an animal in his possession or care may be affected by FMD is legally obliged to notify my Department.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) Ante and post mortem inspections are conducted on livestock at slaughterhouses by official veterinary surgeons working on behalf of the Meat Hygiene Service.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) Our extensive programme of serological testing of sheep flocks was an important part of the process of satisfying the Office International des Epizooties and the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU the Great Britain is free of FMD. Nearly three million blood samples, from over 32,183 farms, have been tested. This includes samples taken from sentinel animals prior to the re-stocking of premises on which livestock have been slaughtered during the outbreak and from animals prior to movement under licence.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/6" class="indent">(iv) Official veterinary surgeons and local authority inspectors are present at markets and carry out farm visits as part of their routine duties.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/7" class="indent">(v) As part of the controlled restocking process, animals are examined regularly during a four week period of 'sentinel' restocking. In addition, sheep and goats on restocking premises are subject to blood testing after 28 days before restrictions are removed.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/8">Although it is now over five months since the last outbreak, the FMD investigation at a farm near Hawnby, North Yorkshire last week, underlines the importance of maintaining our guard, and shows that the system of monitoring for FMD during controlled restocking is vitally important. Farmers and vets should remain vigilant and all those who have contact with livestock must maintain the highest standards of bio-security.</p>

Surplus from one year's EC Budget is returned to member states in the following year's Budget by means of a reduction of the amount to be financed from own resources. This has the effect of reducing the amount each member state is required to pay from GNP-based resource. Moneys returned in this way are not broken down by category and information is not therefore available for specific items of expenditure. So we have made no representations on this matter.</p>

	<p pid=".215W.9/1">The UK favours the abolition of milk quotas in advance of enlargement. If, however, this does not prove to be possible we believe the approach taken in the European Commission's paper on milk quota allocation for acceding countries to be a sound one. It follows previous practice, when quotas were first introduced in 1984, and in other EU enlargement processes, whereby quota is fixed on the basis of historical production during a set reference period, in this case the average for the years 1997&ndash;99. As such, there should be no impact on the UK dairy sector. We have made it clear to the Commission that we are looking for an outcome which is both fair and does not create new obstacles for CAP reform.</p>

	<p pid=".217W.6/1">The forthcoming Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations which will implement the regulatory and technical requirements of the Landfill Directive will ban the landfilling of hazardous liquid wastes from July 2002 as required by the Directive. The Directive also requires that non-hazardous liquids are banned from landfill 'as soon as possible' and no later than July 2009.

The Government are currently considering how they wish these producer responsibilities to be discharged, and how the targets should be met. The current draft of the proposed EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive contains similar provisions. The Department has undertaken also to publish shortly a discussion paper on a possible producer responsibility model for tyres. Consideration is also being given within Government to producer responsibility initiatives for direct mail and non-packaging farm plastics.</p>

	<p pid=".218W.5/1">This Department will investigate complaints about the spread of injurious weeds covered by the Weeds Act 1959 to farmed land or land used for the keeping of horses as part of a diversified farm business. Where the complaint is valid the occupier of the land will be asked to take action to remove the weeds. In most cases the occupier will co-operate and act promptly to remove the weed. However in a small number of cases, following discussion with the parties involved, the occupier will persistently refuse to take action. If this is the case we will arrange for the weeds to be cleared and will recover the cost from the occupier of the land.</p>
	<p pid=".218W.5/2">When following up a complaint we may arrange for an inspector from the Rural Payments Agency to visit the holding to identify the weed concerned and the level of infestation. If necessary a follow-up visit may also be carried out to ensure the weeds have been removed. Technical staff from the Department's Rural Development Service will oversee clearance work arranged by DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid=".218W.5/3">In the current financial year all work involving farm visits has been severely constrained by the foot and mouth outbreak. As a result only some one and a half staff years were devoted to this work over the period from April to December 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".220W.2/1">The statistical survey covers a wide spectrum of issues concerning the local air pollution control system; the 2000&ndash;01 report is over 200 pages long. It ranges from simple numbers of applications and authorised processes in each of the 24 process categories, to data on speed of local authority decision, numbers and types of prosecutions, whether cost accounting is undertaken, and whether authorities have enforcement policies. Each statistical report is circulated to key stakeholders for their comment and the reports are now published. The reports are very carefully considered by the Department and decisions made on what steps should be taken. For example, in the light of figures on local authority take-up of cost accounting, steps were taken to reinforce to local authorities the importance of adopting such practice, and practical guidance was issued to all local authorities on cost accounting methods.</p>

Canoe portage facilities have been installed on the rivers Great Ouse, Nene, and Stour with similar works planned for other rivers including the Thames. On rivers where there is no right of navigation, the Agency has sought to improve access for canoeists nationally through the Angling and Canoe Liaison Group which it hosts, chairs, and provides secretarial support for. With support from this Group, the Agency has funded the production of a booklet, &quot;Agreeing Access to Water for Canoeing&quot;.</p>

Until the industrial action was suspended on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-11">11 January</phrase> it was not possible to take action to relieve sites which were under the greatest pressure. Gloucester claims are processed at Exeter and, following the suspension, extra teams were drafted in from other RPA sites across the country and significant amounts of overtime were worked. As a result of this recovery action most of the Gloucestershire claims which are able to be paid will have been cleared by the end of February.</p>

	<p pid=".224W.2/2">The Department does not collate statistics on fly tipping. Reports by the Tidy Britain Group on this issue showed that the type of waste most frequently fly-tipped is household waste. It is unlikely that the landfill tax causes householders to fly tip waste because local authorities have a legal obligation to collect or accept this type of waste and, as a result, householders do not directly meet the cost of the tax.</p>
	<p pid=".224W.2/3">Under Section 59 of the Environment Protection Act 1990, local authorities (or the Environment Agency) have the power to remove any fly-tipped waste and recover costs incurred from any person who made or knowingly caused or permitted the deposit of the waste.</p>
	<p pid=".224W.2/4">The local authority or the Environment Agency also has the power to prosecute the perpetrators of fly tipping which can lead to an unlimited fine and/or imprisonment for up to two years (five years for special wastes).</p>

	<p pid=".225W.2/2">Pesticide products containing carbaryl have been reviewed as part of the general review in the UK of all organophosphate pesticides. The main purpose of the review is to address public concerns about the potential toxicity of these chemicals and economic impact is not an overriding consideration where safety is concerned. However, the loss of some compounds may have an economic impact on particular sectors of industry. The decision to revoke a particular compound is not taken lightly. It may be revoked because serious safety concerns remain following the evaluation of data submitted in support of the compound or because there was insufficient data submitted for an adequate evaluation of the data to be made. The loss of carbaryl stems from a commercial decision by the approval holder not to support the compound under the UK review.</p>

	<p pid=".226W.2/2">Under EU rules the UK is not obliged to inform other member states of any national review programme of pesticide products undertaken to address national issues. However, all member states and the commission were informed of the UK programme to review organophosphate compounds, which includes carbaryl. In addition, all are automatically informed of any new product approvals and revocations. A separate European programme intends to review all active substances used in plant protection products within the community and all member states and the commission are involved in this decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.2/3">The approval holder for carbaryl did not submit supporting data under the UK review and therefore the approval for all products containing carbaryl, including Thinsec, have been revoked. Under the European review programme carbaryl has been supported so far. Data for the evaluation of carbaryl must be submitted to the member state evaluating the compound by the end of April 2002. The continued approval of carbaryl throughout Europe is therefore dependent on the conclusions of that evaluation.</p>
	<p pid=".226W.2/4">It is possible for member states to carry out their own review exercises and for these to be carried out at different times to the European review. Member states are not obliged to follow other countries, domestic decisions regarding the approval or revocation of compounds. In this case, the UK organophosphate review was introduced to address public concerns about the safety of these compounds and we have acted in a consistent manner to revoke their use where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".227W.8/1">I believe strongly that community buildings and village halls have an important role to play in village life. They can make an enormous difference to the well-being of communities by providing sustainable, multi-functional and flexible resources. They can provide a focus for a range of activities including child care, employment training and advice, sports, leisure and participative activities involving all members of the rural community.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.8/2">Recent evidence from the Countryside Agency's &quot;Rural Services Survey&quot; suggests that the substantial amounts of funding from various sources over recent years&mdash;the 21st Century Halls for England Fund, the Community Fund, Awards for All funding and local authorities&mdash;has been very successful in increasing provision of village halls. We are in regular contact with the Countryside Agency on these issues and my officials will be meeting Action for Communities in Rural England shortly to discuss how best to support local communities so as to complement the investment that has gone into village halls.</p>

	<p pid=".228W.0/2">New EU-wide measures (implemented domestically under the Processed Animal Protein Regulations from <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-01">1 August 2001</phrase>) already control intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of a wide range of processed animal proteins effectively preventing their inclusion in feed for farmed animals in order to stop the propagation of BSE.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.0/3">In Great Britain, a national feed sampling programme has been in place since 1996 to monitor compliance with BSE-related feed controls. This programme, operated by the State Veterinary Service, typically takes around 20,000 samples per year from feed mills, on-farm mixers and other premises handling livestock feed. The results of the programme are very encouraging and indicate wide compliance with the feed controls, confirming that prohibited ingredients (from domestic or imported sources) are being effectively removed from the market, distribution channels and farms.</p>
	<p pid=".228W.0/4">One theoretical issue is that recent cases of BSE in younger animals may have been exposed to infection as a result of cross-contamination (during transhipment) of imported vegetable protein used in the production of animal feedingstuffs with meat and bone meal. We are continuing carefully to investigate such cases, but there is currently no clear evidence that individual animals have been infected by this route.</p>

	<p pid=".230W.0/2">Scottish Executive Ministers did not attend the February Agriculture Council as there was nothing on the agenda of specific interest to Scotland and the UK Government are well briefed on the Scottish Executive interests in more general matters. There was no need for the UK Government to raise any issues of particular concern to the Scottish Executive. On the third point, it is the responsibility of the European Committee of the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Scottish Executive's involvement in preparations for EU Council meetings. These arrangements are a matter for the Committee and the Scottish Executive. My Department provides information to Scottish Executive officials as part of that process.</p>

	<p pid=".230W.3/2">It is not possible to comment precisely on the effect of the climate change levy on the competitive position of our horticulture industry. This depends, among other things, on the extent to which individual sectors and firms within the industry are exposed to international competition; its future energy use; and the extent to which it takes up the incentives which the Government have introduced to help it improve its environmental performance and to protect its competitiveness. These incentives include:</p>
	<p pid=".230W.3/3" class="indent">a special package of support which aims to improve energy efficiency across the sector, including the provision of site-specific advice for individual businesses;</p>
	<p pid=".230W.3/4" class="indent">exemptions from the levy for most renewable sources of energy and for fuel used by good quality combined heat and power systems;</p>
	<p pid=".230W.3/5" class="indent">enhanced capital allowances for investments in energy efficiency technologies including thermal screens, boilers, combined heat and power systems and lighting; and</p>
	<p pid=".230W.3/6" class="indent">a temporary 50 per cent. discount on the levy to the horticulture sector for a period of up to five years while the energy efficiency measures targeted at the sector take effect.</p>

	<p pid=".230W.6/1">I announced this morning that agreement has been reached with the House Builders Federation and the water industry that all new sewers will be built to one agreed standard. We now have in place a protocol which sets out the key elements of design and construction for new development to enable wider adoption of sewers. As a result, owners of new property will not have the kind of problems experienced by those with existing private sewers. Copies of the protocol and the report on the outcome of the consultation undertaken by the Department into new sewers and drains have been placed in the Library. They are also on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.6/2">I am equally keen that we should assist owners of existing private sewers. We have therefore appointed outside consultants to undertake research to establish the extent of the private sewer network, identify and examine the problems associated with private sewers and produce workable solutions. The research began in December and is due to last 18 months.</p>

	<p pid=".231W.2/1">Based on recommendations from the Environment Agency I (by authority of the Secretary of State) announced this morning that I have reviewed the identification of Sensitive Areas in England in accordance with the criteria in Part I of Schedule I of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (England and Wales) Regulations 1994 (which transposes the European Council Directive (91/271/EEC) concerning urban waste water treatment).</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/2">This review has resulted in the identification of four freshwater stretches of the rivers Stour, Wissey, Chelmer and Leam, which are intended for the abstraction of drinking water, to be identified as Sensitive Areas (nitrate) on the basis of elevated levels of nitrate under the terms of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/3">These new requirements on water companies to remove nitrate from sewage treatment discharges will complement the action required by farmers under the Nitrates Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/4">Work to provide more stringent treatment (nitrogen removal) at six qualifying treatment works is expected to be completed by end 2004. 180 bathing waters (already identified under the Bathing Waters Regulations 1991) in England are also to be identified as Sensitive Areas as discharges from qualifying sewage treatment works receive, or are to receive by 2005 more stringent treatment (ultraviolet disinfection) to fulfil standards of those regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/5">Funding for these improvements have already been provided for in the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) Periodic Review of water company price limits for the five-year period from 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/6">We are committed to a steady improvement to Britain's freshwater and bathing quality. Already we have the best ever recorded bathing water quality. Today's moves mean that we can continue our efforts to ensure clean and healthy water both for this country's inhabitants and its aquatic life.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/7">Lists of the new sensitive areas have today been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. Maps showing the location of all current sensitive areas (nitrate) and (bathing waters) will be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and at offices of the Environment Agency in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".235W.8/1">Since December 2000 the Department has paid about &pound;650 million to local authorities to cover the additional salary costs of teachers passing the threshold. To help with the operation of threshold assessment and performance management we also make &pound;28 million per year available to schools through the Standards Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".235W.8/2">The Department has a contract with Cambridge Education Associates (CEA) for the provision and deployment of threshold assessors and external advisers to governing bodies on heads' performance. We also have a contract with the Centre for British Teachers (CfBT) for training in threshold assessment and performance management. The value of these contracts depends on the volume and quality of activity. Since January 2000 total CEA contract costs have been around &pound;36.5 million and CfBT costs around &pound;12 million, including the value of investment that will support future activity.</p>

	<p pid=".237W.3/1">The Department is collecting the names of most children, but not the addresses of any. This January we introduced the &quot;Pupil Level Annual Schools Census&quot; (PLASC) for maintained schools in England. Schools provided a list of the pupils on their register together with each pupil's name, &quot;unique pupil number&quot; (UPN), home postcode (not full address), and other details such as ethnic group, special educational needs and eligibility for free school meals. This information will be combined with details of Key Stage assessment and examination results collected separately from schools, marking agencies and exam boards, and with future PLASC returns, to create statistical profiles of pupils. The Department has no interest in the identity of individual pupils as such. However pupil names (in addition to UPNs) are needed to ensure that all data relating to the same pupil are collated correctly, and therefore that the statistical profiles are accurate. Within the Department only technical staff directly engaged in the data collation process will have access to pupil names.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.3/2">Analysis of these statistical profiles will provide major new information to help schools, LEAs, the Department and other educational agencies in the drive to raise standards. It will also enable groups of pupils (such as ethnic minorities) who may be under-achieving to be identified far more effectively so that programmes can be developed or improved to meet their needs. Home postcodes too will be used for statistical purposes only. The postcode mix of a school's pupils provides an indication of socio-economic background which can be taken into account (along with other factors) in comparing the performance of different schools and setting targets for improvement. Postcode information also enables neighbourhood analyses to be carried out.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.3/3">Certain limited disclosures of PLASC data with pupil names may take place provided these comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and any other legislative requirements. For further details I refer the hon. Member to my answer on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-28">28 January 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-01-28.109W"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 109&ndash;11W</phrase> to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the hon.

This is five times the amount available in 1997&ndash;98. The fund can be used for a range of activities including training for staff in special educational needs, improvements in speech and language therapy provision for children with communication difficulties and the greater inclusion of children with SEN in the mainstream. This latter includes early intervention for pupils with SEN, training on child development and behaviour management, and improved links between special and mainstream schools.</p>

	<p pid=".241W.2/1">From 1997&ndash;98 to date, we have supported spending totalling &pound;110 million through local education authorities to provide security improvements at maintained primary and secondary schools in England. In 1997 the Department issued joint guidance with the Home Office on &quot;School Security-Dealing with Troublemakers&quot;, and in March 2001 the Department produced a video &quot;Can You See What They See?&quot; and set up a website &quot;<a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/schoolsecurity/">www.dfes.gov.uk/schoolsecurity/</a>&quot;.

	<p pid=".242W.2/1">Last November, at the launch of the new generation of Modern Apprenticeships, the Secretary of State announced a &pound;16 million marketing campaign, to be run over three years in England, to promote apprenticeships and boost participation. That campaign, led jointly by the Department and the Learning and Skills Council, starts on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-04">4 March</phrase> with a new television advertisement, aimed at young people, which will run until the end of the month.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.2/2">From the spring, a range of marketing measures will be introduced to reach not only young people, but also key influencers and employers. At the local level, Learning and Skills Councils, Connexions Partnerships, careers services and other partners will work together to raise awareness of, and foster support for, Modern Apprenticeships; and to provide young people with essential information and advice on the opportunities available in their communities. It is a key role of National Training Organisations and their successors the Sector Skills Councils in partnership with the LSC to ensure that employers continue to support MA and that they provide sufficient places to meet the demand from young people.</p>

Recent changes to the student funding system apply to undergraduate rather than postgraduate students. The Government have already taken steps to improve the competitiveness of PhD stipends to ensure that doctoral study remains an attractive option for graduates with the minimum level for research councils' PhD stipends rising to &pound;9,000 per year by 2003&ndash;04. The Government have also commissioned Sir Gareth Roberts to review the supply of high-level engineering and science skills.</p>

This guidance, &quot;School Security: Dealing with Troublemakers&quot;, deals with incidents, including thefts, that occur on school premises, and advises schools and local education authorities that offences of theft need to be reported to the police.

If a mobile phone is stolen in such circumstances, it is then a matter for the victim and their parents to report it to the police. They may also wish to inform the school so that the head teacher and local education authority may be able to see if any pattern of crime is arising, and to consider the need for advising pupils and their parents of any consequent action.</p>

	<p pid=".254W.3/1">We have taken a series of steps to ensure people are made aware of the remedial measures we have taken to rectify the problems created by the failure to publicise adequately the 1986 legislative changes to Inherited SERPS.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.3/2">These measures, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-29">29 November 2000</phrase>, and which subsequently became law on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-20">20 March 2001</phrase>, were: to postpone any change to the rules on inherited SERPS until October this year; ensure existing pensioners, and people due to reach state pension age before this October were not affected by the change; and phase the reduction for people within 10 years of state pension age&mdash;allowing them time to plan ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.3/3">During the course of last year, the Department wrote to all existing pensioners, and those whose state pension age falls before <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-05">5 October 2002</phrase> to reassure them that, in the event of their death, the new rules on Inherited SERPS will not affect their spouses.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.3/4">We are now going further to ensure that people understand the changes. From <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March</phrase>, the Department will start writing to some 5&frac12; million people within 10 years of state pension age&mdash;those who, under the new rules, can pass on between a maximum of 90 per cent. and 60 per cent. of their SERPS to a surviving spouse.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.3/5">The letter, and the accompanying leaflet, will not only explain how the changes may affect them, but will also give them the opportunity to request an estimate of the SERPS they can pass on, and impartial information on financial planning.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.3/6">In addition, from August this year, we will run a media campaign to further disseminate information on the changes to the public at large.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.3/7">We have taken action to ensure that the Department's staff are aware of the new rules, and the Department will also provide a dedicated helpline 0845 600 6116 or textphone 0845 602 1913 to answer further queries and provide information to members of the public.</p>

	<p pid=".257W.2/2" class="indent">25.3 per cent. of the senior civil service are women, up from 17.8 per cent. in 1998. The target for 2004&ndash;05 is 35 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/3" class="indent">21.2 per cent. of those in the top 600 posts are women, up from 12.7 per cent. in 1998. The target for 2004&ndash;05 is 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/4" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> 2.3 per cent. of staff at senior civil service level are from a minority ethnic background, up from 1.6 per cent. in 1998. The target for 2004&ndash;05 is 3.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/5" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> 1.8 per cent. of staff at senior civil service level have a disability, up from 1.5 per cent. in 1998. The target for 2004&ndash;05 is 3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/6" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> These figures exclude data on ethnicity and disability in MOD.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/7">Individual Departments and agencies have specific initiatives in place to tackle under-representation at senior levels. These are supported by a number of central initiatives, all of which are publicised widely across Government.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/8">In June 2001, the Cabinet Office launched the Elevator Partnerships, as a pilot informal mentoring scheme for women. The aim of the scheme is partnership between 50 senior women and 50 junior women who appear to be static in career terms, with the aim of encouraging career confidence.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/9">All Departments were given the opportunity to participate in the pilot. An evaluation of the pilot in the summer will be used to encourage Departments to set up similar schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/10">The Cabinet Office has launched &quot;Pathways&quot;, a central development programme targeted at minority ethnic staff with the potential to rise to senior levels. There is an annual trawl across all Departments for participants and there is a page dedicated to the scheme on the civil service website.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/11">There is also an annual bursary scheme for disabled civil servants who have the potential to reach a senior management position (at least Grade 7) in the civil service. The scheme provides access and funding for training opportunities and personal development. Applications are invited annually through advertisements in Government publications.</p>

	<p pid=".266W.8/1">The BBC, as Television Licensing Authority, contracts the day to day administration and enforcement of the licensing system to its agent, TV Licensing (TVL). While there is clearly no benefit in visiting an address if it is known that there is no television receiver there, this information is not always available without a visit. I understand that, in the past, a declaration that no television was in use at an address was normally accepted by TV Licensing as proof of the matter, but that a significant proportion of such declarations turn out to be false. The BBC has indicated that its current policy is therefore that TV Licensing should visit all addresses in respect of which it has received a declaration that no television is in use.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.8/2">TV Licensing officials may enter a person's home only with their consent or if authorised to do so by a warrant issued by a magistrate. Under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 (as amended), in order to issue such a warrant a magistrate must be satisfied, by information provided on oath, that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under the Act has been or is being committed.</p>

	<p pid=".274W.2/1">The Tobacco Task Force last met in October 1999. Following that meeting it was agreed that the task force had completed its initial work of identifying the needs of sports affected by the ban on tobacco sponsorship. Those sports included in the task force confirmed that it was too soon to be looking to replace existing contracts, and that the situation should be reviewed before the expiry of current contracts. We have been in contact with the member sports since 1999 and will consider the case for reconvening the task force if requested to.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/2">I have recently been contacted by the British Darts Association. I have confirmed that I am happy to assist the association in discussions with alternative sponsors as and when interested companies are identified.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.5/1">The national strategy for sexual health and HIV prioritises the HIV prevention needs of groups most affected by HIV, including people from, or with links to, high prevalence countries (currently in Africa), injecting drug misusers and men who have sex with men. The strategy also proposes a target to reduce by 50 per cent. the number of previously undiagnosed HIV infected people attending genito-urinary clinics who remain unaware of their infection by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/2">Latest estimates of the number of adults living in the United Kingdom with HIV infection indicate that nearly half of all infections in male heterosexuals are undiagnosed. These men are therefore unable to benefit from HIV treatment services and health promotion to reduce the likelihood of infecting their partners.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/3">Figures from the Public Health Laboratory Service show that, to date, a total of 5,813 men and 7,630 women diagnosed in the UK are presumed to have acquired HIV through heterosexual sex. This compares to almost 27,000 diagnoses in gay and bisexual men. The majority of heterosexuals with HIV are of African origin and acquired their infection abroad.</p>

The studies fail to provide convincing evidence that municipal incinerators affect children's health.</p>

	<p pid=".292W.2/114" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".292W.2/115">1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.2/116">2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.2/117">3. The expenditure is the total spent on commissioning health care by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. The majority of drugs expenditure in 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99 and a smaller element in 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.2/118">4. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2000&ndash;01 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.2/119">5. Some health authorities act as lead commissioners for particular specialties which inflates their figures when compared with others and also causes differences between years. Other factors may also distort the figures so the results are therefore not all directly comparable with each other and with answers to similar questions for previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".296W.5/2">A patient's discharge is only regarded as delayed when the hospital team's assessment is that the patient no longer needs treatment in a hospital bed and that they can safely be cared for elsewhere. When this assessment has been made the patient does not have a right indefinitely to occupy a hospital bed. A patient can, however, refuse to be discharged to a care home. In this case, social services staff, together with the hospital, community health services, the patient and any family and carers, will need to explore alternatives. Ultimately a package of health and social care to support the patient in their own home (or alternative accommodation, if their own home is now unsuitable), should be put together to allow the patient to be discharged.</p>

	<p pid=".304W.2/2">NHS ProCure 21 aims to deliver better capital procurement in the national health service, through programmes on better design, enabling the NHS to be a better client, performance management and partnering. The first three elements apply to all capital schemes in the NHS. Partnering is currently being piloted in the north-west and west midlands regions. The selection of Principal Supply Chain Partners is currently in progress, and an evaluation will be made once the partnering programme is under way and a decision taken on how quickly we will be able to roll it out nationally.</p>

	<p pid=".304W.8/2">We do not have data available centrally on the number of vocational training scheme places. Doctors on vocational training schemes represent only a proportion of those training for general practice, as there are other training routes.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.8/3">All doctors training for a career in general practice must undertake a period training as a General Practice Registrar. We have a target to increase General Practice Registrar numbers by 550 by 2004. To accommodate these increases, we are investing significant resources in the general practice training infrastructure (&pound;9 million over three years) and in developing training practice premises (&pound;30 million over the same period). We also removed, last November, the outdated restrictions that had previously prevented overseas doctors receiving NHS funding when undertaking General Practice Registrar training.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.8/4">Recruitment to General Practice Registrar training is healthy. Numbers have risen, year on year, for the last five years. The attached table shows the figures for the last 10 years. Last year numbers increased by 224 on the previous year, exceeding our target increase of 150. As a result of the measures we have put in place, we expect growth to continue.</p>
