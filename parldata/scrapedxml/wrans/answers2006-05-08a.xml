UK experts participated in a conference in Budapest in February 2006 to discuss the issues emerging from the consultation. The Commission is currently consulting an expert group containing technical representatives from all EU member states in order to finalise its proposal. We anticipate that a final proposal will be produced in autumn 2006. The final proposal will cover the full spectrum of education and training, including both academic and vocational qualifications.</p>

	<p pid="a.2W.5/1">Local authorities and the LSC have crucial roles to play in delivering the reforms set out in the White Paper 'Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances', and must work together to drive progress through a shared strategy. The White Paper makes clear that we want local authorities to play a strategic leadership role, consistent with their leadership role in children's services overall, ensuring the integration of 14&ndash;19 reform with the wider agenda for children and young people in the locality. The Learning and Skills Council will be the primary partner for the local authority, and will use its funding and powers to secure high quality provision which meets the needs of learners and employers in every area. This will include providing opportunities for new and existing high quality providers to openly compete for provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.5/2">The White Paper sets out a robust approach to tackling underperformance which could culminate in the Learning and Skills Council ceasing to fund provision which does not improve; or requiring changes to governance or executive management.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.5/3">If a change in governance or leadership is required, this might include a stronger role for the relevant local authority at the invitation of the existing governing body.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.5/4">If funding is withdrawn, replacement provision is likely to be sourced by competition. No one model is expected to arise out of a competition to secure a replacement provider. It would be open to a local authority to participate in a competition if it wished to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.3W.3/1">Information on the support provided by DFID to partner countries is publicly available (including on DFID's website <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>) and is disseminated in partner countries by DFID offices and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) missions.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.3/2">We believe that aid is more effective when used to support developing countries' own plans, and to strengthen their own capacity to deliver. So where possible, DFID works in partnership with developing country governments, and integrates our support with their programmes. In such partnerships, our aim is to ensure public understanding of our combined efforts rather than to separately identify donor funded work.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.3/3">Where however, governments do not share our commitment to reducing poverty reduction, human rights and good financial management, it is important to ensure that our aid is visibly separate from government programmes. For example, in Zimbabwe, no DFID funding is channelled through the Government. All our assistance, which focuses on humanitarian need and the HIV/AIDS crisis, is provided through non-governmental organisations and UN agencies. This substantially reduces the scope for the government to claim credit for assistance provided by DFID</p>

	<p pid="a.3W.6/1">The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) sets out Africa leaders' priorities to help boost agricultural growth and food security at continental, regional and country levels. As the UK and other G8 countries only responded firmly to CAADP during 2005, no funds were explicitly allocated to it over the last three years. However, the response below identifies where DFID funding was consistent with the CAADP.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.6/2">At the country level, the CAADP commits African countries to spend 10 per cent. of their budgets on the agriculture sector. DFID's support to African country budgets will help them do this. However, detailed information on how budget support is allocated to sectors by Africa governments are not held centrally and to gather it would involve incurring a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.6/3">At the regional and continental levels, DFID provided around &pound;80 million over the last three years for agricultural research, one of CAADP's four priorities. In the next three years, DFID has allocated around &pound;85 million to agricultural research in Africa as part of its response to CAADP.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.6/4">In financial year 2005&ndash;06, DFID committed an additional &pound;200,000 to design a programme of additional regional support under CAADP. This will clarify DFID's plans for additional regional work on CAADP over each of the coming three years. DFID has provided a total of &pound;2,348,000 to the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UN-EGA) over the last three financial years (&pound;1,000,000 in 2003&ndash;04, &pound;673,121 in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;675,000 in 2005&ndash;06). DFID has recently been considering a contribution for the next three years with the Commission. However, this has been delayed whilst the UN-ECA re-examines its role in conjunction with the African Union and the African Development Bank, under the new leadership of Abdoulie Janneh. We expect the UN-ECA to be in a better position to discuss its future needs with donors after its Annual Meeting in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.6/5">No support has been given to the Pan African Parliament to date. However, DFID is currently discussing priorities for support with the Pan African Parliament. We hope to complete the design of a Pan African Parliament support programme over the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="a.4W.2/1">Access to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services is unacceptably low in many sub Saharan African Countries where often less than 5 per cent. of pregnant women are able to access these services. The recent Secretary General's report to the UN reporting on progress for the past five years on AIDS, highlights that only 9 per cent. of HIV positive pregnant women in low and middle income countries have access to PMTCT services.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.2/2">DFID has been actively engaged in building international consensus, and as co-chair of the Global Steering Committee for the June 2006 HIV/AIDS UNGASS will be pressing for agreement on actions required to scale up services towards universal access to a comprehensive programme of prevention, treatment and care, including access to PMTCT by 2010 with a &quot;Road Map&quot; for future action.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.2/3">DFID believes that PMTCT is an important prevention measure which should form part of a comprehensive response to HIV prevention, and has encouraged partner countries to integrate PMTCT plans into maternal and child health and sexual and reproductive health services.</p>

	<p pid="a.5W.2/1">I expect the 2005&ndash;08 public service agreement target on maternal health in Asia to be met by 2008. I do not, however, expect the target on maternal health in Africa, to be met by 2008. Progress against this target after 2008 will therefore be subject to further discussion during the next spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.5W.2/2">The target for Asia is to achieve an increase of 15 percentage points in the proportion of births assisted by skilled birth attendants. The latest estimate is 43 per cent. using data from 2001 to 2003, compared to 38 per cent. in 2000. If the current rate of progress continues, it is estimated that the target should just be achieved by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.5W.2/3">The target for Africa is to achieve an increase in the proportion of births assisted by skilled birth attendants by 11 percentage points. The latest estimate is 47 per cent. and increases before 2008 are unlikely. DFID has not yet estimated when this will be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.5W.2/4">Further detail on the latest progress against these and all public service agreements will be presented in the 2006 Departmental Report which will be laid before Parliament in the next few days.</p>

	<p pid="a.6W.5/1">There is growing political consensus among member states of the African Union on promoting gender equality and empowerment. A Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa was ratified in November 2005. A key element is the elimination of discrimination against women. DFID seeks to encourage and support African Governments in their work at country level to put this into practice. DFID has provided financial support to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), who has developed an African Gender and Development Index which shows specific gaps in the status of women at country level.</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.5/2">DFID provides financial support for work to reduce violence against women and to provide support for legal assistance in a number of countries in Africa. For example, in Sierra Leone, DFID has provided support for Sexual Assault Referral Centres for victims of sexual assault and gender based violence; in Ethiopia it has provided core support to the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association, who provide legal aid and assistance for issues affecting women; in Uganda DFID supports UNICEF's protection work in northern Uganda, one component of which aims to address sexual and gender based violence; and in Uganda and Ghana DFID provides support to programmes aimed at tackling domestic violence. DFID also provides financial support to the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) which supports the Trust Fund for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and the Women, Peace and Security Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.7W.2/1">DFID funding to Liberia is mainly channelled through multilateral organisations, such as UN agencies, and the European Commission. To contribute to better public safety, and in response to a request from the UN Secretary General, DFID has recently provided &pound;2.1 million to the United Nations Development Programme Trust Fund for Crisis Prevention and Recovery in Liberia for support to the deactivation of unqualified Liberian National Police (LNP) Officers. The LNP is responsible for maintaining law and order, investigating crime, collecting evidence and arresting and remanding suspects pending trial. Effective reform and rebuilding of the LNP would be a significant step towards providing more security for people, including women.

	<p pid="a.8W.2/1">We share the concerns raised by Jan Egeland, UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs. As he noted, the security situation has deteriorated dramatically since January, with increasing levels of banditry, armed clashes and attacks on civilians and UN and NGO staff. This rising level of insecurity threatens to reverse progress made in 2005. Over the last four months alone, 200,000 people have been driven from their homes by the violence. The ability of the UN and NGOs to access the most vulnerable people is becoming a critical issue with no or very limited access to up to 650,000 people in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.2/2">As Mr Egeland rightly identified, these problems are compounded by the increase in restrictions and administrative delays imposed on humanitarian agencies by the Government of Sudan. We continue to press the Government for unimpeded and safe access for the humanitarian agencies. We hope that a conclusion to the Abuja peace process will aid this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.2/3">The UK has played a leading role in the international community's response to Darfur, including support to the Abuja process. The UK is one of the few donors providing early and reliable funding to the humanitarian effort in 2006. We continue to press our international donor partners to contribute more, and we are also working with the UN to mitigate the impact of the current funding shortfall and security-related issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.9W.6/1">The Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 lays down strict rules for the collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and use or disposal of all animal by-products, which includes the carcases of fallen stock, in order to safeguard public and animal health.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/2">Animal by-products must be collected and transported in leak-proof, covered vehicles or containers in accordance with Annex II of the EU Regulation. Local authorities, usually Trading Standards, are the enforcement authority for animal by-products legislation and are responsible for ensuring the conditions of the Regulation are complied with.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/3">Transportation in a refrigerated vehicle is not a specific requirement of Annex II of the Regulation, unless the material is unprocessed Category 3 material destined for the production of feed material or pet food, when it must be transported chilled or frozen unless it is processed within 24 hours of departure. In other cases the transportation of animal by-products must take place at an appropriate temperature to avoid any risk to public or animal health and take place without undue delay. In all cases vehicles must be maintained in a clean condition, and be clean and dry before use, and washed and disinfected after use.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/4">In addition, under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities have a duty to check their areas periodically for existing and potential statutory nuisances, and to take reasonably practicable steps to investigate complaints of statutory nuisances, including any dust, steam, smell or other effluvia arising on industrial, trade or business premises and being prejudicial to health or a nuisance. A &quot;premises&quot; may be a dwelling, place of business, land, beach, vessel or sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/5">Once satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists or may occur or recur, a local authority must issue an abatement notice requiring that the nuisance be ceased or abated within a specified timescale. It is an offence to breach or fail to comply with an abatement notice, which carries upon summary conviction through the courts a maximum fine up &pound;5,000 for domestic premises and &pound;20,000 for industrial, trade and industry premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/6">Some plants and processes that have the potential for emissions of offensive odours are regulated under the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations, which are enforced by either the Environment Agency or local authorities depending on the type of installation. Plants and processes that are covered by these regulations are not subject to the statutory nuisance regime, in order to remove double jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.6/7">Vehicles on public highways are not &quot;premises&quot; within the statutory nuisance regime on odour. However, vehicles driven in a careless or antisocial manner (that is causing or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress) may be seized by the police under section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.11W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-02">2 May 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.11W.5/2">Following the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report Waste not, Want not, published in 2002, Defra commissioned an independent body to bring together information on waste management facilities, including municipal incinerators, currently used in the UK and Europe, and the currently available scientific evidence on their environmental and health effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.5/3">The resulting Review of Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management: Municipal Solid Waste and Similar Wastes report; was peer reviewed by the Royal Society and published in May 2004. Among the other conclusions drawn, the report showed that risks to human health from incineration are small in comparison with other known risks to health.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.5/4">Emissions from municipal incinerators of PM2.5 particles (estimated at 0.029 thousand tonnes in 2004) are proportionally lower than the contribution from other sectors, at around 0.03 per cent. of the national total of 104 thousand tonnes. The major sources of PM2.5 are thought to be road transport (27 per cent.), domestic combustion (14 per cent.), agriculture (8 per cent.), industrial off road machinery (7 per cent.), power stations (4 per cent.) and small scale waste burning (4 per cent.). However, this fraction of national emissions will not represent the level of human exposure arising from each source sector as a result of the different heights and conditions of release.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.5/5">Defra recently launched a consultation on measures to review the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This consultation suggests a much more wide ranging approach for pollutants such as fine particles (PM 2.5), which is cost effective, geared towards improving public health in the UK and will lead to further improvements in air quality. Further details on this consultation can be found on the Defra website:</p>

The guideline values have regard to specific environments and effects rather than the source of noise, so there are no specific guidelines on aircraft noise.

	<p pid="a.15W.3/1">The 'Future of Air Transport' White Paper set out the combination of measures by which the Government aim to limit and, where possible, reduce the number of people in the UK significantly affected by aircraft noise. These include promoting research and development into new low noise engine and airframe technologies. We have incorporated the key elements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation's balanced approach to controlling noise at airports into UK law; EU directive 2002/49/EC requires periodic noise mapping at many airports from 2007 to identify day and night noise problems and, from 2008, action plans to deal with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.15W.3/2">The Government have powers to regulate noise at airports designated for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports are currently so designated). This regulation includes departure noise limits and restrictions on night flying. We will also consider exercising similar powers at other airports if there is evidence that a major noise problem is not being dealt with adequately through local controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.15W.3/3">The Civil Aviation Bill will give airports clear powers to impose penalties on airlines who fail to follow noise preferential routes and other procedures designed to avoid, limit or mitigate the effects of aircraft noise. In the case of airports designated for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, where the Secretary of State has specified noise controls, he will have the power to direct that a penalty scheme be made, amended or revoked to enforce those controls. It will be for the managers of non-designated airports to decide whether to use these powers in the light of their local circumstances.</p>

To date 7,740 (5,282 UK and 2,458 foreign) have become the subject of claims for compensation. Approximately 25 per cent. can be attributed to a DVLA error in keying the address, with 75 per cent. due to non-delivery by Royal Mail.

Those who hold digitised passports only need to quote the passport number so that DVLA can check identity on line with the UK Passport Service. All other UK passport holders can have their applications checked at some 750 mainline post offices, and DVLA's local offices, for a small charge, with immediate return. Holders of EU passports, and those from certain designated countries, can take them for checking at three DVLA local offices (Glasgow, Nottingham, Wimbledon) and DVLA's Reception at Swansea.</p>

	<p pid="a.20W.3/1">The Government strongly support the use of high quality biofuels in the road transport sector. In the short term, we estimate that bioethanol has the potential to make up some 5 per cent. of total petrol sales in the UK. The Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) which we announced last year is designed to ensure that this happens by 2010, and is likely to mean that sales of bioethanol will amount to over a billion litres a year by that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.3/2">We have made clear that we intend that biofuels should account for more than 5 per cent. of total transport fuel sales after 2010 so long as infrastructural requirements and fuel and vehicle technical standards allow, and subject to the costs being acceptable to the consumer. We would also want to put in place robust carbon saving and sustainability assurance schemes to ensure that the biofuels sold in the UK were from sustainable sources and were delivering the maximum possible carbon savings.</p>

Newer rolling stock is expected to be transferred to this route for December 2006. The Greater Western franchise specification was designed to improve the overall operational and financial performance of the train service and to ensure resources were used to best meet market needs.

The Code is issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and it is periodically reviewed by the CPS.

	<p pid="a.39W.9/1">Lord Burns, the independent adviser on the BBC Charter Review, will be chairing a public seminar on the BBC licence fee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May 2006</phrase> to which other broadcasters have been invited including ITV, Channel 4, Five and BSkyB. The debate generated by this seminar will form part of the evidence base for setting the future level of the licence fee. In preparation for this seminar, we have invited written submissions on the future funding of the BBC from interested parties. We are also commissioning survey research on the public's willingness to pay for the BBC.</p>

	<p pid="a.58W.2/1">The main element of national health service dental services are the primary dental care services provided by dentists working within the general dental service (GDS), or personal dental service (PDS) pilots. Until April 2006, when primary care trusts (PCTs) became responsible for commissioning all primary dental care services, the GDS was a non- discretionary service funded from a national budget. Expenditure was mainly determined by the volume of NHS work that dentists chose to undertake. Local budget allocations were not assigned to individual PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.2/2">The level of expenditure on hospital and community dental services is decided at local level by PCTs. The tables show the most readily available core data on expenditure on GDS and PDS services for the Morecambe Bay PCT. The difference between gross and net expenditure is the contribution to costs from dental charges collected directly from patients. As the notes explain, this data does not capture certain elements of GDS and PDS expenditure, and reliable local PDS data based on practice level details is only available from the financial year 2004&ndash;05. Full data for 2005&ndash;06 is not yet available.</p>

	<p pid="a.58W.5/1">Under the new dental service framework which took effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, primary care trusts (PCTs) received devolved budgets to support the commissioning of local primary dental services. These services were previously provided as general dental services (CDS), for which expenditure was demand-led, that is depending on the volume of national health service work that dentists chose to do, and personal dental services (PDS) pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.5/2">Allocations for 2006&ndash;07 were based on the costs of all GDS and PDS services delivered between October 2004 and September 2005 (the most recently available data for each area), adjusted where necessary to reflect the full year costs of newly opened contracts, together with provision for approved growth plans for local schemes proposed by PCTs. Appropriate upratings to fully reflect annual earnings adjustments as recommended by the doctors and dentists review body were also considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.5/3">These allocations reflected the commitment that all dentists previously providing NHS services were entitled to maintain their previous level of earnings in return for an agreed level of NHS commitment. This was intended to provide a smooth transition to the new contract arrangements and to provide a stable base for the future development of dental services.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.5/4">PCTs may direct additional funding to dentistry from their general NHS resources if they judge this to be an appropriate local priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.59W.5/2">The publication &quot;Ambulance and other patient transport services: Operation, use and performance standards&quot; provides guidance on the eligibility criteria for patient transport services (PTS) and is available in the Library. This document states that medical need for non-emergency patient transport must be determined by a doctor, dentist or midwife and will depend upon the medical condition of the individual patient, the availability of private or public transport and distance to be travelled. The principle which should apply is that each patient should be able to reach hospital in a reasonable time and in reasonable comfort, without detriment to their medical condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.59W.5/3">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for ensuring that there is provision of ambulance services, which could include patient transport services, to such extent as they consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. Therefore, it is for the local national health service to decide who provides patient transport services for eligible patients in their area. PCTs should apply the principles outlined in the aforementioned publication to consider each case on its merits or to develop local criteria for patient transport services use. The White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot; signals our intent to broaden eligibility to patients referred for treatment in and out of hospital settings and during 2006&ndash;07 we will update guidance on eligibility for PTS to reflect the changes outlined in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.59W.5/4">PCTs are responsible for ensuring that patients who travel to receive their traditional hospital care receive reimbursement of reasonable travel expenses where the patient can prove they require financial assistance. &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot; also signals our intent to extend eligibility for the hospital travel costs scheme (HTCS) to include people who are referred by a health care professional for treatment in a primary care setting, providing that they meet the existing low-income criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.59W.5/5">For 2004&ndash;05, NHS ambulance trust expenditure on non-emergency PTS was approximately &pound;228 million. Itemised data on expenditure by other NHS organisations on non-emergency patient transport is not available centrally. Information on HTCS expenditure is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.65W.9/2">The Home Secretary regularly discusses illegal immigration with his EU counterparts. Since January 2005, he has attended numerous meetings, specifically eight EU Justice and Home Affairs Councils at which this issue has been raised. In addition, he has also had numerous bilateral meetings with his EU counterparts, in smaller groups, and non EU counterparts in the margins of these meetings and in visits they have made to the UK at which discussion of illegal immigration has played a prominent part. More particularly during the UK Presidency in the second half of 2005, he ensured that specific EU attention was given to illegal immigration including organised immigration crime. An EU action plan on human trafficking was agreed as well as a new approach to migration, both legal and illegal, with partner countries and regions, in particular Africa, which the European Council endorsed. Implementation of both of these programmes of work has begun and the UK is playing its full part in ensuring the EU delivers against the commitments made. The presidency also focused on measures to strengthen the EU's borders and, as part of work to strengthen the security of EU travel documents, reached intergovernmental agreement on non-binding common minimum security standards and issuing procedures in ID cards.</p>

The replacement Statement of Changes included all of the key policy changes in the previous statement, but with a couple of minor amendments. As explained in the Explanatory Memorandum, there were two main amendments that needed to be made. These were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.68W.6/2" class="indent">The existing arrangement was preserved whereby applicants coming to the UK under ancestry provisions are given leave to enter for the entirety of the settlement qualifying period rather than being granted one period of two years and having to apply for a three-year extension before qualifying for settlement (as required in the first statement);</p>
	<p pid="a.68W.6/3" class="indent">Prospective students hoping to remain in the UK as a student must obtain an entry clearance prior to entry (this requirement was inadvertently omitted from the first statement); since the statement was being re-laid, we took the opportunity to clarify the provisions for postgraduate doctors and dentist to make it clear that an applicant seeking leave to enter in this capacity need not have completed their degree in the previous 12 months if they have been granted leave in this capacity on an earlier occasion.</p>

The power to withdraw driving licences was brought into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-02">2 April 2001</phrase> (under the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000). If the non-resident parent is found guilty of willful refusal or culpable neglect the court will decide which of the available sanctions is the most appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/5" class="indent">Prior to the Secretary of State making an application to the court, a warning letter is issued to the non-resident parent advising of the intention to apply to the courts for committal to prison or disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/6" class="indent">During the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> the Agency issued 1,155 warning letters to non-resident parents. Of these it was necessary to make 920 applications to court for committal or disqualification proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/7" class="indent">The information provided below relates to the number of cases for which applications were made to court for committal or disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence proceedings. These numbers may include multiple actions against individual non-resident parents who continually fail to pay. Therefore, although several applications can be made in respect of individual debts the Court will incorporate these into the same hearing with one outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/8" class="indent">The following table details the number of cases referred to court and the outcomes for committal and disqualification proceedings over the same period.</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="a.71W.0/21">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/22">1. Of the 920 cases prepared for court with an initial hearing date set, in a small number of hearings, the actual hearing date will occur after <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.0/23">2. The fact that the number of suspensions and actual penalties is less than half the number of referrals is explained by the number of debtors who enter into agreements to pay rather than attend court. Similarly, only a very small number of debtors actually go to prison or lose their driving licences because the courts normally suspend a sentence on condition that the defendant commits to pay.</p>

We have also increased the availability of carer's allowance by abolishing, in 2002, the age limit which precluded carers aged 65 and over from claiming carer's allowance. This change also gives older carers access to the additional amount for carers in pension credit. By linking the carer's allowance earnings limit to the level of the national insurance lower earnings limit , we have significantly increased the amount carers entitled to the benefit can earn from paid employment.</p>

The report proposes a new model for delivering services to older people based on the Sure Start model for children and families.

	<p pid="a.85W.2/1">The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 (IMD 2004) was constructed at lower layer super output area (SOA) level and not at ward level. The new geographical unit was introduced to overcome the problems associated with wards&mdash;frequent boundary changes and differences in population sizes. With an average population of 1,500 people, SOAs are far better than wards at picking up small pockets of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.85W.2/2">The following table includes the list of SOAs in Yeovil constituency and Somerset that fall within the 30 per cent. most deprived SOAs in England. The data shows that of the 74 SOAs in Yeovil constituency only seven (9.5 per cent.) fall within the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged SOAs in England and all seven of these are located in the borough of South Somerset. In total there are 327 SOAs in the local authorities that make up Somerset (including Yeovil). Of these 40 (12 per cent.) are among the 30 per cent. most deprived in England. The most deprived SOA (EO1029106) is located in Bridgwater Sydenham in Sedgemoor.</p>

	<p pid="a.91W.2/1">Outside of Neighbourhood Renewal Fund areas local strategic partnerships are currently voluntary partnerships governed by non-statutory guidance issued in 2001, as such there is no requirement for the partnership collectively to report verbally or in writing to the local authority or a centrally-specified formal mechanism for local councillors to put <i>(a)</i> oral and <i>(b)</i> written questions to the local strategic partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.2/2">The 2001 guidance 'Local Strategic Partnerships' states that</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.2/3" class="indent">'Individual local authorities working within LSPs need to determine which elected members are involved and what role they should play'.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.2/4">The guidance also states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.2/5" class="indent">'It should be ensured that councillors are properly included in the process'.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.2/6">It is therefore for each area to determine the way in which LSPs and councillors interact.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.2/7">The local Government Act 2000 provides for a code of conduct to apply to members and co-opted members of every relevant authority. The Standards Board of England policies this code. Non-local authority members would conduct themselves with reference to their own professional or corporate code of conduct and comply with any advice that accompanies this.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.2/8">We have recently consulted on the future role of LSPs and are considering responses to this.</p>
