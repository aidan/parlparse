Although it is no longer a statutory requirement to notify the presence of Varroa, it poses a major threat to beekeepers. However, it can be kept under control with appropriate treatments and hive management techniques. The National Bee Unit provides written material on Varroa management (available on their Beebase website) and issues advice to beekeepers both through comprehensive training sessions on effective management of Varroa and when visiting individual beekeepers.</p>
	<p pid="c.171W.8/3">Other damaging parasites affecting honey bees include Nosema and Tracheal mites. Limited survey work has shown that two species of Nosema&mdash;N. apis and N. ceranae&mdash;are present in the UK. They have been found in widely dispersed locations. Tracheal mite is also widespread.</p>

To do so would be counterproductive in terms of direct environmental impact, and would conflict with our objective of phasing out all single use bags, whether made from plastic or paper. While paper bags are derived from a renewable resource, their manufacturing process is resource intensive. Considerable quantities of oil are used, particularly for the extraction of wood pulp. Paper bags are also heavier than plastic bags and therefore require more energy to transport, resulting in greater emissions.</p>

	<p pid="c.175W.16/19" class="indent">As you are aware, entitlement to an AFPS 75 widow's non-attributable pension ceases in the event of remarriage or cohabitation and the onus is on individuals to notify the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) should there be a change in their personal circumstances. This is a compulsory requirement to comply with the AFPS 75 scheme rules.</p>
	<p pid="c.175W.16/20" class="indent">Contrary to these statistics representing a saving to the defence budget, I should point out that costs would have been incurred if these spouses' pensions had not ceased on re-marriage or cohabitation. The estimated capitalised cost of paying back payments (plus interest) to those individuals represented in the table, whose pensions were ceased, as well as the cost of paying those pensions in future would be around &pound;150 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.175W.16/21" class="indent">The capitalised cost of removing the cessation condition completely for the future would be between &pound;70 million and &pound;350 million. The reason for the range in figures is that the AFPS 75 statistics are not consistent with the UK population remarriage statistics. This could be due to a reduction in the reporting of remarriage and cohabitation in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="c.175W.16/22" class="indent">I am sorry that it has taken so long to provide a substantive reply, but it has required a bespoke exercise to be conducted to generate sufficient data for the scheme actuary to be able to analyse.</p>

	<p pid="c.177W.2/1">The Army does not actively recruit overseas with the exception of Gurkhas from Nepal. Any Commonwealth or Irish citizen residing overseas who wishes to apply to join the Army must travel to the UK at their own expense to undergo the selection process. However, in recent years the Army has sent selection teams to some Commonwealth countries at the specific request of the government concerned, and even then only when evidence suggests that there is sufficient interest among the local population to merit a visit. The selection teams screen out those who are not thought capable of meeting the full entry standards, to save them the cost of an abortive trip to the UK to undergo the recruitment selection process. The selection team will only see those who have made an application to the Overseas Cell of the Army's Recruiting Group.</p>
	<p pid="c.177W.2/2">Since 1997 Army Overseas Selection Teams have visited Fiji 10 times, St Vincent and the Grenadines three times and St Lucia twice. In addition a team has this month just commenced a visit to St Lucia and Belize.</p>

	<p pid="c.177W.8/1">As a result of temporary disruption due to flooding at AWE Burghfield, the nuclear site licensee, AWE plc, took a decision not to undertake live nuclear working while remedial work was undertaken. This decision was taken on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July 2007</phrase>, in consultation with the nuclear installations inspectorate (NII) and with Ministry of Defence officials, and was consistent with our planned operational programmes. Precise details on these programmes, including live working dates, are being withheld for the purposes of safeguarding national security.</p>
	<p pid="c.177W.8/2">While necessary work to repair flood damage was ongoing, the opportunity was taken to maximise completion of existing work identified from AWE's routine Periodic Review of Safety (PRS), as a parallel activity. Work varied in different facilities, examples include: replacing floors, plasterwork and doors; replacing electrical equipment; mechanical, electrical and lighting improvements and new vacuum and compressed air systems. Live working has already resumed. Facilities have been subject to rigorous scrutiny through AWE plc's governance process with inspection by, and authority from, the NII.</p>
	<p pid="c.177W.8/3">Ministry of Defence officials maintain a constant dialogue with AWE plc and NII colleagues have been consulted throughout. The disruption did not have an adverse effect on the UK deterrent programme, and AWE Burghfield maintains its capability to support the deterrent safely under highly regulated arrangements.</p>

These targets recognised the lower baseline figure from which the MOD were working, but remained both meaningful and stretching.</p>

	<p pid="c.182W.2/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Derek Twigg to Andrew Murrison:</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.2/3" class="indent">You may recall that I wrote to you on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April</phrase> (ref: D/US of S/DT MC02052/2008) in reply to your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-02">2 April</phrase> (ref: AM/JCP/29/020408) enclosing one from your constituent, Ms K Eastwood of 17 Bush Court, Priors Road, Prestbury, Cheltenham who expressed her concern about the proposed relocation of the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) from Innsworth to Gosport and Norcross.</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.2/4" class="indent">As you will be aware from my letter to you on this issue, I undertook to write to you once I had made my decision. I trust you will also accept this as my written reply to your written questions ref 204670,204676, 204677 and 204678.</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.2/5" class="indent">I have considered carefully all of the issues surrounding the options outlined within the Future Accommodation Study (FAS) for the relocation of the SPVA functions from Innsworth, and have decided that SPVA should retain a four site structure based at Centurion Building, Gosport, Tomlinson House, Norcross, Kentigern House, Glasgow and Building 247, Innsworth (i.e. Option One under the FAS).</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.2/6" class="indent">While I recognise that there would be business benefits in the medium term to be gained from moving the SPVA functions currently undertaken at Innsworth, I consider that the risks associated with moving the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre and the MOD Medal Office at this time, given the vital role and the excellent service they provide, to outweigh these benefits. Therefore, I have decided that, on balance, those functions currently undertaken at SPVA Innsworth should remain there for the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p pid="c.192W.5/1">The criteria that are used to set electronic speed advisory signs on the motorway are contained in the Policy and Procedures for the use of matrix signals by the Regional Control Centres which has been agreed between the Highways Agency (HA) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). These signs can be set automatically by the system software or manually by the HA Regional Control Centre staff (RCC). The decision to set signals should be based on the information available and is the responsibility of the officer (Traffic Officer or police in charge of the incident at the scene) or the operator in the control room. Where an advisory speed limit sign is set manually by the operator, the decision on the advisory speed displayed is based upon information received from a number of sources including CCTV, traffic officers and police at the scene.</p>

	<p pid="c.196W.4/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-19">19 May</phrase>, the Government launched the first major advertising campaign to raise awareness about units and to help people to estimate how much alcohol they drink. The Government will spend &pound;10 million this year on national alcohol campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.4/2">The units strand of the Know Your Limits campaign includes a series of adverts on television, radio, billboards and press. A new online calculator can be downloaded to help people add up the units in their drinks. There are free materials, including posters and leaflets.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.4/3">The inclusion of unit content and sensible drinking advice on most drinks labels by the end of 2008, by agreement with the alcohol industry, will also raise awareness of units and health risks.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.4/4">The &quot;Drinking: adults' behaviour and knowledge in 2007&quot; report is based on information collected by the Office for National Statistics Omnibus survey covering adults in the United Kingdom. The latest report published in January is the seventh in a series and includes information on peoples' knowledge of alcohol units and benchmarks (the sensible drinking guidelines on regular daily intake), their awareness of unit labelling, what people drink, where and with whom and whether they had discussed drinking with a medical professional.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.4/5">The report found that in Great Britain in 2007, 85 per cent. of adults had heard of measuring alcohol consumption in units, compared with 79 per cent. in 1997. It also found that there has been an increase from 54 per cent. in 1997 to 69 per cent. in 2007 in the proportion of adults who had heard of the sensible drinking guidelines on regular daily intake. In 2007, around 40 per cent. of these adults did not know what the benchmarks were.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.4/6">The Government commissioned a YouGov poll to inform the new alcohol units campaign described above. The YouGov poll shows that the majority of men (78 per cent.) and women (76 per cent.) do not know how many units are in a large glass of wine and that 56 per cent. of men and 60 per cent. of women do not know how many units are in a double gin and tonic.</p>

	<p pid="c.197W.8/1">One of the most successful exploitations of adult stem cells to date has been in the use of bone marrow transplantation for a variety of conditions including leukaemia and lymphoma. More than 2,500 bone marrow transplantations are performed each year in the United Kingdom. More recently, cord blood stem cells have been used as an alternative source of stem cells. In the past three years, the NHS Cord Blood Bank has issued both unrelated and directed cord blood units to treat 115 patients and these numbers continue to grow annually.</p>

	<p pid="c.206W.8/1">Since 1997 the Government have introduced a number of policies to make work pay and help working families.</p>
	<p pid="c.206W.8/2">The working tax credit (WTC) provides financial support on top of earnings, and together with the national minimum wage (NMW) helps to improve work incentives and relieve in-work poverty. The child care element of WTC improves the financial rewards for parents from work, and gives them the financial flexibility to choose the child care arrangements that are most appropriate for their families. It offers low-to-moderate-income families support with up to 80 per cent. of child care costs up to a limit of &pound;300 per week for two or more children. In addition, families in work are eligible for the child tax credit. Taken together, these policies mean that form October 2008, the guaranteed minimum income for a family with one child working full-time will be &pound;292 a week.</p>
	<p pid="c.206W.8/3">The Government are committed to helping parents balance work and family life, including introducing enhanced maternity, paternity and adoption leave, the right for parents to request flexible working.</p>
	<p pid="c.206W.8/4">The Government are also trialing new ways of ensuring that work pays. From October 2008 the Government will pilot a new better off in work credit which will reassure long-term recipients of incapacity benefit (ESA on its introduction), income support, or jobseeker's allowance that if they enter full-time work they will have an in work income, including any in work benefits or tax credits, of at least &pound;25 per week more than they receive from their out of work benefits.</p>

The regime requires avoidance promoters to provide HMRC with details of schemes that fall within certain descriptions within five days of them being made available or implemented. It does not incorporate any acceptance or rejection type process. A disclosure would only be declined if it were made in error, for example if it concerned matters outside the scope of the disclosure regime.</p>

Information on the number of households disputing an overpayment is not available before August 2006 but for information relating to the number of disputes received and cases written off for 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, I refer the hon.

	<p pid="c.212W.5/1">When seeking to recover any of the debts for which it is responsible, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has a duty to strike a balance between a customer's ability to pay and its responsibility to recover monies properly owing to the Exchequer.</p>

	<p pid="c.212W.5/5">Where immediate, full payment is likely to cause the customer financial hardship, HMRC will normally reach an agreement to recover the debt over a longer period, usually 12 months. Where it is clear that a customer will still not be able to repay through such a staged arrangement, because they have little disposable income or assets, HMRC will normally suspend recovery but review the customer's circumstances at a later date to see if it would be possible to restart recovery because their financial circumstances have improved. Where it seems that a customer's financial circumstances are unlikely to change, for example because they are on long-term benefit or are seriously ill, HMRC will remit the debt.</p>

	<p pid="c.213W.6/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the chief executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how much unpaid maintenance was owed by the Child Support Agency to parents with care in each quarter since 2005; how much has been written off in each year since 2005 as uncollectable; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/5" class="indent">Unpaid child maintenance is not owed by the Child Support Agency but by those parents who have failed to meet their responsibilities towards their children.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/6" class="indent">The Agency has increased the amount of child maintenance including arrears collected or arranged over the first two years of the Operational Improvement Plan, collecting a record-breaking &pound;1 billion in the year to March 2008. In addition internal Agency figures show that the rate at which child maintenance debt has been growing continues to reduce. In the year to March 2008 child maintenance debt grew at a rate of &pound;10 million a month, which is less than half the rate at which debt was growing in the year to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/7" class="indent">The amount of unpaid child maintenance owed at the end of each quarter for the period March 2005 to March 2008 is set out in the attached Table 1 including Agency internal figures for the year ending March 2008. This represents the total owed by parents, which has accrued over the 15 years of the Child Support Agency's operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/8" class="indent">The Agency does not have the power to write off debt and has never done so. The Agency does, however, undertake an annual Debt Analysis Exercise based on a sample of cases, to estimate the amount of debt assessed as collectable, and that which is deemed either possibly, or probably uncollectable. The results of this annual sample exercise are subject to review by the National Audit Office as part of their audit of the Agency's accounts, therefore the estimate for the year ending March 2008 will be published with the Agency's 2008 Annual Report and Accounts later this year. The latest annual estimate of the collectability of unpaid child maintenance information is also available in Table 22a of the Quarterly Summary of Statistics, and has been set out in the attached Table 2 for ease.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/9" class="indent">It should be noted that classing a debt as possibly or probably uncollectable does not mean the Agency will not take action in the future to collect any outstanding money. The Agency will continue to make every effort to ensure parents fulfil their financial responsibility to their children, to provide a stable foundation on which the new Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission can build.</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.6/10" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

Therefore the possibly uncollectable figures for 2004-05 and 2005-06 are based upon the provision in the accounts only, leading to an increase in collectable debt in these years.<br/> 6.

The Process is firmly embedded into the Department's governance regime and Gateway reviews are used as an integral part of the overall Assurance provision within the Department. Feedback from Senior Responsible Owners (for whom the reports are written) and project teams is that overwhelmingly they are extremely useful in helping the projects deliver their intended outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="c.221W.2/2">The Home Office controls the sale of sulphuric acid, together with other corrosive acids (formic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, nitric and phosphoric) under the Poisons Act 1972, included in Part II of the Poisons List. The purpose of the legislation is to allow the sale of commonly-used poisons whilst protecting the individual from their inherent dangers. The sale of Part II poisons are restricted to retail pharmacies and to businesses whose premises have been entered on to local authorities' lists as sellers of poisons (usually hardware stores, garden centres and the like).</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.2/3">The manufacture and sale of certain chemicals, that can be used in the production of illicit drugs, is controlled under EU legislation (Council Regulations (EC) Nos. 273/2004 and 111/2005) and effected through drug precursors regulations administered by the Home Office. Two of the chemicals under such control are sulphuric and hydrochloric acid, both commonly used as solvents in illicit production. Any company manufacturing or trading in either, and in quantities over 100kg a year, must be registered with the Home Office and exports to certain sensitive countries must be authorised.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.2/4">Additionally, when hazardous chemicals, including sulphuric acid and other corrosive substances are sold, the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002 places a requirement on suppliers to package such chemicals safely and label properly so that information is provided on the risks associated with these chemicals.</p>

	<p pid="c.221W.5/1">Details of the Government's proposed changes to benefit conditionally for lone parents, together with a set of draft regulations, were presented to the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-07">7 May 2008</phrase>. The Committee will shortly commence a public consultation exercise seeking views on the proposals from interested organisations before formally responding to the Secretary of State. After considering the SSAC report, the Government will respond on the arrangements for lone parents, including those who educate their children at home.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.5/2">In the documentation provided to SSAC, the Government outlined their proposals on lone parents who educate their children at home. While recognising that lone parents can choose to do so, it is not the purpose of income support to fund them to educate their children at home. Therefore, the Government consider that they should be required to look for paid work when their youngest child reaches the relevant threshold age.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.5/3">Lone parents who educate their children at home and who apply for jobseeker's allowance will need to fit in their home education activities around their obligations to look for work. Unlike lone parents who send their children to school, lone parents who choose to educate their children at home do not have to observe school hours, days or terms and may have greater flexibility to fit paid work around their children's education.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.5/4">They may, however, need to find alternative care for their children when they undertake work related activities or take up a job. The draft regulations presented to SSAC also include an amendment to allow Jobcentre Plus advisers additional discretion so that a lone parent claiming or receiving jobseeker's allowance will not be penalised if they cannot access appropriate and affordable child care.</p>

This change meant that claimants have 72 hours to lodge a JR where removal directions are set but we are no longer required to defer removals simply on the threat of judicial review; claimants must also lodge full grounds of challenge.

However following the opening of 2 Marsham Street in 2005 &pound;122,000 was spent on the provision of internal art for the new building. This demonstrated the Department's support for UK arts. The developer had direct responsibility for the costs of the external art strategy, the cost of which is included in the combined PFI charge for the building.</p>

	<p pid="c.226W.8/1">The Ministry of Justice has published two annual reports containing statistical information on freedom of information requests received by monitored bodies (including central Government Departments) in 2005 and 2006. These reports can be found at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.8/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.226W.8/3">The 2007 annual report is currently being drafted for publication in June 2008. However, statistics on requests received in each quarter of 2007 have been published and can be found via the MOJ website:</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.8/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.226W.8/5">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.8/6">The published reports provide statistics on the number of &quot;non-routine&quot; requests received during each period where: an initial response was provided within 20 working days; an initial response was given outside this time but a public interest test extension had been applied; an initial response was given outside this time and no public interest test extension was applied, and where no initial response had been given at the time the statistics were collected.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.8/7">The 2006 annual report provides statistics on the duration of the public interest test extensions in that year. Corresponding statistics for 2007 will be available when the 2007 annual report is published.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.8/8">Information requests where deadlines were extended beyond 40 days is not collected in the form requested; however the proportion of resolvable requests the Department answered &quot;in time&quot; (i.e. meeting the deadline or with a permitted extension) in 2007 was 87 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.8/9">For 2005 and 2006, the reports show the number of requests received by the Department which were withheld, either in full or in part, where an FOI exemption or EIR exception was applied. For 2007, the number of such requests was 333, based on aggregated quarterly statistics from 2007. Requests withheld solely under the exemption applicable to &quot;information available by other means&quot; are not included; statistics on these are not collected centrally because they are dealt with as routine business.</p>

We said in our consultation paper on visitors, published last December, that we are committed to the protection of those who are exploited when they are in the UK. We are currently conducting research and analysis in respect of the current provisions for overseas domestic workers. In light of the research findings we will consider, with interested parties, how best to achieve protection for any person who is found to be a victim of trafficking, irrespective of how they entered the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.234W.0/1">The proposals for the levels of fees for the Early Years Register and the compulsory part of the Ofsted Childcare Register from September 2008 were set out in the consultation&mdash;Childcare Act 2006: Future Approach to Fees and Subsidies and the accompanying impact assessment. The consultation exercise ended on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February</phrase> and we received 3,639 written responses. The Government response to the consultation will be published shortly alongside decisions on fee levels for 2008 and the approach to fee setting in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="c.234W.0/2">As we made clear in the consultation document and impact assessment, our proposals are designed to give effective, locally managed support to the child care sector so that parents and children can have the child care that they need. We proposed that new targeted support arrangements would be administered by local authorities as part of their new child care sufficiency duty. There is no reduction in subsidy under our proposals. The proposal was that we move from a national blanket 100 per cent. subsidy to an arrangement where some funding is available for local decisions about how best to use the money to respond to local market conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.234W.0/3">During the consultation, we met with many key stakeholders from the child care sector including representative organisations and local authorities, whose views are being taken into account as we analyse the responses to the consultation and make decisions.</p>

	<p pid="c.240W.2/1">This is a deep-rooted and intransigent problem which will require action on a number of fronts and we do not have evidence of the impact of Connexions in isolation. The Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Select Committee report: &quot;Jobs for the Girls: Two Years On&quot;, published in February this year, recognised that progress had been made but stressed the importance of careers advice and work experience in achieving our gender equality aims&mdash;recommending that more resource should be allocated to this.</p>
	<p pid="c.240W.2/2">We know, therefore that there is much more to be done and we are planning a range of measures which will make clear our expectations on countering gender stereotyping and seek to embed good practice. Connexions services will continue to play a key role. From April of this year local authorities will commission and manage local information, advice and guidance services. The new Quality Standards for young people's information, advice and guidance published last autumn set out our expectations of the services that will be delivered&mdash;including emphasising the importance of challenging gender stereotypes and limited career aspirations.</p>

	<p pid="c.241W.2/2">This Department is currently working with six local authorities who are accelerating progress to implement a single funding formula in April 2009. This project will contribute to good practice guidance. Initial guidance drawn from the experience of these authorities was issued to all local authorities in March and further comprehensive guidance will be distributed this summer. Our expectation is that local authorities will be responsible for developing their own formulas and for issuing guidance to early years providers as part of the implementation process.</p>

	<p pid="c.241W.5/1">The requirements of the National Curriculum for physical education (PE) are compulsory for all pupils aged five to 16. This includes blind and partially-sighted pupils. The statutory documents for PE set out an inclusion statement which requires schools to adapt their provision so that it is appropriate for the pupils being taught. These enable schools to adapt their PE and sporting provision in order to: set suitable learning challenges; respond to pupils' diverse learning needs; and overcome potential barriers to learning for individual pupils or for groups of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.5/2">The PE and School Sport Professional Development Programme includes resources and materials which help teachers to improve the inclusive nature of their PE and sporting provision. The training is free to all schools and, since 2006, over 1,300 resources have been accessed by teachers wanting to improve in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.5/3">Equity is also imbedded within the national PE and Sport Strategy for Young People, which is creating a five hours of sport offer for all five to 16-year-olds. Blind and partially-sighted children will benefit from the network of 450 multi-sport disability clubs that will be created through this.</p>

This supports all settings to plan play, activities and experiences that can help all children to make progress in their development and learning.

	<p pid="c.253W.2/1">According to available data (the government of India National Sample Survey 2004-05) there are 70 million child labourers in India or a quarter of all child labourers in the world. A large proportion of India's child labourers are Dalit (formerly &quot;untouchables&quot;) and Adivasi (tribal) children. The majority of working children live in rural areas, with over 80 per cent. of them employed in agricultural and non-formal sectors and many in bonded labour.</p>
	<p pid="c.253W.2/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports the government of India and other partners to protect children in India. For example, DFID India supports the government's flagship programme for universal elementary education, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). Studies of child migrant labourers have found that discouragement at school was one of the factors that pushed children into work. Increasing enrolment, retention and reducing drop out rates are central to the SSA programme, which has also pioneered &quot;bridge schools&quot; designed to bring working children back into mainstream education. DFID India's strategic partnership with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) is contributing directly to the elimination of child labour in Andhra Pradesh. The project has been successful in helping government of Andhra Pradesh to reduce the number of child labourers in the state from 1.3 million to 0.2 million by 2007. Working with government, civil society, employers and trade unions an innovative model for reducing child labour in urban areas has been developed and is now being promoted nationally by the ILO.</p>

	<p pid="c.254W.3/2">UK energy policy is based on a market approach. With rising fossil fuel (oil, gas and coal) prices, which also feed into the price of electricity, there is every incentive for businesses to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels themselves without Government intervention. However, in the context of our climate change policy, the Government are taking a large number of actions that will reduce the UK's dependence on fossil fuel-based energy. These include:</p>

	<p pid="c.254W.3/7" class="indent">Installation of smart meters in businesses thereby allowing them to have more direct control over the energy spending and therefore dependency on fossil fuels; and</p>

	<p pid="c.278W.5/1">The Government asked Lord Carter of Coles to lead an independent review of legal aid remuneration. He reported in July 2006 and the Government accepted his recommendation. Some fees to Counsel were reduced and others increased. The net effect was a 9 per cent. increase in fees paid for defence advocacy services. As a result, while prosecution and defence fees had previously been broadly aligned, there is now a disparity between prosecution and defence fees. Prosecution fees are higher than defence fees in the longer, more complex cases, while defence fees are higher in the higher volume of shorter cases in the Crown court.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.5/2">The appropriate fees for counsel undertaking prosecution work is a matter for the Attorney-General and the Crown Prosecution Service. However, I am aware that discussions are proceeding between the CPS and the Bar Council about possible ways of redistributing current expenditure on prosecution fees to reduce the disparity.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.5/3">I do not believe that absolute parity between legal aid and prosecution rates is essential for several reasons as the CPS is not purchasing the same services from the self employed Bar as the Legal Service's Commission purchases through legal aid. The CPS as litigators have much greater control over the work undertaken by self employed barristers. Much of the CPS ancillary work and preparatory work more generally, can be undertaken by in house litigators and by Higher Court Advocates.</p>

	<p pid="c.280W.8/1">The responsibility for judicial training lies with the Lord Chief Justice as head of the judiciary and is exercised through the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Maurice Kay.</p>
	<p pid="c.280W.8/2">Sentencing is a judicial function and judges and magistrates are responsible for making decisions in individual cases, subject to the statutory framework laid down by Parliament. All those who pass sentence will also consider relevant case law, Court of Appeal decisions and sentencing guidelines. Because of the independent nature of sentencing, training for both judges and magistrates seeks to promote a consistent approach to decision making, and uses sentencing exercises to give judges the opportunity to discuss the issues involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.280W.8/3">Responsibility for issuing sentencing guidelines rests with the Sentencing Guidelines Council, not the Government. The Council was set up under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and is an independent body chaired by the Lord Chief Justice. In framing or revising sentencing guidelines the Council must have regard to the need to promote consistency in sentencing. The guidelines are binding on all courts&mdash;who must give reasons if they depart from the guidelines&mdash;and enable them to approach the sentencing of offenders from a common starting point in all criminal cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.280W.8/4">In response to Lord Carter's review of the use of custody, the Sentencing Commission Working Group was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Gage to consider the advantages, disadvantages and feasibility of a structured sentencing framework and permanent Sentencing Commission.

However, the study 'Mental Health Needs and Effectiveness of Provision for Young Offenders in Custody and in the Community' (Professor Richard Harrington and Professor Sue Bailey, Youth Justice Board for England and Wales 2005), identified 23 per cent. of young offenders as having learning difficulties, that is having an IQ of 70 or less.</p>

	<p pid="c.282W.5/1">The under-18 unit at Thorn Cross Young Offender Institution showed the possible benefits of open conditions for some young people, but also demonstrated that a single large unit is not viable. Nor is a single unit drawing young people from the whole of England and Wales consistent with the Youth Justice Board's general aim of placing young people as close as possible to their homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.282W.5/2">The Youth Justice Board is developing a strategy for the provision, across the country, of open accommodation for young people in custody. It is likely that this will be linked to existing closed establishments.</p>
