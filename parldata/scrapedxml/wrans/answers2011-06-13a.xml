This is irrespective of any consent given by the participant or by a parent, guardian or other person over the age of 18 in loco parentis. As well as this, programmes must not include material (whether in individual programmes or in programmes taken together) which, taking into account the context, condones or glamorises violent, dangerous or seriously antisocial behaviour and is likely to encourage others to copy such behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.6/1">The number of teachers that schools employ in future years will, as now, be a matter for them to decide, according to local needs and subject to statutory requirements on class sizes where appropriate. For funding purposes, the Department has produced overall estimates of teaching posts in state schools and academies in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.6/2">The Government do not produce estimates of the future numbers of teaching posts in particular subjects. Estimates of the proportion of teachers working in secondary schools who will be qualified in different subjects are however produced as part of the Department for Education's teacher supply and demand modelling process. These estimates, broken down by subject, are not currently made for teachers working in primary schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.6/3">The latest School Workforce Census data indicates there are around 13,200 art teachers in state funded secondary schools. Of these, around 11,400 hold a relevant post A-level qualification. Estimates for the future number of specialist art teachers in state funded secondary schools indicate that there will be a decrease of around 100 to 200 teachers in each year. This is in line with a decreasing requirement for secondary teachers as a result of the ongoing decline in secondary pupil numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.556W.6/3">At present, this education only has to be full-time for those pupils who have been permanently excluded from school. We believe that all pupils who fall under section 19 should be entitled to full-time education, unless this is inappropriate for health reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.6/4">That is why we have taken measures to commence section 3A of the Children, Schools and Families Act 2010 from September 2011. This section redefined the section 19 duty, to the effect that the education should be full-time for all pupils in alternative provision, unless there are reasons which relate to the physical or mental health of the child which would mean that this would not be in the child's best interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.6/5">There is no duty upon local authorities to report the provision they make for the pupils who fall within the scope of section 19. We have no plans to require local authorities to provide this information.

	<p pid="a.560W.5/2">It is a crime to drop litter, and the offender can be prosecuted in a magistrates court and fined. Littering from a vehicle, especially when it is travelling at speed, presents particular difficulties for local authority enforcement officers in clearly identifying the offender.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/3">An amendment tabled during the Commons Report stage of the Localism Bill proposes to extend the scope of the current offence of littering to make the registered keeper of a vehicle criminally liable whether or not they were present or personally responsible for the littering. That approach raises serious concerns over fairness and proportionality.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/4">A key element in tackling litter is changing littering behaviour. That is why the Government are supporting, through their grant to the charity Keep Britain Tidy, the Love Where You Live campaign which draws together business, communities, local authorities and civil society organisations in partnership to secure a lasting change in behaviour. As part of this, we will be looking to work further with business and others to develop ways of tackling vehicle litter.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.5/5">Borough councils in London will shortly be able to use new powers acquired through a private Bill currently before Parliament to tackle vehicle littering by issuing a civil penalty. It makes sense for Government to seek to learn the lessons of that approach in London before considering further legislation in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.564W.8/1">The majority of funding for British Waterways comes from its commercial activities and through its licensing operations. During the last spending review period, grant contributed between 30% and 35% of British Waterways' revenue which is spent on the waterways in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.8/2">In the current, tough fiscal environment, the Government will give the new waterways charity the best possible start. It has already committed to transfer BW's commercial property portfolio and committed to long-term funding at the 2014-15 level (&#163;39 million) to 2022-23 inclusive. The terms and conditions of the funding will be subject to negotiation with the recently appointed trustees of the new waterways charity.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.8/3">Making British Waterways a charitable company creates new opportunities for growing income from private and commercial sources, making efficiencies and forming supportive partnerships. The charity will also be able to borrow against its assets and so expand income in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid="a.567W.6/4">Green Deal is a market-led product, so delivery will ultimately depend on sign-up by Green Deal providers and customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.6/5">The Department has been engaging closely with the finance and investment community regarding the provision of finance for Green Deal. Our engagement to date has suggested that the issue of securities backed by Green Deal payments may be one means of keeping the cost of finance low. Investors have told us that Green Deal backed securities, if created, would be, in principle, an attractive proposition which would increase diversity in the market for this type of investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.576W.7/2">The EU ETS directive also allows member states to compensate sectors at risk of carbon leakage as a result of the indirect costs of the EU ETS (i.e. increases in electricity prices arising from the EU ETS) subject to a revision of the state aid guidelines. The Government recently responded to the Commission consultation on changes to the guidelines. We will take a decision on whether the UK will offer compensation once the Commission has published the revised state aid guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.580W.2/1">I have discussed the new EU legislation on energy infrastructure, expected this autumn, with the Commission on a number of occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.2/2">The Trans-European Energy Network programme (TEN-E), which the new legislation will replace, has a small budget and provides modest early-stage funding to those electricity and gas projects which are considered important for EU energy security and market integration. The Government's view is that infrastructure investment should be primarily financed by the private sector and driven by commercial considerations. However, we acknowledge that there could be instances where market failures might justify the award of limited public funding for priority projects. It will, however, be important to ensure that criteria are agreed governing the award of any such funding so that it is properly targeted and does not displace commercial financing.</p>

	<p pid="a.582W.6/1">One of the primary objectives of the current review of feed-in tariffs is to ensure that the Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) scheme does not cost more to consumers than the amount set in last year's spending review (i.e. around &#163;900 million over the period 2010-11 to 2014-15 in nominal undiscounted prices). This includes a saving of &#163;40 million (around 10%) in 2014-15 compared with original projections carried out before the start of the scheme. It also represents a significant further saving compared with our estimation of likely spend in the absence of a review this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.595W.2/1">In the recent appraisal of the Intercity Express Programme, the reliability of the two train types is expected to be similarly high. Both train types offer a substantial improvement in reliability when compared to the existing older stock, and the contractual structure of the IEP is designed to ensure that manufacturers and maintainers are heavily incentivised to provide a reliable service.</p>

	<p pid="a.595W.5/1">The Government's main priority is to ensure the safety of aircraft and air passengers. We are also working to improve agreed international procedures for mitigating the potential hazards caused by volcanic ash. Following the eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in April 2010, the UK has taken a number of additional steps to minimise disruption to passengers and airlines.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.5/2">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has worked closely with manufacturers and airlines to develop a better shared understanding of the ability of aircraft and their engines to tolerate volcanic ash. The CAA has issued revised guidance that enables airlines to operate in the medium and high ash concentration zones, provided an acceptable safety case exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.5/3">The Government are also supporting the provision of new radar cover in Iceland to obtain more accurate data in the event of a future eruption and also the establishment of a permanent civil contingency aircraft for use by the Met Office to conduct atmospheric testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.5/4">The impact of the Grimsvotn eruption in May 2011 was significantly less than last year's Eyjafjallajokull eruption. However, a number of further steps have been taken to address the lessons learned. The Government have established a Volcanic Ash Observations Group under the chairmanship of Sir John Beddington to look at ways of improving the input data for the Met Office volcanic ash dispersion model. In addition, the CAA has established a Volcanic Ash Advisory Group to improve the process for establishing high concentration danger zones.</p>

	<p pid="a.598W.5/1">Local authorities incur costs when providing statutory assistance to homeless households as a result of the need to administer applications and secure temporary accommodation. Net current expenditure on homelessness administration by local authorities in England totalled &#163;205 million in 2009-10. On top of this local authorities incurred costs of &#163;40 million providing temporary accommodation. (DCLG, local authority revenue expenditure and financing statistics)</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.5/2">In the same year 40,020 households were accepted as owed the main homelessness duty. At the end of March 2010, 51,310 households were in temporary accommodation. (DCLG, Live Tables 770 and 777)</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.5/3">However, these two sets of figures cannot be used to accurately calculate the average cost of homeless acceptances to local authorities because they are not directly comparable. For instance, some expenditure on homelessness administration will have been incurred as a result of providing non-statutory assistance to households at risk of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.5/4">Taxpayers also incur costs from statutory homelessness as a result of housing benefit expenditure on households living in temporary accommodation. Temporary accommodation is usually slightly more expensive in housing benefit terms than comparable private rented accommodation (reflecting higher management costs).</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.5/5">However, not enough is known about the circumstances of households accepted as homeless or local market rental conditions to specify exactly how much more is spent on Housing Benefit as a result of statutory homelessness.</p>

	<p pid="a.599W.2/1">While the Homes and Communities Agency does not have specific targets, all providers bidding for funding to the Agency's Affordable Homes programme are required to submit an Employment and Skills Statement. Encouraging providers to support delivery of new jobs in this way is in line with this Government's belief that delivery is best optimised by reducing bureaucratic burdens and top-down targets to free up local partners, the private and the voluntary sectors to drive growth and opportunity. As result of the Homes and Communities Agency's investment programme, around 2,700 apprenticeships were created or safeguarded in 2010-11. A break-down by year for 2009-10 is not available.</p>

We maintain this consistent policy because we believe that to make substantive concessions such as paying ransoms would reward the act of hostage-taking and encourage future kidnaps of British nationals. Although the payment of a ransom by a third party to a criminal gang is not illegal under UK law, the Government are firm that we do not, and will not, become involved in activity that could facilitate such a payment. Payment of a ransom to a United Nations designated terrorist group or individual would contravene the al-Qaeda and Taliban sanctions regime established by UN Security Resolution 1267 (1999).</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.11/1">The Ministry of Justice has commissioned Social Finance Ltd to run the Social Impact Bond at Peterborough prison for a maximum period of six years from September 2010. It will target three cohorts of short sentence prisoners, each containing around 1,000 offenders, one after the other. The length of each cohort will be dependent on the length of time required for 1,000 unique individuals to be released from Peterborough prison, up to a maximum of 24 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.11/2">The results from the final cohort are expected to be published in 2018, as a time-lag is required to assess the reconvictions of the offender cohorts.</p>

	<p pid="a.617W.9/1">The Government have no such plans. It is not possible to disaggregate UK aid spending for safe abortion from wider expenditure on areas such as reproductive health care, maternal and neonatal health and health personnel development. This is because the Department for International Development (DFID) works to improve access to effective and integrated health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.9/2">It is a major priority for the UK Government to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights, including access to modern family planning methods and promoting women's choice, in the developing world. Safe abortion reduces recourse to unsafe abortion and saves maternal lives. Each year 65-70,000 women die following unsafe abortion. DFID's policy position on safe abortion is set out in the practice paper &quot;Safe and unsafe abortion&quot;, which will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.618W.5/1">International food prices have increased significantly over the past nine months, reaching their highest levels since 1990, but the recent picture has been mixed. The Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO's) Food Price Index (FFPI) showed that a sharp increase in international grain prices in April more than offset declines in dairy, sugar and rice, while oils and meat prices were mostly unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.5/2">Local food prices follow global food markets, albeit with a slight time lag. Analysis of the domestic prices of staples in developing countries again shows a mixed picture. In Nigeria, prices of sorghum and maize in Kano, the main market of the country, rose by about 11% in March from the previous month. However, in Mozambique, prices of main staple maize declined markedly between March and April in all monitored markets reflecting the start of the 2011 harvest. In Malawi, prices of maize rose in March but are 50% below the levels of the previous year following the 2010 bumper crop and expectation of another good harvest in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.621W.0/1">The causes of volatility in international agricultural markets, and the appropriate policy response, are the subject of ongoing discussion across the different G20 formations.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.0/2">It is difficult to be definitive about the role of speculation in agricultural price spikes. Food supply and prices are affected by a number of factors including global energy prices, global stock levels, the size of harvests, changes in exchange rates and national agricultural trade and marketing policies. On balance we are sceptical about the degree to which speculation has played a significant causal role. The Government continues to monitor relevant research in this area with interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.0/3">It is also important to note that trading in commodities markets plays an important role in providing liquidity (the volume of trades being made in a market) in these markets and that liquidity is essential to the effective functioning of these markets. Against the backdrop of climate change, and the possibility that international agricultural prices may become more volatile over time, the role of agricultural futures and options markets, and the liquidity they rely on, become more important.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.0/4">Before any regulations are introduced it is important that there is a clear understanding of the associated costs and benefits. The Government would need to see a more detailed proposal from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development before they could comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.0/5">Information on the value of holdings in commodity index funds traded in the UK is not centrally collected.</p>

For some this reflected the intrinsically temporary nature of the original case. Others had been needed to monitor specific targets and policies that were no longer relevant.

	<p pid="a.636W.8/1">There is no simple solution to controlling antibiotic resistance. Appropriate prescribing to slow the emergence of resistant strains, good microbiological practice and surveillance to ensure detection and high standards of infection prevention and control practice, are all key steps to prevent the spread of these bacteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.8/2">&#8220;The Health and Social Care Act 2008 Code of Practice on the prevention and control of infections and related guidance&#8221; provides guidance. A copy has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.8/3">All organisations, including primary care, will use a number of specific measures to tackle antibiotic resistance. These measures include the use of antibiotic stewardship programmes to minimise the unnecessary use of antibiotics and thus reduce the selection pressure for resistance to develop accurate and prompt detection of resistant strains of bacteria and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screening to reduce the risk of onwards transmission in hospitals and other settings. The Department's expert Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection (ARHAI) undertake ongoing horizon scanning and advise on emerging problems: for example the committee recently issued guidance with the Health Protection Agency on the control of newer highly resistant carbapenemase producing bacteria such as those with New Delhi Metallo Beta Lactamase. The Department and ARHAI also actively promote good antibiotic prescribing.</p>

	<p pid="a.638W.2/1">In the European Union, genetically modified (GM) foods undergo a rigorous pre-market evaluation that includes the safety of components introduced into GM crops, such as Bt proteins. The safety of Bt proteins has also been assessed during the authorisation of pesticides that contain the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>. The assessment of the Bt proteins that are present in authorised GM foods is based on tests in animals and does not include human trials to examine whether the proteins pass into the blood supply. However, the available data from in vitro tests have shown that Bt proteins are rapidly broken down by digestive enzymes in the same way as most other proteins in the diet.</p>
	<p pid="a.638W.2/2">A Canadian publication has recently suggested that small amounts of one Bt protein may be present in human blood, at around one part per billion, although it is not clear whether the analytical methods that were used in this study were suitable for identifying and quantifying such low levels in human samples. If the finding is correct, the design of this study did not provide any evidence of the source of the protein, which is present in commercial pesticide preparations as well as in some GM crop varieties. The detection of trace levels of Bt proteins in people does not necessarily imply any risk to health.</p>

Decisions on administering simple cautions, reprimands and warnings must be made in accordance with the Director of Public Prosecution's Guidance on Charging. The police retain the authority to administer a simple caution, reprimand or warning in all cases, other than those involving indictable-only offences, where the matter must be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for a decision. Police officers can also take advice from the CPS at any stage in an investigation on whether a simple caution is appropriate, as set out in the Director's Guidance on Charging.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.2/1">Statistics relating to deaths from occupational diseases reported to have been caused or aggravated by workplace conditions since 2010 are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.664W.2/2">No single source of information provides a count of the number of people that have died from occupational illnesses. For some causes of death, occupational cases are clinically indistinguishable from those due to other factors. For these causes numbers have to be estimated rather than counted.</p>
	<p pid="a.664W.2/3">Research commissioned by HSE estimated that 8,019 cancer deaths in Great Britain in 2005 were attributable to exposures to carcinogens at work, and it is likely that a similar number would have occurred in subsequent years. This estimate includes deaths from the asbestos related cancer mesothelioma.</p>
	<p pid="a.664W.2/4">Using other international research, it is also estimated that there are currently approximately 4,000 deaths in Great Britain each year from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) due to past occupational exposures to dusts, gases, vapours and fumes. Again, it is likely that a similar number would have occurred in subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.664W.2/5">The number of deaths in Great Britain for 2008 (the latest year for which data are available) due to the small group of diseases that can be regarded as occupational on the basis of the cause of death alone are provided in table 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.664W.2/6">Most of the occupational diseases that cause death usually take many years to develop following occupational exposures. Estimates of current deaths therefore largely reflect industrial conditions of the past.</p>

	<p pid="a.665W.9/3">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what assessment has been made of the potential effect of the closure of Jobcentre Plus Benefit and Contact Centres in Liverpool, Huyton and Chester on (a) response times for replies to correspondence and (b) the quality of service provided to users. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.9/4">The closures of the Benefit and Contact Centres in Liverpool, Huyton and Chester should affect neither our correspondence response times nor the quality of the service that we provide to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.9/5">With regards the correspondence that we receive, Jobcentre Plus has clearly laid down service standards whereby a customer can expect a full response within 10 working days of us receiving the letter. We are also committed to responding to Members of Parliament writing to us on behalf of a customer within 15 working days.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.9/6">The rationalisation of our offices can be completed without impacting on the service, we offer to our customers. Our contact centre network is virtual, meaning that calls are routed to the next available agent no matter where they are in the country. Similarly, customers do not actually have direct contact with our benefit processing sites - telephone calls about benefit enquiries are dealt with in our contact centre network.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.9/7">Our business transformation is designed to respond to the changing ways that people seek to access, our services. Our online job search facility receives more than a million visits every day and our contact centres handle more than 230,000 calls every working day. People can now apply for Jobseeker's Allowance via the internet and more than 500,000 have done so. We are planning to build on these arrangements and introduce a range of new digital services that today's employers and customers expect, including online benefit tracking and enabling jobseekers to create online profiles which can then be matched to vacancies. We are also focused on continuing to modernise and develop our benefit centres to drive up productivity and value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.9/2">The aim is to maintain access to benefits for under-18s, including those with long-term health conditions, on broadly the same basis as now. Currently, 15-year-olds are not eligible for income-related employment and support allowance but 16 and 17-year-olds can receive it if they are assessed as having limited capability for work under the work capability assessment. We intend to follow a similar approach under universal credit and that benefit should be available to qualifying young people both in and out of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.9/3">Those aged 18 or over will be able to claim universal credit whether or not they have limited capability for work, providing they satisfy the other entitlement conditions. Under the Bill a basic condition of entitlement is that a person is not receiving education but there is scope to make exceptions in regulations. It is expected that these exceptions will maintain the current support that is available through the benefits and tax higher education.</p>

We are rolling out a range of new measures aimed at getting Britain working, including Work Clubs to help jobseekers share skills or experiences and the new enterprise allowance for those considering self-employment.

The legislation will still allow employers to use compulsory retirement ages, which can be earlier than 65 years, providing they can objectively justify it.</p>

We are committed to taking forward all of his recommendations. Most of these changes are already in place and we will implement the remainder by summer to coincide with the first work capability assessments of incapacity benefits claimants taking part in the full nationwide reassessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.9/3">Additionally, as part of his second independent annual review of the Work Capability Assessment, Professor Harrington has already asked a number of charities including the MS Society, Arthritis Care, Parkinsons UK, Colitis UK, Crohns and the National Aids Trust to look in detail at the Work Capability Assessment descriptors for fluctuating conditions.</p>
