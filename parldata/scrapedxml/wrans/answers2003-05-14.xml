	<p pid=".245W.9/1">The Strategic Rail Authority is currently undertaking a feasibility study on the proposal to re-open the Matlock to Buxton line. The study is expected to be completed in two stages. The first stage will look at options to re-instate the link that formerly existed. This is expected to be completed in September 2003. If the partners agree to continue, stage two would develop the preferred option in detail. Stage two will be completed in April 2004. The Strategic Rail Authority is also currently examining the case for reopening the section of line between Bicester and Bletchley for freight and diversionary purposes. This would potentially enable the introduction of passenger services on the eastern section of the route. For these projects to be taken forward, they would have to represent value for money and be affordable.</p>

From the same date, the Home Office changed its recruitment policy to allow the recruitment of staff up to the age of 64 subject to their meeting normal standards of health and provided that there is an expectation of a reasonable period of employment and return on recruitment and training.</p>

	<p pid=".256W.13/1">Redbridge receives funding from my Department to provide after school study support opportunities for young people in the area: &pound;284,859 this year through the Standards fund. We allow individual schools and local authorities the freedom to decide which activities best meet local needs. Study support can range from homework and study clubs to special-interest activities including the creative arts and ICT, and many of these take place after school.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.13/2">Redbridge has also received two grants totalling &pound;527,050 through the New Opportunities fund to provide out of school hours activities. The first grant targets approximately 10 schools in the Hainault and Loxford areas and the second has introduced activities into more than 15 other schools in the borough. Many of these activities take place after school, and include a Bollywood Dance Club, girls' football, and a zoology club.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.13/3">Redbridge has, in addition, been awarded &pound;795,343 by the New Opportunities fund for after-school childcare to date, and is on course to meet its DfES target of 1,387 places to be created before June 2003. It has also received an extra capital allocation of &pound;22,000.</p>

	<p pid=".258W.2/1">In introducing the new funding system in 2003&ndash;04, our aim has been to produce the best possible match between the distribution of funds and the differing circumstances and needs of pupils, schools and Local Education Authorities. It is our policy to ensure that the funding each authority receives reflects the needs of its pupils, and the cost of providing an education service.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.2/2">The new funding system comprises of a basic entitlement per pupil&mdash;the same everywhere, and a top ups for each pupil with additional educational needs&mdash;again the same everywhere. There are also top ups to reflect the higher costs of recruiting and retaining staff in some areas, and the higher costs of providing an education service in sparse areas. The top up for additional educational needs was informed by research conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers into the costs of providing for pupils with additional needs. The top ups for area costs are based on earning differentials from the labour force survey.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.2/3">These top ups mean that there are differences in what individual authorities receive. Those which have more deprived pupils and/or receive extra funding to take account of the high costs of recruiting and retaining staff in their area, receive a higher level of funding overall than those which have comparatively low levels of deprivation and/or do not receive additional funding for area costs.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.2/4">All LEAs have seen an increase in their Education Formula Spending Share of at least 3.2 per cent. per pupil in 2003&ndash;04, in addition to compensation for the bulk of the pension contribution increase and the transfer into EPS of nursery grant and class size grant. The increase for Worcestershire is somewhat more substantial at 4.1 per cent. This translates into an increase in Worcestershire's Education Formula Spending Share of 6.0 per cent. when pupil number changes are taken into account.</p>

	<p pid=".263W.11/1">Since 2000 the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU), under contract to Defra, has carried out a number of surveys to estimate the level of by-catch in UK fisheries. These surveys recorded for the offshore bass fishery 53 common dolphins caught in 116 hauls in 2001 and eight common dolphins caught in 66 hauls in 2002. However, by-catch information from other member states whose vessels operate in this fishery and elsewhere in UK waters is not available so it is not possible to produce reliable estimates of dolphin by-catch deaths in within the UK 200-mile limit. It is for this reason that I have been pressing the Commission for urgent action to widen observer coverage of EU fisheries and to bring forward proposals for positive action to reduce by-catch.</p>

We, and some other member states, have expressed concern that the current proposal to base eligibility on quota held at a date in the future has already given rise to speculation on the quota market. We have suggested that it should instead be based on quota held on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, and confined to active producers as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.6/2">No formal assessment has been made of the economic impact on the dairy industry, including the effects of quota speculation, of any delay in coming to a decision on the eligibility criteria for the premium. This would in any case be very difficult to determine, as its effect would vary enormously according to producers' individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.6/3">The earliest that a formal agreement will be reached on the dairy premium, along with the rest of the CAP reform package, will be the meeting of the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers on 11 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".266W.9/1">None. The nature of dry cleaning operations makes it difficult to capture 100 per cent. of the various solvent waste streams for recycling. The Solvent Emissions Directive (1999/13/EC) which aims at reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents from certain activities and installations, including dry cleaning operations, does not include specific requirements to ensure that a certain amount of the solvent waste stream should be recycled. Instead it controls releases from the operation of the dry cleaning process as a whole by controlling the maximum amount of solvent that can be emitted per unit mass of cleaned garments, that is emissions of waste gases and fugitive emissions to air, soil and water and solvents contained in any products.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.9/2">We intend to consult separately on proposals to include requirements on the operators to ensure that waste contaminated with solvents are recycled or disposed of by waste licensed contracts. This will be in line with existing waste management regimes. There are incentives within these proposals to encourage recovery of any residual solvent contained within the waste from dry cleaning operations.</p>

Of those personnel, the number deployed into Iraq varies daily, but is in the order of 12. In addition, some 50 civilians from other Government Departments have deployed, or are deploying into Iraq with the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance. The Coalition, including civilian personnel, will stay in Iraq only as long as is necessary to help the Iraqi people to build their own political institutions and reconstruct their country. It is too early to predict how long this is likely to take and therefore, how much the deployment of United Kingdom civilians to Iraq will cost.</p>

	<p pid=".272W.8/1">It is too early to gauge whether the Gulf conflict has had an impact on recruitment to the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines since the process can take a number of months from enquiry to entrance and any knock-on effect would not be evident until later in the year. No candidates have withdrawn enquiries or cancelled interviews as a stated consequence of the conflict and the flow of expressions of interest remains high.</p>
	<p pid=".272W.8/2">The number of enquiries and subsequent applications to join the Service as Naval ratings and Royal Marines other ranks shows an increase of between 8 per cent. and 10 per cent. respectively on the same period for last year.</p>

Training establishments support music and the arts in a recreational and developmental context and encourage participation as an adjunct to training in operational skills.</p>

	<p pid=".275W.3/1">The Principal Personnel Officers strongly encourage recruits and trainees to sustain links with their parents during initial training. The Naval Service considers that these links are strong, but samples of parents/guardians are to be surveyed on a regular and routine basis to confirm this. Commanding Officers of Army initial training units have for some considerable time now written to, or kept in telephone contact with, parents of recruits aged under 18 years. All Army recruits are also encouraged to maintain contact with parents themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.3/2">Following a recent review of the legal position, RAF guidelines to disseminate best practice are expected to be published shortly. A copy of these guidelines will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".278W.3/1">The energy performance requirements in Part L of the Building Regulations have been reviewed twice in the last decade to see what contribution they can make towards achieving the Government's energy performance and carbon dioxide emissions targets, while remaining proportionate, cost-effective and practical. Other greenhouse gases are controlled in different ways. In the Regulatory Impact Assessment published in October 2001 to accompany the latest amendment to Part L of the Building Regulations, which came into effect in April 2002, it was estimated that the changes would lead to a reduction in carbon emissions of 1.4 million tonnes of carbon (equivalent to about 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide) per year in 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".278W.3/2">The consultation document published in June 2000 that proposed this amendment included an assessment of the scope for improving performance standards over the period to 2008. Both these documents can be inspected on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister website at <a href="http://www.safety.odpm.gov.uk/bregs/brnews.htm">http://www.safety.odpm.gov.uk/bregs/brnews.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".278W.3/3">As to plans for future enhancements, it was announced that a new review of the Building Regulations would occur in the Energy White Paper with the aims of bringing a further major revision into effect in 2005 for new buildings and refurbishment work, and raising standards even more over the next decade.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.5/1">The research underlying SEDBUK, the UK's database of domestic boiler seasonal efficiency indices, which was developed to facilitate SAP energy ratings, was carried out as a collaborative venture by industry and Government in 1997 to 1999. Collaboration has continued since then and this has focused on improvements and rectifying anomalies.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.5/2">Research into the evaluation of the energy performance of micro-combined heated and power (micro-CHP) units is at an early stage. A laboratory test procedure is being developed through consultations that have been commissioned by a group set up by the Energy Saving Trust. The procedure is close to completion and it is anticipated that the next stage will be to turn it into a 'Publicly Available Specification' (PAS) through the offices of BSI. It is akin to the standards in the Boiler Efficiency Directive, used to evaluate full and part load performance for boilers, and aims to establish similar performance parameters for microCHP systems. The results obtained could be used to determine a seasonal performance index for microCHP systems. However, while this index would be similar to the SEDBUK for boilers it would be inappropriate to make direct comparisons between these products on an efficiency basis. Consideration is therefore being given to the development of a comparison system based on total carbon emissions, total energy or total energy costs.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.5/3">As the rating development will be reliant upon microCHP field trials, it is not possible to say precisely when the further research results will be known, but the aim is to have the SEDBUK equivalent in place in time for inclusion in the next major revision of the Building Regulations Part L in 2005. There will, of course, be consultation with the interested parties on these initiatives during the intervening period.</p>

	<p pid=".283W.6/1">The UK has made considerable progress in recent years in terms of the proportion of the population regularly accessing the internet. The UK online programme drives forward work across Government, helping to meet the Prime Minister's commitment of internet access for all who want it by 2005. In 1998, 10 per cent. of UK households (8 per cent. in Scotland) had internet access, compared to 45 per cent. by April 2003. Virtually all schools across the UK are now connected to the internet. All schools in England will have broadband connections by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.6/2">In total, 62 per cent. of the UK adult population&mdash;some 28.7 million people&mdash;have now used the internet (October 2002 National Statistics Omnibus Survey); 38 per cent. of the UK adult population, 17.6 million people have yet to get online; and 50 per cent. of the adult population, 23.1 million people, log on regularly. The survey currently provides six-monthly breakdowns of results for the devolved administrations, so 2003 results for Scotland are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.6/3">In November 2002 the Prime Minister announced that we had successfully achieved our target of setting up 6,000 UK online centres in England, enabling thousands of individuals to enjoy the benefits of the internet by providing free or low cost internet access and offering support for first time users. Many of the centres are located in the 2,000 most deprived wards in England. They are located in libraries, community centres, village halls, football clubs, mobile facilities and other community venues. UK online centres have a proven track record of helping to support and engage harder to reach groups, including the long-term unemployed, in the provision of access to ICT learning and skills. So far 16.9 per cent. of users have been unemployed.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.6/4">The Scottish Executive's Public Internet Access Points initiative aims to create over 1,000 new internet access points in a wide range of venues throughout Scotland where people already go as part of their everyday lives&mdash;e.g. shops, post offices, community centres, pubs, sports facilities etc. Over 500 venues are now up and running. In addition over 550 libraries in Scotland now provide free public access to the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.6/5">To enable people to find their nearest internet access point the UK online helpline, in association with the Scottish Executive, provides contact/location information of public internet access facilities across the UK, including in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.6/6">During the forthcoming 'Get Started' (formerly 'Online Nation') publicity campaign, the UK online helpline will also provide information on events and activities (including taster sessions) in Scotland and Scottish callers will receive the Internet Made Easy CDROM (a joint development with Scottish University for Industry) covering basic skills and outlining the benefits of the web.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.6/7">The 'Get Started' campaign will seek to explain to those currently not using the internet how the internet can benefit their daily lives, and will encourage them to access the internet at their nearest public internet access point. We are especially keen to encourage elderly people and those in low income households to get online as it is these people who are least likely to be aware of what the internet can do for them. This campaign will run simultaneously with a campaign in the Scottish Executive with similar objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.6/8">The 6,000 UK online centres will offer a free introductory session to the internet to anyone who wants it. In addition, we have commissioned regional TV programmes and community service announcements to demonstrate how people have benefited from using the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.6/9">To help get our message across we are working with a number of companies and voluntary organisations to deliver the campaign. These include the BBC, Arriva Group, BT pic, Dixons Stores, the Prince's Trust, the National Library for the Blind, and Citizens Advice. We hope that working with these partners will enable even more people to understand the benefits that the internet can bring.</p>

	<p pid=".285W.2/1">Individual Government Departments and agencies have responsibility for external recruitment, with the exception of the Fast Stream. The recruitment process for jobs in the Civil Service, including advertising, must be consistent with the principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition, in accordance with the requirements of the Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code. Decisions about advertising have to take into account, subject to the details of the vacancy or vacancies, how best to ensure that information is widely available in the areas where the target candidate market is to be found.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/2">We have set targets to improve the diversity of Government Departments at senior levels, and therefore recruitment advertising at every level includes trying to reach those who might not traditionally consider the civil service as a career.

	<p pid=".286W.6/3">The Government shares the concerns of the group about the importance of protecting and preserving archaeological sites and museums in Iraq. Before the conflict started, the Ministry of Defence consulted widely with the archaeological fraternity, who provided lists of key sites of cultural and historical interest in Iraq. Troops were briefed accordingly and avoided key sites of cultural and historical interest as far as possible during the conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.6/4">We could not prevent damage inflicted by Iraqi forces. Most of the looting by criminal elements occurred whilst the fighting was continuing. The aim of the Coalition forces at this stage was to suppress Saddam Hussein's forces with minimal loss of Coalition lives and Iraqi civilians.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.6/5">Troops guarded cultural sites where they could, but this was not always possible due to the security situation. It also now appears that organised groups had access to Baghdad Museum and planned the looting well in advance of military action.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.5/3">The UK has not ratified because the extent of the obligation regarding right of entry is unclear. There are no present plans to ratify, but the matter remains under consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/4"><i>2. Convention Relating to Stops on Bearer Securities in International Circulation&mdash;</i>signed <phrase class="date" code="1970-05-28">28 May 1970</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/5">Austria, Belgium, France and Luxembourg, which were the four parties, have denounced the Convention which has since ceased to be operative.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/6"><i>3. Convention on the Establishment of a Scheme of Registration of Wills&mdash;</i>signed <phrase class="date" code="1972-05-16">16 May 1972</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/7">English law has been amended to enable compliance with the Convention in England and Wales (1982 Administration of Justice Act). The UK is unable to ratify because Scottish law has not been amended to enable the Convention to be ratified. The Scottish Executive do not see ratification as a priority.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/8"><i>4. European Convention on the Control of the Acquisition and Possession of Firearms</i> <i>by Individuals&mdash;</i>signed <phrase class="date" code="1978-06-28">28 June 1978</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/9">Ratification would require amendments to be made to the Firearms Act 1968. There are no plans to make such amendments as the UK has already ratified UN and EC instruments on weapons control. Ratification is unlikely. <i>5. European Convention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter&mdash;</i>signed <phrase class="date" code="1979-05-10">10 May 1979</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/10">The UK could not ratify at the time of signature, as domestic legislation was more restricted in its scope than the Convention. The EC approved the Convention in 1988, and in 1993 its requirements were incorporated in Directive 93/119/EC, which was implemented in the UK in 1995. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been seeking Ministerial agreement from the relevant departments and the devolved administrations. Ratification is likely in early 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.5/15">Ratification of this convention remains under consideration by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/16"><i>9. European Convention relating to questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite</i>&mdash;signed <phrase class="date" code="1996-10-02">2 October 1996</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/17">The UK could not initially ratify this convention until EEC Directive 93/83/EEC had been implemented. There is an agreement among EU member states that they should ratify simultaneously. Until all member states have the necessary legislation in place, ratification cannot take place.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/18"><i>10. Agreement on Illicit Traffic by Sea, Implementing Article 17 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances</i>&mdash;signed <phrase class="date" code="1995-01-31">31 January 1995</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/19">The Home Office has not yet found a suitable legislative slot to enact the new legislation required to proceed with ratification. We will continue to look for such a legislative slot, and restart the ratification process when one becomes available.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/20"><i>11. Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning higher education in the European Region</i>&mdash;signed <phrase class="date" code="1997-11-07">7 November 1997</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/21">The instrument of ratification was signed by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-06">6 May 2003</phrase>. The UK will ratify this convention in the very near future.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/22"><i>12. Criminal Law Convention on Corruption</i>&mdash;signed <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-27">27 January 1999</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/23">Before the Convention had entered into force, the Home Office considered it desirable, although not necessary, to reform domestic law on corruption before ratifying the Convention. However, it remains uncertain when the draft Corruption Bill will proceed and, following the entry into force of the Convention in 2002, the balance of the argument has changed. We intend to ratify in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/24"><i>13. Civil Law Convention on Corruption&mdash;</i>signed <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-08">8 June 2000</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/25">Certain minor amendments are needed in relation to UK law on limitation of civil actions to enable ratification to take place. Relevant provisions have been included in the Corruption Bill, which was recently published in draft, and will be taken forward when a legislative opportunity arises.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/26"><i>14. European Convention on the Promotion of a Transnational Long-term Voluntary Service for Young People</i>&mdash;signed <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-19">19 September 2000</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/27">The Department for Education and Skills will not be pursuing ratification of this Convention. It closely mirrors an existing EU scheme and as such, ratification would lead to a duplication of work.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/28"><i>15. Additional Protocol to the European Agreement on the Transmission of applications for Legal Aid</i>&mdash;signed <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-04">4 October 2001</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/29">The Lord Chancellor's Department has established that no primary legislation is needed to proceed with ratification. They are in the process of preparing an Explanatory Memorandum on this protocol. Ratification is therefore expected to take place in the latter half of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/30"><i>16. Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data, regarding supervisory authorities and transborder data flows</i>&mdash;signed <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-08">8 November 2001</phrase></p>

	<p pid=".288W.5/32">The Explanatory Memorandum for this protocol has been laid before Parliament. The Crime (International Co-operation) Bill must be given Royal Assent before ratification can progress. This is likely in late 2003, with ratification following in early 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/33"><i>18. Convention on Cyber Crime</i>&mdash;signed <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-23">23 November 2001</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/34">New legislation will be required in order to ratify this convention. The principal cause of delay has been finding Parliamentary time for this legislation. Ratification is expected in late 2004 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/35"><i>19. Protocol no. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights on the Abolition of the Death Penalty in all circumstances&mdash;</i>signed <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-03">3 May 2002</phrase></p>

In November, I had a detailed discussion in London with Jamaica's Minister for National Security, Dr. Peter Phillips, on the challenges he faces; and last July, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister met President Uribe of Colombia and underlined the importance he attaches to co-operation on drugs issues.</p>

In the Caribbean, a British Military Advisory and Training Team from the Royal Navy is providing maritime skills to enable local coastguards to intercept consignments of drugs. The local US Embassy is providing the same coastguard detachments with vessels in which to conduct their operations.</p>

Friend the Home Secretary, together with the US Attorney General, signed a new bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United Kingdom and the USA. Article 16.2 of the Treaty contains a standard provision precluding the UK from transferring persons extradited from the US elsewhere without US consent, and vice versa. Such a provision features in the existing (1972) UK/US Extradition Treaty.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.5/2">At US request, the UK has provided a side letter to the new Treaty confirming that the UK understands this provision to preclude the onward surrender to the International Criminal Court (ICC) of a person extradited from the US; and that the UK would contest any request from the ICC for such a surrender, as being incompatible with Article 98.2 of the ICC Statute.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.5/3">Article 98.2 provides for non-surrender of an individual to the ICC where the requested State has an international obligation that gives the right of consent to the sending State.</p>

These points were covered in the joint statement with US Secretary Powell at Camp David on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-27">27 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.5/2">The differences between India and Pakistan can only be resolved through peaceful means and engagement. We therefore welcome recent moves by both sides towards the normalisation of relations. We hope that these positive developments prove to be the first step in a process of building confidence, normalising bilateral relations and resolving their outstanding differences, including Kashmir. We will continue to do all that we can in support of these positive developments.</p>

It is chaired by the Minister for Pensions and meets on a regular basis to provide views on presented ideas from Government on the development of policy or services, and to serve as an external think-tank for ideas on service delivery issues.

	<p pid=".310W.0/1">An association between long-term use of oral contraceptives (OCs) and a slightly increased risk of cervical cancer has been recognised for many years. However, it has not been possible to demonstrate a direct causal relationship as the presence of other factors, such as persistent infection with human papilloma virus (HPV), that are believed to have an important role in the development of cervical cancer, are also associated with long-term use of OCs.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/2">A review of all eligible research on the long-term use of OCs and risk of cervical cancer has recently been published (<i>The Lancet</i>&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-04-05">5 April 2003</phrase>&mdash;361:1159). This review took into consideration many other relevant factors, such as HPV infection and still found that use of OCs for many years is associated with a slight increase in the risk of cervical cancer compared with 'never-use'. A copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/3">The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has kept the issue under review and has considered the latest evidence. CSM has advised that, as it is not possible to be certain that all relevant factors, such as duration of HPV infection, have been fully taken into account in the review, a definite causal relationship has yet to be established. Nonetheless, the new study strengthens the evidence for a causal link between long-term OC use and cervical cancer and research is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/4">Warnings about the risk of cervical cancer with long-term use have been included in the summary of product characteristics for health professionals and the patient information leaflet for women for many years. In addition, women are advised to regularly attend for a cervical smear in accordance with Guidelines. In the United Kingdom, the introduction of a highly effective screening programme means that the total number of cases of cervical cancer is low and mortality has fallen.</p>

The FSA advises and keeps Health Ministers regularly informed, through frequent discussions and briefings, about relevant developments and issues. The FSA works very closely with local authorities and their representative bodies and receives regular representations from them regarding food law enforcement issues. These are made informally through day-to-day contact between FSA officials and local authority enforcement officers and more formally by means of written representations, through the enforcement liaison group (a joint FSA/local authority committee that was set up to strengthen and develop links with local authorities) and at regular meetings of the FSA's chairman, chief executive and other senior officials with representatives of the local authorities co-ordinator of regulatory services and with the Local Government Association. These representations relate to a wide range of issues including, for example, the FSA's local authority monitoring and audit programmes, levels and consistency of food law enforcement activity, recruitment and retention of enforcement professionals and licensing of food premises.</p>

	<p pid=".319W.11/1">Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), environmental health officers (EHOs) based at Heathrow's health control unit are boarding flights arriving at the airport from high risk areas such as Hong Kong, China and Singapore. EHOs are meeting planes before passengers disembark to ascertain from the cabin crew whether there are any ill passengers on board.

	<p pid=".319W.11/2">If a passenger has become ill during the flight and develops symptoms suggestive of SARS, an EHO/health control unit officer and a medical officer will board the plane on its arrival. Airline crew and passengers remain on board while the medical officer assesses the patient and establish the nature of the illness. The health control unit arranges for the patient's subsequent care.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.11/3">If SARS is suspected, then all passengers and crew will be given information sheets about the illness and the need to seek early medical advice should they develop symptoms within ten days of the flight.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.11/4">Close contacts, including passengers sitting in the same seating row or within at least two rows in front of or behind the ill passenger, will be given a form to complete. The form will require them to provide their contact details and in the event of the suspected case being confirmed, will enable public health services to monitor their health.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.11/5">The plane involved will then be impounded by EHOs until it has been disinfected by the airline in accordance with current requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".321W.5/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-12">12 May</phrase>, there were four probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.5/2">There have been a number of cases where people fit the suspect definition of SARS which have also been investigated. We will only be reporting cases that fit the probable case definition issued by the World Health Organisation. At this time of year in south-east Asia influenza activity is high and we would therefore expect travellers to this area to be returning with flu-like symptoms, which are unrelated to the current outbreaks of SARS. Each suspected case is carefully evaluated on the clinical presentation of its symptoms.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.5/3">The situation is changing daily, and it would not be beneficial to report suspected cases as there will be many who after investigation do not fit the WHO case definition. We therefore only report on probable cases, as required by WHO.</p>

	<p pid=".323W.2/1">European rules on food labelling are implemented in the United Kingdom by the general provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Food Labelling Regulation 1996. These make it an offence to describe food in a way that is false, or likely to mislead a purchaser about its nature, substance or quality. Guidance notes accompanying this legislation make clear that terms like &quot;smoked&quot; can easily be abused and suggest that products that have been immersed in, or sprayed with, a solution which imparts flavour and colour should be described as &quot;smoke flavoured&quot; rather than &quot;smoked&quot;.</p>
