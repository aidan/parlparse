	<p pid="a.2W.7/1">As outlined in the Olympic Delivery Authority's (ODA) 2008-09 Annual Report, performance payments are payable to CLM for the achievement of pre-agreed key performance indicators for the delivery of programme milestones and cost targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.7/2">Payments to CLM during the financial year 2008-09 reflect the increase in scale of the project in the last year as construction activity increased, and the strong progress being made as the project remains on track and within budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.7/3">The ODA, working with CLM, achieved significant savings of &pound;390 million in the last year. The savings derive primarily from reduction in scope and value engineering changes, procurement savings, inflation and VAT savings, and have been applied to cost pressures as they have arisen. In particular, they have been used to help fund the Olympic Village and ensuring that the programme overall can be delivered within budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.7/4">CLM's contract is heavily incentivised and payment to them is dependent on meeting strict performance measures tied to delivering on time, to budget and to a high standard.</p>

	<p pid="a.4W.2/1">The chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), David Higgins, has a performance-based pay element within his contract agreed by the Minister for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This is linked to delivery on time and within budget. The basis of performance pay is agreed by DCMS and the level is determined by the remuneration committee of the ODA Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.2/2">The ODA's Annual Report and Accounts for 2008-09, copies of which have been placed in the House Library, records the progress in 2008-09, this records significant achievements including:</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.2/3" class="indent">keeping the programme on track and on budget;</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.2/4" class="indent">delivering the first venue, Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy in November 2008, on time and within budget;</p>

	<p pid="a.4W.2/7" class="indent">meeting challenging cost and health and safety targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.2/8">On the basis of his contract the remuneration committee determined that a performance related payment of &pound;209,566 was the appropriate amount to recognise the chief executive's performance, However, Mr. Higgins said, in July, that he had voluntarily agreed to defer half of his performance-based pay until 2012, subject to the satisfactory delivery of the current programme and scope, within the maximum available funding agreed by the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.2/9">As John Armitt, Chair of the ODA said &quot;None of our progress over the year would have been possible without the hard work of the team at the ODA led by David Higgins&quot;.</p>

However, the Minister for Sport and I have had discussions with the British Olympic Association and UK Sport. I have also spoken to British Cycling on this matter. The International Cycling Federation recently submitted a request to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for new cycling events to be included in the 2012 Olympic programme. The IOC Executive Board indicated that this could happen, especially if the new events increase the participation of women at the games and on condition that they replace events already on the programme. Current events can be replaced with new ones only if the total number of athletes is maintained. A final decision will be made at the IOC congress in October.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.2/1">The Government favours early devolution of responsibility for policing and justice, in line with the process set out by the First and Deputy First Minister in November 2008. It welcomes the introduction in the Northern Ireland Assembly of a Bill to establish a new Department of Justice, and looks forward to the Assembly approving a resolution seeking a transfer of powers, as set out in section 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. It is making intensive efforts to clear the remaining obstacles.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.9/1">Over the past two years, the UK has been working alongside Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission (IEC), the UN Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the wider donor community to prepare the 2009-10 Afghan elections. This includes preparations for the Provincial Council elections, which will be held at the same time as the presidential elections on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-20">20 August 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.9/2">The Afghan Government, with the support of the international community, has a vital role to play in both ensuring adequate security for the elections and that the IEC is a functioning body, capable of ensuring effective organisation. The 2009 elections will be the first Afghan-led elections since the 1970s.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.9/3">UNAMA, through the UNDP, is co-ordinating international support through the ELECT project&mdash;to which the UK has given &pound;16.5 million. ELECT aims to build up the capacity of the IEC to run the elections and to create a more cohesive and informed electoral process with as wide participation as possible. We work closely with the UN in Afghanistan and New York on preparations and have frequently played the lead role in raising and resolving issues of concern with the UN, the Afghan Government and international donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.9/4">International funding, both through ELECT and other projects, is supporting media exposure for candidates and civic education for voters, to explain the electoral process and to encourage them to vote. We are following the UN and IEC preparations closely, holding UNDP to account against the project's agreed outputs and pressing for additional action where necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.35W.8/1">Ensuring the welfare of British nationals detained abroad is one of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)'s highest priorities. Consular staff are given training and guidance in how to deal with distressed British nationals overseas, including in cases where allegations of mistreatment have been made. Consular staff are specifically trained on what action to take in response to any allegation of mistreatment. They can also draw on professional support, including from specialist legal and human rights advisers in the FCO.</p>
	<p pid="a.35W.8/2">However, this training and guidance is continually evolving and improving. Guidance is now clearer on the paramount importance and urgency of these cases, on who in London and overseas needs to be informed of allegations of mistreatment when these are made to a consular official, and on the actions to be taken to follow up such allegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.35W.8/3">Our current guidance includes the identification of possible signs of torture and mistreatment, as well as the procedures to be adopted in such circumstances. The first step when a British national is detained overseas is to seek and secure access by our consular staff. Our staff are instructed to ask our nationals whether they have suffered abuse or mistreatment, and to look out for signs of mistreatment even where an individual does not raise it. They are required to follow up all reports of mistreatment whether they come from the individual themselves, from their friends, family or representatives, or from other sources. What form this follow up action will take will depend on the individual circumstances of the case. Most obviously, we can raise our concerns with the relevant authorities. Whatever action we take however, the objective remains the same: to end the mistreatment, and have the incident investigated and the perpetrators of any abuse brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.35W.8/4">In many countries we also raise more general concerns around the mistreatment and abuse of detainees as part of our wider human rights dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="a.38W.5/1">During the 2008-09 financial year, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) had no staff specifically employed on branding activity, although some parts of the FCO (for example Consular Directorate) undertake in-house branding activity on a continuing basis as part of their promotional campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.5/2">In addition, the Communication Directorate established a three-person team to review, consolidate and simplify all aspects of the FCO's corporate identity.

	<p pid="a.41W.8/1">At the end of 2008 Spain put forward a &quot;Site of Community Importance&quot; (SCI) under the habitats directive which encompasses British Gibraltar Territorial Waters (BGTW). As the Commission only consulted each state bilaterally on the sites it put forward, the UK discussed only our own proposed sites (including two in Gibraltar) with the Commission.

We await a response from the court to our request.</p>
	<p pid="a.41W.8/3">The case does not concern a Spanish claim to BGTW. In fact the case involves an Article 230 application before the Court of First Instance by the Government of Gibraltar for annulment of Commission Decision 2009/95/EC, made under the habitats directive, to the extent that the listing of the Spanish SCI, Estrecho Oriental, includes British Gibraltar Territorial Waters (BGTW) and an area of the high seas beyond BGTW.</p>

Our ambassador in Pyongyang raised our concerns with the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs and Speaker of the North Korean parliament in February 2009 during the visit to North Korea by Lord Alton and Baroness Cox.

This subject was raised with the Chinese at the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue in January 2009. We urged China not to return those people crossing the border from DPRK to China.

	<p pid="a.48W.2/3">Following the attacks, our high commissioner in Islamabad raised our concerns about the attack in Gojra with the Chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif. Mr. Sharif assured the high commissioner that the perpetrators would be brought to justice and that he had instructed the Lahore High Court to conduct an inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.48W.8/1">The UK continues to view the difficult situation facing religious minorities in the Punjab and indeed all of Pakistan as a cause for concern. The latest attacks on the Christian community in Gojra and ongoing persecution of the Ahmadiyya community are examples of the dangers faced by religious minorities, and serve as reminders of the need to protect the religious freedom of all Pakistanis.</p>
	<p pid="a.48W.8/2">Alongside our EU partners, the UK continues to encourage the Government of Pakistan to repeal or amend the blasphemy laws to reduce the widespread misuse of this legislation to discriminate against minority groups. In December 2008, the EU called upon the Government of Pakistan to promote tolerance, to effectively protect freedom of belief and freedom of expression and to reform discriminatory legislation such as the blasphemy laws. In August 2009, the EU also raised the attacks on Christians in Gojra with the Pakistan Foreign Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.48W.8/3">We continue to encourage Pakistan to fulfil its commitments under the UN Human Rights Council. During the last Universal Periodic Review in May 2008, we secured a commitment from the Government of Pakistan that checks would be introduced to regulate investigations into allegations of blasphemy that affect minority groups.</p>

It is ultimately for the Sri Lankan people to decide what a solution must look like, but we believe it would need to be based on equality, consent and rule of law. The All Party Representative Committee (APRC) was set up by the Sri Lankan President to build consensus on political reforms. In 2008, we funded a visit by APRC members to England, Wales and Northern Ireland to share our experiences of devolution, and peace building in Northern Ireland. We encourage the Government of Sri Lanka to reach a satisfactory conclusion of the APRC process as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.72W.5/1">Payment of state pension would be suspended until the issue in question is resolved. The Secretary of State has the discretion to suspend state pension in whole or in part and would normally do so until any issue which may lead to a doubt about ongoing entitlement had been resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.5/2">State pension may be suspended due to the following reasons:</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.5/3" class="indent">When official DWP correspondence, which has been sent to the customer, is returned by Royal Mail stating 'not known at this address'. Upon receipt of undelivered correspondence, we would suspend payment of benefit and take action to trace an up to date address for the customer. Payment would only be reinstated when a current address is obtained from the customer or their representative.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.5/4" class="indent">When benefit payments are returned by a bank or building society noted 'account closed reason unknown'. Inquiries would need to be made to establish why the payment has not been made to the nominated account and this would prompt suspension of future payments until the reason is known.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.5/5" class="indent">Where the Department has been informed that a customer receiving Widows Benefit has remarried or where investigations show that a widow is living together as husband and wife with a new partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.5/6" class="indent">When a customer is remanded in custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.5/7" class="indent">When inquiries or allegations are made regarding a misappropriation of funds by the customer's representative or power of attorney. This would be a request by either the Social Services or via third party disclosure and would result in suspension of benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.5/8" class="indent">When the Department has been notified of the customer's death but the exact date is currently not known. Payment would be suspended until the issues in question are resolved.</p>

	<p pid="a.82W.5/1">The UK is spending &pound;8.5 billion over the period 2006-07 to 2015-16 in support of education in developing countries. As the bulk of our support and engagement is provided through direct budget support and sector wide approaches, we are unable to put a specific global figure on the amount of money spent directly on disabled children. However, we encourage partner governments to ensure that their monitoring mechanisms can track the effects of national education sector spending on the most vulnerable children, including disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.5/2">The estimated spend on projects where disability is either directly targeted or mainstreamed in the four countries listed is:</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.5/3" class="indent">India&mdash;The DFID supported Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), National Education for All Programme, has helped reach over 1 million children with special needs since 2005-06. The programme has spent over &pound;78 million of which it is estimated approximately &pound;2.3 million supported special needs children.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.5/4" class="indent">Nigeria&mdash;DFID provides support to a set of State level sector programmes including education sector support through the Education Sector Support Programme. DFID Nigeria is increasing its support from &pound;100 million in 2008-09 to &pound;140 million in 2010-11. The increased allocation is being used to expand support to selected partner states for health and education over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.5/5" class="indent">Pakistan&mdash;We do not have any ongoing or pipeline programmes that specifically target the disabled. Our support is mainly provided through sector budgets in support of provincial plans, within which issues relating to provision for disabled children is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.5/6" class="indent">Tanzania&mdash;DFID's support in Tanzania is aligned with the Government of Tanzania National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty. In 2007-08 DFID provided &pound;105 million as budget support of which over &pound;26 million went to the education sector. Of this, we estimate that more than &pound;66,000 went on school places for disabled children.</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has been following events closely but the full economic and social impacts will not be known for some time. Therefore making an assessment of the impact of the crisis on the millennium development goals (MDGs) is extremely difficult and indicative at best. Based on revised growth forecasts, we estimate that up to 90 million more people will be living in extreme poverty by 2010 as a result of the crisis than previously anticipated. This is expected to delay the achievement of MDG1&mdash;eradicate extreme poverty and hunger&mdash;by up to three years. Other goals, such as increased educational enrolment and reduced child mortality, are also likely to be affected due to falling household incomes, but the severity of such effects depend on government policy in the particular developing country.</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.11/1">Human rights principles underpin the UK Government's aid to developing countries. The policy of the Department for International Development (DFID) is to consider a country's human rights record when deciding whether to provide bi-lateral aid. DFID assesses a country's human rights record in its three yearly 'Country Governance Analysis'. This provides an analysis of the human rights situation in each country and is used in developing the Country Plan and the Development Partnership Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.11/2">This approach is reinforced by the Conditionality Policy, which bases UK aid partnerships on shared commitments to respect human rights, to poverty reduction and to good financial management. Where a country government do not share these commitments, UK aid can still be provided to poor people through other routes such as multi-lateral agencies and civil society. Where a partner government have breached their commitment to human rights, UK aid to the government may be suspended, as it was in Kenya and Pakistan in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="a.89W.2/1">The Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) declared victory over the LITE in May 2009. Approximately 270,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) remain in camps in the north and east of the country. Conditions in the camps are basic but have improved as the needs for shelter, food, water and medicine are gradually being met. We remain concerned about high malnutrition levels among sections of the IDP population, the lack of freedom of movement and the restrictions put on activities such as registration of the population and the reunification of families. Recent flooding in the camps following heavy rain highlights the importance of safely returning as many people as possible to their homes before the monsoon season. The Department for International Development (DFID), together with the international community, is participating in contingency planning to mitigate against its effect on the camps.</p>

Since September 2008, the Department for International Development (DFID) has allocated &pound;12.5 million of humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka.

	<p pid="a.90W.4/1">There are significant advantages to issue on the street in appropriate circumstances: officers do not need to return to the police station in order to process the matter and they are able to return to patrol much more quickly, resulting in efficiency savings and a better service to the public.

	<p pid="a.93W.8/1">Ministers and senior officials hold regular reviews with departmental leads to ensure that the policy is being implemented consistently in all probation areas. Community Payback was launched in November 2005 to promote public awareness and confidence in the unpaid work community sentence. To increase visibility, distinctive clothing in the form of orange high visibility jackets has been required to be worn by offenders on most work sites, which are in view of the public, since December 2008. The use of distinctive clothing has been monitored. During the quarter April to June 2009 over one million hours of Community Payback were undertaken by offenders wearing distinctive clothing. If the hon. Member has specific concerns I would be glad to hear from him.</p>

Offenders sentenced to Community Payback (unpaid work) during this period had a 25.8 per cent. rate of reoffending. This is the lowest rate of reoffending of the top five commonly used community orders, though it may only reflect the characteristics of offenders sentenced to Community Payback rather than simply the effectiveness of Community Payback in reducing the likelihood of reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="a.105W.8/4">It is not possible to identify other expenditure on travel and hotels incurred specifically by Ministers without incurring the disproportionate costs as a significant proportion of hotel bookings, air travel, train travel and car hire are arranged through travel management companies employed by the Ministry to obtain best value for money options. Expenditure may also be incurred directly by staff and reimbursed through an expense claim process or charged to a Government Procurement Card (GPC). The GPC is a credit card operated by Barclays bank designed to limit transaction processing costs for low value, ad-hoc expenses. Expense claim records and log books detailing expenditure on the GPC card are held locally across the organisation, including by courts and prisons across the country. Examination and analysis of local records to identify amounts relating specifically to hotels, air travel, train travel and car hire for the last five years would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.105W.8/5">Travel and hotel costs incurred by Directors General and the Permanent Secretary within the Ministry in 2008-09 are published on the Ministry's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.105W.8/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/moj-business-costs-0809.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/moj-business-costs-0809.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.105W.8/7">Director Generals and Permanent Secretary costs have also been published quarterly on the website since July 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.105W.8/8">The annual departmental resource accounts disclose expenditure on &quot;travel, subsistence and hospitality&quot; in notes 10 (administration expenditure) and 11 (programme expenditure). Resource accounts were published by the Ministry of Justice for 2007-08 and 2008-09 and prior to that by the Ministry's predecessor, the Department for Constitutional Affairs. All published accounts can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.105W.8/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/">http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.105W.8/10">Analysis of published totals to identify amounts relating specifically to hotels, air travel, train travel and car hire for the last five years would incur disproportionate cost. The majority of expenditure is recorded within the Ministry's accounting records against a general &quot;travel and subsistence&quot; category which includes, in addition, subsistence allowances where, for example, staff are required to stay away from home overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.105W.8/11">The information that is held under the &quot;travel and subsistence&quot; category in the accounts includes non-civil servants, for example, judiciary and probation personnel. To calculate these costs, it would be necessary for the central procurement team to trawl manual records for the last five years. This is not possible since the procurement contracts have changed during this period as have the structure of the Department following Machinery of Government Changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.105W.8/12">Officials are now working to improve significantly the data held in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.107W.3/1">Encouraging people to complete and return electoral registration forms is the responsibility of electoral registration officers (EROs), in local authorities, under a duty placed on them by section 9 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 (EA Act), which requires them to take all necessary steps to maintain the electoral register, including sending the canvass form more than once, inspecting such records that the ERO is allowed to inspect, and making house to house inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="a.107W.3/2">The EA Act also provided for the Electoral Commission to introduce a performance standards framework for EROs. The standards provide a framework within which the performance of EROs in registering people can be assessed, and targeted work undertaken to drive up performance where necessary. The first assessments against these standards were published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-21">21 April 2009</phrase> and are available on the Commission's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.107W.3/3">The Government also established a funding mechanism to support novel and innovative projects and activities which EROs and returning officers take forward in pursuance of their duty, under section 69 of the EA Act to encourage electoral participation. Through this, funding has been made available for a range of schemes to support registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.107W.3/4">In addition, the Government recently legislated in the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 for the phased implementation of Individual Registration (IR) in Great Britain. This will be supported by a programme of work to drive up registration rates in Great Britain, enhancing both the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the electoral registers.</p>
	<p pid="a.107W.3/5">This programme will include: data matching pilots between EROs and local authorities to support registration; and secondary legislation to support registration amongst service voters, enhance data sharing in areas where there are two tier local authorities, and clarify that the section 9 duty applies all year round. The Government have also initiated a registration poster campaign in Citizens Advice Bureaux, the network of HM courts in England, Wales and Scotland and Jobcentre Plus offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.107W.3/6">Figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that during the last three years registration rates continued to rise. As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase> the number of UK parliamentary electors rose to 45.2 million.</p>

The PTA did not confer a right to transfer on prisoners. Transfer could only take place if both Governments concerned agreed. In the event that Mr. Megrahi's application under the PTA was refused by the Scottish Executive.</p>

These were sent to national, regional and international media and highlighted the work and policies of the Department.

Staffing levels in the Ministry's Communications Directorate now more adequately reflect the high level of media interest in the work of the Department, and the need to meet the high demands of a 24/7 media. It is right that the public know and understand the work of the MOJ and its agencies and how taxpayers' money is being spent. Communications, including the work of the press office, is an important element of this.</p>

	<p pid="a.117W.2/1">In accordance with the legislation which governs the release of prisoners, no prisoner serving a determinate sentence is required to serve the entire sentence in prison. Successive legislation on this, since 1967, has maintained the approach that prisoners should serve a proportion of their sentence in custody and the rest in the community, often subject to licence conditions on release. This approach is vital for the purposes of safely reintegrating prisoners back into the community and to reduce the risk of further offending. If prisoners were to serve their whole sentence in prison they would have to be released without any supervision or restrictions, which would put the public at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.119W.0/1">Escapes involve a prisoner absenting himself from prison custody without lawful authority by overcoming a physical security restraint such as that provided by fences, locks, bolts and bars, a secure vehicle or handcuffs. Absconds occur where a prisoner absents himself or herself from prison custody without lawful authority and without overcoming physical security barriers or restraints, conditions typically found in open prisons. Absconds have been falling and last year recorded the lowest number of absconds on record.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/2">The data in table 1 show the number of prisoners who have absconded from each open prison in England and Wales for the last 12 months and numbers of prisoners who remain unlawfully at large.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/3">Table 2 shows the number of prisoners who have absconded from each open prison in England and Wales for the last 12 years and numbers of prisoners who remain unlawfully at large. Figures for prisoners unlawfully at large prior to April 2004,are not available centrally and could be produced only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/4">Table 3 shows the index offences of prisoners who have absconded from each open prison since April 2004. Data are not available centrally prior to this period and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/5">All those located in open conditions have been risk assessed and categorised as being of low risk to the public. Time spent in open prisons affords prisoners the opportunity to find work, re-establish family ties, reintegrate into the community and ensure housing needs are met. For long-term prisoners these are essential components for successful resettlement and an important factor in protecting the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/6">Prisons can and do take a variety of actions to try and reduce absconds. Open prisons operate intelligence systems to try and spot those who might be planning to abscond; prisoners are screened and those who are at significant risk of absconding are sent back to closed conditions; in many areas the prison, police and CPS are working together to maximise the prosecution of absconders to provide a deterrent to others who may be thinking of doing the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.132W.2/3">Over the last 10 years, more than 99 per cent. of offenders who have been recalled to prison have been successfully apprehended. We are determined to build on this creditable performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.132W.2/4">All agencies are working together to review and revise the end-to-end recall process, to ensure that we have the strongest grip on these individuals and can return them to custody as quickly as possible. The police have an action plan in place to deal with outstanding cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.132W.2/5">The Probation Service has significantly improved its enforcement of breaches. In 1997 only a third of breaches were being appropriately enforced, compared to over 95 per cent. by 2008. Before 1999 recall was rarely used because such cases had to go through the courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.138W.0/1">Control and restraint (C&amp;R) is a system of techniques used within both prisons and young offender institutions in order to bring a violent or non-compliant prisoner under control. C&amp;R is only applied in circumstances where it is necessary to do so and any force used is applied for as short a time as possible and only in proportion to the violence shown by the prisoner. Staff are instructed to avoid use of force wherever possible and instead to use persuasion or negotiation to end such incidents, however, this is not always possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.0/2">All staff in prisons and young offender institutions who employ C&amp;R techniques are trained in their use and undergo annual refresher training.

	<p pid="a.140W.5/2">We believe that these figures may understate the actual number of finds, because they do not include items retained by the police for evidential purposes, and because in some instances prisons have not sent items for analysis. NOMS is putting in place new procedures to ensure that we have a more comprehensive picture in future. While the numbers of phones found indicates the scale of the challenge in tackling illicit mobile phones, it is also a reflection of prisons' increasing success in finding them and better reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.5/3">NOMS is implementing a strategy to minimise the number of phones entering prisons, and to find or disrupt those that do enter. As part of the strategy, prisons have been provided with technologies to strengthen local security and searching strategies, in line with the recommendations in the Blakey report, &quot;Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons&quot;, published in July 2008. This includes the roll out of &quot;BOSS&quot; chairs to all prisons, and the deployment of other detection and disruption technologies, including mobile phone signal blockers.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.5/4">We have also strengthened the law, through the Offender Management Act 2007 (implemented in April 2008), which makes it a criminal offence with a punishment of up to two years' imprisonment to bring an unauthorised mobile phone or component part into a prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.142W.5/1">Information on the street value of drugs used illegally in prisons is not routinely available. Covert activity such as drug taking, by its nature, is very difficult to quantify. A report published in 2001 by the Home Office titled 'Sizing the UK market for illicit drugs' focused on a few specific drugs and estimated the value of the drugs trade in prisons as worth up to &pound;24 million. Since that report, the level of drug misuse evidenced by the random drug testing positive rate has fallen by 36 per cent.</p>

They have, therefore, a responsibility to notify their Governor or Head of Group if they are charged with any criminal offence. Information on the numbers of prison officers charged with offences covered by misconduct in public office could only be obtained by contacting all NOMS establishments and asking them to provide any information they hold locally in this respect.

	<p pid="a.162W.2/2">The salary of the DOM is dependent on the size and complexities of the region.

	<p pid="a.164W.2/1">Physical restraint is only ever to be used by staff in the under-18 secure estate as a last resort, when all other approaches have either not succeeded or would not be appropriate.</p>

They relate to use of restraint in secure training centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.2/3">Central collection of information about the reasons for each restraint began in April 2008. The categories in the table relate to the purposes for which restraint was permitted under Rule 38(1) of the Secure Training Centre Rules 1998 during all or part of the period in question. Those purposes are: to prevent a trainee from escaping from custody; to prevent a trainee from injuring himself or others; to prevent damage to property; to prevent a trainee from inciting another trainee to cause injury or damage property; and to ensure good order and discipline. Prevention of a criminal offence is not, in itself, a purpose for which restraint is or was authorised under Rule 38(1). Ensuring good order and discipline ceased, at the end of July 2008, to be an approved purpose for using restraint.</p>

	<p pid="a.166W.5/15">The National Offender Management Service has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of Prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. Most self harm is not directly life threatening, but nevertheless can be extremely distressing for those who have to deal with it. A prisoner focused care planning system for those at risk, ACCT, has helped prisons manage self harm. There are no easy answers to managing self-harming behaviour but we remain committed to finding ways to reduce it.</p>

Sharia councils do not describe themselves as Sharia 'courts' because they do not have powers to enforce their decisions. Sharia councils are not part of the court system in England and Wales. There are a number of Sharia councils in England and Wales that, on a private basis, when the parties consent, apply Sharia principles to reach resolution of personal and contractual disputes. Some councils have several branches in major cities but councils are not unified under one system governing their approach to issues or their administration so their processes and even their interpretation of Sharia principles may differ.</p>

An interim evaluation report was produced in April 2007 and I have arranged for a copy of this to be placed in the House of Commons Library. Shortly after the completion of this report, the &quot;Independent Review of the Use of Restraint in Juvenile Secure Settings&quot; was announced and a decision was taken to suspend further work on JRT pending the outcome of the review.</p>

Piloting of this new system of restraint is expected to begin early next year.</p>

The decision to allocate funding was made by a cross-criminal justice agency board following consideration of the business case and related documentation, a review against agreed investment principles, a technical design review, and an independent review from Gartner on the effectiveness of current case management systems in use by the youth justice system.

	<p pid="a.182W.6/1">It is not appropriate to use the term 'illiterate' to describe primary school pupils who are still learning. Primary school standards have never been higher. In 2009 92 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved level 3 or above in reading, and 94 per cent. in writing. This means they can read a range of texts accurately and independently and their writing is organised, legible and clear. Many of those working below test level at age 11 will have a range of learning difficulties. We have proven, successful programmes like Every Child a Reader and Every Child a Writer in place to support those who are struggling.</p>

	<p pid="a.184W.12/1">Three Building Schools for the Future projects&mdash;Hull, Oldham, and Stoke&mdash;have previously been suspended in the pre-procurement phase while the local authorities were asked to re-examine their school estate proposals to ensure that the proposals would make a significant educational impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.184W.12/2">Local authorities are required to demonstrate that their BSF plans are visionary and transformational at two key points in the process. At initial entry, local authorities must submit a robust 'Readiness to Deliver' document which explains how their plans will impact on the local educational environment. Once the programme has commenced, they are required to submit a 'Strategy for Change' which describes the educational impact of their plans across all of the local schools to benefit from BSF investment. If, at either milestone, it is judged that the local authority is not setting high enough aspirations, they are asked to revise the strategies and resubmit them. This process helps to reduce the need to suspend BSF programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.186W.2/1">All organisations using ContactPoint must complete organisational accreditation before their staff can be granted access to ContactPoint. Part of the organisational accreditation involves ensuring that appropriate disciplinary procedures are in place in the employing organisation should it be necessary to invoke them in relation to any inappropriate use of ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/2">The use of ContactPoint is monitored at both national and local level. Local authorities are responsible for investigating suspected misuse within their user base. A central DCSF team also reviews use of the system and data by local authorities and national partners. If unusual activity by users within a local authority area or a national partner organisation were to be detected by regular auditing, or was suspected or reported, the local authority or national partner ContactPoint Management Team must suspend the user account, notify the user's manager and carry out an immediate investigation using local policies and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/3">In the eventuality that there was misuse of data held on ContactPoint, disciplinary action would be a matter for the employer of the individual concerned. No one has been disciplined for misuse of data, however, through DCSF auditing, we have identified five instances where correct procedures were not followed by ContactPoint users. Typically, these were users who searched for records, for example, those of family members, in order to 'test' the system, in what they believed was a 'safe' way, before undertaking work such as apply shields to records that need them. All cases were immediately investigated and appropriate action has been taken. One of these five instances resulted in an individual being disciplined. The incident, although inappropriate, did not lead to ContactPoint data being compromised and there is no evidence that any of these instances indicated malicious intent, posed any risk to the security of children's records or constituted misuse of data on ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.2/4">We have always said that we will carefully monitor the activity of early adopter practitioners to identify any further improvements that may be required. In the light of these instances, we further strengthened our training and guidance materials on correct procedures and use of ContactPoint. This demonstrates that the stringent security processes we have in place are working.</p>

	<p pid="a.192W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Miriam Rosen, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-10">10 August 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to Ofsted for response. As Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills, Christine Gilbert, is currently on leave, I am responding on her behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.5/4" class="indent">Tables A to F below show the inspection grades of day care settings and childminders in Basingstoke since 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.5/5" class="indent">The figures for each period are taken from a snapshot of data at the end of each financial year. These data only include providers that were active at this point. Additionally, the figures only count the most recent inspection outcome for each provision at the time of the snapshot, provided their inspection reports had been published or quality assured and not withdrawn from publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.5/6" class="indent">Please note that the inspection judgements requested cover three inspection cycles. Those inspections carried out in the inspection cycle from April 2003 to end-March 2005 inspected the quality of provision against the National Standards for under-eights and were graded on a three point scale. Those from April 2005 to end-August 2008 were also inspected against the National Standards, but graded on the four point scale outlined in the question. It is not possible to operate a simple read-across approach from a three-to a four-point scale. Care should be taken when interpreting data for 'childcare on domestic premises' as the numbers are so small.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.5/7" class="indent">There was a further change of inspection framework following the introduction of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) in September 2008. At this point, Ofsted also changed the way in which we record day-care provision, categorising providers as childcare on domestic and non-domestic premises. These categories broadly relate to the previous category of group day-care provision. The data for September 2008 to March 2009 are presented separately and, as above, it is not possible to operate a simple read-across between inspection frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.5/8" class="indent">Please note that the selection of provision for inspection each year is not random, so care needs to be taken when using the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.5/9" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to right hon. Dawn Primarolo MP, Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, and will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.196W.5/15">Childminders remain the child carers of choice for thousands of families because of the high quality, flexible and responsive service that they offer, but we are continuing to work closely with sector partners (including the National Childminding Association) to strengthen their professional development and the quality of their provision. We are keen to see a diverse and vibrant childcare sector which includes childminders from a range of minority ethnic backgrounds. We will work with Ofsted and the National Childminding Association (NCMA) to look at the factors which are leading to childminders from a BME backgrounds to choose to leave the childminding profession.</p>

	<p pid="a.198W.2/16" class="indent">Please note that, as of <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September 2008</phrase>, the government introduced new arrangements for the registration of childcare providers through the Childcare Act 2006. There are now two registers: the Early Years Register (EYR) and the Childcare Register. The Childcare Register is subdivided into two parts, the compulsory part (CCR) and the voluntary part (VCR). Childcare providers may be registered on any combination of the EYR, CCR and VCR, depending on the age of the children in their care and the type of care offered. Those providers who care for children from birth to the <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-31">31 August</phrase> following their fifth birthday must register on the EYR, unless they are in a category that is exempt from registration. Providers who care for older children who are under eight must be registered on the CCR. Other childcare providers, for example those caring for children over the age of eight, or caring for a child in the child's own home, are not required to register with Ofsted, but may join the VCR.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.2/17" class="indent">Ofsted only sets the maximum number of places for childcare provision registered on the EYR and the CCR. Numbers of registered places therefore indicate the maximum number of children aged under eight that may be present at any one time. The figures are not the number of places occupied, nor the number of children who may benefit from receiving places through providers offering sessions at different times of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.2/18" class="indent">The maximum number of places figures as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase> were calculated by combining the maximum number of places recorded individually for both the Early Years Register (EYR) and the compulsory part of the Childcare Register (CCR) for each provider. As explained when Ofsted published the March 2009 figures, there is a strong possibility that these figures may be higher than the true overall maximum number of places, due to the duplication of places on both registers for some providers. Ofsted omitted the maximum numbers of childcare places as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June 2009</phrase> from the figures published in July 2009, explaining that work was underway to improve the quality of these data. Ofsted will publish the maximum number of childcare places in the next childcare providers and places statistical release in October 2009, and in my Annual Report 2008/09, which will be published in November 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.200W.5/1">Gloucestershire local authority was allocated &pound;671,770 capital funding for workplace nurseries in 2008-09. This formed part of the main capital block of the Sure Start, early years and child care grant and contributed to the authority's total allocation of &pound;7,167,636 in that block.</p>

The Department then makes adjustments based on audited returns.

	<p pid="a.221W.3/1">From September 2009, all local authorities will roll out an extended 15-hour, flexible, free, early education entitlement to their most disadvantaged children. A year later the rollout will be completed, with every three and four-year-old eligible to receive 15 hours early education free per week, to be delivered more flexibly in response to parental demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.221W.3/2">&pound;590 million has been made available over 2008-11 to fund the additional 2.5 hours per week of provision and more flexible delivery. This funding is over and above that which local authorities currently receive through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for a 12 and a half hour free entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.221W.3/3">Over the same period, &pound;642 million capital funding has been made available to improve the quality and capacity of child care in the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) sector, to help deliver the extension of the 15 hours free entitlement for three and four-year-olds and equip settings with facilities for children with disabilities so there are no barriers for any child accessing child care.</p>
	<p pid="a.221W.3/4">The Government have also committed, from 2011, to funding the cost of all children starting school in the September after their fourth birthday, and the full-time costs (up to 25 hours per week) of those children whose parents would prefer them to be in private or voluntary early years provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.225W.0/1">Local authorities do not retain unspent allocation of the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant (SSEYCG). The Department claws back any unspent allocation of revenue following receipt of audited statements of expenditure. The Department also does this for capital allocations but offers carry-forward of unspent capital each year until the end of March 2011 (2010-11 financial year).</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.0/2">The information requested has been placed in the House Libraries. The SSEYCG allocations for each local authority for the last three years are given in Table 1. The spend by local authorities for the last three years for which figures are available are given in Table 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.0/3">The SSEYCG is not divided into the three categories of <i> (a)</i> Sure Start, <i> (b)</i> Early Years and <i> (c)</i> Childcare Grant and local authorities do not report on that basis. The SSEYCG is made up of broad ring-fenced blocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.0/4">In 2009-10 there were nine blocks: Main Revenue, Sure Start Local Programmes, Disabled Children's Access to Childcare, Two-year-olds Offer, 0 to seven Partnerships Pilots, Work Focused Services, Aiming High for Disabled Children Revenue, Main Capital and Aiming High for Disabled Children Capital. The grant structure is detailed in the Memorandum of Grant which was sent to local authorities' chief executives and directors of children's services on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-19">19 February 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.228W.2/1">Funding for the national roll out of the Primary Capital Programme commenced in April 2009. It follows that very few of the projects to be funded wholly or partly through the programme have actually commenced on site at this stage. I am pleased to confirm, however, that North Yorkshire's county council's Primary Strategy for Change has been approved and funding of &pound;11.97 million to support local delivery over the two year period 2009-11 has been duly confirmed. Decisions about the prioritisation of individual projects are rightly matters for local determination. My officials have been advised following inquiries made to officers at North Yorkshire that building work is expected to commence shortly at the following schools:</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/2" class="indent">Norton Community Primary School</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/3" class="indent">Hinderwell Community Primary School</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/4" class="indent">Barrowcliffe Community Primary School</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/5" class="indent">Friarage Community Primary School</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/6">Although none of these schools are located in the Vale of York constituency, the programme aims to support local authorities in renewing around half of all primary schools by 2023. More detailed information about the work planned can be obtained from the local authority.</p>

Our guidance on this funding includes that authorities which do not have high growth in reception class demand overall, may still apply where they have areas within their borders where there is high growth. We would, however, expect authorities which have high levels of surplus places to justify why these cannot be used to accommodate the additional children.</p>

	<p pid="a.231W.2/21">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the new Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 2004-05 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.2/22">The 2004-05 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.2/23">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above, this does not represent the totality of &quot;education&quot; funding in that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.2/24">The per pupil revenue funding figures for years 2005-06 (baseline) to 2008-09 for East of England local authorities are provided in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.2/25">The figures for 2009-10 are not currently available as figures for grants at a local authority level are still in the process of being finalised. The figures for 2009-10 will be available later in the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.2/26">As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding, a split between primary and secondary schools is not available. The figures below are for all funded pupils aged 3-19 and are in real terms:</p>

This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br/> 2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the ROI form collected by the CLG to the Section 52 form from the DCSF. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made.

Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br/> 6. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br/> 7.

	<p pid="a.234W.5/2">We do not intend to extend this to a national audit to determine the extent, type and condition of asbestos in school buildings. The Control of Asbestos Regulation 2006 places duties on those responsible for the maintenance and repair of non-domestic buildings, including schools, to take reasonable steps to identify the location and condition of asbestos containing materials. The duty holder must then use this information to make a written record and management plan to ensure that the risks of exposure to asbestos are properly managed. A national audit would duplicate these arrangements, and have little or no effect in reducing the health risks associated with asbestos.</p>

	<p pid="a.235W.5/2">Any violence against school staff is totally unacceptable. Our recently published behaviour strategy has at its centre strong discipline and good behaviour.

	<p pid="a.235W.5/3">In addition, we intend to introduce new requirements on schools to record incidents of bullying between pupils, and incidents of verbal and physical abuse against school staff. We will introduce the new legislation in 2010. This new requirement will encourage more widespread and effective reporting, appropriate responses and prevention work. It will also send out a clear message to school staff that the issue will be taken seriously and acted upon.</p>

	<p pid="a.235W.8/1">The Building Regulations Part L2A and L2B set energy performance standards for new and refurbished buildings and the energy efficiency of pumps is regulated in this way. The Department does not directly stipulate energy efficiency standards for circulator pumps either for existing or new buildings. Within our main programme for new schools, the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, our approach is to set targets for carbon emissions by a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.235W.8/2">In addition to these regulatory actions, we have developed guidance to help the designers of all newly built schools achieve their target level of carbon reduction. This guidance encourages the use of energy efficient equipment without being prescriptive about design solutions. Additional funding has been provided to three groups of new secondary schools to enable them to reduce their carbon emissions by 60 per cent: schools within BSF, academies and school projects procured directly by local authorities ahead of their scheduled BSF rebuild (One School Pathfinder schools).</p>

	<p pid="a.238W.5/2">The Department's estimate of the number of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) cannot be disaggregated to local level. However, we can estimate the number of young people NEET using figures drawn from the client management systems maintained by Connexions services. The following table shows the number and proportion of young people aged 16 and 17 who were not in education, employment or training (NEET) in each local authority area at the end of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 based on Connexions data. The first year for which local authority figures are available is 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/3">The figures relate to 16 and 17-year-olds known to Connexions in the December of each year. They are not directly comparable with the national estimates of 16 and 17-year-olds NEET published annually by the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>
