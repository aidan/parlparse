	<p pid="a.1190W.13/2">Figures taken from helpdesk records show that from <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-01">1 May 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-15">15 September 2006</phrase> a total of 910 calls were received on all printers, including the Dell printers. Of these 263 could not be solved by PICT Service Desk and were passed on to Dell for engineering visits. In the early part of the contract a number of the calls logged with Dell were for printers not correctly set up but since the setup was by Dell engineers these were accepted as valid warranty calls.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.13/3">Included in the numbers above will be some repeat calls or visits for the same problem. Call categories range from advice on how to use the equipment, incorrect setup (which can usually be solved either on the phone or by a PICT engineer in Westminster), to mechanical failure which result in a warranty call being made to Dell.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.13/4">A replacement is only undertaken as a last resort and was for less than 15 printers. There have been some cases where PICT have taken a decision to replace a printer and then get the repair done in Westminster to minimise the inconvenience experienced by Members or their staff. The printers are supplied under a hardware warranty for four years with a next business day response. Parliament will have incurred no costs for any repairs or replacements except where the fault has been shown to have been caused by misuse, accidental damage or has been wrongly diagnosed as a hardware fault resulting in unnecessary warranty call being made.</p>

	<p pid="a.1191W.3/3">Biomass co-fired with fossil fuels accounted for 830.7 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent in 2005, whereas coal burned in power stations was 32,617 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent. Allowing for the fact that coal fired power stations also use some oil for lighting up purposes, and that some co-firing takes place in oil fired power stations, biomass accounted for around 2 per cent. of the total fuel burned in coal fired power stations. The biomass used was from a variety of sources including sawdust, wood pellets, waste derived fuels, short rotation coppice, olive cake and pellets, tall oil, palm kernel expeller, palm oil and oil tallow. Statistics for these individual sources and for individual power stations are not available because they would disclose information provided by individual generators in confidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1193W.0/1">DFID's programme promotes the status of women in Afghanistan in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193W.0/2">DFID provided significant support to the election process in 2005 and has worked with the Government to strengthen the role of women in the democratic process. The parliamentary and provincial elections had a strong turn out (43 per cent.) of women voters. Currently, a quarter of the MPs in the Afghan Parliament are women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193W.0/3">DFID's support to the Government's national programmes includes support to enhancing the role of women at community level. For example, the national solidarity programme ensures that women are engaged in determining community development priorities through the formation of community development councils. We also support the Micro-finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA), currently per cent. of MISFA's beneficiaries are women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193W.0/4">Through our Civil Society Challenge Fund (CSCF), we provide &pound;500,000 to Womankind Worldwide for their Women's Empowerment Programme. This initiative aims to empower individual women, women's organisations and wider civil society with the skills and knowledge to claim and exercise their human rights and actively participate in political and civil affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193W.0/5">The Government of Afghanistan is currently working with donors to define its strategy for development over for the next five years (the Afghan National Development Strategy). In that process, gender equality is being addressed as a key theme. The UK is actively working to ensure gender equality issues are fully integrated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1193W.3/1">In financial year 2005-06, DFID spent nearly &pound;50 million developing alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan. This is a tenfold increase on the amount spent in 2003-04. A proportion of this funding is specifically targeted on improving agricultural opportunities for Afghan farmers. This includes research to help identify, test and implement new crops and technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193W.3/2">In addition to developing agricultural opportunities, DFID is supporting non-farm options to ensure sustainable alternative incomes for those who make their living from opium poppy. We are also pursuing innovative ways for farmers to make a living, including apricot drying, honey bee keeping, tailoring and weaving and the introduction of fruit tree nurseries and greenhouses for vegetable production.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193W.3/3">DFID is contributing to the Government of Afghanistan's National Solidarity Programme (NSP) and National Rural Access Programme (NRAP), both of which have rolled out to all provinces in Afghanistan. NSP has created 17,033 community development councils and financed 17,109 community led projects. NRAP is constructing 855km of rural roads. The multi-donor Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA), which DFID also supports, is working in 20 provinces and has disbursed US $81 million in small loans to 197,278 clients.</p>

	<p pid="a.1194W.2/2" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Sustainable Development. The overall DFID programme in China aims to support sustainable development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in three areas: health (TB and HIV and AIDS), basic education, and water supply and sanitation. In addition, DFID actively participates, both in terms of staff time and financial resources, in the UK-China Sustainable Development Dialogue. This is led by DEFRA. The four themes agreed with the Chinese for the next two years are natural resource management (especially forests, water and soils), sustainable consumption and production, capacity building for sustainable development and sustainable urban communities. DFID China is particularly involved in the first three, with all the themes involving collaboration and technical exchanges between different ministries in the UK and China, and a range of small projects involving government, non-government organisations and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.2/3" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Corporate and social responsibility.

	<p pid="a.1194W.5/1">The overall outcomes DFID is seeking to achieve are set out in its Public Service Agreement 2005-08; i.e. eliminate world poverty through the achievement of the Millennium development goals in the countries we work in and with partners within the international system. We aim to implement this through our corporate planning process so that we use our resources both financial and human in the most effective way possible. Each director produces delivery plans which sets out specific plans to achieve and monitor our progress during the year.

It is through this planning process that we ensure we have the right staff in the right place with the right skills.

	<p pid="a.1195W.2/1">After four decades of conflict, Angola is one of the most mined countries in the world. The Department for International Development has been a long-standing supporter of mine clearing operations in Angola. We have provided a total of &pound;1.483 million for mine clearance activities in the country since 2003, and are planning an additional commitment of &pound;825,000 in 2006-07. Around 10 international agencies are presently involved in de-mining in Angola, together with government partners.</p>

Two international agencies involved in this survey, HALO Trust and Mines Advisory Group, are receiving funding from DFID. The Landmine Impact Survey will provide a more comprehensive picture of the presence and impact of landmines in Angola than has been available in the past. This will enable better planning and prioritisation of mine action, as well as monitoring on progress of clearance. Emerging findings are already being used to help the central and provincial government in these areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1195W.5/1">Current climatic variability is already hampering the reduction of poverty and sustained economic growth in Africa. DFID has made a commitment in the new White Paper on International Development to help developing countries adapt to climate change. Much of the available information is at regional level. But more effort is needed to help Africa assess what climate change means for national development. We are funding a number of activities in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.5/2">This year, DFID commissioned a mapping of where greatest climate vulnerability and poverty overlap across Africa (available on-line at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1195W.5/4">A major new research fund on Climate Change Adaptation in Africa will help build climate change knowledge and research skill that can be incorporated into planning in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.5/5">DFID is in the process of implementing several country programme assessments of climate risk. The first of these in Africa will be in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.5/6">In line with commitments made at the G8 summit in Gleneagles, DFID is also working to improve the availability and use of climate risk information in Africa through the Climate for Development in Africa programme. This will strengthen the Global Climate Observation System. In addition, DFID is contributing &pound;20 million over three years through the United Nations to help countries develop national adaptation strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.5/7">DFID also commissioned a review of climate change impacts in Africa as a contribution to an independent review on the economics of climate change led by Sir Nick Stern at the Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="a.1196W.2/1">The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has long been one of world's neglected crises. In February I wrote to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, in support of the UN's ambitious 2006 Humanitarian Action Plan for the DRC, which aims to address better the enormous unmet needs across the country. In this letter I called on other national governments to increase their humanitarian aid to the DRC in the same way that the UK has done. The UK has committed &pound;60 million to the Action Plan over two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1196W.2/2">I visited DRC in September to meet the two presidential candidates in the run up to the second round of elections. I used this visit to call again on other donor countries to increase their support to DRC, in support of a similar plea from Jan Egeland, the UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator.</p>
	<p pid="a.1196W.2/3">DFID and FCO staff make regular representations in DRC, in national capitals and in the institutions of the EU for more, better and longer term development assistance to the DRC. As well as more development assistance to DRC, we need it to be better and more effective. The UK is leading efforts in DRC to improve donor working and impact. For example, in the transport sector we have used our planned support to reach agreement among all major donors on integrating critical maintenance elements into all future roads programmes. We are also trying to find ways of rapidly expanding access to basic social services in the future. These are practical ways to show how we can scale up impact in DRC and give donor partners the confidence to increase their support. We are also working with bilateral and multilateral partners to develop more co-ordinated and coherent strategies for post elections assistance to DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1196W.2/4">The UK's programme of development assistance has increased rapidly in recent years, from &pound;5.6 million in 2001-02 to an available package of &pound;62 million this financial year. We plan to continue increasing this, so long as the peace process remains on track.</p>

	<p pid="a.1198W.9/1">The situation in the Palestinian Territories remains very difficult. Continued Israeli military operations in Gaza, internal violence between Palestinian factions and the strike by Palestinian Authority employees have all contributed to a worsening situation. DFID is keeping close track of the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza through the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.9/2">With technical assistance provided by DFID, UN OCHA is producing a Monthly Humanitarian Monitor report. The most recent report indicates that overall poverty rates have risen marginally, a number of essential drugs are out of stock and that deaths and injuries from violence are continuing. In the West Bank poverty now stands at 66 per cent., up from 62 per cent. in June 2005. In Gaza the poverty rate is 79 per cent., up from 77 per cent. a year ago. Among families that depend on salaries and payments from the Palestinian Authority (PA) poverty has risen more steeply (46 per cent. now, up from 33 per cent. in June 2005). 14 per cent. and 22 per cent. of essential drugs are out of stock in Gaza and the West Bank respectively. 77 Palestinians were killed and 266 injured in the West Bank and Gaza during August due to Israeli military operations. 12 Palestinians were killed and 55 injured in intra-Palestinian violence. The Monthly Humanitarian Monitor is available at <a href="http://www.ochaopt.org">http://www.ochaopt.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.9/3">OCHA has reported that 75 per cent. of medical staff and 90 per cent. of teachers are on strike. In the West Bank only critical medical cases are being received at governmental hospitals and health clinics. Most public schools have not re-opened for the new school year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.9/4">DFID has made up to &pound;12 million available to meet Palestinian basic needs through the Temporary International Mechanism. &pound;9 million has been allocated to specific programmes to provide (i) essential medicines and health supplies; (ii) operations, maintenance and repair costs for water, sanitation and electricity services; and (iii) income for the poorest Palestinian Government workers, including teachers, who have suffered a severe loss in income over recent months. DFID has also provided &pound;15 million to support Palestinian refugees in the region, though the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1199W.2/1">The European Commission has confirmed that &euro;37.4 million have so far been disbursed through the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM). Since the TIM was established 97,000 Palestinians have received direct allowances. These allowances have supported health care workers, teachers and the most vulnerable citizens in Palestinian society. Over 2.4 million litres of fuel have been provided for emergency generators at water pumping stations, waste water facilities, hospitals and health centres in Gaza. This has enabled essential services to continue after damage to Gaza's only power station in an Israeli airstrike.</p>

	<p pid="a.1200W.0/1">The Government consider that the role played by the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) in promoting sustainable private sector development is an important part of supporting the middle east peace process. During the UK presidency last year, two projects were approved by FEMIP for the west bank and Gaza Strip. These were &euro;10 million in risk capital for credit guarantees and a &euro;45 million loan for electricity upgrading. However, as with many donor-funded projects in the west bank and Gaza this year, FEMIP has been unable to implement these projects. This is because the Hamas government has so far not met internationally agreed principles for renouncing violence, recognising Israel, and accepting previous agreements and obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1200W.0/2">A review of FEMIP is due to take place by the end of 2006. This will set out options for the future of FEMIP, including on how to strengthen its effectiveness in achieving social and economic objectives. The report has not yet been finalised. The UK will work to ensure that future FEMIP operations in Euromed countries are consistent with and supportive of the peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1200W.0/3">The European Community has provided funding to pay the fuel costs of Gaza power station this year. This continued until the power station was put out of service in an Israeli missile attack in June. My Department is providing &pound;3 million through the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) for operation, maintenance and repair work to keep water, sanitation and electricity services running in west bank and Gaza Strip. The European Community has allocated &euro;15 million through the TIM to pay for fuel for emergency generators. These are ensuring that health, water and sanitation services can continue in Gaza after the Israeli missile attack on the power station.</p>

	<p pid="a.1200W.3/1">Following the Agreement on Movement and Access in November 2005, the EU agreed to undertake an on-site Third Party monitoring role at the Rafah (Gaza-Egypt) crossing. The Border Facilitation Mission has been in place since <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase>. However, the Agreement on Movement and Access has not been fully implemented by Israel or by the Palestinian government. We hope that Israel will act on its commitments in the Movement and Access agreement and that the Palestinian government will facilitate this by committing to non-violence, recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the Roadmap.</p>
	<p pid="a.1200W.3/2">Additionally, at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, the G8 agreed to support the Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement, James Wolfensohn, in his intention to stimulate a global financial contribution of up to $3 billion per year over the coming three years. The intention was that a pledging conference could take place in spring 2006, provided that progress had been made on political and economic issues. However this has not happened. Following the formation of a Hamas Government, the UK, European Community and other donors have suspended direct aid to the Hamas government until it complies with the principles set out by the Quartet. The commitments made at Gleneagles remain should the political situation change.</p>

	<p pid="a.1202W.2/1">The African Union (AU) seeks to achieve African economic integration using regional economic communities (RECs) as building blocks. DFID supports the AU's approach to regional economic integration by providing support both to pan-African institutions (AU and the New Economic Partnership for African Development) as well as to RECs in Southern, West and East Africa.

	<p pid="a.1202W.5/1">We are concerned about the continuing conflict in the Casamance province of Senegal, which has been affected by violence and instability for the past 24 years. Whilst DFID has not carried out its own assessment of the developmental impact of this conflict, it is clear that those living there have suffered greatly, development has been undermined, and there have been significant repercussions for the neighbouring countries of Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.5/2">During the current outbreak of violence, which began in August, international aid agencies estimate that around 10,000 people have been internally displaced by the fighting, while a further 5,000 have crossed into the Gambia. Many of these people are now receiving humanitarian assistance, although it is proving difficult to deliver relief to those still trapped by the fighting. We are in close contact with agencies on the ground and remain ready to provide support if the situation deteriorates further.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.5/3">The UK supports long-term peace building efforts in the region through the interdepartmental African Conflict Prevention Pool. We are considering support, this year, to Concern Universal's long running programme in Casamance and the Gambia, which is focused on mitigating the negative social and economic effects of the conflict through cross-border networking, conflict resolution, peace building and infrastructure rehabilitation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1204W.3/1">Africa's infrastructure deficit and poor condition of existing infrastructure significantly hampers Africa's ability to trade both regionally within Africa and beyond. Good infrastructure reduces transportation costs and delays in moving goods. Recent research shows that in one third of all African countries, transportation costs account for more than 25 per cent. of the total value of exports&mdash;and in Uganda they exceed 70 per cent. A 10 per cent. reduction in transport costs can increase trade by 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/2">Trade-related infrastructure includes rural and international roads, railways, ports and airports, telecommunications, energy and water. Well managed small towns also serve as a vital link between local, national and international markets. Enormous investment is needed to extend and improve Africa's infrastructure base. The Commission for Africa Report estimates that countries need to spend around 5 per cent. of GDP on infrastructure investment and a further 4 per cent. on operation and maintenance. This means a requirement for an additional $10 billion/year by 2010&mdash;a doubling of existing expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/3">DFID played a leading role in launching the Africa Infrastructure Consortium in October 2005. Working closely with African partners, the Infrastructure Consortium's role is to address both national and regional constraints to infrastructure development and broker financing for infrastructure projects that strengthen regional integration, economic growth and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/4">Last month, the Chancellor and I announced that we expect UK spending on Aid for Trade, including economic infrastructure, to increase to $750 million by 2010. A major proportion of this will flow to Africa, including funding for transport, energy, ports and communications.</p>

	<p pid="a.1204W.6/1">The UK funds the International Development Association (IDA), the arm of the World Bank Group that provides grants and concessional loans to the poorest countries. The latest UK contribution was to the fourteenth replenishment of IDA (IDA 14). The agreements governing this funding are set out in the IDA Resolution No. 209 (&quot;Additions to Resources: Fourteenth Replenishment&quot;) which was adopted by the Governors of the World Bank in April 2005. Parliamentary approval for the UK contribution was given under The International Development Association (Fourteenth Replenishment) Order 2006 [Statutory Instrument 2006 No 1071], which came into force in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.6/2">The UK has committed &pound;1.43 billion to IDA 14, and this is payable over the three year period July 2005 to June 2008. I made &pound;100 million of this contribution dependent on the Bank working more effectively with other donors and on reforming the way it attaches conditions to its assistance. These conditions are set out in the IDA Resolution: Schedules to Attachment 1. The &pound;100 million was due to be paid in two equal tranches of &pound;50 million. Following its fulfilment of the conditions for the first tranche, we paid &pound;50 million to the World Bank in July 2006. Payment of the second tranche of &pound;50 million, which is due in April 2007, is subject to fulfilment of the following conditions (set out in Schedule B):</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.6/3" class="indent">Review by the Executive Directors of the Association of (i) a monitoring framework for harmonisation including a series of key indicators drawing on the results of the DAC High Level Forum (HFL-2) and (ii) baselines established by the Association for such indicators; and adoption by the Association of such monitoring framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.6/4" class="indent">Determination by the Executive Directors of the Association that satisfactory progress has been made against the baselines established for such harmonisation indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.6/5" class="indent">Determination by the Executive Directors of the Association that satisfactory progress has been made in implementing the recommendations in the 2005 Review of World Bank Conditionally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.6/6">I told the Bank last month that I would not agree to the &pound;50 million being paid until I had seen the evidence that it was making serious efforts to implement the recommendations of the conditionally review. The recommendations centred on the Bank observing five good practice principles when it agrees the conditions attached to its assistance. The first of these principles is ownership, and the review reaffirmed the Bank's commitment not to impose policies, including privatisation and trade liberalisation, on developing countries. In July 2006, the Bank produced a report on what it had done to implement the good practice principles. The report contained some good examples of where the Bank had sought to apply the principles, but there was not enough information to reach a judgment on how consistently and effectively they had been applied. I emphasised to President Wolfowitz at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Singapore last month the importance I place on the Bank ensuring these principles are consistently implemented in all its programmes, and that I expected a more detailed report. President Wolfowitz agreed to produce another more detailed report by the end of November.</p>

	<p pid="a.1206W.0/1">The UK, along with other donors, has repeatedly expressed serious concern about Operation Murambatsvina, through which the government of Zimbabwe displaced some 700,000 of its own people from their homes and/or livelihoods, as reported by UN Special Envoy Anna Tibaijuka following her visit to Zimbabwe last year. The government of Zimbabwe has consistently denied the extent of the humanitarian tragedy that resulted from those actions, and has shown no interest in discussing housing issues with donors. In addition to Operation Murambatsvina the UN estimate that some 800,000 people have lost homes and/or livelihoods as a consequence as the consequence of the fast track land reform process. No substantial progress can be made on housing without the government of Zimbabwe rethinking its policies on land ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.1206W.0/2">Some UN and other international agencies and non-governmental organisations have managed to gain access to many of the victims. We have provided over &pound;1.8 million to date to support the work of these organisations. There is a substantial ongoing need for assistance to vulnerable and mobile populations from Operation Murambatsvina and other causes such as former farm workers from commercial farms. DFID recently committed a further &pound;5 million to the International Organisation for Migration and &pound;1.1 million to NGOs to support their work in Zimbabwe addressing the needs of mobile and vulnerable populations, including the provision of temporary shelters.</p>

I will shortly be announcing Natural England's budget for the coming year and I will again emphasise the importance of continuing to make progress on our biodiversity commitments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1211W.3/1">The Department's policy is to control common ragwort and other injurious weeds, where there is a threat to animal welfare or agricultural activities. It is not Defra policy to eradicate ragwort entirely, as we recognise it forms an important habitat and food source for many insects. It is the responsibility of all land managers, including local authorities, to control the spread of weeds from land under their control. There is no specific financial assistance available from Defra for this task.</p>
	<p pid="a.1211W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-25">25 May</phrase>, I wrote to the Highways Agency, Network Rail and the Local Government Association reminding them of the need to control injurious weeds on their land where there is a risk to horses and other livestock.</p>
	<p pid="a.1211W.3/3">The Code of Practice on how to prevent the spread of Ragwort was published in July 2004 and has been made widely available to public and private land managers. It provides comprehensive guidance on how to develop a strategic and more cost-effective approach to weed control. It is intended for use by all landowners and occupiers, but is particularly relevant for large-scale organisations managing significant land areas, including local authorities and public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1211W.3/4">It gives advice on identification of common ragwort, risk assessment and priorities for ragwort control, control methods their suitability and efficacy, environmental considerations, and health and safety issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1211W.3/5">To complement the Code of Practice, in September 2005 Defra also published guidance on disposal options for Common Ragwort. This includes information and advice on rotting down, composting, incineration, controlled burning, and landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1211W.3/6">Copies of the Code of Practice and the guidance on disposal are available from Defra Publications (telephone: 08459 55 6000) and are on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/horses/topics/ragwort.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/horses/topics/ragwort.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1212W.2/1">People have access to the beach around much of the coast, but this access is uncertain and it is often not based on clear legal rights. There is much less access to the coastal land behind the beach, to sand dunes and cliff tops and marshes, which also provide that great sense of freedom and well-being that coastal land can bring. There is no clear route all the way around the coast.</p>
	<p pid="a.1212W.2/2">We are looking at possible options for extending access to coastal areas, to really benefit people and allow them to get out and enjoy our wonderful coastline, while taking full account of nature conservation issues. Natural England is currently undertaking fact finding and investigating options and will make recommendations by the end of December. We will then issue a consultation paper in early 2007 setting out the facts, a range of options and the costs and benefits associated with each.</p>

The Act does not apply to CCTV filming purely within a private house/garden, but where the camera's field of operation extends beyond the private property, individuals caught on the film&mdash;where it is possible for the operator to distinctly identify them from the footage&mdash;have a right of access to the film under s7 of the Act.

	<p pid="a.1219W.5/3">The principles that the court must follow when determining the seriousness of an offence are set out in statute. The court must consider the offender's culpability in committing the offence and any harm which the offence caused, was intended to cause or might forseeably have caused. Any previous convictions, where they are recent and relevant, should be regarded as an aggravating factor which should increase the severity of the sentence. The Sentencing Guidelines Council published a guideline on &quot;Overarching Principles: Seriousness&quot; in December 2004, which is binding on all courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1219W.9/18">It is not possible to give figures for the last 30 years since the form apprenticeships have taken have changed meaning any time-series would not be consistent. Britain has a long tradition of apprenticeship, however from the mid 1960's numbers fell from 243,700 in 1966 almost dying out completing during the 1980's with only 53,000 participating by 1990. The current apprenticeship programme was launched in 1994 to address skill deficiencies at intermediate level, aimed both to expand and update existing apprenticeship schemes whilst promoting structured training in those occupations, industries and sectors with no tradition of offering apprenticeships. The table above gives numbers since this current format of apprenticeships (Level 2) and advanced apprenticeships (Level 3) was introduced and became fully operational.</p>

	<p pid="a.1220W.5/2">The Department for Education and Skills plans to replace the requirement on English local authorities to hold a separate child protection register with a requirement that local authorities can record within their electronic recording systems for children's social care whether a child has a child protection plan. These systems will replicate all the information currently held on child protection registers. This arrangement is due to be implemented in April 2008 but a final date will not be set until we are confident that all local authorities have secure systems in place to hold these records. This means that this separate arrangement to record that a child has a child protection plan will coexist with and be separate from the information sharing index.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.5/3">The information sharing index will be a tool enabling practitioners delivering services to children to identify and contact one another easily and quickly, so they can share relevant information about children who need services. It will contain only basic information on all children in England (such as name, date of birth, address, education setting), and a facility for practitioners to indicate that they wish to be contacted in relation to a child because they have information to share, are currently taking action, or have undertaken an assessment. The index will not hold assessment or case information nor any indication that the child is on a child protection register.</p>

	<p pid="a.1222W.2/50">Local authorities were responsible for the registration and inspection of children's day care facilities until these responsibilities were transferred to Ofsted in September 2001. Therefore the figures for child care places for 2003-06 are not directly comparable with the day care figures for 1987-2001. The figures for 2003-06 were derived from the Ofsted database of registered child care providers. The figures for 1987-2001 were derived from the Children's Day Care Facilities Survey, which was discontinued in 2001. There are no figures for 2002 because the period from September 2001 to March 2003 was designated as a transitional period where Ofsted, as a by-product of its inspections, validated the actual number of individuals and organisations that were providing child care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1222W.2/51">With the introduction of the National Day Care Standards and the transfer of responsibilities for registration and inspection of child care providers from local authority social service departments to Ofsted in September 2001, child care places were classified according to the type of day care provided: full day care, sessional day care, childminder, out of school day care or cr&egrave;che day care. Ofsted have produced figures based on this classification on a quarterly basis from March 2003. Their latest figures were published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-27">27 July 2006</phrase> in their report &quot;Registered Childcare Providers and Places, <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June 2006</phrase>&quot;, which is available on their website, <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications">www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1222W.2/52">Up until March 2001, child care providers were classified according to the type of provider: day nurseries, playgroups and pre-schools, childminders, out of school clubs and holiday schemes. Figures based on this classification were published in a series of statistical bulletins, which are available from the Department's website, <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/statistics">www.dfes.gov.uk/statistics</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1224W.8/2">Home Office strategies include use of the Register of Education and Training Providers owned by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), introduction of the Student Task Force to coordinate intelligence and visits to suspect institutions and changes to the Immigration Rules to prevent students remaining in the UK for long periods on low level short courses or using the student route to remain in the UK after their leave in another temporary capacity has expired.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.8/3">The DfES Register is a register of education and training providers and any education provider assessed as non-bona fide for the purposes of the rules is removed from the DfES Register. An overseas student will not be granted leave to enter or remain in the UK unless the education provider is included on the DfES Register.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.8/4">Where the Student Task Force identifies a college that does not meet the bona fide requirements for the purposes of the Immigration Rules it requests the DfES to remove that college from its Register.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.8/5">In the future, the introduction of the points-based system for managing migration into the UK will make the student route more robust by putting sponsorship and compliance at the heart of our processes. Under the PBS, a new register of education sponsors, building on the DfES Register, will apply more stringent requirements to educational institutions such as the responsibility to report non-attendance and non-enrolment and to cooperate with compliance visits. We will also require all private institutions to be accredited by an independent body to ensure that only legitimate institutions providing quality education enter on the new register. The Home Office and DfES are currently working on which bodies will be suitable for these purposes.</p>

These include the criminalisation of torture, a new police code of conduct and regional elections which addressed the concerns of Kabylie groups about under-representation. Amnesty International's report of its most recent visit to Algeria in May 2005, acknowledges that there has been progress on strengthening safeguards to protect detainees in custody and a fall in the number of allegations of torture in custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.1238W.3/2">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has paid tribute to President Bouteflika for the changes he has brought about in Algeria. In a referendum in 2005, the Algerian people voted for a 'Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation'. The Charter, which came into force in February 2006, granted an amnesty to those convicted of terrorist offences or prepared to surrender themselves to the security service. More than 2,000 terrorist prisoners have been released. In addition, the Charter provides for the families of victims of terrorism to register the disappearance or death of their relative and obtain compensation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1239W.6/1">No projects have been funded on ending the use of children as camel jockeys under the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Global Opportunities Fund. The FCO's Human Rights Project Fund co-funded an Anti-Slavery International project to end the use of camel jockeys. This project was focused mainly on Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It ceased on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1239W.6/2">In 2005 Qatar issued a law banning the employment, training and use of children under the age of 18 in camel races. In the UAE a presidential decree was issued banning the use of boys who were under 16 years of age. The Ministry of Interior replaced the camel racing federation as the organisation responsible for regulating the sport. New measures have been introduced such as stringent immigration checks and a requirement for all children to have their own passport. Breaching these rules will result in a fine and persistent offenders may receive a jail sentence. The UAE also signed an agreement with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) whereby UNICEF will process the registration, repatriation and integration of camel jockeys in their home countries. This venture is entirely funded by the UAE. Both countries have also conducted successful tests into the use of robot jockeys.</p>
	<p pid="a.1239W.6/3">We are not aware of any reports of abuse since the new legislation was passed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1244W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not held discussions with UN counterparts about the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). Officials are in regular contact with a range of interlocutors, including at the UN and ICTR, about all aspects of the Tribunal's work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/2">The UK is a strong supporter of the work of ICTR and contributed over &pound;4.5 million towards its budget in 2006-07 through UN assessed contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/3">By the end of 2006, ICTR will have completed 32 cases. To date, 31 judgements have been handed down, 26 individuals have been convicted and five acquitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/4">We are concerned about the high costs of ICTR and keen to ensure that the Tribunal sticks to its agreed completion strategy. Nonetheless, our assessment is that ICTR and other international criminal tribunals, continue to play an effective and essential role in the international community's efforts to combat impunity for the perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. This work takes place in parallel with efforts to strengthen domestic justice systems in post-conflict situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.6/5">The work of ICTR has provided valuable insight into the operation of an international tribunal. This experience is already being drawn upon in the work of other international tribunals and courts. Examples include the success of ICTR's outreach programme in making the work of the court more accessible to the Rwandan people and its involvement in capacity building in the Rwandan justice sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.11/1">During 2006 and particularly over recent months, the security situation in Sri Lanka has deteriorated. The humanitarian situation is now very serious. As a result of the recent violence there are now over 200,000 additional internally displaced persons (IDPs). The Department for International Development has provided over &pound;500,000 in additional relief through the UN and the Red Cross.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.11/2">There have been allegations of serious human rights violations by all parties to the conflict. It is essential to establish the truth of such allegations. We therefore welcome President Rajapkase's initiative for a national commission to inquire into recent killings, disappearances and abductions in Sri Lanka and a panel of international observers to oversee the process. It is important that the investigations are thorough, credible and provide a proper basis where necessary, for due legal process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.11/3">We and EU partners continue to make clear to the Government and to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that the only viable way to a peaceful resolution of this tragic conflict is for both sides to negotiate, and to work constructively towards a settlement that addresses the grievances and legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lankans. We continue to call on both sides to support the 2002 cease-fire agreement in deed as well as word.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.11/4">The Sri Lankan President has convened an All-Party Conference to consider options for a long-term settlement. We support the aims of the Conference and hope it can deliver a way forward for the peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.11/5">We welcome the recent proposal for talks between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE over 28-<phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase> in Geneva and urge both sides to participate in good faith, and to talk constructively about the cessation of the hostilities now, and for the longer-term. We strongly support the efforts of the Norwegian Government on the talks currently proposed and on their ongoing facilitation of the peace process. We remain in close contact with them.</p>

Overall migrants make a net fiscal contribution to the UK. In many cases, Accession workers are supporting the provision of public services in communities across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254W.6/2">A paper entitled 'The Impact of Free Movement of Workers from Central and Eastern Europe on the UK Labour Market' (2006) published by the Department for Work and Pensions, suggests that the impact of migration from the new EU member states has been broadly positive, reflecting the flexibility and speed of adjustment of the UK labour market. The authors also found no discernible statistical evidence supporting the view that the inflow of A8 migrants is contributing to a rise in claimant unemployment in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.1264W.7/1">The chief executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has written to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.7/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.7/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the introduction of bus lanes on Belfast's main arterial roads in reducing the number of cars; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.7/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.7/5" class="indent">I should explain that bus lanes are only one of a number of factors which influence the public's choice between travelling by bus or by private car. Other factors such as the price of fuel, car parking costs and availability, the convenience of public transport and the general level of disposable income, all influence commuters choice of travel mode. It is therefore impossible to directly attribute any change in car numbers solely to the availability of bus lanes on Belfast's main arterial routes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.7/6" class="indent">As bus lanes were part of a package of measures provided to improve bus journey times and reliability, perhaps a more useful measure of their effectiveness is the level of bus patronage over any particular period of time. Overall Citybus/Metro patronage has increased by 20.5% over the 2 year period between 2003/04 and 2005/06. In addition, since the introduction of Metro in February 2005, Translink have recorded a 14% increase in patronage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.7/7" class="indent">While I appreciate we cannot attribute all of this growth in patronage to the introduction of bus lanes, it is, nevertheless, an encouraging trend which we hope to improve upon.</p>

	<p pid="a.1268W.3/1">United Kingdom immigration service does not collate separate figures for Northern Ireland and so it is not possible to provide figures in response to this specific question.</p>
	<p pid="a.1268W.3/2">One individual was arrested by the Police Service of Northern Ireland in 2005 on suspicions of people trafficking but charges were subsequently withdrawn. There is no confirmed evidence of trafficking into Northern Ireland nor has anyone been convicted of people trafficking in Northern Ireland. However law enforcement agencies in Northern Ireland are aware of the potential problems and are maintaining appropriate procedures and checks to ensure that any attempt to engage in human trafficking can be detected and dealt with effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.1275W.0/1">Information about local authorities' actions under homelessness legislation, which includes the number of households living in temporary accommodation, is summarised in the Department's quarterly Statistical Release on statutory homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.0/2">The latest Release, covering statistics to the end of June 2006, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-11">11 September</phrase>. Copies are available in the Library, and from the DCLG website at: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1002882">http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1002882</a>&amp;PressNoticeID:=2234</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.0/3">The duty owed by local authorities to a person accepted as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available. As an alternative to the provision of temporary accommodation, some authorities arrange for households to remain in their current accommodation (homeless at home), until a settled solution becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.0/4">Table 6 in the Statistical Release shows the number of households in temporary accommodation arranged by local authorities, as at the end of June 2006 (the latest date for which information is available).</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.0/5">Table 9 shows the number of households that, during the quarter, left temporary accommodation provided by the authority (or who were no longer registered as &quot;homeless at home&quot;), split by the length of stay in seven broad time bands ranging from 'under six months' to 'five years or more'. These households will either have been provided with some form of settled accommodation, or have left the accommodation voluntarily, ceased to be eligible or become intentionally homeless.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.0/6">Figures on average rent charged by local authorities or private landlords to households in temporary accommodation are not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.1278W.5/1">Six staff in the Women and Equality Unit are working to advance the implementation of the Women and Work Commission recommendations across Government and will produce a report on progress in spring 2007. The exemplar employers are employers from both the public and private sectors, representing large and small employers from a range of sectors, who have initiatives which address the causes of the gender pay gap. The initiatives cover a range of issues including working in schools to inform girls about careers in their sector, equal pay reviews, women's networks, support for women returners, and career pathways for part-time workers. A full list of employers and details of the good practice initiatives is currently being compiled and will be published in due course.</p>

However there are proposals arising from provisions in the Police and Justice Bill that will repeal the requirement for the audit and strategy and replace them with a six-monthly strategic assessment. The findings of this assessment will in turn will feed into an annual rolling three-year plan. All CSPs and CDRPs have an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator in post to ensure that those strategies genuinely reflect the needs of the community served by partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="a.1284W.3/1">Neighbourhood Watch and other Watch schemes have an important role to play in empowering local people to help reduce crime, tackle antisocial behaviour (ASB) and reduce the fear of crime in communities throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/2">Although the Home Office does not provide funding to Neighbourhood Watch or other Watch schemes, support is provided in other ways, for example through the provision of free literature, public liability insurance, training and advice. Home Office officials also offer advice to Neighbourhood Watch schemes who request information on ASB issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/3">Neighbourhood Watch schemes are advised to work closely with their local police forces and Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) who can provide advice and support on local issues such as ASB.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/4">It is for local agencies to decide on the most appropriate intervention to tackle ASB swiftly and effectively based on their knowledge of what works best locally. We do encourage agencies like CSPs to adopt a tiered approach with a blend of measures to provide a proportionate response. Tools such as warning letters, Acceptable Behaviour Contracts and injunctions should generally be used before reaching for an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO). It also requires a twin track approach based on the principles of both enforcement and support. The key aims of any intervention are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/5" class="indent">enable the individual to recognise the consequences of their behaviour;</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/6" class="indent">ensure that they change their behaviour; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/7" class="indent">protect victims, witnesses and the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/8">Section 115 of the Crime and Disorder Act (CDA) 1998 also provides partnerships with the ability to share information with partner agencies. Tackling crime, ASB and misuse of drugs depends upon robust information exchange between all the agencies involved in a CSP. Provisions in the Police and Justice Bill currently before parliament will amend Section 115 of the CDA 1998 so that the current power to share will become a duty to share.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/9">When fireworks are misused or a person acts in an antisocial manner during Halloween or Guy Fawkes, like any time of the year we are determined that their behaviour is challenged and we have provided the tools and powers to ensure this happens. As well as the standard ASB tools and powers the Fireworks Regulation 2004, made under the Fireworks Act 2003 induced a comprehensive package of measures to restrict the supply, use and possession of fireworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1284W.3/10">In preparation for this year's period during September the Respect Task Force published guidance for police, local authorities and other practitioners setting out the current range of tools and powers to tackle firework misuse.

	<p pid="a.1289W.5/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) provides information about the numbers of domestic burglaries and vehicle-related thefts in England and Wales. The BCS can provide a better reflection of the true extent of crime because it includes crimes that are not reported to or recorded by the police. The BCS count of crime includes crimes against adults (aged 16 or over) living in private households. The numbers of domestic burglaries and vehicle-thefts for the last five years, based on the BCS, are displayed in table 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.1289W.5/2">Based on the BCS the numbers of domestic burglaries have decreased by 24 per cent. between 2001-02 and 2005-06 BCS. According to the latest BCS (2005-06) there were 733,000 domestic burglaries in England and Wales, compared with 969,000 domestic burglaries based on the 2001-02 BCS. The numbers of vehicle thefts have also decreased. The numbers of vehicle thefts have fallen by 31 per cent. from 2,494,000 (2001-02 BCS) to 1,731,000 (2005-06 BCS).</p>
	<p pid="a.1289W.5/3">The BCS also provides information about the proportions of crimes that are reported to the police. Approximately half of vehicle thefts and just over six out of 10 domestic burglaries are reported to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.1289W.5/4">Police recorded burglaries in dwellings have decreased from 430,347 in 2001-02 to 300,555 in 2005-06. The numbers of vehicle thefts recorded by the police have fallen from 983,276 to 721,469 over the same period. Police recorded burglaries in dwellings and vehicle-thefts are included in table 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1289W.5/5">This information was published by the Home Office in the Crime in England and Wales 2005-06 publication. This information is available in the Library, and via Home Office website <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/crimeew0506.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/crimeew0506.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1295W.5/1">In April 2003 the Prison Service introduced a shadow Key Performance Indicator (KPI) on accommodation to improve the number of offenders leaving prison with accommodation. Since the introduction of the shadow KPI which became a full KPI in April 2005, the percentage of prisoners released with accommodation has risen from 54 per cent. in 2003-04 to 87 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="a.1304W.2/2">In the table, the figures for 2004 exclude information on the number of juvenile prisoners arriving from courts in London and the south-east, as this information is unavailable. In 2005 an additional 963 prisoners were delivered from courts in London and the south-east, however the number arriving after 7pm is not known.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/3">A number of factors contribute to prisoners arriving after 7pm at Huntercombe. These include late court sittings, delays in placement orders from the Youth Justice Board, courts listing juvenile cases late in the day and prison population pressures, all of which have a significant impact on the number of prisoners being redirected to establishments further away from their usual catchment area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.2/4">The Prison Escort and Custody Services continue to discuss improvements to performance with its Criminal Justice System partners. Courts are being encouraged to list juvenile cases earlier in the day so that juveniles can be escorted from court.</p>

	<p pid="a.1313W.0/1">Communities, local authorities and the police have identified the illegal use of mini motos as a major problem and have raised this with the Respect Task Force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.0/2">As part of an awareness-raising campaign about action that can be taken anywhere to tackle the antisocial and illegal use of mini motos in public spaces, the Respect Task Force made some limited funding available for an education and enforcement campaign over the summer. With funds restricted to around &pound;10,000 per area, the Respect Task Force invited its trailblazer and action areas (List 1) to bid for financial support. Both Wolverhampton and Sandwell in the Black Country were contacted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.0/3">Bids were assessed on the capacity of police to deploy extra policing in hotspot areas and to deliver an information campaign to better inform parents and children about the laws governing mini motos.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.0/4">Money was allocated to 28 areas (List 2) who responded to the invitation and who demonstrated a joint commitment by the local authority and police to tackle a locally identified mini moto problem. In some cases, police were able to extend their campaign beyond the local authority action or trailblazer areas. Neither Wolverhampton nor Sandwell submitted bids to the Respect Task Force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.0/5">The campaign has provided information to children and parents, supported frontline staff through the purchase of police trial bikes, cameras and the use of signposts and barriers to prevent mini moto access to public places.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.0/6">Participating areas collected data throughout the campaign such as use of powers, number of complaints, community impact and successes of the operation in order to gauge the impact of the campaign. These data are currently being evaluated by the Respect Task Force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.0/7">The Respect Task Force is committed to supporting any area experiencing problems with mini motos. We have produced guidance to practitioners on tackling mini moto misuse and a leaflet for the public and retailers. In addition, help for any practitioner is provided through our action line and website and the Respect Task Force can also facilitate action days in individual areas to train and inform practitioners and the police about how to tackle a wide range of antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.1320W.3/2">The range of spectacles carried by an optician's practice is not within the scope of the national health service (NHS) general ophthalmic services contract. However, the system of NHS optical vouchers is designed to give patients maximum choice in deciding where to purchase spectacles and thereby promote access to a wide range of spectacles.</p>
	<p pid="a.1320W.3/3">The system of NHS optical vouchers provides help in buying spectacles or lenses for children, those on low incomes and individuals requiring complex lenses. The voucher scheme gives eligible patients flexibility over which spectacles or lenses to choose. Patients are able to take their voucher to the provider of their choice so are able to shop around from a wide range of providers to obtain the spectacles. The scheme also gives patients flexibility to top up the voucher value (if they wish) to obtain more expensive frames of their choice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1323W.2/2">Over the last year, NHSBT has been communicating with unions and staff about these challenges. There have been many contacts with staff representatives, including Amicus during this period. The national joint staff consultative committee has met a number of times this year and there have also been meetings at national level, involving staff representatives and senior NHSBT executives and the chairman.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.2/3">As part of NHSBTs commitment to keep staff and staff representatives informed, the NBS indicated last month that its current view was to rationalise processing and testing into three main centres. These draft proposals will not impact upon the service to hospitals and there are no proposals to close any blood donation sessions. The NBS will continue to provide critical services to hospitals (such as continuing to have a network of local blood banks to meet orders for blood) and is looking to broaden the choice of places where people can donate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.2/4">The NBS currently has 15 centres from where it distributes blood to hospitals, and reconfiguration of these will be considered in the strategic proposals. The NBS will continue to maintain a network of centres, hold stocks and issue blood to hospitals from near to or in most of its current locations. These proposals will be presented to the NHSBT board later this year and build on a series of communications to staff and staff representatives about the future of the NBS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.2/5">In July, the NHSBT chairman and chief executive briefed the full time staff side officers on the challenges facing NHSBT this was subsequently communicated to other staff representatives and staff. This briefing included that the NBS expected to work towards a network of fewer, larger processing sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.2/6">NHSBT continues to meet and discus these plans with staff representatives, including Amicus. In addition, there will be a programme of discussions with staff representatives as detailed plans are developed over the three year period of the strategic plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.2/7">NHSBT also contacted those hon. Members who have a blood centre in their constituency, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.2/8">NHSBT remains committed to keeping all those with an interest, including hon. Members informed of developments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1332W.2/1">The Government agreed to implement the European Working Time Directive (WTD) as United Kingdom legislation to improve the health and safety and working lives of all employees. The vast majority of staff groups have been covered by the 48-hour week since 1998. The Government negotiated an extension to the WTD for doctors in training to enable phased implementation from August 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.2/2">Local national health service trusts are responsible for assessing the impact of the European Working Time Directive as part of their health and safety obligations. And while implementation of the European Working Time Directive is the responsibility of local NHS trusts, the Department of Health in England continues to work with the health professions and NHS employers to provide joint guidance and support to local organisations including sharing learning from previous lessons learned, and funding new pilot projects in support of the full implementation of doctors in training from August 2009.</p>
