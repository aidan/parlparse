	<p pid="a.915W.3/3">The Serjeant at Arms was appointed on a three year contract starting in December 2004. Following the Tebbit review of the management and services of the House, involving a re-allocation of duties (including the creation of a new post to direct key support services and facilities for Members and others) and after careful consideration the Speaker accepted the House authorities' recommendation not to approve renewal of the contract. Further details on implementation of the Tebbit recommendations are contained in my answer to another question today from the Chairman of the Administration Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.919W.0/1">DFID has not made its own assessment as it relies on the assessment of the IMF and World Bank, which administer HIPC. According to the Annual Report of the World Bank and IMF Boards in May 2006 the Republic of Congo's overall progress in the necessary reforms has been limited and slow. There have been improvements in the management of forestry, the social sectors and health, as well as in developing a poverty reduction strategy. However, there has been limited progress in procurement, debt management, the oil sector and civil society involvement in reducing corruption. There has been no progress in strengthening public investment management.</p>

	<p pid="a.920W.11/1">We are very clear that something has to and will be done to improve New Street station.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.11/2">This is fully recognised within the proposed funding provision for the railway for the next planning period (2009-14) and the funding elements for major improvements for the rail related aspects of Birmingham New Street station have today been announced as being given high priority by government.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.11/3">The proposals of Birmingham city council and its partners seek a very significant investment commitment from the public purse. The Department is therefore scrutinising these proposals carefully and has asked for information to ensure that the funding sought from government represents best value.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.11/4">This information includes alternative proposals for optimising the benefits of public investment and clarification of proposals for ensuring that the public sector's contribution is set at the right level.</p>

	<p pid="a.922W.6/13">It is the responsibility of local planning authorities to identify and release land for housing as part of the planning process. This means that the requirement for the provision of social housing will need to be negotiated and agreed with the local planning authority. The Government have implemented a number of initiatives to assist with land supply for housing. A Register of Surplus Public Sector Land held by central Government bodies has been established. English Partnerships review the sites on the register to identify those which could have the potential for housing development. As at June 2007 there were over 700 sites on the register. Sites are continually being added as they are identified as surplus by landowners and removed once expressions of interest are received after a site has been marketed.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.7/1">Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 contains a number of offences covering acts intended or likely to stir up racial hatred. These include: use of words or behaviour or display of written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting; publishing or distributing such written material; presenting or directing a public performance of a play involving the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; distributing, showing or playing recordings of images or sounds which are threatening, abusive or insulting; providing, producing, directing or appearing in a programme service involving threatening, abusive or insulting visual images or sounds; and possessing threatening, abusive or insulting written material or recordings of visual images or sounds with a view to displaying, publishing, distributing or playing them in a programme service. Anti-Semitic hatred is covered by these offences as Jews are defined as a racial group. The maximum penalty for inciting racial hatred is seven years' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.7/2">In addition to the range of existing incitement offences, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created nine racially-aggravated offences, including assaults, criminal damage and harassment, which make available to the courts higher maximum penalties where there is evidence of racist motivation or racial hostility in connection with the offence. The Act also requires a judge or magistrate dealing with any offence which is racially-aggravated to state in open court that they have found it to be so aggravated, and therefore meriting an increased sentence.</p>

This applies both to the local authority level of Eastbourne and the county level of East Sussex. Due to changes in the measure of antisocial behaviour, police force area data comparable to the national figures are only available for 2004-05 to 2006-07, and the national measure of perceptions of ASB only back to 2001-02.</p>

	<p pid="a.936W.2/1">The Government are currently taking forward a very full range of work which will continue to reduce violent crime. We have, for example, recently passed the Violent Crime Reduction Act, which gives the police and local communities the powers they need to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/2">Southampton is one of the areas included in the Tackling Violent Crime Programme, through which the Home Office is working intensively with practitioners in a number of local areas with high levels of more serious violent crime, to support their efforts to reduce alcohol-related crime and domestic violence, to improve police and other agencies' performance and partnership working, and to improve local strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/3">Southampton was also the first area in the South East to adopt a violence prevention initiative based on Accident and Emergency Unit information sharing. This follows a successful model of community violence prevention developed in Cardiff, which has demonstrated that hospital A&amp;E intelligence can be pivotal in directing violence reduction initiatives, and ultimately reducing the harm caused by violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/4">Sexual violence is also a priority. Funding has been provided this year for the Southampton Rape Crisis and Abuse Centre, a registered charity providing support, advocacy, counselling and therapy, and for No Limits, Southampton, an organisation which provides information, advice and counselling services for young people. Two independent sexual violence advisers, who provide targeted professional support to victims of sex crimes, are based in Southampton.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/5">Southampton Safe City Partnership are engaged in, and sponsor, a range of initiatives, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/6" class="indent">Improved crime recording and analysis</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/7" class="indent">Domestic violence advocacy to assist victims and reduce repeat offending</p>

	<p pid="a.947W.5/2">Government considers that it is essential that radioactive waste is stored safely and securely at all times pending its disposal, in line with HSE requirements on Nuclear Site Licensees and the recommendations of the independent Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM).</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.5/3">In response to CoRWM's 2006 recommendations, the NDA is reviewing the adequacy of waste storage arrangements across its sites, focusing on the service life of facilities required to accommodate waste until a disposal facility is available. In a separate study NDA's contractors have been looking at possible opportunities to optimise intermediate level waste storage. The preliminary view is that there may be opportunities to consolidate storage at some NDA sites using facilities that are already in site baseline plans, as well as opportunities for minimising waste generation. There are currently no plans for new stores located off NDA sites. The outcomes of these studies will inform the review of the NDA's Strategy, which it expects to begin during 2008. The NDA's Strategy will be the subject of public consultation and subject to approval by Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.948W.8/1">Recent research<sup>(1)</sup> carried out on DEFRA's behalf, suggests that it is generally better, in carbon and energy terms, to recover energy from waste wood than to recycle it, with either option being far better than landfill. It estimated that 16 per cent. of waste wood in the UK is currently recycled and 80 per cent. landfilled.</p>
	<p pid="a.948W.8/2">No specific assessment has been made of the reasons for the current level of wood recycling.

	<p pid="a.948W.8/3">Most waste wood is, however, unsuitable for recycling and the waste strategy for England 2007 sets out the Government's intention to recover more energy from wood that would otherwise be landfilled. DEFRA's waste implementation programme is taking forward a programme of work to develop energy markets for waste wood by addressing the informational and practical barriers to expansion.</p>

These requirements do not at present require that the boxes have a return path but nor do they rule it out. The requirements will be kept under review throughout the process of switchover by an emerging technologies group, which will assess the case for changes, including the possible provision of a return path, based on their usability and cost-effectiveness, and will, where appropriate, recommend that DCMS and the BBC amend the requirements.</p>

There is a PSA target to increase the percentage of 5-16 year olds participating in a minimum of two hours high quality PE and school sport each week to 85 per cent. by 2008. The 2005-06 annual survey of schools in school sport partnerships showed that 80 per cent. of children and young people were already doing so.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-13">13 July 2007</phrase> the Prime Minister announced an additional &pound;100 million funding to increase this offer to five hours per week of sport for children and young people aged 5-16, plus three hours per week for young people aged 16-19, by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.953W.3/1">Buildings account for 45 per cent. of total UK carbon emissions&mdash;27 per cent. from homes and 18 per cent. from non-domestic buildings&mdash;so reducing emissions from buildings will be a vital contribution to delivering our overall target of reducing UK carbon emissions by 60 per cent. on 1990 levels by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.3/2">Despite recent growth in the number of domestic and office appliances, heating is still the major use of energy in buildings&mdash;around 75 per cent. of building energy consumption relates to space and water heating&mdash;so insulation, draught-proofing and efficient heating systems and controls are key to delivering significant energy efficiencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.3/3">Existing programmes and policies such as Decent Homes, Warm Front, and the Energy Efficiency Commitment, and information and advice from the Government-funded Energy Saving Trust and Carbon Trust continue to encourage and support energy efficiency refurbishments of existing buildings. These programmes have already had a significant impact on the existing building stock. The latest annual report on the English House Condition Survey, published in June this year, found that the average energy efficiency rating of the housing stock had progressively improved from 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.3/4">In addition, we will shortly begin to roll out the requirement for Energy Performance Certificates and air conditioning inspections which will provide building owners and occupants, for the first time, with information on the energy performance of their buildings and what can be done to improve their performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.3/5">We are currently consulting on proposals for a new three-year Carbon Emissions Reduction Target to run from 2008 to 2011 that would double the activity under the existing Energy Efficiency Commitment that comes to an end in 2008. We announced, in the Energy White Paper in May this year, our intention to introduce a new cap and trade scheme, the Carbon Reduction Commitment, for large organisations to provide a greater incentive for them to take up energy efficiency measures and to consult on a proposal to roll out advanced and smart metering services to all but the smallest business users.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.3/6">We are also looking at how to further improve the targeting of advice to households to encourage energy efficiency improvements and we are reviewing what other measures could be taken to improve non-domestic buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.959W.8/2"><i> </i>The Department does not have a comprehensive estimate of the number of former armed forces service personnel that are homeless, but it does collect information on statutory homelessness from local authorities (which cover some ex HM forces personnel).</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.8/3">Information about local authorities' actions under homelessness legislation is collected quarterly at local authority level, in respect of households rather than people.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.8/4">Information reported includes the number of households accepted by local authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty. The duty owed to an accepted household is to secure suitable accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.8/5">Based on information supplied by local authorities for 2006-07, around 50 households accepted as owed the main homelessness duty in England were in priority need primarily as a result of being vulnerable through having served in HM forces. Some authorities also report secondary priority need categories (when an household falls in to more than one priority need group), and there were an additional 40 households reported here. In total, this represents 0.1 per cent. of all acceptances in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.8/6">In the same year, around 200 households accepted as owed the main homelessness duty cited the reason for loss of their last settled home as having left HM forces, representing 0.3 per cent. of acceptances.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.8/7">A table has been placed in the Library which shows the number of household acceptances who have (i) the primary and (ii) the secondary priority need of being vulnerable through having served in HM forces, and (iii) cited the reason for loss of last settled home as having left HM forces. The data are provided for all local authorities, including Leeds, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.8/8">It is important to note that many of those households with the HM forces priority need may also have the reason for loss of having left HM forces accommodation, and so there is likely to be some overlap between the two sets of figures.</p>

	<p pid="a.976W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.2/2">We have carried out two Tackling Underage Sales of Alcohol Campaigns (the most recent of which included a 10-week operational phase which concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-13">13 July</phrase>) through which police and trading standards officers have targeted over 3,000 potential problem premises that break the law by selling alcohol to under-18s. These national campaigns make use of tough sanctions available under newly commenced legislation to prosecute the premises licence-holder, where there are persistent sales of alcohol to children. Prior to this, we carried out four national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns (AMECs) between 2004 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.2/3">As a consequence of these test-purchase campaigns, retailers have strengthened their procedures and training of staff in relation to alcohol sales. Most retailers have now adopted the 'Challenge 21' policy, whereby anyone appearing to be under 21 is asked to produce a valid form of identification prior to any sale of alcohol. Test-purchase failure rates have dropped accordingly, indicating that it is increasingly difficult for under-18s to purchase alcohol illegally. During AMEC one in 2004, the overall test-purchase failure rate was 50 per cent. By AMEC four in the summer of 2006, it had reached 29 per cent. and 21 per cent. for the on- and off-licence trade respectively, and 18 per cent. for supermarkets. In addition, the Licensing Act 2003 also increased penalties for selling alcohol to children with the maximum fine increasing to &pound;5,000 on conviction, and the possibility for courts to suspend or order forfeit of personal licences on a first offence as opposed to a second conviction, as was previously the case.</p>

Special care: care given in a special nursery, transitional care ward or postnatal ward, which provides care and treatment exceeding normal routine care. Some aspects of special care can be undertaken by a mother supervised by qualified nursing staff. Special nursing care includes support for and education of the infants parents. 2. Level 2 intensive care: (high dependency intensive care): care given in an intensive or special care nursery, which provides continuous skilled supervision by qualified and specially trained nursing staff who may care for more babies than in level 1 intensive care. Care includes support for the infant's parents. 3. Level 1 intensive care: (maximal intensive care): care given in an intensive or special care nursery, which provides continuous skilled supervision by qualified and specially trained nursing and medical staff. Care includes support for the infant's parents. 4. Definitions of general and birth episodes General episode: A general episode is any episode which is not covered under other episode types. Other episode types include birth episodes, delivery episodes, patients formally detained under the provisions mental health legislation or long term psychiatric patients, other birth events and other delivery events. 5. Birth episode: A birth episode is the hospital episode that commences at birth. If a baby is transferred from another episode or re-admitted to hospital after discharge this new episode will not be classified as a birth episode, regardless of the age of the baby. 6. FCE An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year. 7. Data quality Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for Health And Social Care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. 8. Ungrossed data Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed). <i> Source:</i> HES, The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

If the person does not register (if qualified) and continues to use the title, the HPC can issue a 'cease and desist' letter. In most cases this action has been effective and the HPC says that it has not yet had to prosecute a case.

Data are collected on the disposal, i.e. paid, fine registration certificate issued etc.). However, because of the time taken for the procedures for payment to be enforced, the data are collected approximately nine months later than the period of issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.11/2">2005 data will be available in the 2006 publication &quot;Offences relating to motor vehicles, England and Wales, Supplementary tables&quot; which is expected to be published in 2008. 2006 data will be in the 2009 publication.</p>

	<p pid="a.1009W.0/4" class="indent">Death certificates record the place where a person dies, but not where any infections may have been acquired. It is not possible from the information on a death certificate to know whether an infection was acquired in the hospital or other place where a patient died. Patients are often transferred between hospitals, nursing homes and other establishments and may have acquired infections in a different place from where they died.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009W.0/5" class="indent">ONS does not receive information on 'healthcare-acquired infections' but special analyses of deaths involving two infections that are often associated with healthcare, MRSA and Clostridium difficile, are undertaken annually by ONS for England and Wales. The most recent figures were published in reports in Health Statistics Quarterly 33 in February of this year. This publication is available in the House of Commons library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009W.0/6" class="indent">The table below provides data on the number of death certificates of persons normally resident in East Sussex on which MRSA and Clostridium difficile were mentioned, from 1996 to 2005, the latest year for which figures are available. Breaking these figures down to local authority lever risks identifying individuals, and so figures can not be provided for Eastbourne.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009W.0/7" class="indent">Figures are reported in Health Statistics Quarterly for deaths involving MRSA and Clostridium difficile by place of death, including general hospitals and nursing homes. These figures show that in England and Wales around 90 per cent of these deaths occur in NHS general hospitals. Breaking down the number of deaths in East Sussex by place of death would risk identifying individuals. Figures by place of death can therefore not be provided for either East Sussex or Eastbourne.</p>

In the context of a rapidly changing world, the CSR would undertake a fundamental examination of the balance and pattern of public expenditure, and identify the investment and reforms necessary to equip the UK for the decade ahead. The Government announced that departments budgets for 2007-08 would be unaltered from those previously announced and that the next CSR would conclude in 2007, setting departments budgets for the years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11.

	<p pid="a.1014W.5/4" class="indent">Table 1 gives estimates of the numbers of UK and foreign nationals of working age and the numbers and rates of economic activity for the three months ending December in each year for 1997, 1999 and 2001 to 2006. Comparable estimates are not available for 1998 and 2000. These estimates are not seasonally adjusted. The data shown are based on labour force survey (LFS) household population and not the total UK population to enable consistent economic activity data to be shown. It should be noted the LFS data shown by nationality:</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/5" class="indent">excludes those who have not been resident in the UK for six months</p>

	<p pid="a.1014W.5/9" class="indent">is consistent with population estimates published in spring 2003 which are significantly lower than the latest population estimates and also the headline labour market statistics published each month by the Office for National Statistics; LFS estimates by nationality for the period requested are not yet available consistent with latest population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/10" class="indent">Table 2 gives estimates of the economically inactive people split by those who want a job and those who do not want a job. A further disaggregation for those who are long term sick or disabled is also shown. These data are for the three months ending December 2006, and are not seasonally adjusted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/11" class="indent">Estimates for economic inactivity for EU member states are available from the Eurostat website which is accessible via the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.5/12" class="indent">The LFS estimates at the detailed level required for this answer are only available consistent with the UK population estimates published in February and March 2003 and do not yet incorporate the more recent population estimates that are used in the headline labour market series.</p>

	<p pid="a.1021W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, for what reasons the Child Support Agency ceased its policy of charging a fee for use of its services in 1995; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021W.3/5" class="indent">The Child Support Agency ceased to charge fees for its services in 1995. The Child Support Fees Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992/3094) which covered the amount and circumstances in which fees could be charged were subsequently revoked in 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021W.3/6" class="indent">As the 1998 Green Paper 'Children First' explained, the decision to firstly cease applying these regulations and to later revoke them was based on concerns about the unacceptable levels of service the Agency was providing. The regulation making power within the Act was retained to allow for the reintroduction of fees once the Agency could provide a level of service that would warrant it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1023W.8/1">In January 2005, the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit published their report, 'Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People'. The report set out the Government's vision and made recommendations relating to disabled children, young people making the transition to adulthood, employment and independent living.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.8/2">The Office for Disability Issues was established in December 2005 and is working across Government to improve outcomes for disabled people, including through a ministerial group and the board of management, both of which bring together a range of Departments to oversee delivery of the Government's strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.8/3">The chapter of the Life Chances report which considered employment did not make any specific recommendations relating to parents with disabled children. However, proposals set out in the July 2007 Green Paper, 'In Work, Better Off' are intended to make better use of the new deal approach for people who claim benefit as unemployed and are actively seeking work but who face significant barriers to finding work, including caring responsibilities at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.8/4">More recently, the joint HMT/DfES children and young people's review, 'Aiming High for Disabled Children: Better Support for Families', published in May 2007, looked at how services can provide greater support for families with disabled children. The report's findings are feeding into the comprehensive spending review and will be implemented through a cross-Government framework.</p>

This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.2/4" class="indent">Work trials were first introduced in 1989, since when they have formed part of an overall and constantly evolving package of measures to assist employers meet their recruitment needs. Until 2000 we did not routinely capture detailed management information on work trials. Since then, we have recorded information on the number of customers undertaking a work trial, but not the number of people confirmed permanently in the job. Our success in helping people into work is measured in terms of the number of people who leave benefit and move into work, but this is not broken down specifically to identify those securing a job through the help of a work trial.</p>

	<p pid="a.1032W.3/1">The employment and deployment of support staff, together with any training required in order to take up a post, is a matter for schools or local authorities to determine as the employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.3/2">Support staffs, including teaching assistants, play an important role in schools, often working closely with pupils with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities. In recognition of this, the Training and Development Agency for Schools (IDA), which has responsibility for the training and development of the whole school workforce, has developed national occupational standards for teaching/classroom assistants. These contain elements relevant to working with pupils with SEN or particular educational needs. National Vocational Qualifications at level 2 and 3 are based on these standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.3/3">In addition, the TDA has also developed induction training materials for teaching assistants and introductory training materials for other support staff working in primary and secondary schools. Both sets of materials contain discrete modules covering inclusion, SEN and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.3/4">The professional standards for higher level teaching assistants (HLTAs), for which the IDA is also responsible, require HLTAs to know how to support learners in accessing the curriculum, in accordance with the SEN code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.3/5">All schools can use their own budget to fund the training and development of their staff. They also receive a school development grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. This can include sending teaching assistants on specialised training courses. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, in certain circumstances, to provide specific training and development in relation to SEN and disabilities. The TDA also provides local authorities with grant funding to support candidates through the HTLA training and assessment process.</p>

	<p pid="a.1034W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.5/2">The Government believe that mediation can offer considerable advantages over going to court in the settling of family disputes, especially where children are involved, irrespective of how cases are funded. To support and encourage mediation, we have established the Family Mediation Helpline and supporting website. The Helpline telephone number is 0845 60 26 627 and the website address is <a href="http://www.FamilyMediationHelpline.co.uk">www.FamilyMediation Helpline.co.uk</a>. We have sponsored a public awareness campaign; are facilitating judicial awareness seminars and supporting in-court referral schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.5/3">Provisions of the Children and Adoption Act 2006 will enable the court to direct parties in child contact disputes to attend a meeting about mediation. Referrals will also be encouraged through changes to court forms, particularly in relation to disputes over children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.5/4">The Legal Services Commission's revised Family Fee scheme will remove the financial disincentives for solicitors to make referrals to mediation. Under the scheme, it will be in the interests of the solicitor to make a referral to mediation and to do so at an earlier stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.5/5">The Ministry does not set targets for mediation because we do not think that a target in this area would be desirable. There are certain cases which are unsuitable for mediation because there is an imbalance of power between the parties. We do not wish to see such cases, which include those where one of the parties has been subject to domestic violence, forced into mediation. In addition, while we can advise parties about the benefits of mediation it would be a breach of the parties' human rights to prevent them having their case heard in court.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.5/6">Finally, neither this nor predecessor Departments have received any representations from children's charities regarding mediation in family disputes.</p>

This stipulates the issues that schools are required to cover at each of the four key stages. Beyond this, the Department's 'Sex and Relationship Education Guidance' outlines how schools can deliver a broader programme of SRE using the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). The guidance provides information on the issues to be covered in both primary and secondary schools, but it is for individual schools to determine their own SRE policy, including how SRE is delivered and when.

	<p pid="a.1038W.2/1">One of the three overarching objectives in the National Languages Strategy, published in 2002, was an entitlement that by 2010 all 7 to 11-year-old pupils will be able to learn a language at least in part in class time. Already some 70 per cent. of schools are providing primary languages within class time, so are making excellent progress towards this goal. We have backed this by action on a range of fronts including: training over 2,000 primary teachers with a languages specialism and aiming to train 6,000 by 2010; committing &pound;49 million over 2006-07 and 2007-08 to support the introduction of primary languages; developing new schemes of work for French, German and Spanish; and setting up the Primary Languages Training Zone, an interactive website for teachers, school leaders and trainers involved in the delivery of primary languages.</p>
	<p pid="a.1038W.2/2">In October 2006, we commissioned a languages review, which was chaired by Lord Bearing and which reported in March 2007. We have accepted Lord Dearing's recommendation that languages should become a compulsory part of the primary curriculum when it is next reviewed. This will mean that all pupils will learn languages for seven years. We hope that learning languages earlier will inspire children with a love of languages and motivate them to continue learning languages post-14.</p>
	<p pid="a.1038W.2/3">Music and Art and Design are compulsory National Curriculum subjects for all five to 14-year-olds. To begin to realise our aim that every primary pupil who wants to should have an opportunity to learn a musical instrument the Government have invested &pound;30 million in primary instrumental and vocal tuition over the last two years. We are putting a further &pound;10 million this year into a national singing programme aiming to make singing an integral part of every child's school day. The Government are investing &pound;36.5 million this year in the creative partnerships programme which promotes schools working with creative artists.</p>

	<p pid="a.1039W.2/2">Comparable figures for maintained secondary schools constructed in recent years are unavailable centrally. But a typical cost per pupil for construction of a 1,000-pupil maintained secondary would be in the range of &pound;18,750 to &pound;22,900 per pupil, excluding site acquisition costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1041W.2/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families has advised all local authorities and fire brigades that we expect new schools to be fitted with sprinkler systems in future. However, the decision as to whether or not to install sprinkler systems will be based on a risk analysis and there may be a few cases where new schools are at a low risk of fire and where sprinklers would not represent good value for money. The risk analysis and cost benefit analysis tools we have recently published to help clients decide whether or not to install sprinkler systems in schools can also be used to determine whether or not an existing school should have sprinklers fitted, as part of a refurbishment project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041W.2/2">In the autumn we will be publishing a standard specification for Sprinkler Systems in schools in our Standard Specifications Layouts and Designs series of guidance documents. Also, in August, we will be publishing the new Building Bulletin 100 Designing and Managing against the Risk of Fire in Schools which will be the normal means of compliance with Building Regulations Part B. This will include comprehensive guidance on when to install sprinkler systems in schools.</p>

These include tailored curriculum frameworks, guidance for teachers, assessment materials, teaching and learning materials, and a framework for understanding dyslexia. We have also tested the entire Skills for Life learning infrastructure to ensure it properly supports LLDD learners, and commissioned a training programme for staff in the sector.</p>

Friend the Minister of State for Science and Innovation at DTI on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June</phrase> concerning overall Government spend on nanotechnology. Estimated Government support for nanotechnology work over the last 10 years amounts to around &pound;408 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.5/3" class="indent">(i) A portfolio of 26 Nanotechnology Collaborative R and D projects is being supported, which brings together business and academia to undertake joint research that has a future commercial use. Funding of &pound;14 million since 2004 (against &pound;32 million total project costs) has been provided to consortia involving business and academia, with business providing just over half of the funding; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.5/4" class="indent">(ii) The network of 24 UK-based Nanotechnology Centres, with a total budget of &pound;54 million over five years, provides open access facilities to enable companies (particularly SMEs) to use expensive pieces of equipment to test new ideas and prototypes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.5/5">Additionally, EPSRC currently funds 167 research grants classified as having a significant nanotechnology component that have a formal collaboration with UK industry. These grants have a total value of &pound;86 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.1053W.0/1">In Angola there is an independent press and a few radio stations that are free to voice criticism of the Government. However, in the provinces the Government-run media largely dominates media coverage. There is only one independent nationwide broadcaster, Radio Vorgan (run by the main opposition party, Uni&atilde;o Nacional para a Independ&ecirc;ncia Total de Angola (UNITA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1053W.0/2">The Government of Angola is taking measures to reform the judiciary and associated legislation, much of which pre-dates the civil war, which ended in 2002. Our embassy in Luanda has sponsored three projects in conjunction with the Bar Association of Angola to assist in the development of the judiciary. We welcome the Government's introduction of a new press law, which is currently in preparation and will provide more scope for independent reporting. Both the Constitutional Law and the Penal Code are also under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053W.0/3">There is complex legislation relating to the registration of political parties which is rigorously enforced. There are 12 opposition parties represented in Parliament. The UNITA congress is currently under way in Luanda and has received coverage in the independent and Government-run media. Representatives of other smaller political parties and members of the Diplomatic Corps have also attended the congress. We welcome the Government's announcement that legislative and presidential elections will be held in 2008 and 2009 respectively and continue to monitor the political landscape closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053W.0/4">The Government of Angola have taken several steps to improve transparency in public financial management. Internationally qualified auditors conduct rigorous cost and fiscal audits for all oil companies, including the national oil company, Sonangol. A new procurement law is being drafted. A Court of Auditors was created in 2001, which helps to review and audit public expenditure allocations and has handed down embezzlement sentences. However, much still needs to be done, not only on transparency of public financial management, but also on strengthening Government accountability to the people. We continue to encourage the Government of Angola to sign up to the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.1054W.11/1">It is a condition of employment that members of the Diplomatic Service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) provisions for children's education are intended to help staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054W.11/2">We expect children who accompany their parents on postings overseas to use free state schooling if it is available locally and suitable. If suitable English-language schooling is not available free of charge locally, but is available at fee-charging schools, we refund fees to enable children to receive the education they would be entitled to in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054W.11/3">With staff and their families having to move at regular intervals, sometimes at short notice and at times which may disrupt schooling for their children, and education facilities at posts overseas varying (or not being available at all), continuity of education can be problematic particularly during the important exam years. The FCO's continuity of education allowance addresses this problem by enabling children to board at schools in the UK as long as their parents remain subject to the world-wide mobility obligation and take up postings overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054W.11/4">The amount we spent in the financial year 2006-07 on providing education in independent schools for children whose parents are temporarily based in the UK is &pound;7.6 million. The total amount we have spent on continuity of education allowance for staff in the UK and overseas during the financial year 2006-07 is &pound;13 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.1060W.2/1">Sanctions are most successful when implemented multilaterally. The EU has an effective arms embargo in place covering the whole of Sudan. The existing UN arms embargo, established in UN Security Council Resolution 1591, applies to rebels in the whole of Sudan, but to the Government of Sudan (GoS) in Darfur only. Amnesty International and the Panel of Experts have reported that all sides are violating the UN arms embargo. Such reports highlight the limitations in the UN arms embargo.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060W.2/2">Sanctions are an important tool for applying pressure on the Sudanese Government. We consider that it was the threat of further UN sanctions that persuaded the Sudanese Government to agree to the hybrid AU-UN peacekeeping force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-12">12 June</phrase>. This is a significant achievement and an important step towards restoring stability, the protection of civilians and ensuring full humanitarian access in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060W.2/3">We will maintain pressure on the GoS and rebels, and will pursue further targeted sanctions against any party that obstructs progress on the peacekeeping force, ceasefire, political process or humanitarian access.</p>
