	<p pid="d.462W.3/1">Our policy is that electricity generated from bioliquids, including at the microgeneration level, can be eligible for support under the renewables obligation as long as the bioliquids pass the mandatory sustainability criteria. For every megawatt of electricity produced from bioliquids, generators currently receive: 1.5 renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) for dedicated bioliquids, 1 ROC for fossil derived bioliquids such as FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) biodiesel, 0.5 ROCs for co-firing and 2 ROCs for fuels made through advanced pyrolysis. We expect to publish a consultation shortly which will set proposals for support for bioliquids and other renewable technologies in the renewables obligation from 2013. The consultation will be accompanied by an impact assessment which will assess the impact of the proposals on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
	<p pid="d.462W.3/2">Use of bioliquids as a household fuel, including conversion of existing boilers, is not currently supported under the renewable heat incentive (RHI) or the renewable heat premium payment. As stated in the RHI document (published in March) we are considering whether to support bioliquids as part of developing the second phase of the RHI scheme. As in the case of the renewable obligation, an impact assessment will be produced which will assess the impact of the proposals on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

	<p pid="d.463W.5/1">Drilling depths for shale gas will be specific to the drilling location. However shale gas exploration drilling is only taking place in a small number of locations within the UK at present. The most active drilling area and the only one where hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for shale gas has been carried out is at Cuadrilla's site near Blackpool. Two exploration wells have been drilled, the deepest to a depth of 10,775 feet, and a further well is currently being drilled. Fracking has only taken place at one site&#8212;at depths of between 6,550 and 8,823 feet. Again, fracking depths will be dependent on the well location and the depth and size of any shale seam encountered.</p>

	<p pid="d.464W.6/2">Reprocessing of Magnox fuel remains the most viable and cost effective option for the management of Magnox fuel. The forecast completion date of Magnox reprocessing has been extended for operational performance reasons to around 2017. The Magnox extension means that completion of Magnox Operating Plan (MOP) and recovery of Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR) breeder material, through the Magnox reprocessing plant, are now on comparable timescales. Reprocessing of DFR breeder material accelerates remediation of the material by utilising an existing mature technology, which reduces programme, engineering and cost risk whilst meeting security and cost optimisation objectives. Further details on the case for DFR Breeder reprocessing can be found on the NDA website at:</p>

However, the &quot;renewable output&quot; of a generating station is reduced to take into account &quot;input electricity&quot; if the input electricity used by the generating station in generating the output electricity exceeds 0.5% of the total amount of the output electricity. This is set out in Article 25(1) and (2) of the Renewables Obligation Order 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.477W.8/1">Sanctions imposed by the EU on Syria are aimed at putting pressure on President Assad and his regime to stop the killings and repression of the Syrian people, and allow for their legitimate aspirations to be met. These sanctions have also set pace for action in the wider international community. The recent decision by the EU to impose a ban on the purchase, import or transport from Syria of crude oil and petroleum products, where the EU previously imported well over 90% of Syria's crude oil, has deprived the Syrian regime of a major income stream to help fund its repression.</p>
	<p pid="d.477W.8/2">Sanctions are not aimed at the Syrian people but at those responsible for the regime's violent repression. They are also aimed at those who support or benefit from the regime's violence: these people must recognise the consequences of their actions and step away from the regime.</p>

Moreover, our proposed abolition of the unpopular regional strategies, through the Localism Bill, will remove top-down pressure on councils to review the extent of their green belt.

	<p pid="d.486W.7/1">The Government are funding research to understand the current state of the electoral register which will help us to better understand the way in which the move to individual registration will have an impact.</p>
	<p pid="d.486W.7/2">The Government will do everything they can to maintain the completeness of the electoral register. This includes phasing in the move to Individual Registration over two years so that people on the register who do not apply under the new system do not lose their vote at the 2015 General Election. Every eligible elector will be asked in 2014 to register under the new system: this will include personal invites to people on the register, inquiries to households where no one is registered or people have moved, reminder letters and face to face doorstep canvassers. There will also be a publicity campaign run by the Electoral Commission and we are testing data matching to identify people missing from the register and looking at how we can increase the choices people have over how to register, including greater use of online registration.</p>

If a member of staff broke the law (for example by parking illegally, exceeding the speed limit, using a mobile phone when driving) they would be obliged to pay any fine themselves. The Department's policy makes it clear that managers must not reimburse any costs associated with breaking the law.</p>

	<p pid="d.495W.6/1">There are a number of initiatives at national, regional and local levels which encourage young people to join their local cadet unit. These include websites for each of the Cadet Forces, activity on social networking websites and recruiting events in local communities. However, the best recruiting tool is the enthusiasm of cadets themselves, encouraging their friends to join so they can take part in the exciting and challenging programmes our Cadet Forces offer. In the case of the Combined Cadet Force, the head teacher's support is key and we bolster this support through regular briefings and our work with the Combined Cadet Force Associations. Furthermore, last summer the Minister for Defence Personnel Welfare and Veterans, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40548" name="Andrew Robathan">the Member for South Leicestershire (Mr Robathan)</phrase>, commissioned a review into Defence's Youth Engagement activities which will include related issues.</p>

Visits are not always for export purposes, however Ministers travelling overseas will promote defence and security exports wherever appropriate. Support to defence exports is enshrined in Military Tasks and is an important part of the RAF Engagement Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="d.499W.2/1">The Asylum Improvement Project was set up to explore new ways to speed up the processing of asylum applications. We have already seen improvement outcomes from this project which include:</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/2">replacing the old PSA target with a new performance framework to ensure that the whole system remains in balance;</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/3">introducing better, shorter guidance for case owners on sensitive issues, including gender;</p>

	<p pid="d.499W.2/5">The improvements that we have made to our processes have already had a positive impact on performance:</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/6">Eurostat statistics show that in June 2010 there were nearly 7,720 asylum seekers waiting for a decision on their application. In July 2011 that had reduced to 5,670 and this is despite an increase in applications.</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/7">We are making decisions more quickly. On average 59% of applications now receive a decision within 30 days.</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/8">Our internal audit process shows that the quality of our decisions has remained high.</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/9">The cost of the asylum support system has been reduced by over &#163;100 million in the last year.</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/10">Removals are getting faster. 19% of asylum seekers are now removed within 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/11">We continue to pursue an ongoing programme of innovation and reform to ensure that the asylum system delivers swifter, higher quality case conclusions, delivered at significantly lower cost to the taxpayer.</p>

However, selected cardholders in the former Tribunals Service were authorised to withdraw cash for the purposes of reimbursing appellants expenses. The process was strictly controlled at the business unit level and monitored by district managers to ensure compliance with the process.

	<p pid="d.516W.2/1">There is no fixed limit on the number of police or court cells that could be used to hold prisoners, as the number that can be made available at any one time depends on the occupancy levels required to deliver their primary function. If these places are required the number that will be made available will be determined jointly by NOMS and ACPO for police cells, or NOMS and HMCTS for court cells.</p>
	<p pid="d.516W.2/2">The maximum cost per night of a police cell used under operation safeguard is &#163;400, although the actual price charged will normally be less. The pricing structure for police cells is set out in the Safeguard National Framework Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.516W.2/3">The pricing of court cell contingencies is determined by commercial contracts with a number of private sector organisations. Because of the confidential nature of these contracts it would not be appropriate to publicly release these costs.</p>

The Ministry of Justice does not hold information on the total numbers of repossessions of property (including where keys are handed back voluntarily).</p>
	<p pid="d.534W.2/2">These figures represent the numbers of claims leading to orders being made. This is more accurate than the number of orders, removing the double-counting of instances where a single claim leads to more than one order. It is also a more meaningful measure of the number of homeowners who are subject to court repossession actions.</p>
	<p pid="d.534W.2/3">These figures do not indicate how many properties have actually been repossessed. Repossessions can occur without a court order, such as where borrowers hand the keys back to the lender. Also, not all possession orders result in repossession. Many orders are suspended and if the borrower complies with the repayment arrangements set out in the suspended order the property will not be repossessed.</p>

This will primarily affect England and Wales. A Languages Services Framework Agreement with a single supplier was signed by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-24">24 August 2011</phrase>. As a result, parts of the National Agreement will be dis-applied to organisations inside the MoJ framework.</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/2">The Ministry has received representations from a wide variety of individual interpreters, translators and their representative organisations throughout our consideration of this issue. We held a series of four roadshows, in autumn 2009 in London, Cardiff, Manchester and Newcastle, which sought attendees' views on the strengths and weaknesses of the current arrangements and how to bring about improvements. A general email address has been available since February 2010 to allow interested parties to submit views direct to the project team and ask questions.</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/3">In August 2010 various interested parties were notified of the Government's intention to embark upon a procurement process and there were meetings with some of those interested parties, including interpreters' and translators' representative bodies. The Ministry sought views on our specific proposals as they had emerged from the competitive dialogue process, which was undertaken between <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-30">30 March 2011</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-04">4 May 2011</phrase>. We continue to receive, consider and respond to correspondence from interested parties and groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/4">The procurement exercise for the Language Services Framework Agreement was undertaken via a competitive dialogue process. There were several stages to this process:</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/5">(A) A Pre-qualification Questionnaire;</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/6">(B) Invitation to submit an Outline Solution;</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/7">(C) Invitation to submit a Detailed Solution;</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/8">(D) Invitation to submit a Final Tender.</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/9">126 suppliers were invited to submit a pre-qualification questionnaire. 77 accepted the invitation and 58 fully completed one. Their responses were evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="d.535W.0/10">12 suppliers were invited to participate in the competitive dialogue itself, because they met the pre-qualification criteria. These were:</p>

	<p pid="d.542W.5/1">The London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) is a private company operating independently of Government responsible for staging the games. In August 2011, after a competitive procurement process, LOCOG appointed Dow Chemical as the supplier of the stadium wrap. As with all LOCOG's contracts, the wrap must comply with LOCOG's sustainable sourcing code and be consistent with high standards of environmental responsibility. Dow Chemical is a Worldwide International Olympic Committee (IOC) Olympic Partner and therefore, one of 11 &#8220;TOP&#8221; partners for the London 2012 games.</p>

	<p pid="d.542W.8/1">The Government and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) established the Nations and Regions Group to ensure UK-wide engagement and to maximise the legacy from London 2012. This group works directly with representatives from each of the nations and English regions to realise the sporting, economic, and cultural benefits of the 2012 games.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.8/2">Kent stands to gain from the wide range of opportunities created by the 2012 games, through businesses winning games-related work, increased tourism and cultural celebrations. Some examples of how the South East, and specifically Kent, will benefit from the games are given below.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.8/3">Over 19,800 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for LOCOG's London 2012 education programme, Get Set; 3,020 schools and colleges are registered in the South East. In Kent 620 schools and colleges have registered for Get Set, including Sevenoaks Primary School and Sevenoaks Preparatory School.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.8/4">Over 1,700 cultural or sporting projects across the UK have been awarded the Inspire mark. In the South East 156 projects have been awarded Inspire marks.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.8/5">In addition, 233 contracts have been awarded by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) to suppliers in the South East. Kent fencing company Chestnut Products Ltd was contracted to install the perimeter fencing to the main Olympic Park and also to supply and install the perimeter fencing for Broxbourne's White Water Canoe Centre. Chestnut Products Ltd also works directly as a contractor on a supply and install basis for general fencing around the park.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.8/6">So far 24,924 companies in the region have registered on Competefor (the website where London 2012 contract opportunities are advertised), and 382 contracts have been awarded to Competefor suppliers. Not all the information on &#8220;supply chain&#8221; level contracts is in the public domain. There may be other companies that have secured &#8220;supply chain&#8221; contracts in the region.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.8/7">I have also announced the &#8216;Places People Play' programme, which will bring sporting legacy to life in communities across the country. This will be achieved by transforming the places where people play sport, inspiring people to make sport happen at a local level and creating sporting opportunities that give everyone the chance to become part of the mass participation legacy. Further detail can be found at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="d.542W.8/9">In addition, the &#8220;Kent School Games&#8221; was part of the national pilot of the School Games programme that has been rolled out nationwide from September this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.8/10">Locations across the UK, particularly those that are hosting international teams in pre-games training camps (PGTCs), have additional opportunities to realise the economic benefits of the games. 28 agreements have been signed with teams to hold PGTCs in the South East including the National Olympic Committee of Nepal who will be using facilities in Kent.</p>

An FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.  2. Emergency admissions are collected from the following codes: 21=via accident and emergency (A&amp;E) services, including the casualty department of the provider 22=via general practitioner 23=via Bed Bureau, including the Central Bureau 24=via consultant out-patient clinic 28=other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another health care provider.  3. Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). Normally, if data is tabulated by health care provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. However, in the case of those with embedded treatment centres, these data are quoted separately. In these cases, &#8220;X&#8221; is appended to the code for the rest of the trust, to remind users that the figures are for all sites of the trust excluding the treatment centres. The quality of TC returns are such that data may not be complete. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately. Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of dataflows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using this data as the counts may be lower than true figures.  4. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.  5. Activity included: activity in English NHS hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.  <i>Source:</i>  HES, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

The Department's guidance, contained within the health circular HSC 2004/001, does not prevent the use of confidentiality clauses per se. However, it does state that national health service employers must consider with their legal advisers whether such a clause is necessary in the circumstances of each case and that if such a clause is included within a particular agreement that it complies with their various statutory obligations regarding the treatment of confidential information, including the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.11/2">Before an employee considers signing a compromise agreement, which may or may not contain a confidentiality clause, the employer is required to pay for the employee to have independent legal advice on the terms of the agreement.</p>

However, this will be done through his relationships with the national health service bodies established by the Health and Social Care Bill.

We are also proposing to amend the scrutiny regulations so that, in the first instance, referrals are to the NHS Commissioning Board and, if outstanding issues remain, to the Secretary of State. This is consistent with the Government's vision to develop a more locally accountable and autonomous NHS. However, the Commissioning Board and the Secretary of State will have powers to direct commissioners if they consider this is an appropriate response following a referral.</p>
