However, a case of property fraud has been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for advice, with a view to criminal prosecution. Two additional cases of suspected fraud have been referred to the Defence Fraud Analysis Unit (DFAU) for investigation and may come to court in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".448W.0/2">No incentives are paid to private companies to detect and report suspected fraud.

	<p pid=".449W.13/1">In accordance with Section 91 of the Police Act 1997, after consultation with the Scottish Ministers, I have agreed to appoint and re-appoint the following surveillance commissioners to assist Sir Andrew Leggatt, the chief surveillance commissioner. There are three commissioners for England and Wales, two for Scotland and one for Northern Ireland. However, the remit of each commissioner covers the whole of the United Kingdom so that any commissioner can act in jurisdictions other than his own.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.13/2">I have appointed from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>, as a commissioner the Right hon. Lord Sutherland, who served as a judge of the Court of Session from 1985 to 2001, for a period of three years.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.13/3">I have also re-appointed as commissioners:</p>
	<p pid=".449W.13/4">Sir Charles McCullough who was appointed as surveillance commissioner in 1998 and is re-appointed for a further three years from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>. He served as a High Court judge of the Queen's Bench Division from 1981 to 1998;</p>
	<p pid=".449W.13/5">The right hon. Sir Michael Hutchison who was appointed as surveillance commissioner in 1998 and is re-appointed for a further three years from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>. He served as a Lord Justice of Appeal from 1995 to 1999;</p>
	<p pid=".449W.13/6">Lord Bonomy who was appointed as surveillance commissioner in 1998 and is re-appointed for a further three years from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>. He has been a judge of the Court of Session since 1997;</p>
	<p pid=".449W.13/7">The right hon. Sir John MacDermott who was appointed as surveillance commissioner in 1998 and is re-appointed, <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-01">1 November 2001</phrase>, until <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-01">1 October 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".449W.13/8">The commissioners are appointed under the provisions of Part III of the Police Act 1997. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 extended the commissioners remit. Since the authorisation of intrusive surveillance operations forms a key component of the Government's response to serious and organised crime, I attach considerable importance to these appointments and I am delighted that the commissioners have accepted their appointments. In conjunction with Sir Andrew Leggatt, their substantial judicial experience, particularly of the criminal justice system, will provide independent oversight of surveillance operations, which although operationally important, must also be subject to stringent safeguards.</p>

	<p pid=".451W.9/1">Government and industry are taking forward three policy initiatives designed to increase the overall productivity and competitiveness of the UK construction industry.</p>
	<p pid=".451W.9/2">First, Rethinking Construction. In partnership with the industry we are using demonstration projects, case studies and best practice dissemination to prove the business case for change and to provide practical means by which companies can improve their productivity and competitiveness and clients can demand products that actually enhance their own performance. We have agreed to continue the initiative until April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".451W.9/3">Second, my Department supports a substantial programme of construction-related innovation and research. Sir John Fairclough, a former Government chief scientist, has recently conducted a review for us of how we should best provide that support in the future. The report establishes an excellent framework for improving the effectiveness of construction research. We are consulting the industry on how we can work with them to take forward the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".451W.9/4">Finally, the Quality Mark Scheme, which will enable builders to demonstrate their competence and to distinguish themselves from their less reputable rivals. The scheme will be rolled out across the country over a three to four year period.</p>
	<p pid=".451W.9/5">These three closely connected initiatives are being taken forward against a backdrop of continuing work with the industry to understand the various issues it faces, especially in relation to wider Government policy, to ensure we develop polices and regulations that recognise the competitiveness issues in the industry while meeting Government's broader objectives on the environment, safety and so on.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.5/1">The Bill responds to the Scott report's key recommendations that the existing export control should be replaced with legislation that:</p>
	<p pid=".452W.5/2">Sets restrictions on the Government's power to control exports;</p>
	<p pid=".452W.5/3">Gives Parliament the power to scrutinise orders introduced under export control legislation.</p>

The Metals Industry Competitive Enterprise (MICE) aims to introduce lean manufacturing techniques throughout the sector.

Even in these cases some of the world's most stringent requirements for laboratory animal welfare and licensing must be fully complied with.</p>

The Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 1996, which implement the European Cosmetics Directive have a voluntary measure which allows claims about animal testing to be made if a manufacturer so chooses. There are no other regulations on product labelling with regard to animal testing.</p>

	<p pid=".459W.8/1">No projects have been ruled ineligible on state aid grounds alone. Some have given rise to state aid concerns which require them either to be amended so that they do not constitute aid or so that they fell within the block exemption regulations. Other schemes, or their UK funding streams, may need to be or are being notified to the commission so that their compatibility with the EC treaty can be determined. I have received representations from Members of Parliament and businesses about the state aid rules. It is important that the rules are respected but also that they should not inhibit unnecessarily regeneration of urban centres.</p>

	<p pid=".466W.7/1">The UK has played a major role in tackling the unsustainable debt burden of the poorest countries. We led the way in securing the revision of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which was agreed in September 1999. Up to US$100 billion debt could be written off for the 42 HIPC countries. So far, 26 countries have qualified for this exceptional relief. These countries will receive more than US$60 billion worth of debt relief, reducing their debts by more than two-thirds on average. We hope that more countries will qualify for debt relief but substantial further progress will be difficult, as many of the remaining HIPC countries are either affected by conflict or have severe governance problems.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.7/2">The UK goes further than is required under the HIPC Initiative and provides 100 per cent. relief on its bilateral debts to countries once they qualify, and holds any debt repayments 'in trust' in the meantime. The Government have already cancelled their aid debts to all the poorest countries, not just HIPC. The UK is also the second largest contributor (US$306 million) to the HIPC Trust Fund to help international financial institutions meet their share of HIPC costs.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.7/3">We seek to reduce the poverty of children, which causes suffering to today's children and jeopardises the well-being of future generations, by working to address the cause of poverty and deprivation in the families and communities in which they live. Support for children's rights to basic health care, education, nutrition, shelter, protection from violence and abusive labour, along with sustainable livelihoods for their parents, is central to our work towards the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.7/4">We are working to energise the international system to achieve the goals. The goals include the target of, by 2015, lifting 1 billion people out of abject poverty, universal primary schooling, and reducing under-five child mortality by two thirds.</p>

	<p pid=".467W.2/1">We are firmly opposed to any suggestion that World bank highly concessional loans should be converted to grants. The International Development Association (IDA) of the World bank provides very concessional loans which are paid back over 40 years with a 10 year grace period and low service charge. Such loans are highly effective in helping countries to reduce poverty and are complemented by grant resources provided by other agencies. Any move to change IDA loans to grants would undermine the effectiveness of IDA and its future financial integrity.</p>

	<p pid=".469W.5/1">The Government are working to implement the action plan of the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in a variety of ways both through out bilateral programmes and our multilateral work. Over the past four years, we have increased the proportion of aid allocated to least developed countries, as a proportion of our bilateral country resources, from 33 per cent. to 45 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.5/2">We are supporting the Commonwealth Secretariat's Trade and Investment Access Facility to deliver a range of activities designed to strengthen the capacity of least developed Commonwealth countries to address trade issues. We also continue to work with multilateral organisations including the United Nations and the European Commission to ensure that the momentum generated by the third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, on key issues such as trade, aid untying and financial issues is maintained in follow-on international conferences. These include the current Financing for Development conference in Monterey (18&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-03-22">22 March</phrase>) and the forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.5/3">We consider it important to see the third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries as part of an on-going process of developing a partnership for poverty eradication between developing countries, including least developed countries, and the international community. We will therefore continue to work with our partners to build on the positive achievements made on recent initiatives such as the European Union's &quot;Everything But Arms&quot; agreement and the Development Assistance Committee's recommendations on untying, both of which were strongly supported by the UK, to ensure that least developed countries can achieve sustained economic growth and development.</p>

It identified various options, which have since been under consideration by the St. Helena Government. As part of that process, the views of the islanders have been sought. The outcome has been a majority preference in favour of possible air access in future, as an alternative to replacing St. Helena's dedicated passenger and supply ship. Island representatives have recently visited the UK to discuss air access and will be reporting their discussions to the St. Helena Government at the beginning of April.</p>

In addition, the Police Scientific Development Branch of the Home Office has published a number of papers on the subject and will carry out a study into false alarms in partnership with ACPO. This will investigate the causes of false alarms and highlight the need for best practice throughout the security industry.

	<p pid=".479W.2/1">The Halliday review of the sentencing framework has given us a unique opportunity to examine what we should do to prevent, tackle and punish offending behaviour. The recent rise in the prison population suggests that sentences are not currently being targeted as effectively as they could be. Prisons are focusing on housing more and more prisoners for whom it is not demonstrably the right option. The Government is currently considering how to take the sentencing reforms forward with a view to publishing our conclusions in a White Paper to be published in the Spring. Whatever the population pressures, the Government is uncompromising in its response to serious and dangerous offenders. Where there is a need to protect the public, this should take place in a secure environment. Communities must be protected from such offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".479W.2/2">As part of this I am very keen to look imaginatively at alternatives to full time custody, and in particular would like to explore options for piloting intermittent custody and introducing a new suspended sentence (custody minus). These sentences, alongside the tougher and more flexible community sentences we already have, as well as those being proposed, will give sentencers the confidence to explore alternatives to short custodial sentences. Easing pressure on the shorter-term population will enable the Prison Service to focus on providing longer term prisoners with the regimes, training and programmes they need to correct their offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".479W.2/3">Home detention curfew (HDC) is a key resettlement tool which gives us the opportunity to monitor an offender during their transition back into the community. It is also a useful tool in helping us manage the prison population by reducing over-crowding at the same time as improving the resettlement and rehabilitation opportunities for less serious offenders. From the beginning of May prisoners serving sentences of between three months and under 12 months, with the exception of those convicted of violent or drugs offences within the previous three years, and prisoners who have any history of sexual offending, will be released on home detention curfew for the latter part of their sentence unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. All offenders not statutorily excluded will be subject to a risk assessment and released on HDC only where it is safe to do so. Under the HDC scheme released prisoners serve the remainder of their custody period at home under electronic curfew usually from 7pm to 7am. At any one time we expect that this measure will remove up to 1,350 prisoners from prison accommodation, in addition to the 1,800 who are already on the scheme. The impact of these arrangements and any further extensions of the HDC scheme will be kept under close review.</p>

	<p pid=".481W.5/2">Section 96 of the Police Act 1996 places a duty on police authorities to make arrangements for obtaining views of people in the force area about matters concerning the policing of the area.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.5/3">The Act does not specify that this duty should be fulfilled through the establishment of police/community consultative groups which have no formal status set out in statute, and whose constitution and membership is not governed by any binding directives or guidance. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary (Mr. Blunkett) has issued no specific guidelines on the way in which the chairs of any such groups should be appointed. Information about them is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.5/4">In its report published in December 2001, the Community Cohesion Review Team, chaired by Ted Cantle and set up following the disturbances in the north of England last summer, recommended that a good practice guide to community consultation should be developed, and that work is being taken forward.</p>

	<p pid=".481W.8/1">I refer to a letter sent by my predecessor (Mr. Clarke) in February of last year which addressed this subject.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.8/2">The term &quot;trawling&quot; has been used by critics of the police to describe the process by which police investigations into serious allegations of historical sexual abuse in children's homes and other institutions trace potential witnesses. As such, it is not for my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to provide a definition of a term he considers unhelpful and pejorative and is not normally used by the police.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.8/3">The process referred to by the term is an investigative method which involves sampling from an often long list of potential witnesses who may have information that can be used to corroborate or rebut an allegation of sexual abuse which may have taken place a considerable time beforehand. Due to the very complex nature of these investigations, witness evidence is often paramount due to the lack of forensic and other evidence after the passage of time since the alleged offences.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.8/4">The Code of Practice issued under Part II of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 sets out general responsibilities for officers conducting investigations into allegations that a crime has been committed. Under the code, police officers conducting an investigation should pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry, whether these point towards or away from the suspect. The practice referred to is established practice as the best use of police resources in eliciting information to assist an investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.8/5">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) undertook a thematic inspection into child protection in 1999 and is currently taking a major part in an inspection of safeguards for children's welfare led by the Social Services Inspectorate. HMIC also routinely conduct detailed force inspections, which include arrangements for child abuse and major crime investigations. None of these has, thus far, thrown doubt over the quality of investigation into institutional child abuse allegations; nor has any evidence to support concerns into the sampling of historic institutional child abuse allegations been brought to the attention of HMIC or the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.11/1">I have today published a consultation paper on piloting a comparative label for passenger cars. The consultation sets out the Government's proposals on a possible new form of label, which would be based on the environmental performance categories used in the Graduated Vehicle Excise Duty system. We believe this would make an effective label, consistent with and reinforced by the environmental message given through the new taxation regimes. The proposal at this stage is to begin piloting a comparative label later this year, with a view to making any further decision following that pilot. Any proposal to make the label mandatory, would be subject to further consultation. I have placed copies of the consultation document in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.2/1">I have today laid before the House two statutory instruments: the Local Authorities (Executive Arrangements) (Access to Information) (England) Amendment Regulations 2002 and the Local Authorities (Access to Meetings and Documents) (Period of Notice) (England) Order 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.2/2">Our aim in modernising local government is to make local decision-making more accountable. We have listened very carefully to the responses we received to the consultation on access to information in local government which we launched in April 2001. We believe it is right that local people should have earlier warning of the important decisions that local authorities take and of the meetings where these decisions take place. In line with this the statutory instruments will have the effect of increasing the notice period authorities have to give of such decisions or such meetings from three to five days.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.2/3">This reform will encourage greater participation by local people in the democratic process. Decisions that local authorities take will benefit from the transparency that public debate brings. Decision-making will be brought closer to those affected by those decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.2/4">Our consultation also asked views on two other issues&mdash;proposals to revise the definition of &quot;exempt&quot; information given by Schedule 12A of the Local Government Act 1972 and the framing of guidance on financial thresholds for key executive decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.2/5">We currently have no plans to make changes to the definition of exempt information, but we will consult further in the planned review of the access to information regime, planned for summer 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.2/6">We announced in the local government White Paper, &quot;Strong Local Leadership Quality Public Services&quot;, published in December 2001, that local authorities were best placed to define what constitutes a key decision.</p>

	<p pid=".490W.8/19" class="indent">invite local authorities to develop transport change proposals, including:</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/20" class="indent">A campaign to encourage the use of public transport</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/21" class="indent">A strict enforcement of Land Use Policy to promote development decisions which reduce car dependency</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/22" class="indent">Urban regeneration that maximises the attractiveness and potential of existing centres as places of employment, retail and leisure opportunities to reduce car dependency and promote social inclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/23">An announcement on a further extension of the Metrolink System to Stockport will be made as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/24">The outputs of the study will be balanced across transport modes and across the South East Manchester area. The most deprived neighbourhoods and more affluent car owning neighbourhoods are all set to benefit from the additional transport investment involved. Improvements are designed to help reduce road congestion and accidents; increase rail use by up to 50 per cent. in peak periods and 100 per cent. off peak; increase bus use by 8 per cent. in peak periods and 30 per cent. in off peak periods and increase use of the Metrolink. I am also pleased to say that proposals for encouraging the use of public transport and improving air quality through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have also been welcomed by environmental groups.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.8/25">I welcome the solutions proposed by the study. It is an excellent example of how multi-modal transport solutions can be devised to address complex and deep seated transport problems. We have seen that a wholly roads based solution would have added to, rather than alleviated, the long-term traffic problems in the area. Instead the study has identified a balanced strategy which will deal with congestion problems for motorists, but which does so by investing across all modes of transport and in a sustainable way.</p>

Its aim is to ensure that any measures implementing the principle of equal treatment are made more effective, thereby providing victims of sex discrimination with effective access to justice. The directive also defines the concept of indirect discrimination.</p>
	<p pid=".496W.5/3">We do not hold cost information in the form requested in part <i>(b)</i> of the question and that information could be assembled only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".496W.5/4">Departments are required to produce regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) for all proposals, including those originating in European legislation, likely to impose significant costs on business, charities or voluntary organisations. DTI prepared an RIA for the regulations in question, which showed the cost to an employer who is not discriminating should be nil. A copy of the RIA has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

Consequently, private medical insurance is not a feature of the Department for Education and Skills' (DfES') terms and conditions of employment.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.2/3">The employees of DfES' non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) are not civil servants.

	<p pid=".503W.6/1">The quinquennial review of the National Forest company has been completed. It has concluded that the company, a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, should continue to be responsible for delivering the National forest Strategy which is contributing strongly to the government's sustainable development agenda. Since its creation in 1995 the Company has for example achieved an expansion of woodland cover in the National Forest area, covering 200 square miles in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire, from 6 per cent. to 12 per cent. Detailed changes to the company's operations will be made in order to maximise effective delivery and value for money.

These data are not published monthly as the sample size is insufficient.

Annual average prices are given in the annual report on the survey (NFS 2000 is the latest).</p>

Three million free licences were issued in the financial year 2000&ndash;01. 3.2 million free licences were issued between April and December 2001 and the forecast take-up of the concession for the year as a whole is 99 per cent. In addition, approximately 500,000 people living in residential homes and sheltered housing, who previously qualified for the &pound;5 Accommodation for Residential Care concessionary fee, now receive their licence free of charge; we believe this represents the great majority of those eligible, though precise figures are not available.</p>

	<p pid=".517W.2/2">In relation to my own Department, the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers and the Departments for which the Attorney General is responsible, section 8 paragraph 8.2.1 of the civil service management code requires Departments and agencies to ensure that staff use the most efficient and economic means of travel in the circumstances, taking into account any management benefit or the needs of staff with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/3">The Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers is fully committed to ensuring that staff use the most efficient and economic means of travel commensurate with meeting operational needs.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/4" class="italic">Crown Prosecution Service</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/5">The Crown Prosecution Service's travel and Subsistence policy already makes it clear that official travel should always be conducted in the most effective and economic manner and normally by public transport.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/6">The main principles of the Crown Prosecution Service's travel and subsistence policy are:</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/7" class="indent">No reimbursement is appropriate when no extra expense is incurred;</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/8" class="indent">All official journeys must be necessary, duly authorised, and undertaken in the most economical manner consistent with the efficient conduct of official business;</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/9" class="indent">Payment from public funds will normally be based on the cost of the journey by the most economical route and the most reasonable mode of conveyance;</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/10" class="indent">The Department may refuse claims for unreasonable expenses, or expenses which could have been avoided if the journey had been better planned.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/11">The Crown Prosecution Service grants entitlement to first class travel to all staff at Level C, Pay Bank C2/ Level B, Pay Band B3 and above. This entitlement is a contractual right that forms part of the terms and conditions of service for those Crown Prosecution Service staff members. On a number of occasions, the Department has considered the removal of this right but has withdrawn from that approach because of the cost associated with a buy-out of the contractual right.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/12">Furthermore, staff entitled to standard class travel only, may be allowed to travel first class in the following circumstances:</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/13" class="indent">When required to travel overnight;</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/14" class="indent">When necessarily travelling with a civil servant entitled to first class travel or a non-civil servant travelling first class;</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/15" class="indent">When the Department is satisfied that it is not practicable for the member of staff to obtain a seat in standard class. <i>Treasury Solicitor's Department</i></p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/16">It is departmental policy in the Treasury solicitor's Department that all staff, regardless of grade, must have full regard to the need for economy in travelling and must always consider using standard class on trains. Only more senior staff may travel using first class, though junior staff may accompany them if they need to work together during the journey. <i>Serious Fraud Office</i></p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/17">It is departmental policy in the Serious Fraud Office that all staff, regardless of grade, must have full regard to the need for economy in travelling and must always travel standard class unless they can obtain better prices for first class travel, or there are compelling reasons not to travel standard class.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.2/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's report on the city of Salford council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/2">The report finds the city of Salford council to be a poorly performing authority in almost all aspects of benefits administration and counter fraud activity.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/3">BFI reports finding evidence of good policies and procedures, but these were undermined by inadequate implementation or monitoring. For example, a benefit take-up policy existed but there was limited evidence of implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/4">The report identifies a range of examples of poor administration. This includes an inadequate management checking regime, poor standards for verifying claims for benefit, and failure to process all new claims within 14 days of receiving all the necessary information.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/5">Procedures for dealing with changes to claimants' circumstances were found to be flawed and a failure to apply the law was likely to lead to over and under- payments of benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/6">The council had no policy on overpayments. The lack of quality management information and a lack of managerial or supervisory involvement contribute to poor overpayment recovery. In March 2000 the council's recorded overpayment debt stood at almost &pound;5 million and was rising year on year.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/7">While the city of Salford council had a positive counter fraud strategy and had provided officers with a good procedures manual, investigation quality was found to be inadequate. There was no control over investigations, nor over the workload of each investigator which was found to be excessive.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/8">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/9">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.</p>

	<p pid=".523W.2/2">The BFI first inspected and published a report on the performance of Kirklees metropolitan council on <phrase class="date" code="1999-05-29">29 May 1999</phrase>. It found that the council was performing poorly. Following publication of this first report, the council accepted the recommendations and drew up an action plan to improve performance. BFI's second report finds that Kirklees has largely failed to implement its own action plan and has not fully addressed any of the major recommendations included in the first BFI report. Inspectors consider that the council's performance in administering benefit and countering benefit fraud has got worse since the first inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/3">Poor performance was identified in many areas of benefit administration. A failure to improve the verification of benefit claims; no improvement on previously slow processing times for new and renewal claims; a deterioration of procedure for dealing with the overpayment of benefit; and a lack of supervisory management were all reported by inspectors. At the time of the inspection there was a backlog of around 7,000 cases awaiting assessment and 65,000 documents awaiting filing.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/4">On counter fraud work, the report notes failures by the council to introduce and implement a counter fraud strategy and to introduce and implement a prosecution policy. There was also increased potential for internal fraud, fewer fraud staff and a lack of management within the counter fraud teams.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/5">The BFI considers that Kirklees metropolitan council's inadequate response to the findings of the first inspection casts grave doubts on its commitment to provide an efficient and secure benefits system.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/6">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/7">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.</p>

	<p pid=".524W.2/1">We have a three-stage strategy for reforming housing benefit and dealing with the legacy of neglect we have inherited. The first stage, which is now well under way, is to radically improve HB administration and bear down on fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.2/2">The HB help team is working in partnership with local authorities to support them in improving the administration of HB. We are already seeing real improvements in administration as a result of the team's work and the on-going programme of inspections by the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate. We also want to help more authorities deliver a high standard of HB service by sharing good practice. We are developing a dedicated website to do so and we plan to make available shortly on CD a &quot;toolkit&quot; which the help team has developed.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.2/3">In April we will publish performance standards for the full range of HB administration. These standards offer local authorities practical guidance on effective and secure administration of benefit. Local authorities will be able to self-assess their performance against standards.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.2/4">We have already increased HB administration subsidy for the year 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;166 million, in 2002&ndash;03 it will increase to &pound;170 million and to &pound;174 million in 2003&ndash;04. This three-year settlement provides local authorities with stability, enabling them to plan more effectively for the future administration of HB and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.2/5">With the introduction of the pension credit, we are removing the need to reclaim HB every year for pensioners aged 65 and over. For those over 65, we will be making awards for five years. The HB income threshold will also be raised by the maximum amount of the pension credit savings reward, to an expected level of &pound;113.80 for single pensioners in 2003 and we will treat pensioners' capital more generously.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.2/6">Introduced nationally from April 2002, our new anti-fraud incentive scheme, puts more emphasis on prevention of fraud, as well as its detection. And we are working to get an accurate and robust measurement of fraud in the system, through the HB reviews begun last April. In time we expect to gain sufficiently reliable information from the reviews of the level of loss in the system to be able to measure progress against an agreed target.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.2/7">The second stage, which is already beginning, is to restructure rents. This is an essential prerequisite to the third stage of reform, instituting fundamental changes to the structure of HB. Fundamental reform of HB has to be built on the platform of the first two stages if it is to succeed, as was clearly set out in the Housing Green Paper.</p>

In determining whether these expenses are available to individual staff, alternative options such as local recruitment or redeployment are considered first to ensure that these transfers are cost effective.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/2">The financial assistance available would normally cover all necessary legal, removals and estate agents' costs. Assistance from a specialist relocation company in marketing homes is also available. On-going assistance may also be forthcoming if a member of staff relocates to a dearer housing, as determined by the use of Valuation Office data, resulting in increased housing costs. All new housing costs are closely compared to those at the original home to ensure that comparable property types are used. These expenses and controls are in line with the central guidance in section 8 of the Civil Service Management Code.</p>

They are encouraged to provide positive case studies and may apply to become age positive champions. To become an age positive champion, a potential applicant must submit strong evidence of commitment to age positive practice. Officials of this Department vet applications from potential champions.</p>
	<p pid=".526W.2/4">Organisations that do not have in place a wide enough range of age positive practices to be accepted as champions are still often able to provide useful case studies illustrating particular age positive aspects of their employment policies. Age positive champions play a vital role in the campaign. By promoting their own best practice and highlighting the practical business benefits of a mixed age workforce they encourage other employers and individuals to tackle age discrimination in the workplace. There are currently 32 age positive champions and around 50 case studies, although both figures are steadily increasing. The newest feature of the campaign is the age positive website <a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk">www.agepositive.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid=".527W.6/1">The legal profession is independent of Government and as such it is the professional bodies which, in the first instance, are responsible for the regulation of their members. The Government have no current plans to alter this. However, we are aware of concerns about the standard of complaints handling by the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors (OSS). For this reason, the Government have already taken reserve powers to impose standards for complaints handling on the legal professional bodies. These powers would allow for the establishment of a new post, the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner, whose function would be to set targets for the handling of complaints by failing bodies. The Lord Chancellor is considering the OSS's performance against targets and any decision about the appointment of the Commissioner will be made in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".532W.5/1">The European average for health spending has remained at between 7.9 and 8 per cent. of gross domestic product for a number of years. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has stated that, as long as the economy remains strong, we will reach the European Union average by 2005. Current spending plans will raise the level of United Kingdom total health expenditure to 7.6 per cent. of gross domestic product by 2003&ndash;04. Spending beyond this period will be decided in the coming spending review.</p>

The PPE has been tested against 15 liquid industrial chemicals in a standard test battery (ATSM F1001&ndash;99a) chosen to represent a broad range of liquid classes and properties. It has also been tested against a representative sample of chemical warfare agents.</p>

These facilities are not intended to provide protection against chemical agents for either health service personnel or the chemically contaminated casualty. Health service personnel will be protected by wearing PPE, while casualties will be given appropriate medical treatment once they have been decontaminated.</p>

	<p pid=".533W.8/1">In the NHS Cancer Plan we pledged that the national health service contribution to the costs of specialist palliative care (including hospices) would increase by &pound;50 million by 2004. This investment is intended to help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care and enable the NHS to increase their contribution to the cost hospices incur in providing agreed levels of service. The level of funding voluntary hospices receive is a matter for local decision based on a strategic view of local palliative care services. We have required all cancer networks to develop costed strategic investment plans for palliative care, which will inform the wider NHS planning process through Health Improvement Programmes and Service and Financial Frameworks for 2002&ndash;3.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.8/2">Information on the number of beds freed within the NHS by the transfer of patients to hospice care is not available centrally. There are approximately 2,000 hospice beds in the voluntary sector and over 400 beds in the NHS in England. About 120,000 people die annually from cancer in England; approximately 50 per cent. of these die in hospital, 13 per cent. die in hospices and 25 per cent. die in their own homes.</p>
