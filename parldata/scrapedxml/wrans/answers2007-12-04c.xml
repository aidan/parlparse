	<p pid="c.1070W.2/1">The Highways Agency is working with other parts of Government to secure the delivery of a substantial amount of housing in Northamptonshire in general and Kettering in particular. The A14 running just to the south of Kettering serves both long distance and local traffic and is currently operating under considerable stress.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.2/2">A major improvement scheme is under consideration, but this will take time to deliver. In the meantime, the Highways Agency is looking into measures that could allow the new housing to get under way while maintaining the functionality of the important A14 route. This includes the prospect of ramp metering which is a technique where the amount of traffic joining the A14 is managed through the use of signals, accompanied by sensors, to regulate the system and prevent the build-up of traffic on the adjacent local road network.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.2/3">The Highways Agency will continue to work closely with partners, in particular Northamptonshire county council, to develop proposals which balance the needs of the strategic and local highway network. However the overall strategy is not simply about concrete infrastructure. There are many measures, including those designed to secure modal shift that could be put in place to reduce to a minimum the amount of traffic generated by the new development. Northamptonshire county council's Transport Strategy for Growth provides a strong guide to what can be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="c.1076W.6/25">As I said in my written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July 2007</phrase>, the military footprint in Northern Ireland is now broadly comparable to that in the rest of the UK with the majority of forces training and preparing for operations worldwide. Although this is the planned number of armed forces personnel with a home base in Northern Ireland, the actual number of personnel present will be less as some of the units will be deployed on rest of the world operations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1077W.2/1">The UK's Defence engagement is aimed at personnel from across Colombia's large armed forces, and not individual units. Current military assistance to Colombia is primarily concerned with education; there are strong emphases on training regarding human rights and the disposal of explosive devices in order to reduce the numbers of deaths, both civilian and military, from them. However, there are some aspects of military assistance which we do not give specific details as to do so could endanger not only the effectiveness of the support but also the lives of the British and Colombian personnel involved. The Parliamentary Ombudsman has upheld this decision.</p>

The temperature in non-office areas may vary depending on the activity in that room. The statutory minimum temperature as given under the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 is 16 degrees Celsius after the first hour of working; unless the work involves strenuous physical exertion. Where possible, individuals' comfort preferences are taken into consideration.

It was agreed that recommendations from the Commission will be discussed at the December GAERC to ensure that these countries do not end up facing Generalised System of Preferences tariffs.</p>

Severe economic mismanagement has deprived Burma of the economic growth enjoyed by its South East Asian neighbours, and investment in public services has been minimal. A third of the population lives below the poverty line. Those in conflict areas, of which Karen State is one, face further human rights abuses by the Burmese military, and on occasion by the ethnic armed groups. As a consequence of the conflict, there are 500,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) in Eastern Burma, the majority of whom are Karen&mdash;and their humanitarian plight is particularly severe. DFID provides assistance to IDPs using community-based groups from inside Eastern Burma, and cross-border to the most vulnerable. DFID also provides support to Burmese refugees, mostly Karen, in Thailand.</p>

	<p pid="c.1086W.0/1">UN agencies and international NGOs active in Somalia report that up to 500,000 people, almost exclusively civilians, have been displaced as a result of the conflict in the south&mdash;197,000 since the beginning of October. They are mostly accommodated in temporary encampments close to the capital Mogadishu, and face shortages of shelter, food, water and, especially but not exclusively for those injured in the fighting, healthcare. A further 50,000 have been displaced by the border conflict between Somaliland and Puntland in the north. Total displacement of the Somali population, including those affected by earlier conflict and natural disasters, is estimated by the UN to be 1 million. Agencies delivering relief supplies face regular harassment, extortion and bureaucratic obstruction, and the International Community, including the UK, has made strong representations to the Somali authorities to enable relief work to flow freely.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.0/2">So far in 2007 DFID has committed &pound;8.6 million to help those worst affected by the fighting and the ongoing humanitarian needs, including &pound;1 million since mid-October. We keep in close contact with UN agencies and our partners on the ground to ensure that DFID's humanitarian response fits the immediate needs of the most vulnerable. Our humanitarian adviser visited part of the affected area last week, to assess the situation. He will make another visit to the worst affected area during the next week, after which we will consider what further urgent support we might provide.</p>

	<p pid="c.1090W.2/1">For reasons of commercial sensitivity it is not possible to itemise the net book value and expected sale revenue of each asset currently planned for disposal. However the Department is taking professional advice to ensure value for money and to maximise the return on these disposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.2/2">The Department currently anticipates total receipts from the sale of assets of approximately &pound;9 million in 2007-08; &pound;36 million in 2008-09; &pound;10 million in 2009-10 and &pound;5 million in 2010-11. The disposals planned for the latter three years will form part of the Department's Asset Management Strategy to be published in December this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.2/3">Estimates of sale proceeds are subject to fluctuations in the property market and cannot be guaranteed, nor can it be stated with certainty exactly when these sales will take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.2/4">It should also be noted that the figures apply to the wider DEFRA network, not just to the core Department. The assets in question are surplus or under-utilised land and property. The largest anticipated sale is that of DEFRA-owned land and buildings at Guildford, and we expect this to account for approximately one third of the income from asset disposals over the period 2007-08 to 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="c.1097W.5/18">A significant amount of the funding has been spent on cetacean research, in particular, the UK Standings Scheme and work to determine the abundance and distribution of cetaceans in UK waters. Funds have also been used to assist in expanding our knowledge of the range of habitats found in our seas. This has included the funding of marine surveys in areas beyond 12 nautical miles to identify Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and the development of UK Seamap; a series of marine landscape maps which are based on a modelling exercise to predict marine landscape types likely to be found in UK marine waters. Such research outputs will be useful in marine spatial planning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1097W.5/19">In addition, marine biodiversity science is undertaken indirectly via other programmes within the Department. It is, however, harder to separate out the exact proportion of the spend which could be regarded as biodiversity research back to 1997. It is estimated that, this year alone, a further &pound;400,000 could be regarded as marine biodiversity science research from the Marine Environment research and development programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1097W.5/20">The figures in the table do not include marine biodiversity science expenditure by the Conservation Agencies, Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and Natural England. These two bodies are responsible for the implementation of marine biodiversity policy in UK offshore waters and territorial waters of England respectively. DEFRA provides funds to these agencies for the delivery of marine nature conservation policy. Both of these organisations fund relevant science to ensure the effective delivery of policy. For instance, in 2007-08, the JNCC were provided with &pound;1 million to complete offshore survey work, a considerable proportion of this budget will be spent on commissioning offshore survey of areas believed to be important for conservation purposes.</p>

	<p pid="c.1100W.0/1">The UK has recently provided the Commission with its views on the future of the cod recovery mechanism, copies of which I have arranged to be placed in the Libraries of the House. In the meantime, we are exploring with them and the UK industry, possible changes to the scheme for 2008, designed to reduce cod mortality in the short-term, which does not simply involve blunt cuts in days at sea. We will return to the longer term position next year in the context of the ongoing review.</p>

	<p pid="c.1113W.7/1">Units of dental activity are essentially banded courses of treatment, weighted according to the relative average complexity of the three dental charge bands. The current weightings are derived from the previous general dental services fee-scale. Each fee included an element which reflected the relative time taken for the procedure and the expenses incurred. The weighted averaging inherent in the new system means some courses of treatment will involve more time and expense than the average for that band, others less. There are no plans to change the distribution of the existing weighted courses of treatment. However dentists working patterns under the new system are kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.1113W.10/1">Preventive as well as diagnostic treatments are included in a Band 1 course of treatment as set out in Schedule 1 to the NHS (Dental Charges) Regulations 2005 (SI. 2005/3477 as amended). Under a Band 1 course of treatment dentists are required to undertake a clinical examination and diagnosis. Diagnosis includes checking for signs of oral diseases such as oral cancer and any issues with developing teeth and face including any need for orthodontic correction. A Band 1 course of treatment also provides for instruction in the prevention of dental and oral disease including dietary advice and dental hygiene instruction, surface application as primary preventive measures of sealants and topical fluoride preparations where clinically indicated. Epidemiological surveys of child dental health are generally undertaken by salaried dentists employed by primary care trusts.</p>

	<p pid="c.1116W.5/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) were awarded devolved primary dental service funding allocations from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, based on the level of dental activity and costs observed in each area in the 12-month period October 2004 to September 2005, with appropriate additions to absorb subsequent annual contract value upratings, previously agreed service developments, and expected changes associated with the new ways of working fostered by the new dental contract. These initial allocations allowed PCTs to sustain national health service provision in each area and honour the commitment to offer all serving dentists replacement contracts. These historical levels of expenditure reflected where dentists had previously chosen to set up in practice and how much NHS work they chose to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.1116W.5/2">The new dental service reforms cannot correct historical imbalances in provision overnight, but by granting the NHS greater control they provide a stable base from which PCTs can plan further developments and use the flexibilities offered by the new contract to make the most effective use of dental resources. PCTs are best placed to assess factors such as the levels of unmet demand for NHS services in each locality, and can supplement provision for dentistry from within their total NHS resources if they consider this an appropriate local priority.</p>
	<p pid="c.1116W.5/3">Based on PCTs' initial devolved dental allocations, NHS net expenditure on primary care dental services in 2006-07, after taking account of the contribution from patient charges, was over &pound;400 million higher than in 2003-04, an increase over three years of 30 per cent. which has helped the NHS expand services in some areas that had previously struggled to attract NHS dentists. The Department is reviewing the basis of PCT dental allocations after the initial three-year transitional period for the new service arrangements ends in March 2009.</p>

The increased costs of fuel over the last few years, makes it more difficult for people on disability benefits to pay for adequate heating.

	<p pid="c.1132W.5/3">The FCO has also supported drugs awareness campaigns in Colombian schools. In addition, Colombia has benefited from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's Latin American projects that the UK has co-funded to improve institutional capacity across the region.</p>

We take a broad regional approach to tackling the trade in illicit drugs, through a mixture of political engagement, capacity building and law enforcement support in producer, transit and consumer countries. This includes working with governments of other producer and transit countries in Latin America, as well as with governments in countries along the main trafficking routes for drugs from Latin America (especially via the Caribbean and West Africa).</p>

	<p pid="c.1138W.6/1">No such estimates have been made.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.6/2">In the year ended March 2007, HM Revenue and Customs recorded exports from Yorkshire and The Humber to the EU totalling &pound;7.2 billion out of a total export figure of &pound;12.3 billion for the region. Exports to the EU, therefore, accounted for 59 per cent. of the total. This excludes exports of services and lower value exports, which are not recorded by HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.6/3">The number of companies in the region exporting to the EU in the year 2006 has been recorded by HM Revenue and Customs as 1,717. Since the Intrastat survey covers only the largest traders, the total actually exporting is likely to be much higher. The number of companies in the region exporting anywhere in the same period was recorded as 5,589, though as it included the 1,717 exporting to the EU it, too, is likely to be an underestimate of the true position.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.6/4">On foreign direct investment, there are 595 EU-owned companies in Yorkshire and The Humber, of which 62 are based in Huddersfield. Over 1,700 new or safeguarded jobs were generated by new companies investing in Yorkshire and The Humber during 2006-07. Of this figure, investment by companies based in other EU states contributed 202 jobs.</p>

The Department does, however, have in place a strategy for monitoring the law and the impact of the extension of it to carers. In 2008, for example, an employee omnibus survey is planned which will identify adults with caring responsibilities and look at what impact the law has had on them.</p>

	<p pid="c.1142W.2/1">As soon as we were made aware of the loss of data from HMRC, we made contact with the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre to identify any potential children's welfare issues. As child safety and welfare issues are an absolute priority for us, we are maintaining close contact with the agencies involved to ensure that we all remain vigilant to any child welfare issues that may arise.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 20 November</phrase> my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, asked the Department's Permanent Secretary to conduct an immediate assessment of how personal data is stored and protected in the Department. The Permanent Secretary reported back within 24 hours to confirm the Department is confident that we have very robust procedures in place. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. On <phrase class="date" code="">Wednesday 21 November</phrase>, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all Departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. Given the obvious importance of ensuring that ContactPoint has extremely robust security measures in place, on <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State also asked for an independent assessment of ContactPoint's security procedures. This will be conducted by Deloitte.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/3">Security is, and always has been, of paramount importance to the ContactPoint project and we are mindful that the Data Protection Act 1998 requires that the level of technical and organisational security must be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/4">In line with best practice, ContactPoint will be routinely backed up. This will be done only by specifically identified system operators within Capgemini, with whom we have contracted for the build and initial host of ContactPoint. Two Capgemini staff will have to be present when back-ups take place. This dual control is considered best practice. The backup tapes will be encrypted, protected with a strong (complex) password and stored in a fire-proof safe in a secure room. The limited number of Capgemini staff who do have access to this data must have enhanced CRB clearance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/5">There is no facility that would allow users to copy personal identifiable information to a file, other than when files need to be backed up as indicated in the last paragraph. The vast majority of users will only be able to view child data on the screen&mdash;they will not be able to extract files in a personally identifiable form. A very limited number of people will be able to extract identifiable data, one record at a time, from ContactPoint in order to meet legal requirements as set out in The Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007, including responding to subject access requests. There is a clear right under the Data Protection Act 1998 for children and young people (or their parents or carers when acting appropriately on their behalf) to have access to their information on ContactPoint and for it to be corrected if it is found to be inaccurate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/6">A very limited number of people in local authorities and the national ContactPoint team will be able to run reports to, for example, produce aggregated data or support data quality checks. These reports will be in an anonymised form and will not contain personally identifiable data. The only exception to this is a report produced to support local authorities in their duty to identify children who are missing education. The information provided in this report is restricted by regulations and can only contain child name, address, date of birth, unique identifying number, parent/carer contact details and the details of start and end dates for educational institutions attended by the child or young person.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/7">Access to ContactPoint will be strictly limited to those who need it to do their job and who will be subject to stringent security controls. Before being granted access, all users will have completed mandatory face-to-face training, have security clearance (including enhanced Criminal Records Bureau clearance) and have a user name, a password, a PIN and a security token to access ContactPoint. Mandatory face-to-face training will include the safe and secure use of ContactPoint and the importance of compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/8">To gain access to a child's record, all users will have to state clear reasons why they are accessing ContactPoint, and all use of the system will be monitored and audited. Every access to a child's record will be detailed in the ContactPoint audit trail. This will be regularly monitored by local authorities, using on-line user activity reports, to ensure that any misuse is detected.</p>

Identity and diversity also is a cross-cutting theme across the whole revised curriculum and provides schools with the opportunity to teach pupils about the connections between the diverse cultures and communities in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.5/2">In addition, the national framework for religious education has been incorporated into the revised secondary curriculum. The framework places inclusion, tolerance, diversity and interfaith dialogue at the heart of children's learning. A regional training programme to support schools in delivering the new curriculum is being rolled out from January 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1153W.0/2">The suspension of ERDF payments stems from specific concerns identified by the Commission in the level of on-site project monitoring. The Government have carried out intensive work to increase the level of checks and strengthen reporting. Each affected region is being assessed individually by the Commission and as a result the suspensions have now been lifted in the west midlands, north-east, Yorkshire and The Humber, north-west objective 1, and Peterborough. A total of &pound;243 million in ERDF payments was held back for those regions by the Commission, and payments have now been fully resumed. We are waiting to hear about the lifting of the suspensions of payments for London. In the case of the north-west objective 2 programme we are carrying out urgent further work to re-assure the Commission before a final decision is taken.</p>

	<p pid="c.1155W.0/1">The following table shows statistics on the percentage of dwellings built on previously-developed (&quot;brownfield&quot;) land and on previously-residential land.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.0/2">There is no direct indicator which can be used to determine how many dwellings have been built on back gardens. The Land Use Change Statistics dataset contains information on changes in land use in England and is used to answer questions on this topic. In this dataset, land use is divided into 24 categories. However, gardens, patios, garages and other cartilage as well as dwellings themselves are all classified as 'Residential'. It is therefore not directly possible to determine whether or not dwellings have been built on a garden. This has not changed since the Land Use Change Statistics were introduced in 1989.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.0/3">As a proxy, we use data on previously-residential land instead of back gardens, but this includes conversions, sites where dwellings are demolished and replaced as well as building on back gardens and other types of development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.0/4">Over the period 2002 to 2006 (the most recent years for which data are available) 94 per cent. of dwellings in the Uxbridge constituency were built on previously-developed land. This compares to 95 per cent. across the whole of London and 70 per cent. across England. Over the same period 33 per cent. of dwellings in the Uxbridge constituency were built on previously-residential land. This compares to 20 per cent. across the whole of London and 18 per cent. across England.</p>

	<p pid="c.1157W.5/1">The White Paper &quot;Planning for a Sustainable Future&quot; (CM7120) outlined that the number of Commissioners would depend on the Commission's workload, but that we expect that the Commission might require between 20-30 Commissioners. All of the Commissioners would be appointed by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will ask Welsh Ministers for nominations for 2-3 of these posts, reflecting the role of the Commission in determining nationally significant energy infrastructure projects in Wales. The Infrastructure Planning Commission will have no role in determining projects in Scotland, and so no nominations will be sought from Scottish Ministers.</p>

The Government also stated in their Memorandum on Re-licensing, sent to the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-10">10 January 2007</phrase>, that while there had been some representations about licensed premises using TENs to operate additional hours or activities which have not been included on the full licence, the Government believed that the existing limit was sufficient.

	<p pid="c.1159W.5/2">It will be for OFTENANT to determine which standards are set and how they are monitored, subject to its own objectives, which include ensuring protection of tenants and minimising regulatory interference. Professor Martin Cave's review of social housing regulation, published in June 2007, envisaged that registered bodies might develop own codes of conduct which they would monitor themselves, with the regulator collecting basic performance information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1159W.5/3">These provisions will apply to all housing associations which are currently registered with the Housing Corporation. They do not apply to local authorities, but the Government have announced their intention to extend the scope of the regulator to local authority landlords and Arms Length Management Organisations within two years of OFTENANT's creation.</p>

This pilot was run jointly by the Planning Advisory Service (part of the Improvement and Development Agency), and the Advisory Team on Large Applications (part of English Partnerships). Neither of these bodies have any role in determining the outcome of planning applications. PDAs are not about determining applications they are about ensuring efficient working processes on a local level when dealing with large or complex projects.

	<p pid="c.1160W.3/1">Article 8 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order (the GDPO) 1995 sets out the duties of local planning authorities to publicise the planning applications they receive, in order to invite comments on development proposals from third parties. Guidance on those duties is provided by Department of the Environment Circular 15/92, &quot;Publicity for Planning Applications&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1160W.3/2">The GDPO requires the local planning authority to publicise planning applications, either by a site notice or by notification to neighbours. In addition, local advertisement in a newspaper is required for applications for planning permission for 'major' applications which is defined as minerals applications, waste development, the provision of dwellings (where more than 10 provided or site is 0.5ha or over), a building with floor space of 1,000 m<sup>(2)</sup> or over, development on a site of 1 ha or over, and also listed building consent and conservation area consent.

This advises that local landscape designations should be maintained only or, exceptionally, extended where it can be clearly shown that criteria-based planning policies cannot provide the necessary protection. PPS7 also states that, when reviewing their local area-wide development plans and local development documents, planning authorities should rigorously consider the justification for retaining existing local landscape designations. They should ensure that such designations are based on a formal and robust assessment of the qualities of the landscape concerned.</p>

	<p pid="c.1163W.6/1">Under the 'set-aside' regime, which ran until <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, with-debt local authorities were required to set aside a proportion of the capital receipt generated by the disposal of a Housing Revenue Account (HRA) asset, upon disposal of that asset, for repayment of housing debt. Debt-free authorities were free to use their receipts for any capital purpose they saw fit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.6/2">The Department recorded the value of capital receipts set-aside and continues to record the value of right-to-buy (RTB) sales. However, these are separate exercises. The manner in which the data are collected means that no differentiation is made between RTB sales and other disposals of housing assets resulting in a capital receipt that goes to make up that set-aside total for a local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.6/3">The following table shows the value of capital receipts set-aside from 1995-96 to 2003-04 (the last year in which the set-aside regime existed). When set-aside exceeds RTB capital receipts it is because set-aside includes a proportion of receipts from not only RTB but also whole-stock transfers, non-RTB dwelling sales and sales of other HRA assets such as housing land.</p>

	<p pid="c.1164W.2/1">Proposals for housing development at Ashton Green first came before the Secretary of State as an allocation in the 1991 to 2001 Leicester Local Plan, and subsequently in the 1996 to 2016 Replacement Leicester Local Plan. The Secretary of State enabled that proposal to emerge through the statutory planning process, culminating in the adoption of the current City of Leicester Local Plan in January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.2/2">Ashton Green formed part of the evidence supporting the 6Cs (formerly three cities) Growth Point Bid submitted to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning early in 2006.

	<p pid="c.1164W.2/3">Further details of the Ashton Green sustainable community were submitted to the Department as evidence supporting the 6Cs program of development in October 2007. That document made the case for Growth Point funding for the 6Cs that is currently under consideration by the Department: an announcement on funding to all Growth Points will be made in the near future. Growth Point funding is to be awarded as a block grant, so it will be a matter for local partners, including Leicester city council, to determine how to use any funds to support their growth aspirations at Ashton Green and elsewhere.</p>

I invited Leicester city to discuss the potential of forming a local housing company as proposed in the July 2007 Housing White Paper &quot;Homes for the Future; more affordable, more sustainable&quot;, with my officials. As the owner of the land at Ashton Green, Leicester city council is well placed to secure a high proportion of affordable housing on this site through such a delivery vehicle.</p>

	<p pid="c.1168W.0/3" class="italic"> Letter from Vivien Hopkins, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-04">4 December 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what assessment he has made of the ease of completing disability living allowance application forms; and if he will (a) bring forward proposals to review the format of the forms and (b) consults the National Autistic Society on their recommendations for changes to the application process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/5" class="indent">The Minister for Disabled People, Anne McGuire MP, promised you a substantive reply from the Acting Chief Executive of the Disability and Carers Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/6" class="indent">We have a long standing commitment to improving our service to our customers, including identifying and implementing improvements to claim forms for Disability Living Allowance (DLA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/7" class="indent">By way of background the claim form has to cater for the fact that disabling conditions affect different people in different ways, varying enormously from individual to individual, and may also change over time in a way that is not always easy to predict.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/8" class="indent">For these reasons it is vital that each person has the opportunity to explain, on the claim form, exactly how their disability affects their personal care and mobility needs. In addition, over 70% of DLA working age customers have more than one medical condition and forms must therefore allow customers to explain the needs arising from physical, mental or sensory impairments, or any combination of these.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/9" class="indent">Since September 2005, we have aimed to better balance the needs of both our customers and our decision makers by changing the format of our claim forms to a tick box format with more specific questions. This enables the customer to focus more easily on the information required and simplifies completion by the customer, carer or representative. At the same time, it provides the level of detail that DCS decision makers need to understand the impact of the customer's medical condition on their daily life, when considering the legislative criteria for entitlement. The forms allow the customer to provide additional detail in free text, if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/10" class="indent">In developing a new claim form for DLA customers of working age, customer research was conducted using qualitative methods, and extensive consultation with the DCS Advisory Forum (DCS AF) was undertaken. The first version of a new DLA claim form was introduced in September 2005 and used for 6 months in the Bootle and Manchester areas. An amended version was introduced in April 2006 following further consultation with the DCS AF and this version was fully evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/11" class="indent">The evaluation undertaken found that customers were significantly more satisfied with the new claim form than had been the case in the 2005/2006 MORI survey of DCS customers about the national claim forms. Staff, and decision makers in particular, were also generally positive about the new form compared to the previous version, particularly the inclusion of tick boxes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/12" class="indent">Further revisions were made to the form as a result of ongoing evaluation and feedback, resulting in the new DLA 1 Adult claim form that was rolled out for national use in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/13" class="indent">I now turn to part (b) of your question asking if DCS will consult with the National Autistic Society on their recommendations for changes to the application process. I can confirm that we are currently working with key stakeholders, including parents and representatives of children's welfare organisations, to consider the issues around the application process for children, including possible revisions to the DLA Child claim form. The National Autistic Society is one of the groups represented and they are therefore aware of the potential changes to the DLA Child claim form.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/14" class="indent">This work is at an early stage and development of a revised version of a DLA Child claim form for testing and evaluation is planned during 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.0/15" class="indent">Please let me know if I can help further.</p>

	<p pid="c.1173W.3/1">To receive and continue to receive jobseeker's allowance, claimants must be available and actively seeking work. Generally claimants who are in full-time education are not regarded as available for employment during the period of study. Similarly those in full-time training are not regarded as available and are not entitled to jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.3/2">Jobseeker's allowance claimants can however, undertake part-time skills training provided it does not conflict with the work search requirements of their benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.3/3">However, obtaining skills can be an important factor in finding and retaining work. Therefore claimants will be treated as available if they are participating in an employment related course of up to two weeks approved in advance by DWP, or aged 25 or over and on an approved employment related course including one under the new deal for up to nine months.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.3/4">Intensive training for longer than two weeks can only be accessed by moving an individual from jobseeker's allowance onto a training allowance, which protects eligibility to passported benefits including housing benefit and council tax benefit. Training allowances have to date, only been offered to a limited number. In &quot;Opportunity, Employment and Progression: making skills work&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="">26 November</phrase>, we announced our intention to increase access to such training allowances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.3/5">Subject to adviser discretion, customers who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months or more will be moved to a training allowance and will be able to undertake training full-time, employability focussed training designed to meet employer needs for up to eight weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.3/6">Further, in recognition of the importance of obtaining skills in increasing the employment prospects for some Jobcentre Plus customers, we have also announced that we will be piloting mandatory training where the adviser thinks this is appropriate, to test if this increases job outcome rates and employment sustainability and progression.</p>

The cost of calls to 0845 and other non geographic numbers is dependent on several factors.
