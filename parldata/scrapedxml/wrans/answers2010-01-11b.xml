	<p pid="b.645W.3/1">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) publishes data on the construction contractor workforce each quarter on the London 2012 website. The latest figures as at the end of September 2009, showed that 7,270 people were working on the Olympic Site, of which 2,428 were working on the Village. Of those working on the Park, 21 per cent. were people from the five Olympic host boroughs. The ODA expects construction on the Park and Village to have created work for 30,000 people by 2012, with the number of workers on site is expected to peak at 11,000 during 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.645W.3/2">The employment legacy is not limited to those working on the Olympic site. Companies across the UK are winning Games related work, creating employment. The investment in major public projects, like the London 2012 Games, is also supporting the construction industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.645W.3/3">The ODA currently employs 222 people. This figure is forecasted to reduce as projects are completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.645W.3/4">LOCOG estimates that a contracted workforce of 100,000 people will be needed to stage the Games. It is also expected that new opportunities will be created in sectors such as tourism, leisure, hospitality-6,700 new opportunities are expected to be created in retail, hotels and restaurants-and in sport and media because of our hosting of the Games.</p>
	<p pid="b.645W.3/5">LOCOG currently employs approximately 500 people. This number is forecasted to rise to 1,000 people by December 2010, and to 1,700 by December 2011. The number of people employed by LOCOG during Games time is expected to reach 6,000 including temporary Games-time roles.</p>
	<p pid="b.645W.3/6">After the Games, up to 10,000 new permanent jobs are expected to be created on the Park, and more created in the wider Lower Lea valley as a result of the regeneration in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.645W.3/7">Further to the creation of new employment opportunities, the London Development Agency and its partners, including Jobcentre Plus, aim to use the Games to reduce unemployment across the capital by 70,000 by 2012 through programmes such as Personal Best and the Employer Accord. By September 2009 it had achieved 14,000 against this target.</p>

	<p pid="b.657W.0/1">A number of steps have been taken to reduce levels of unemployment among disabled people since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/2">In July 2001 the new deal for disabled people was launched. This is a programme of advice and practical support, which helps people move from disability and health-related benefits into paid employment. The programme is delivered through a network of 'job brokers' offering different services, which can be tailored to a customer's individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/3">December 2007 saw the introduction of Pathways to Work in the West Yorkshire district, which includes the Leeds, West constituency. This programme helps claimants of incapacity benefits or employment and support allowance get work by offering individual support and access to a wide range of help, including work-focused interviews.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/4">The public consultation &quot;Helping People Achieve their Full Potential: Improving Specialist Disability Employment Services&quot; was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December 2007</phrase> to help shape the future of specialist disability employment provision. The new programme, Work Choice, which replaces existing specialist disability employment programmes, will be introduced in October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/5">Employment and support allowance replaced incapacity benefits for new customers nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase>. Employment and support allowance has a greater work-focus than its predecessors. It also has a more modern and robust medical assessment, which helps to identify the help that people need to ensure they can fulfil their potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/6">Access to Work is a specialist disability programme that helps disabled people overcome work-related obstacles. It is flexible, easy to access and shows high levels of satisfaction from disabled people and their employers. The Access to Work base budget has been increased from &#163;15 million in 1994-95 to &#163;81 million in 2009-10 and will continue to grow to &#163;138 million by 2013-14. We are also working to improve the programme to ensure it helps people with mental health conditions more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/7">The refreshed jobseeker's allowance regime and flexible new deal will go live in Leeds in April 2010. This is designed to offer personalised and more intensive support to customers, including those with disabilities, to help overcome barriers to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/8">More generally, all jobseekers have full access to Jobcentre Plus vacancy services to enhance their employment opportunities. We recognise that some disabled customers may have a more limited availability and scope to find and carry out certain types of work. Therefore, at the start of their claim customers are asked to tell their adviser about any disabilities that might have such an impact, and can restrict their work search activity and availability for work if those restrictions are reasonable, given their condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/9">Customers with a disability can volunteer to be fast-tracked to the six month stage of jobseeker's allowance, subject to the Jobcentre Plus personal advisers agreement. This allows disabled people to access additional intensive support earlier in their claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/10">Disability employment advisers are available to provide specialist support to people facing employment barriers because of a disability. They can advise customers about a range of specialised support available, and provide advice on job retention if a person is concerned about losing their job because of their disability. They are supported by work psychologists and various external disability specialists.</p>

	<p pid="b.658W.2/1">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has no plans to assess the safety of household refuse containers (including &quot;wheelie bins&quot;) in relation to deliberate fires. I do not intend to request them to do so as such incidents arise from criminal acts of arson, which is a matter for the police, and not HSE, whose remit is restricted to the health, safety and welfare of persons at work and others who may be affected by work activities. HSE is therefore involved in issues such as the safe lifting of wheelie bins on to refuse lorries, to which European standards apply, but the deliberate setting of fires in household refuse containers is outside any intended normal use and design criteria. Such arson attacks are tackled by the fire and rescue services and are investigated by the police under the Criminal Damage Act 1971.</p>

	<p pid="b.660W.2/1">The introduction of the scanners is a necessary additional measure in response to the heightened threat to the travelling public. Their application to passengers including children, with the proposed safeguards as to their use, is a proportionate response to the heightened threat. The use of body scanners is compatible with the Protection of Children Act 1978. The use of scanners will be subject to a code of practice which is being developed by the Department for Transport and airport operators.</p>

	<p pid="b.667W.0/1">The Highways Agency has established procedures in place for notifying any local residents or businesses likely to be affected by planned works, as well as placing advertisements in the local press. These can include letter drops, locally held exhibitions and press-releases prior to the commencement of works. In addition, hon. Members, within whose constituencies work is due to take place are given advance warning of the start of works. Local councillors are also routinely advised.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.0/2">In schemes where work takes place entirely within the existing highway boundary, as is the case with the current M6 motorway works in the Walsall, North constituency, there is no obligation upon the Highways Agency to give such additional publicity. However, in view of the close proximity of residents in this case, arrangements were made within the contract for a site-liaison officer to be appointed to regularly communicate with local residents about the progress of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.0/3">In addition, following representations made by residents' groups, regarding works on the M6 in the Walsall, North constituency further measures have been put in place to keep residents informed. These include regular newsletters and visits by the site-liaison officer to affected residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.0/4">With regard to the notification of Members whose constituency is adversely affected by major work, it is the Highways Agency's standing practice to give such notification. In the case of this project, my hon. Friend was included in the original notification to MPs and MEPs, sent on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-10">10 September 2008</phrase>, prior to the commencement of the works.</p>

These requirements are based upon detailed business case analysis and expected revenue increases. In some cases these are specified within the contract because they have a pay-back period longer than the franchise term. Such schemes increase the value of the franchise in future years, reducing the long term cost of the railway to the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="b.670W.6/3"><i> (a)</i> Both during February 2009 and immediately following the winter season, a number of discussions were held between the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency to discuss issues arising from the winter and to contribute to the related Transport Select Committee (TSC) hearing and other related events requiring briefing information. Following the TSC hearing, the UK Roads Liaison Group led a review into the severe weather of February 2009, comprising input from the Highways Agency, salt suppliers and the Department for Transport, as well as local authority representation. Discussions between the Department for Transport and Highways Agency were held in both carrying out the review and compiling the subsequent report. Department for Transport Ministers have also had a number of discussions with the Highways Agency to discuss winter resilience, including the distribution of salt.</p>
	<p pid="b.670W.6/4"><i> (b)</i> Department for Transport officials have also had a number of discussions with Salt Union and others on similar issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.673W.3/1">The December Transport Council took place during the recess. I therefore reported on the outcome of the Council, including the outcome of discussions on intelligent transport systems, in a letter to the Hon. Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee. The text of that letter is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;I attended the second Transport Council of the Swedish Presidency, in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-17">17 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/3" class="indent">The Council reached a Political Agreement on a Regulation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport. The Regulation aims to make bus and coach transport more attractive, particularly to disabled people and people with reduced mobility; and to create a level playing field across Europe, both between operators and different modes of transport. I was one of several Ministers to maintain reservations on the scope, asking for the Regulation to apply only to long-distance national and international services. Some other Member States argued strongly for widening the scope. The Presidency offered a compromise of removing the compensation and assistance provisions from the application to urban, suburban and regional services. This means that the only provisions from which Member States would not be able to exempt such services would be those requiring that ticket prices and conditions must be offered without any discrimination based on nationality or the place of establishment of the carrier, and that there must be no discrimination on grounds of disability or reduced mobility with regard to booking a journey or boarding a vehicle. This compromise was acceptable to all, and on this basis I accepted the text of the Political Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/4" class="indent">The Council agreed a General Approach on the proposal for an amending Regulation on the establishment of structures for the management of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes. The text of the General Approach was acceptable to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/5" class="indent">There was a Progress Report on a Directive on the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). I joined some other Ministers in opposing mandatory deployment. We only support the further deployment of ITS where there is a sound business case for doing so in pursuit of our transport goals. I expressed the UK view that such decisions should be for Member States, and my understanding that nothing in this Directive prejudices that right. We will continue to regard this as critical in discussions on any future proposals. The Presidency hoped that the Directive could be adopted as soon as possible during the New Year and that agreement will be reached with the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/6" class="indent">There was also a Progress report on a proposed Directive on aviation security charges. The UK will continue to work towards achieving a fair and proportionate outcome that balances the interests of passengers and airports.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/7" class="indent">The Council reached a General Approach on a Directive on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from EU ports. The Directive seeks to facilitate maritime transport by simplifying administrative procedures for ships travelling between EU ports by the introduction of streamlined electronic reporting. I stated that the UK still has some concerns relating to the consistency of the Directive with our e-Borders system. We will seek to see these resolved at a later stage of the negotiating process.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/8" class="indent">The Council was unable to agree to the draft Conclusions on the Commission's Communication &quot;A sustainable future for transport: Towards an integrated, technology-led and user friendly system&quot;. Following the debate therefore, the Presidency issued Conclusions to be used to provide a steer to the Commission on priorities for the next EU Transport White Paper, which is due in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/9" class="indent">The Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate an agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), providing a general framework for enhanced cooperation, with priority given to aviation safety issues in the first instance. We welcome this development. The Presidency made clear that the Decision does not affect relations between individual Member States and ICAO, nor does it affect the arrangements for preparing Community positions for meetings of the ICAO Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/10" class="indent">There was a Progress Report from the Commission on the negotiation of a second stage air transport agreement with the US. I joined some others in suggesting that the next Transport Council should review progress and consider any new US proposals, particularly on the key issue of investment reform. The Council took note of the state of play, confirmed the importance of reaching a deal in 2010, and noted signs of progress in some areas, but stressed the need for significant progress in other areas (including investment reform and the environment).</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.3/11" class="indent">Under AOB, the Commission informed the Council that the outcome of the Galileo procurement process would be announced in a few months time.&quot;</p>

When access is no longer required, the passes are withdrawn. Disaggregating the number of security passes issued to contractors providing consultancy services in the last 12 months would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.680W.8/1">DEFRA manages sickness absences in line with its sickness absence policy. This includes facilitating timely employee access to occupational health advice, medical or wellbeing interventions. Long-term sick employees are encouraged to return to work on a programme of recuperative duties where appropriate. All individuals returning to work from sickness absence will have a &quot;welcome back&quot; meeting with their manager. This is to discuss their reasons for absence and, where necessary, work-related issues connected with their absence including provision of workplace adjustments.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.8/2">The number of days of sickness absence taken by staff in DEFRA and its agencies in each of the last 12 months could be calculated only by incurring disproportionate cost. However, the total number of working days lost due to sickness in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase> (the latest available figure) in DEFRA and its agencies was 80,900, an average of 8.1 days per employee. The estimated cost of sickness absence in 2008-09 was &#163;9.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.8/3">There is no agreed method of calculating the cost of sickness absences in the civil service. DEFRA has calculated the annual cost by multiplying the number of working days lost due to sickness in each grade by the average salary for that grade. No account has been taken of staff on long-term sick who are on reduced or no pay, which would reduce the total.</p>

Reward-only and voucher-based schemes are included within the scope of the powers. It is up to local authorities to make a proposal to the Secretary of State for permission to run a pilot, in line with local needs. None have yet done so.

	<p pid="b.684W.2/1">We have just completed a fundamental review of exemptions from the need for an environmental permit for waste operations. Revised regulations will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase>. One of the aspects of the review was funding the recovery of the Environment Agency's costs of registering exempt waste operations and carrying out appropriate periodic inspection. Currently, some exemptions from permitting are subject to annual registration fees, while the majority are not. We consulted on proposals to introduce a &#163;50 fee for the registration of most exemptions. The majority of those who responded to this consultation were against the introduction of fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.684W.2/2">The Government concluded that in the current economic climate, imposing charges may discourage the take-up of small-scale waste recycling and recovery operations and have a disproportionate impact on small businesses. The Government therefore decided not to prescribe charges for the registration of exempt waste operations or to provide the Environment Agency with powers to introduce charges under its scheme of charging, agreed each year with the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.684W.2/3">The exception to this is the exemption for the treatment of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), which is already subject to a registration fee to recover the costs of the mandatory annual inspection required under the WEEE Directive, 2002/96/EC. Under the revised regulations, the level of the registration fee for the WEEE exemption for the new three-year registration period will be in line with the current charges for annual registration and will be set out in the scheme of charges for 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.685W.11/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) published the findings of new research into the quantity of household food and drink waste in November 2009 which revealed that 8.3 million tonnes of food and drink are thrown away by households each year, most of which (5.3 million tonnes) could have been consumed. This avoidable food and drink waste is worth &#163;12 billion, on average costing around &#163;480 for every household a year, increasing to &#163;680 a year for households with children.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.11/2">In the study, three reasons for avoidable food waste were identified; cooked, prepared or served too much; not used in time and other. Just over half of avoidable food and drink waste is classified as 'not used in time', with a value of approximately &#163;250 per household per year, and a further 40 per cent. falling into the category of 'cooked, prepared or served too much'.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.11/3">Much of the food and drink that is wasted is unnecessary and can usually be avoided, and we are now focusing on how to change people's behaviour, and incentivise retailers to play a more active role. The Government are doing this through their ongoing work with WRAP to cut significantly the amount of food wasted in the supply chain and in the home. This requires a twin-track approach-working closely with retailers and manufacturers, and also directly with householders.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.11/4">DEFRA funds WRAP to deliver the Love Food Hate Waste campaign which is aimed at helping consumers more effectively manage their shopping and food storage and usage to help cut down on food waste and save money, through providing a number of pieces of advice and information via various media.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.11/5">The Government are also collaborating with WRAP and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) on a project which will help prevent consumer food waste through the application and increased understanding of date labelling (use by, best before, sell by, display until etc.), and food storage and use guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.11/6">The Courtauld Commitment between Government (represented by WRAP) and the grocery sector also includes a target to reduce household food waste by 155,000 tonnes over a three-year period (ending in March 2010), which places an onus on the industry to implement means of helping consumers to reduce waste-such as clearer and more informative storage and usage guidance and new ranges of product sizes more in line with contemporary consumer demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.11/7">Charitable organisations are also working to minimise food waste by providing the food industry, including supermarkets and restaurants, with an outlet for good quality surplus food by redistributing it to vulnerable people in the community.</p>

	<p pid="b.688W.0/1">Membership of the Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and Sustainable Resource Management (ACR+) network gives access to research reports, conference proceedings, newsletters and gives discounts for attendance at conferences. It also allows effective sharing of information between approximately 100 local and regional authorities that have a shared interest in waste management and resource recovery. It also facilitates joint participation in research projects, allowing costs to be spread and reducing duplication of effort.</p>

	<p pid="b.688W.3/1">In Budget 2009, the Chancellor announced that he was making available &#163;10 million to support the development of anaerobic digestion and in-vessel composting projects in 2009-2010. Some &#163;8.4 million of this funding was allocated to DEFRA with the remainder going to the devolved administrations. DEFRA and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) decided that the timescales associated with the planning and construction of new anaerobic digestion and in-vessel composting projects precluded DEFRA from fully utilising the Budget 2009 funding in the current financial year. Therefore DEFRA, HM Treasury and DECC agreed that &#163;4.4 million of this allocation should be transferred to the latter to allow it to accelerate the implementation of the Anaerobic Digestion Demonstration Programme in 2009-2010. This programme is delivered by WRAP on behalf of DEFRA, but is funded by DECC's Environmental Transformation Fund. In recognition of this arrangement, DECC will be making a reciprocal transfer of &#163;4.4 million to DEFRA in 2010-2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.3/2">WRAP is mainly funded by DEFRA with subsidiary funding from DECC and the devolved administrations. Therefore DEFRA remains the sponsoring department for WRAP.</p>

	<p pid="b.698W.12/2">To date we have made the following progress:</p>
	<p pid="b.698W.12/3" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase> changes to PACE Code A came into effect which removed the requirement for police officers to complete the Stop and Account form, whilst retaining the recording of the ethnicity of those stopped for monitoring reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.698W.12/4" class="indent">We are also legislating in the Crime and Security Bill currently before Parliament to remove the paperwork associated with Stop and Search.</p>
	<p pid="b.698W.12/5">Action on forms is part of a wider approach to bureaucracy reduction, focusing on the simplification of policing processes and more effective management of risk. Jan Berry has been appointed as the independent Reducing Bureaucracy Advocate to challenge Government and the police service to make further progress on these issues, supported by a practitioner group of police officers and staff. Her full report, Reducing Bureaucracy in Policing, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-02">2 December 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.698W.12/6">As set out in the White Paper, we will also work with police stakeholders to encourage forces themselves to take responsibility for reducing bureaucracy.

A key element of CONTEST, the Government's strategy for countering international terrorism, is &quot;Prevent&quot;-that is to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting violent extremism. To do this we need to prevent people supporting violent extremism and the ideology that fuels terrorism. Part of our Prevent work is to challenge those who support violence. But we also want to actively promote the shared values (including democracy and the rule of law) on which our society and the cohesion of our communities depend. We aim to do this by working in partnership with communities to challenge the ideology of violent extremism and disrupt those who promote it. The Government aim to empower all communities to reject violent extremism. We are also working with police forces, local authorities, schools and universities, and local communities to protect vulnerable individuals from radicalisation.</p>

These have included the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) guidance on stop and search which was revised and reissued to all forces in November 2008.

This letter reiterated how the powers should be used and was accompanied by a copy of the national circular.</p>

	<p pid="b.708W.0/1">I have regular discussions with ministerial colleagues and Welsh Assembly Government Ministers on all issues affecting the Welsh economy including small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.0/2">The Welsh Assembly Government is actively engaged in promoting small business and self-employment options with young people, including graduates.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.0/3">In addition, under the Jobcentre Plus Six Month Offer, there are two elements of help on offer to people who want to move into self-employment or start a business. The first provides financial support during the early weeks of trading through the self-employment credit paid of &#163;50 a week for up to 16 weeks and the Building Britain's Recovery White Paper brings forward entitlement to this credit to three months.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.0/4">The second was a provision of additional funds to Flexible Support for Business in Wales so that it can provide intensive self-employment and business start-up support for those who need it both before they leave benefits and into the first weeks of trading.</p>

Due to developments internationally, including a G20 consensus agreement on bank capital reform, it is now expected that the European Commission will reissue its consultation in late summer or the autumn of 2010. This will have a broader scope to match the Bank for International Settlements' consultation 'Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector', while retaining the measures on moving towards a single rulebook for bank capital in the EU.

CLSAs will provide a single strategic interface between local authorities, Children's Trusts and the Department.

	<p pid="b.727W.2/1">There is nothing to prevent local authorities from using the funding delivered for the Primary Capital programme to provide new primary school places where there is need. The Primary Capital programme challenges local authorities to join up funding streams in support of a long term strategic approach to capital investment across the primary school estate, which will include providing sufficient permanent school places where they are wanted. Our expectation, therefore, is that all investment in primary schools should support the strategic objectives outlined in each authority's primary strategy for change. Decisions about investment priorities and how these should be funded are rightly matters for local determination.</p>
	<p pid="b.727W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-30">30 November 2009</phrase>, the Department confirmed funding of up to &#163;300 million to support the provision of additional primary places in authorities experiencing exceptional growth in the number of primary pupils. This is on top of more than &#163;1.2 billion already available to local authorities collectively from 2008 until 2011 to help them provide permanent new places in areas of population growth.</p>

In 2008-09, 23 regional &quot;pathfinder&quot; authorities received funding of &#163;149 million and 32 exemplar projects-20 new build and 12 refurbishment-have already been completed.

	<p pid="b.737W.5/1">The main route by which insulation and energy efficient light bulbs are promoted to households is through the Carbon Emission Reduction Target. This is an obligation on energy suppliers to meet household carbon emission saving targets. The suppliers unit cost of purchase and the level of subsidy they employ is commercial in confidence. Government estimates for the total unit cost of compact fluorescent lights (including administrative costs) is around &#163;1.41, and for cavity wall insulation is around &#163;455. There are a number of variables which impact the estimates for the level of subsidy suppliers employ, including whether the household is a priority group or non priority group customer and whether it is in social housing. For example, for cavity wall insulation in non social housing, estimates for energy supplier subsidy is on average just under 100 per cent. for priority group households and just over 50 per cent. for non priority group households.</p>

	<p pid="b.745W.5/1">UK direct contributions to WFP in 2008 and 2009 were &#163;89.9 million (equivalent to US$169 million) and &#163;81.7 million (equivalent to US$127.6 million) respectively. These are the two highest contributions in the period 2004-09. Our ranking among WFP's donors was similar (seventh in 2008 and eighth in 2009) and our share of WFP's total income (in US$ terms) was almost the same (3.3 per cent. in 2008 and 3.2 per cent. in 2009). In both years we contributed more to WFP than to any other humanitarian agency or fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.5/2">Our contributions to WFP take into account the different ways in which we can help protect the most vulnerable. The main reason we contributed less to WFP in some countries in 2009 is that while the food price crisis of 2008 required an exceptional food assistance response, the persisting problems of food insecurity required a broader range of actions-not all involving WFP. For example in Bangladesh we are tackling chronic food insecurity through our social protection, livelihoods and health/nutrition interventions. In Kenya we are supporting NGOs who are specifically working on child malnutrition.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.5/3">Our 2008 funding was also boosted by the response to Cyclone Nargis (&#163;12.6 million equivalent to US$24.8 million) and the final year of our institutional strengthening programme with WFP (&#163;2.8 million equivalent to US$5.0 million).</p>

These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.

They are then subject to a period of consultation with stakeholders before final publication on the NICE menu for QOF. NHS Employers (on behalf of the Department) and the British Medical Association will then negotiate on which of the published indicators will be applied nationally and what the value of these indicators should be.

	<p pid="b.761W.5/1">As the General Pharmaceutical Council will be independent of Government, it was not thought it appropriate for the Department to consult on these standards on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.5/2">The General Pharmaceutical Council will be a new body with new powers so there are no comparable statutory standards in existence for pharmacy. However, where there are existing standards that cover the same geographical remit as the new regulator, that is Great Britain, they have been used as a starting point for development. In particular, the most recent Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain education standards have been incorporated where possible.</p>

The regulatory framework is being strengthened to reduce opportunities for fraud; the new operational model for HMRC to respond to fraud using new approaches and the full range of HMRC's powers is on track to be implemented from April 2010; and HMRC is working with the large brewers and wholesale buying groups on developing practical measures to close off illicit supply chains by restricting the availability of illicit alcohol to fraudsters.</p>

	<p pid="b.770W.2/2">The reason that some separately assessed property within the port of Hull has been merged with the assessment for the statutory port is that new information has been provided and there has been agreement of the facts between the parties. This reflects the success of the &quot;fast-track&quot; appeals process applied by the Valuation Office Agency to cases involving a significant and unexpected backdated liability. Where ratepayers co-operate and provide the information requested, the agency has been able to review the rating lists and make amendments to reflect new information that has a material affect on the assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.770W.2/3">The same approach has been applied at other ports. Where changes have not been made and properties continue to be separately assessed for business rates this is either because the facts do not support the case for change or the parties have not agreed the facts that may still prove material.</p>

From our communication with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) it appears that the research was conducted by a worker in HMP Dartmoor but on an ad-hoc basis and with no official or central oversight by either MOJ or MOD. Preliminary results which found that 32 of the 191 prisoners (16.75 per cent.) were veterans, were presented at a meeting of the Veterans Prison In-Reach Working Group (VPIR), a group sponsored by the MOD. It is likely that the result was skewed because the wings were largely comprised of older prisoners which meant that they were more likely than other prisoners to have served in the armed forces at some time (including under national service).</p>

However, it was widely recognised that the introduction of credit and debit card facilities would be welcomed among the large majority of responsible court users where a debt has arisen from a genuine dispute for a small claim and that not providing these facilities would be denying those debtors a very convenient way to pay their debt.</p>

These were for use as corporate images following reshuffles or machinery of Government changes, and portraits were taken of senior MOJ officials as well as the ministerial team.

	<p pid="b.792W.3/15">Not all prisoners released in error will be unlawfully at large. For example, they may be released on a valid licence or have been unconvicted prisoners whose cases have now been concluded without a custodial sentence. As the table shows, there are only 12 surviving ex-prisoners who have not been back into the criminal justice system since their release in error. Further inquiries are being made to ensure all appropriate action is being taken to locate them.</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.3/16">Most prisoners released in error are returned to custody quickly. While we are aware of one case in which a prisoner released in error committed a serious offence in 2005, there is otherwise no indication from the available information of any significant level of offending by prisoners who should have been in custody at the time.</p>

	<p pid="b.794W.8/1">The National Offender Management Service has a comprehensive drug treatment framework, based on the National Treatment Agency's revised models of care, to address the different needs of drug-misusers in prison. The interventions available are designed to meet the needs of low, moderate and severe drug misusers, irrespective of age, gender or ethnicity. Core elements of the framework are available in all adult prisons across England and Wales. Higher intensity services are available in selected sites according to the drug treatment needs of offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.794W.8/2">Given the large numbers entering prisons with a history of drug misuse and the range of problems that they face, we have not considered it appropriate formally to assess the merits of dedicated drug treatment prisons. However, where prisoners are assessed as suitable for high intensity drug interventions such as therapeutic communities or the 12-step programme every effort is made to move them to an establishment offering that programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.794W.8/3">As no formal assessment has taken place, we have not estimated the cost of places in dedicated drug treatment prisons. However, average costs in 2008-09 indicate that the additional cost of places on prison-based accredited drug treatment programmes (eg 12-Step, Therapeutic Communities) can range from &#163;1,200 to &#163;7,200. Variations in cost are dependent upon the mix of staff delivering the programme and its length/intensity.</p>

	<p pid="b.795W.2/1">The full cost of providing meals includes a number of elements including staff and prisoner labour, food, training (staff and prisoner), kitchen and servery facilities, utilities and other overheads, including management overheads, and it is not possible to fully identify these costs-some of which are shared resources across individual prisons and between prisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.795W.2/2">It is, however, possible to separately identify the cost of food. For 2008-09, the last full financial year for which figures are available, the average public sector Prison Service daily food cost per prisoner in England and Wales was &#163;2.31.</p>
	<p pid="b.795W.2/3">The average food cost per meal per prisoner is based on the understanding that breakfast, lunch and dinner account for approximately 20 per cent., 40 per cent. and 40 per cent. of the daily food cost.

	<p pid="b.796W.0/42">Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy. From mid-2007 this policy has been applied to both the public sector and contracted estate. The strategy requires each prison to undertake regular analysis of the problem areas, consider solutions and provide an action plan to improve personal safety and reduce violence. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety. This includes environmental and physical measures, as well as alternative ways of managing behaviour.</p>

Since David Blakey's report, &quot;Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons&quot;, was published in July 2008 good progress has been made in implementing Blakey's recommendations. We have also strengthened the law, through the Offender Management Act 2007 (implemented in April 2008), which makes it a criminal offence with a punishment of up to ten years' imprisonment for the conveyance of drugs, mobile phones or other prohibited items into a prison. There is also a range of offences used to prosecute staff in these circumstances, including misconduct in public office and possession with intent to supply.</p>

Data on this previous measure for the 2002-2005 cohorts were reported in early 2004-2007 respectively. After 2007 the basis of the measure changed to offenders that received a pre-court disposal (reprimand or final warning) or a first-tier or community penalty or were released from custody between January and March.

	<p pid="b.799W.0/4">The local juvenile reoffending measure differs from the published national statistics on juvenile reoffending. The primary difference is that the data source is administrative data held by youth offending teams, whereas the national statistics are produced using the police national computer. There are therefore differences in the offences which count towards reoffending.

This Strategy should usefully consider supply chain issues in relation to the range of small scale on-site low carbon and renewable energy technologies, for example, the development of skills in design and installation of such technologies. In addition, it may also consider other areas such as developing a systems approach as opposed to a technology approach for microgeneration technologies, certification and standards and information provision.

	<p pid="b.814W.3/1">Good progress is being made with the relicensing of Sector Skills Councils. The assessment and relicensing process for Sector Skills Councils formally opened in July 2008 with the launch of the Prospectus, 'Empowering SSCs-Employer driven skills reform across the UK'. By the end of 2009 18 SSCs had successfully met the performance standard. In the case of Skillfast-UK, the SSC for the fashion and textile sector, Government decided to uphold the UK Commission's recommendation not to issue a new license. Instead, the intention is for the coverage of this sector to come within the scope of another SSC. The UK Commission expect to make further recommendations to Government early in 2010 in relation to the remaining SSCs.</p>

	<p pid="b.818W.8/1">By March 2010, 20,000 graduate internships overall will have been created in the private, public and third sectors to help young people develop the skills they need to build their employability. There will be different models for these internships. Up to 10,000 of these places will be delivered in partnership with the Federation of Small Businesses, of which at least 5,000 will receive an allowance towards the cost of the internship. That will provide &#163;100 per week towards the wage costs involved and employers will meet the balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.818W.8/2">These places are being provided through the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the universities. Details of the funding awarded will be published in January and we expect the bulk of the employers to be providing internships and receiving allowances by the end of March.</p>
