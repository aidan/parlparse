	<p pid=".311W.3/1">A project team was appointed early last year to look at potential sites for the memorial and to consider the qualifying criteria for those to be commemorated. Extensive research was carried out on suitable sites both in and outside London. There has been wide consultation with the services and ex-service organisations on both the siting and eligibility criteria. There is general support for the proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.3/2">I am delighted to be able to confirm that the Armed Forces Memorial will be sited at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The names of those commemorated will either be engraved on the memorial or in Rolls of Honour that will be kept close by in the Millennium Chapel at the Arboretum. The design of the memorial will be decided following an architectural competition that will be held later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.3/3">The qualifying criteria for inclusion on the memorial are:</p>
	<p pid=".311W.3/4" class="indent">&quot;All those Service personnel who were killed on duty whilst performing functions attributable to the special circumstances and requirements of the Armed Forces, or as a result of terrorist attack, and all those who died whilst deployed on designated operations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".311W.3/5">An additional part of the project will be to erect a memorial plaque in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey to those members of the armed forces killed in conflict since the end of the second world war. Finally, there will be Rolls of Honour recording the names of all members of the Royal Navy and the Army who have died in service during this period. These will be kept in suitable churches in London and will be similar to those for the Royal Air Force that are kept in the Church of St. Clement Danes.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.3/6">Trustees of the Armed Forces Memorial trust will now be appointed to take this project forward. They will take on the ownership of the memorial and will be responsible for its funding and construction. Funds will be raised by public subscription.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.3/7">This is a very important national project that will also provide a platform to help educate our younger generations about the value of our armed forces.</p>

	<p pid=".312W.3/1">Comprehensive environmental monitoring programmes have been in place at both Eskmeals and Kirkcudbright ever since the beginning of the DU munitions trials announced in the House in 1979. These programmes have focused on the collection and analysis of samples of soil, vegetation, freshwater, seawater, seaweed, molluscs and seabed and shoreline sediments. Faecal samples from domestic and wild animals have also been collected on an opportunity basis. This monitoring continues to show that DU does not pose a significant risk to members of the public or site personnel.</p>

	<p pid=".313W.2/1">As Eskmeals, depleted uranium (DU) rounds have been fired against hard targets and the resulting DU fragments and contaminated debris have been collected after each firing. The material has then been sent for disposal at the low-level radioactive waste repository at Drigg. Air filters from the target area have also been disposed of via this route. Some higher activity material, such as DU plate, which is not suitable for disposal at Drigg, remains in storage pending a national decision on future radioactive waste disposal strategies. Some steel targets contaminated with very low levels of DU are still stored at the site and options for the disposal of this material are currently being discussed with the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.2/2">At Kirkudbright, the trials require the DU rounds to be fired through very soft targets (such as hessian sheets) and to travel out to sea. In this case, remediation is required only if an experimental round malfunctions and contaminates the range area. When such impact points have been located, samples of soil and vegetation have been collected to assess the degree of contamination: clean-up is then carried out if pre-set action levels have been exceeded. Specially marked drums have been kept at each firing point for storing contaminated material and the Radiation Protection Adviser has provided disposal advice on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.2/3">At West Freugh, a small number of DU projectiles, weighing less than 25kg in total, were fired into the sea 2km below the low-water mark. There are no records of any DU projectiles accidentally striking the land in the region. The small number of DU rounds in the sea were not considered to pose a hazard which would warrant a clean-up operation.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.2/4">Foulness had an indoor facility, in which small experimental DU projectiles were fired between 1982 and 1983. The building was designed to prevent any escape of particulate DU into the atmosphere. It is no longer in use and was decontaminated in 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".313W.5/1">We welcome the publication of part II of the Royal Society report which is a valuable addition to the scientific knowledge on the risks from depleted uranium (DU) munitions.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/2">Overall, the report's conclusions are very much in line with the Ministry of Defence's assessment that the risks DU poses to the health of UK Gulf veterans, peacekeepers in the Balkans and UK forces/civilians in current and future conflicts, are very low, in all but extreme cases. This is what we have always believed, and bears out the findings of research carried out by organisations such as the United Nations and World Health Organisation as well as ourselves.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/3">The extreme circumstances mentioned in the report could affect individuals such as the crew of a vehicle that had been hit by a DU round or personnel who had worked for long periods, unprotected, in a vehicle which had been hit. I am pleased to say that no UK service personnel have been exposed in this way.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/4">Nevertheless, there are a number of areas where we believe that further research is desirable to enhance the database on which to make judgments weighing the potential loss of life arising from not using DU munitions in battle against any potential longer term impact on human health and the environment resulting from its use.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence is pursuing initiatives to reduce the numbers who are temporarily unfit for operational purposes because of injury. These initiatives include measures aimed at prevention of injury, for example, improvements to the physical fitness training programmes for new entrants. The measures also include swifter assessment and better treatment of those who are injured, especially through the creation of additional rehabilitation facilities. These steps are expected to lead to a reduction in the numbers of personnel who are medically downgraded, including a reduction in the numbers who are invalided as a consequence of injury.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.6/2">Any personnel developing a permanent condition which degrades their functional capacity may require to be permanently downgraded or invalided as appropriate. The recommendation will be made in accordance with the service's medical boarding procedures. A Medical Board may recommend that an individual's medical condition is compatible with continued service in a permanently reduced medical category but the final decision will be made by the employing authority, taking into account the ability for the service to continue to employ an individual with the relevant restriction. If, despite efforts to the contrary, this turns out not to be practicable, the individual will be invalided.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.6/3">In the case of officers invalided from the service, subject to meeting the health requirements laid down, eligible individuals may apply for employment under the MOD Retired Officer scheme. Alternatively, there are no restrictions on disabled people being employed in civilian jobs in the MOD. The Department complies fully with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and was one of the first Departments to achieve the Employment Service two-tick &quot;Positive about disabled people&quot; symbol in May 1995. The MOD also has its own Disability Fund to pay for specialist equipment and training to help disabled employees develop their full potential at work. The Department is a member of the Employers' Forum on Disability and currently funds three disability bursaries through the Cabinet Office scheme. Around 5 per cent. of the civilian workforce of the MOD has a declared disability. This percentage is broadly in line with the estimated numbers of economically active disabled people in the working population as a whole.</p>

The armed forces are organising a royal visit which will take place in Portsmouth in late June and the Ministry of Defence will fund the cost of providing a Golden Jubilee medal to eligible service personnel. Wherever possible any expenditure on these two projects will be from its existing financial allocation. There was no identifiable expenditure on the Golden Jubilee in financial year (FY) 1999&ndash;2000. In FY 2000&ndash;01 there was an estimated &pound;31,500 associated with planning for the Golden Jubilee and thus far in FY 2001&ndash;02 a further &pound;1,155,000 has been spent, including the costs of supplying and issuing about 40,500 Golden Jubilee medals.

We shall be considering whether any changes will be required to the aspects dealt with in the 2000 Act when the Service discipline Acts are replaced by a single piece of discipline legislation covering all the Services. We are also assessing whether any modifications may be necessary as a result of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Morris <i>v.</i> the United Kingdom, although that judgment was directly concerned with court martial procedures rather than the areas covered by the 2000 Act.</p>

As part of this commitment, we recently published a strategy document entitled 'Tackling child poverty: giving every child the best possible start in life' which will inform the Budget and Spending Review 2002. As a result of tax and benefit changes announced in the last Parliament, there are now 1.2 million fewer children in poverty than there would otherwise have been.</p>

The Government are also making substantial new investments in services for children. Over the four years to 2004, average real-terms annual growth in spending on education and training in England will be over 5&frac12; per cent. In addition, extra funds have been made available for SureStart, Neighbourhood Renewal and the Children's Fund.</p>

Organised crime gangs with no paramilitary links are also involved. We are responding firmly and robustly to the drugs problem through the organised crime task force. The hon. Gentleman will wish to join me in congratulating PSNI for their recent successes.</p>

	<p pid=".334W.8/1">In Northern Ireland we are seeking to tackle and confront the trade in counterfeit goods through the co-ordinated efforts of the Organised Crime Task Force which I chair.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.8/2">The task force provides a multi-agency approach to tackling the range of organised criminal activity that exists in Northern Ireland and to optimise our approach members are drawn from HM Customs and Excise, PSNI and N10, as well as others.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.8/3">Specifically to highlight and bring to the forefront of the Northern Ireland public's attention the major wrong of supporting those who trade illegally, Sir Reg Empey (Minister for Enterprise in the Northern Ireland Executive) and I paid a visit to shops and businesses in Belfast city centre before Christmas to visibly encourage the support of legitimate trade. We sought to highlight further the wrongdoing of supporting those who trade in counterfeit goods through articles by Sir Reg and myself in the task force's news-sheet entitled &quot;Response&quot;, which receives a wide distribution within Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.8/4">I would pay particular tribute to the work of the police and other agencies who have recorded a number of successes in recent months against those trading in counterfeit goods. One such example relates to police operations at Nutts Corner market where in October 2001 &pound;80,000 was seized and on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-23">23 December 2001</phrase> &pound;18,000 worth of counterfeit CDs and Playstation games were seized. Other recent successful seizures include &pound;40,000 worth of counterfeit clothing at Kilkeel market and &pound;60,000 worth of counterfeit CDs etc. following a house search in Jonesborough.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.8/5">At the end of January I co-hosted with Sir Reg Empey an event at Hillsborough Castle which brought together leading Northern Ireland business leaders representing such organisations as the CBI, Institute of Directors, small businesses, the construction industry and banking, to name but some. The event was part of our on-going attempts to engage with the business community and enlist their support in the fight against organised criminal activity in its many forms. I will be continuing with this process of engagement in the months ahead.</p>

	<p pid=".335W.2/1">The Organised Crime Task Force, which I chair, is continuing to tackle head on organised criminal activity in all its forms. In last year's threat assessment, published in March 2001, the Organised Crime Task Force identified 78 organised crime groups, involving around 400 individuals. About half of the groups have links to paramilitary groups.</p>
	<p pid=".335W.2/2">However, the lines between terrorism and organised crime are blurred. Approaching terrorism as just terrorism, or organised crime as just organised crime, will inevitably overlook the common ground between the two. Both depend on a group of individuals operating together in secrecy with the same need to launder proceeds from racketeering, drugs, armed robberies etc. regardless of whether this is for personal gain or paramilitary purposes.</p>

	<p pid=".337W.2/1">These attacks are completely the opposite of what the Belfast Agreement was about. Those who sanction them and carry them out are the enemies of a transition to a peaceful society in Northern Ireland. Police investigate all such attacks but their investigations into these offences are often hampered, as the victims generally decline to make a formal complaint. Regrettably therefore prosecutions are therefore extremely rare.</p>
	<p pid=".337W.2/2">The Government continue to support the police providing them with the resource they require, but it is also important that members of communities from which the perpetrators of these attacks emanate pass on relevant information to the police. This can be done in strict confidence using the Crimestoppers line.</p>

	<p pid=".339W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-14">14 March 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/2"><i>Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC)</i> All information in PLASC about individual pupils, including their ethnicity, is collected from schools under Regulations laid under section 537A of the Education Act 1996, as amended by section 140(1), paragraph 153 of Schedule 30 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/3">PLASC information will be used by the Department solely for statistical purposes. It remains of statistical value after pupils have left school&mdash;for example to monitor patterns of progression from school into further education and training, higher education and the labour market, and how these patterns vary between different groups of pupils, including different ethnic groups. In order to be able to derive such statistics PLASC information will be retained indefinitely on an individual pupil basis, as allowed by section 33 of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/4">With respect to pupils' ethnicity, the ethnic groups used for PLASC in January 2002 were based on those from the 1991 national population Census, and from January 2003 will be based on those from the 2001 Census. In neither case is Jewish identified as a separate ethnic group, nor is there any other information in PLASC that identifies pupils as Jewish.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/5">Relatively little of the information in PLASC is provided by pupils or parents&mdash;much of it will be known by the school from its own interactions with pupils, or will be received from other sources. The main items that are provided by pupils or parents (in addition to name, date of birth and home postcode) are ethnic group and first language. Schools should seek this information, but pupils or parents have the right to withhold it. Most schools already obtain this information routinely.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/6">The White Paper &quot;Excellence in Schools&quot;, published in July 1997, highlighted the need for much better pupil level information to be available throughout the schools sector in order to support the drive to raise standards, and also for a national system of &quot;unique pupil numbers&quot; (UPNs) to enable this information to be collated accurately on a pupil by pupil basis. A consultation document was issued in December 1997 with detailed proposals (including PLASC, UPNs and a central pupil database) addressing the issues raised by the White Paper. This document was sent to LEAs, teacher associations, church and religious organisations, governors' and parents' organisations, the Data Protection Registrar (as she was then), leading civil liberties organisations (Liberty and Charter 88), and a range of other interested organisations (including the Commission for Racial Equality). A summary of the document was also sent to all schools.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/7">Before and after this consultation exercise the Department had meetings with the Data Protection Registrar and her officials, and a series of measures were agreed in respect of the issuing of UPNs, and their use in the collection and collation of pupil level data. These measures aimed to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act, and minimise any possible threat to the privacy of pupils. The Department continues to discuss the use of UPNs and pupil level information with the Information Commissioner's Office as and when issues arise, and is also planning to discuss with her Office security arrangements for the forthcoming central pupil database.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/8">The Department has no interest in the identity of individual pupils as such. Pupil names and UPNs are collected to enable PLASC information to be linked, pupil by pupil, with Key Stage and examination results which are collected separately, and from one year to the next. Technical staff engaged in this data linking will, for that purpose, need to have access to pupil names and UPNs. The linked data (without pupil names and UPNs) will then be used to carry out statistical analyses of attainment levels, and how these vary according to the various pupil attributes identified in PLASC.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/9">Pupils, or in certain circumstances their parents or guardians, will be able to see the information held about them in the central database, and to ask for correction of any inaccurate data. Details of other organisations or individuals who may, subject to certain conditions, have access to data with pupil names were provided in my answer on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-28">28 January 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-01-28.109W"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 109&ndash;11W</phrase> to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase>. Pupils and parents will not be able to control such access except in the case of the Connexions Service, where access will not be allowed if the pupil or their parent (depending on the pupil's age) has instructed that they do not wish it to happen, and in certain circumstances in the case of access by research organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/10"><i>Connexions</i> The Department is in discussion with the Office of the Information Commissioner about the collection of information for Connexions.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/11">There is as yet no national Connexions database containing information about individual young people. Connexions is delivered through local Connexions partnerships, of which 15 are operating at present. Each of these is responsible for the information it holds about young people in its area, and provides information to the Connexions Service National Unit in aggregate form only. We are examining what national approaches will be appropriate to support the work of local Connexions partnerships. Feasibility testing is at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.3/12">Young people have the right to see all information held about them by Connexions, and are able to request correction of any inaccurate data. They are not able to control access to Connexions partnerships' databases, but partnerships must ensure that all processing of information about young people complies with data protection principles.</p>

	<p pid=".342W.15/3">The main business of this council was a debate in preparation for the forthcoming European Council in Barcelona. The Spanish Presidency issued its own conclusions. The UK supported the key themes of improved co-ordination of economic and employment policy and the importance of aligning the new European employment strategy with the Lisbon goal of full employment. Member states recognised the need to integrate disadvantaged groups, particularly older workers, into the labour market to achieve this goal and acknowledged the vital role played by life long learning in achieving the Lisbon targets.</p>
	<p pid=".342W.15/4">Council also held an open debate on violence against women which formed the basis of Presidency conclusions for Barcelona. There was consensus on the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to this issue with broad agreement on the use of good practice guides and annual awareness raising campaigns at a European level. The forthcoming Danish Presidency will take forward this work in the context of the council's annual follow-up of the member states' implementation of their commitments under the Beijing Platform for Action, including discussions on the necessity for, and potential scope of, indicators in this field.</p>
	<p pid=".342W.15/5">The Presidency sought an outline position on the proposal for a directive updating the existing directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to asbestos, pending the adoption by the European Parliament of its First Reading opinion.

	<p pid=".342W.15/6">The Council also heard a progress report on negotiations for the draft directive supplementing the proposed regulation for a Statute on a European Co-operative Society in respect of employee involvement. Work will continue on this dossier in COREPER.</p>

	<p pid=".344W.6/1">All vehicles converted to run on LPG must comply with the requirements of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. Conversions which result in significantly reduced emissions are eligible for Government grants under the Powershift programme, which is administered by the Energy Saving Trust. To be eligible for a grant, conversions must be done by Powershift approved converters, whose competence is tested by the trust. The DTI has recently announced a new &pound;1 million programme, called &quot;LPG Boost&quot;, to further enhance the uptake of LPG, including grants to help additional conversion specialists undertake the technical training and meet the competencies for becoming Powershift approved converters, and so increase the network of approved converters.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.6/2">The additional cost of converting a vehicle to run on LPG is typically between &pound;1,500 and &pound;2,000.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.6/3">DVLA statistics record 26,694 vehicles as running on gaseous fuels. DVLA statistics do not distinguish between liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas vehicles, but most of the vehicles are LPG-fuelled cars&mdash;natural gas is used mainly in heavy goods vehicles, and the numbers are smaller. The DVLA figure is also an underestimate, since not all motorists notify DVLA of their vehicle's conversion. There are currently estimated to be around 65,000 LPG vehicles in the UK. Motorists are converting to LPG at an increasing rate, with the number expected to increase by about 35,000 for 2002 and 50,000 in 2003, prompted by the Government grants available, and the fact that low-cost LPG fuel is now available in all areas of the country.</p>

The branch became aware that the second fishing vessel was missing on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-15">15 February</phrase> and, using an inspector who happened to be in Northern Ireland at the time progressing the first investigation, initiated inquiries the same day.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.11/2">Both investigations are on-going. The MAIB aims to publish accident reports within nine months of the event. There is every expectation this will be achieved in the first accident but may well be longer in the second as there has been no sign of the missing vessel since she sailed. Without any direct evidence to explain what occurred, the investigation is likely to take longer.</p>

When the decision has been taken to carry one out, inspectors will take whatever action they consider most suitable in the circumstances.

	<p pid=".352W.0/1">Those airports subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority notify CAA of the different airport charges levied at their airport. Landing charges are one of these. However, they vary for different categories of aircraft (eg by aircraft noise); by aircraft weight categories and sometimes by time of day. They may also include airport navigation charges. The resources required to process and collate the information on landing charges data for all airport operators, and in a form which would allow useful comparisons between airports, would be disproportionate and not show the level of the total airport charge.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.3/1">There are three categories of airport in respect of airport charges.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.3/2">Airports with more than one million passengers each year are subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and require their permission to levy charges. Below this threshold, airports are able to levy airport charges without permission. For the 'designated' airports of BAA's London airports and for Manchester airport, this permission is also subject to conditions regarding the maximum amounts that may be levied.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.3/3">For the non-designated economically regulated airports with permission to levy charges, CAA are notified of the airport charges to be levied by the airport operator but they do not play a part in determining these.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.3/4">For the designated airports of BAA's London airports and of Manchester airport, the conditions imposed by CAA are the result of an extensive process every five years to set the maximum annual airport charge for the following five years. In doing this, CAA take account of their statutory objectives listed in Section 39 of the 1986 Airports Act. This price cap has been expressed in terms of the average revenue from airport charges per passenger (revenue yield). Provided the annual airport charges set each year by the airport operator would not be expected to result in the price cap being exceeded, CAA are not involved in their determination.</p>

	<p pid=".353W.2/1">Today we are announcing the outcome of the first stage of the current review of English Partnerships (EP), together with appointment of the new chair of the organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.2/2">The new chair of English Partnerships is to be Margaret Ford. She has extensive experience in economic development and of working with Government organisations within the UK and internationally. She has particular experience of leading organisations though periods of considerable change. We are confident that Margaret Ford is the right person to lead EP into its new role.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.2/3">EP will become the Secretary of State's expert adviser on brownfield regeneration, managing a national portfolio of strategic sites, and managing demonstration projects. EP will work with national, regional and local partners, especially the RDAs, and the private sector, to identify strategic brownfield land, prioritise and facilitate its development. There is a continuing remit for EP as a national public sector body and as a vital component of the Government's programme for achieving an Urban Renaissance.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.2/4">To sharpen the organisation's focus on brownfield regeneration, we intend EP progressively to transfer their non-strategic Commission for the New Towns (CNT) landholdings to other appropriate bodies, for example the local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.2/5">In the spirit of the two Green Papers we published last year setting out fundamental changes to local government and the planning system, EP will relinquish the use of their planning powers in the former new town areas, bringing control over the development of these areas under the democratic control of their local councils. This will be a staged process.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.2/6">As part of stage two of review, we want to resolve the problems that have arisen in the past from the dual statutory function of the former Urban Regeneration Agency and the Commission for the New Towns. This will give EP a common purpose and help them in taking forward their changed agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.2/7">I am today placing in the Library of the House the report on stage one of the review, including the KPMG consultation report and key areas to be addressed in stage two. There is still important work to be done and we will continue to listen to and work with the widest range of interested organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".354W.2/1">The development of brownfield sites is a key priority for my Department. It underpins our policy for the revival of our towns and cities and for achieving more sustainable patterns of development.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/2">We are radically overhauling the planning system so it helps promote economic prosperity by delivering land for development in the right place at the right time. Our planning policy guidance for housing (PPG3) sets out an &quot;urban brownfields first policy&quot; as we want to conserve greenfield land.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/3">Planning Policy is directing private sector development towards brownfield land, and measures are in place within the development control and local plan system to ensure this. For instance, local authorities must reassess greenfield sites that have been previously identified in their local plans for development, and they must thoroughly re-appraise applications for the renewal of planning permission on such sites. Regional and local planning strategies are expected to focus new housing development where brownfield sites are available. The Department is also promoting a greater use of Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) to assemble brownfield sites that are in multiple ownership.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/4">The public sector also has a direct role to play, and in this respect the Department has a Public Service Agreement target under which it aims to:</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;. . Ensure that brownfield land will be reclaimed at a rate of over 1,100 hectares per annum by 2004 (reclaiming 5 per cent. of current brownfield land by 2004 and 17 per cent. by 2010)&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/6">The reclamation of over 1,100 hectares is specifically for the Regional Development Agencies and English Partnerships to achieve. With a forecast output of 1,200 ha for this year, they are on course to exceed it.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/7">Within the Corporate Planning process, an annual target for brownfield land reclamation is being agreed with each RDA. DTLR officials will be monitoring and encouraging progress.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/8">There are many examples of RDA involvement in the successful redevelopment of brownfield sites. For instance, the South East RDA is continuing the earlier work of English Partnerships in redeveloping the former Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham Maritime in Kent, with a sustainable mixed development at this 140 ha site. The North West Development Agency is to develop a high quality business park in North Manchester, thereby bringing 25 ha of brownfield land back into use. Dursley and Gloucester Docks are sustainable mixed-use developments being undertaken by the South West of England RDA.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/9">The Government are aware that the withdrawal of the Partnership Investment Programme, and its replacement with schemes of a more limited application, has restricted RDAs and EP in their ability to use the private sector in delivering brownfield land regeneration. To improve the flexibility of Government agencies in this regard, the Government:</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/10" class="indent">Have made significant extra resources available to RDAs to take sites into public ownership and develop them directly</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/11" class="indent">Have recently notified to the European Commission a new scheme for involving the private sector in housing schemes</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/12" class="indent">Is engaged in discussions with the Commission and other member states about brownfield regeneration within the context to State Aid rules.</p>

	<p pid=".355W.5/1">The intensity of subsidence reported in the press is very minor and is unlikely to cause damage. It is several orders of magnitude less than that experienced in the coalfields and damage is much more likely to occur from shrinking and swelling of clay subsoils in London than from subsidence at the level reported.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.5/2">Subsidence from tunnelling operations is well known and it is taken into account in the design of tunnelling operations. Where necessary, such operations include mitigation measures to reduce the effects of subsidence to below the level likely to cause damage.

International research has established that the increased risk of an accident arises from the distracting effects of holding a telephone conversation rather than from just driving with one hand on the wheel. Further research, commissioned within the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme towards the end of last year, is under way to measure the distraction from hands-free phones in comparison to other common driver distractions such as talking with passengers or tuning the radio.</p>

	<p pid=".360W.3/1">There are no plans to make a change in the foreseeable future. The limit will stay at 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The Government consulted on this in 1998 and waited upon proposals from Europe before considering the matter further. No firm legislation was forthcoming from the European Union although the European Commission produced a Recommendation which, among other measures, recommended community wide harmonisation of the legal blood alcohol content (BAC) limit for motorists at 50mg. We have now considered whether it would be desirable to make such a change and concluded that we should maintain emphasis on enforcement and publicity. In reaching this decision the Government were mindful of the fact that our penalties are among the toughest in Europe. But we remain committed to combating drink-driving and support more research and collaboration at a European level.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.2/2">My Department provides an annual grant in aid to both the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering from the science budget, mainly for fellowships and international exchanges. This funding is reviewed, together with the other components of the science budget, at each Government Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/3">My officials also meet the Executive Secretaries and other members of staff of each body approximately quarterly to review progress in respect of grant in aid funded programmes, and to discuss other matters of common interest.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/4">Broadly comparable arrangements cover funding to other learned societies from the Research Councils. However, the sums involved are small, and do not come directly through the science budget. Examples of these would include the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of Chemistry, which receive funds from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for workshops, summer schools, and conferences.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/5">My Department is also considering a programme of support for funding projects to be undertaken by the Engineering and Technology Board.</p>

	<p pid=".367W.2/1">Belize was considered for CDI under the three basic CDI criteria&mdash;commitment to pro-poor policies, promotion of responsive and accountable government; and application of macro-economic policies to encourage sustainable development. Although some progress had been made in implementing commitments in relation to the first two criteria, on the third criterion my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development shared the concerns set out in the IMF Article IV report from April 2001, particularly in terms of significant increases in external commercial debt levels and the widening public sector deficit. Against this background she concluded that Belize had not fulfilled the CDI criteria. There is provision for a further review later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.6/2">Since April last year initiatives on illegal imports have been co-ordinated by officials in DEFRA, working closely with other Departments such as HM Customs and Excise and Food Standards Agency, as well as the local authorities and port health authorities who are responsible for controls at ports and airports. This joint approach had led to more effective information sharing and improved targeting of activity at ports and airports.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.6/3">DEFRA is also holding a high level forum on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-21">21 March 2002</phrase> involving all stakeholders, to consider the next steps for intensifying our efforts and to agree further priorities and action.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.6/4">Responsibility for checks on imports of meat and meat products (which might be coming from countries with FMD) are the responsibility of the local or port health authority and it is for the appropriate local authority to deploy staff according to the volume and nature of products imported.</p>

The UK strongly supported the timely adoption of UNSCR 1373 (2001) as a vital measure in the global campaign against terrorism. The regulation will assist in ensuring full compliance within the EU with the provisions of UNSCR 1373(2001). The Government consider the immediate freezing of assets to prevent their dissipation an essential tool in the fight against terrorism. The regulation does not limit the UK's ability to take autonomous measures against other individuals that we deem to be linked to terrorism.</p>

At tier one (covering for example standards and subtitling but with impartiality requirements excepted) and tier two (measurable quotas, news in peak time) the BBC will be regulated by OFCOM alongside other public service broadcasters. At tier three, the Governors will continue to regulate the delivery of the BBC's remit, while the commercial public service broadcasters will be given greater freedom in the delivery of their remits.</p>

Recent major budget productions attracted to these shores such as &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;, &quot;Chocolat&quot;, &quot;Killing me Softly&quot; and &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; have contributed to the overall inward investment figure of approximately &pound;539 million in 2000. The Film Council's Premiere Fund has a budget of &pound;30 million of Lottery money over three years for the production of theatrical feature films that have the potential to attract significant audiences at home and abroad. The Film Council's most recent release, Gosford Park, has already won a Golden Globe and has been nominated for seven &quot;Oscars&quot;. The UK was one of the earliest signatories of the European Co-Production Convention and has seven bilateral co-production agreements with other countries. The UK also has a massive talent base, providing a major contribution to the world's feature film industry.</p>

	<p pid=".394W.2/2">This issue was thoroughly reviewed between 1997 and 1999. Following our review, the White Paper &quot;Time for Reform: Proposals for the Modernisation of Our Licensing Laws (Cm 4696)&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-10">10 April 2000</phrase>, set out our plans for reforming the alcohol and public entertainment licensing laws, including the hours during which alcohol may be sold or supplied to the public. To counter and minimise public disorder resulting from fixed closing times, we intend to introduce flexible opening hours as a condition of the licences of each venue, with the potential for some to operate up to 24 hour opening on each day of the week, subject to consideration of the impact on local residents. We intend to introduce primary legislation to implement these proposals as soon as parliamentary time permits.</p>

Details of completed research projects are published in the annual report of the Animal Procedures Committee, which is available from The Stationery Office.</p>

However, this is not the only money spent by the Government on seeking to develop alternatives, as other Departments also fund such work. It is estimated that the total spent on this by the United Kingdom Government is in the region of &pound;2 million each year. Industry also spends many millions of pounds each year on the search for and development of alternatives. To take this further on an international level, the United Kingdom Government will continue to support the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) through contributions to the European Union.</p>

	<p pid=".397W.5/1">To meet the requirements of section 5(4) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, any application to use protected animals in research must be the subject of a detailed cost/benefit assessment by Home Office inspectors. The likely adverse effects on the animals concerned must be weighed against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the proposed programme of work. All procedures are strictly regulated and all applications for licenses to use animals are assessed to ensure that the work is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/2">For that purpose the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, who offer professional advice and recommendations on licence applications made under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, use a range of resources to keep abreast of developments and results in animal research, and the scientific community have established and maintained their own databases to the same end.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/3">A mandatory central database would be problematic for a number of reasons. There would, in particular, be significant difficulties in ensuring the completeness and quality of the data and in ensuring that intellectual or commercial confidentiality were not compromised. We do, however, believe that there is scope for further reducing the risk of duplication of animal testing by encouraging companies to engage in data sharing. To this end, in August 2000, we announced an inter-Departmental concordat on data sharing to enable Government Departments to reduce the duplication of tests on animals. The concordat commits United Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles and encourage data sharing between clients and thereby reduce animal tests. Progress in implementing the concordat will be reviewed in the next few months.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/4">In addition, there are a number of international and national initiatives to encourage data sharing. International assessment programmes have well-established and effective methods for data sharing, ensuring mutual acceptance of data and dissemination of information on chemicals. This also extends to dissemination of data to developing countries.</p>

	<p pid=".399W.11/1">We need to ensure that we can perform the basic duty to protect the public by punishing people for the crimes they have committed while ensuring we engage in rehabilitation to reduce re-offending and prevent crime. To this end we are committed to a radical re-think of the sentencing framework so as to give clarity and direction to the courts and avoid the damaging effects of prison overcrowding. Prison must be used as effectively as possible and targeted where it is most necessary. It should be used for incapacitating dangerous, violent and other serious offenders but prison sentences should be as long as necessary for punishment and public protection, and no longer.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.11/2">The reform of the probation service, with its central focus on reducing re-offending means that rigorously enforced community sentences are a real and tough alternative to imprisonment. We want to build on this work to provide sentencers with more than two stark options, imprisonment or a community sentence. We are looking at intermediate disposals such as intermittent custody and a strengthened suspended sentence. On community sentences the courts need to be able to mix and match with a generic sentence so that we can get it right for the individual. As part of the work taking forward the recommendations of the Halliday report on the sentencing framework we are looking at new forms of community penalties that allow the sentencer this flexibility. We aim to encourage greater use of community penalties for some non-violent offenders such as those convicted of theft and handling or fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.11/3">Home Detention Curfew and a rigorous assessment process plays an important role by enabling some prisoners to be released from prison, while still subject to restrictions placed on their liberty. This facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into the community and helps offenders to secure employment as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.11/4">We are addressing the recent increase in female prison population by taking forward the Government's strategy for female prisoners. A cross-Government women's offenders reduction plan is currently being developed by a multi-agency team drawn from across the criminal justice system, which is based in the Home Office. The aim of the programme is to strengthen policy, programme, research and spending partnerships across government to reduce women's offending. This includes linking criminal justice work with broader Government efforts to tackle social exclusion, particularly as it affects women at risk of offending.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.2/2">Our policy on the detention of asylum seekers in prison remains as set out in our White Paper &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven&mdash;Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain&quot;. We made it clear that, although the routine use of prison accommodation for immigration detainees had ended, there would remain a need to hold small numbers of individuals, including asylum seekers, in prison for reasons of security. This would, for example, include individuals transferred to prison accommodation following the incident at Yarl's Wood removal centre on 14&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-02-15">15 February 2002</phrase>. Such individuals would be identified on the basis of the security risk they are assessed to pose rather than on the progress of any asylum or other claim they may have made. As such, individuals who are assessed to pose a security risk and who have yet to receive a decision on their asylum application may be held in prison accommodation.</p>

Section 91 sets out the Crown Court's powers to order a youth to be detained for certain serious offences for a period not exceeding the maximum term of imprisonment with which the offence is punishable in the case of an adult aged 21 or over.

	<p pid=".417W.0/1">People who have been receiving incapacity benefit for more than 28 weeks normally undergo a personal capability assessment (PCA). The purpose of the PCA is to determine that a person meets the threshold of incapacity to continue receiving benefit. In addition, in selected pilot areas, examining doctors are able to produce a capability report for the person's personal adviser. The capability report helps those who wish to return to work by shifting the emphasis from disability to ability.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.0/2">As part of the PCA process, a person may be called, where appropriate, to attend a medical examination. The importance of keeping an appointment along with the potential consequences of not attending are clearly highlighted in the supporting documentation sent to the person.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.0/3">When a person fails to attend an appointment he or she is asked to provide written details of their reasons for non-attendance. The reasons, along with any other relevant information, are presented to a decision maker for consideration of whether there was good cause for not attending the appointment. The good cause provision acts as a safeguard for vulnerable people and those with genuine difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.0/4">A decision maker decides good cause by considering all the evidence and applying the law to the facts of the claim. Each case is considered on merit and all relevant circumstances, including the person's state of health, are taken into account. If it is decided to withdraw entitlement, then the person can ask for the decision to be reconsidered or referred to an independent appeal tribunal.</p>

	<p pid=".419W.1/2">While conciliation and arbitration can be of value, it would not be appropriate in this instance to refer the current dispute to ACAS as the Public and Commercial Services Union has proposed. The fundamental principles underpinning the delivery of Jobcentre Plus are at the heart of the welfare modernisation and customer service improvement to which the Government are committed. They are not ones about which it is appropriate to seek arbitration.</p>

	<p pid=".420W.5/2">Pension credit recipients with income above the guarantee credit who are also entitled to housing and council tax benefits will experience higher withdrawal rates than under the minimum income guarantee. However, these people will see gains from the introduction of the savings credit, the fairer treatment of capital and the extension of the applicable amounts in housing and council tax benefit due to our proposals for pension credit. This means that a single pensioner over 65 with marginal deduction rates of 91 per cent. will gain at least &pound;11 a week (couples will gain at least &pound;15.81). It also means that almost 1.9 million pensioner households will get more help, or get help for the first time, with their rent or council tax.</p>

	<p pid=".422W.3/1">There are no plans to change the amount by which benefits are reduced for hospital in-patients who have been in hospital for more than 52 weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".422W.3/2">The hospital downrating rules prevent double provision from public funds as the publicly funded NHS maintains people while they stay in hospital as well as providing free treatment. Social security maintenance benefits are also paid from state funds. They are therefore not paid in full indefinitely where a person is in a NHS hospital and having their day to day living expenses met through the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".422W.3/3">The double provision principle is a key cornerstone of the system of national insurance introduced over 50 years ago.</p>
	<p pid=".422W.3/4">However, we also recognise that people have on-going financial commitments while in hospital, and although we consider the six week rule strikes a fair balance between what the state should provide financially and the provision individuals should make for themselves, we have none the less decided to extend the period before benefits are downrated by a further seven weeks to the 13 week stage. This will mean that people previously affected by the six week rule will be able to keep their benefits untouched if their period of stay in hospital is under 13 weeks. Benefit is generally then not downrated again until after 52 weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".422W.3/5">Benefit is adjusted in this way because, generally speaking, the national health service will have assumed the responsibility of providing for patients who have spent more than 52 weeks in hospital. The personal requirements allowance is regarded as a reasonable amount to cover small personal items not already provided by the hospital.</p>

	<p pid=".425W.2/1">The 1991 judgment of the Court of Appeal in Cassinelli <i>v.</i> Secretary of State for Social Services was concerned only with the meaning of the test of &quot;severe discomfort&quot; in relation to whether the manner in which a person could make progress on foot out of doors was so limited that he could be taken to be virtually unable to walk for the purpose of entitlement to mobility allowance. The court held that the test is one of severe discomfort rather than of severe pain or distress. This is not relevant to <i>(a)</i> attendance allowance, for which entitlement depends upon a severely disabled person's need for personal attention, supervision or watching over from another person; but <i>(b)</i> it continues to be relevant to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance, which replaced mobility allowance in 1992, and the guidance to decision makers about that component in the Decision Makers Guide cites the meaning of &quot;severe discomfort&quot; given in the Cassinelli judgment as the one to be followed when considering whether a person is virtually unable to walk.</p>

	<p pid=".425W.8/1">Long-term unemployed people who need help with basic skills or the English language are identified by personal advisers during the Gateway period of the New Deal. Those with a need can then be referred to help within the Gateway, including short basic skills courses. People who need more intensive, longer- term assistance are offered help through the Education and Training New Deal option which can provide courses lasting up to 26 weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".425W.8/2">Basic skills or English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) training is provided in response to an individual's needs. The Employment Service contracts locally with New Deal providers to meet the needs of their particular client group and provides sufficient funding for this to be achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".425W.8/3">The help provided through the New Deal is an important part of the Government's strategy to improve literacy and numeracy skills. A new curriculum in ESOL was launched in February and will further improve the quality of language provision available to those who need it. We will be working to embed the new curriculum into our employment programmes.</p>

The Family Resources Survey (FRS) is a continuous survey, interviewing approximately 25,000 private households in Great Britain each year. The FRS asks a wide range of questions about people's incomes and other living circumstances, including sources of pension income.</p>

	<p pid=".428W.5/2">A radically changed minimum income guarantee (MIG) form was introduced last October after consultation with pensioners and their organisations. The new form cut the number of pages pensioners had to complete from 40 to 10 and removed questions irrelevant to the vast majority of pensioners. The Department also established a MIG helpline to enable pensioners to claim over the telephone.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.5/3">Improvements have been made to our standard size claim forms, particularly those relating to disability benefits. They include using a larger type size, increasing the size of answer boxes and using a background tint that gives the best possible contrast to improve legibility.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.5/4">We are also currently testing a new shorter and simpler attendance allowance claim form aimed at claimants aged 75 or over. If this 16 page form, which replaces the existing 34 page form, is successful in obtaining the information we need we will be looking to apply the lessons learned to other groups of disabled people applying for disability living allowance and attendance allowance.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.3/1">The report &quot;Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service 2000&quot; prepared for my Department by Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland (BioSS) shows that by applying the same methodology as in previous years the average level of sickness absence was 9.9 days per staff year. This represents a small decrease over the equivalent figure of 10.1 days set out in the report for 1999. The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the 2000 figures.</p>

Overall the civil service has been targeted to reduce sickness absence by 30 per cent. (to 7.2 days per staff year) by 2003 against the 1998 baseline.

Our programme for modernising the national health service (NHS) as set out in the NHS plan will rely on the provision of efficient and effective information systems to enable the benefits for patients and the public to be achieved. A common e-mail system is one component of this; by opting for a common system across the NHS the maximum benefits of value for money will be obtained. To this end, the NHS information authority is currently conducting a formal open procurement exercise for e-mail and directory services for the NHS. It is expected that subject to successful completion of negotiations a preferred bidder will be announced shortly.</p>

The chairman and members of the statutory board are appointed by Health Ministers, following Nolan/Neill principles, to ensure an appropriate mix of independent experts.

The Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation and the Advisory Group on Ionising Radiation review the evidence on the biological and medical effects of radiation. They also advise the board on future research priorities. A new advisory group&mdash;the Radiation, Risk and Society Advisory Group&mdash;has been set up to help NRPB to improve its communication in a practical way.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.2/2">I understand that while mesotherapy has a number of applications, it is of most relevance to the NHS as a method of pain relief. Mesotherapy is a treatment where local anaesthetic is injected in small amounts to an area of pain. Chronic pain relief is provided throughout the NHS in different forms, and includes the use of local anaesthetic. However, pain relief is a short-term measure and it is important that the underlying cause of the pain is identified and treated.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.2/3">The decision on the type of pain relief treatment provided to patients is made on a case by case basis. The Department does not collect details of the different types of pain relief available on the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.5/1">The additional funds provide the opportunity for the Medical Research Council (MRC) to accelerate research on autism, building on existing strengths and addressing gaps which were identified in the report of their review of the epidemiology and causes of autism. It will complement and add to the MRC's current support for research in this field. It is likely that the range of research supported will be broader than that of the MRC review and may include research to develop and evaluate interventions.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/2">The MRC will shortly be setting up a steering group which will offer detailed advice on implementation. Building on the success of lay involvement in the MRC review, the membership of this group will importantly include lay people. The Department will have an observer on the group. We will continue to pursue our constructive dialogue with the MRC on autism research.</p>
