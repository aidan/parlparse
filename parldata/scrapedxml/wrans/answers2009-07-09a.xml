	<p pid="a.920W.3/1">The Department for Transport regulates certain rail fares, particularly where people have little alternative to rail to make necessary journeys (such as season tickets used by commuters). Regulated fares account for in excess of 60 per cent. of all rail journeys made.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.3/2">Train operators are free to apply commercial pricing to unregulated fares, which means charging higher fares at peak times when trains are full but lower fares to price-sensitive passengers in the off-peak to attract additional passengers. This helps achieve value for money in terms of both passengers carried and subsidy required.</p>

	<p pid="a.924W.8/3">The use of acoustic deterrent devices as specified under Council Regulation 812/2004 has been problematic for the UK and for other member states. UK fishing vessels have identified pinger deployment and safety issues during fishing operations. We reported our concerns to the European Commission and we have been given scientific dispensation to start a research programme to develop appropriate and effective pingers that are safe for our fishers to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.8/4">The UK's research into acoustic deterrent devices is being carried out on behalf of DEFRA by the sea mammal research unit (SMRU). SMRU, in collaboration with SeaFish and the industry are currently testing a dolphin dissuasive device (DDD) and they are looking at the effects these devices may have on the population distribution of harbour porpoises. Initial results on the efficacy of these pingers are promising.</p>

	<p pid="a.928W.9/1">The information is not available in the format requested as the court databases do not contain background information in relation to offences committed; for instance, it is not possible to specify the number of convictions where an illegal firearm was used in relation to murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.928W.9/2">It is possible, however, to provide conviction statistics for firearm-related offences as specified by firearms legislation, including those that relate to the possession, hiring, distribution or supply of firearms.

	<p pid="a.930W.6/2">In October 2008 the set of codes used to record the disabling condition for disability living allowance changed. Primary and Secondary codes replaced codes for Care and Mobility and more fine detail was introduced with respect to disabling condition. Prior to October 2008, there were fewer than 50 categories for disabling condition, but now there are over 500. This information is available for statistical analysis from November 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.6/1">My Department works closely with the tourism industry to ensure that there is good access for disabled people at attractions throughout the United Kingdom. As part of the quality assessment scheme, tourism business in the UK are required to prepare an access statement describing their current services and facilities so that disabled people can decide if they meet their particular needs. Accessibility best practice is now incorporated into the new Visitor Attraction Quality Assurance Scheme (VAQAS) criteria and its quality guidance booklet.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.6/2">In addition the DCMS has set up the Accessible Tourism Stakeholders Forum to help to deliver improvements in this area which was a central theme in our Tourism Strategy for 2012. VisitEngland has recently published &quot;Easy Does It&quot;, a guide for setting out how tourism businesses can achieve simple, low cost changes to benefit themselves and their disabled customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.6/3">Most recently DCMS, along with VisitEngland, VisitScotland, VisitWales, and other public bodies, has supported the launch of Open Britain, a definitive guide book and website for people with disabilities and special access requirements.</p>

She explained that the Government could not at that point fully address the issues surrounding section 6 of the Human Rights Act until the implications of the judgment in YL <i> v.</i> Birmingham city council were known. The Government have since legislated to overturn the principal effects of that judgment through section 145 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008, and are also committed to consulting further on the scope of the Human Rights Act. We believe those of the issues raised in the Joint Committee's report that remain relevant following these developments can best be addressed in that context.</p>

	<p pid="a.936W.5/2">The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 imposes requirements on political parties to keep accounting records showing sums of money received and expended by the party, and to publish annual statements of accounts. As to form and content, the 2000 Act indicates that these statements of accounts should comply with requirements which may be prescribed by regulations made by the Electoral Commission. Since 2008, the commission has been working with political parties to agree standard requirements for statements of accounts. The commission has stated that it will continue to discuss the issue with the parties, with the aim of achieving improved transparency while imposing the minimum necessary burden on parties and their staff, many of whom are volunteers.</p>

	<p pid="a.939W.3/1">The feasibility of deep maintenance upkeep work, such as refits and docking periods, being carried out to the Invincible Class aircraft carriers at HM Naval Base Clyde was considered as part of the Naval Base Review. It was assessed that as the berths at Faslane were designed to accommodate submarines further work would be required to make them suitable to accommodate the heavier aircraft carriers. In addition, there are insufficient waterfront facilities, such as for equipment storage and ship's company living accommodation, available to allow deep maintenance work to be carried out there. However, other maintenance work such as that carried out onboard the ship by its company and which does not require the vessel to be berthed for a significant period of time, can be carried out at the naval base.</p>

	<p pid="a.945W.2/1">I was delighted to award Kent county council (KCC) a Beacon Award for its work on Olympic and Paralympic legacy earlier this year. This award recognised the council's clear vision and determined approach to games legacy and its programme of bespoke 2012 projects across the county, and Ashford is part of the supporting county partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/2">The Kent Co-ordinating Group for the 2012 games, on which Ashford borough council is represented, plays a key role in this partnership and aims to derive the maximum benefits from the games for the county. It has set up nine task groups to co-ordinate action across Kent on: arts; communications and media; economic development and regeneration; schools and young people; sport; tourism; transport; and volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/3">Kent has already made good progress with its Olympic and Paralympic legacy in these areas through initiatives such as the Kent School Games which in 2008 had 30,000 participants from over 500 schools including those in Ashford. In terms of Paralympic legacy, KCC has increased its disability sport associate officers network to cover 15 of the 19 summer Paralympics sports and two of the four winter sports. Kent also has the highest sign up in the South East (SE) of England for the Get Set School Programme and businesses registered for Competefor, the London 2012 brokerage system. Steps have also been taken to raise awareness of the importance of tourism, leisure and hospitality businesses to the Kent economy in the lead up to the games through initiatives such as the third successful 'Kent's Big Day Out' event to be held each year in the run up to the games. This year's event held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-28">28 March 2009</phrase> saw over 17,000 vouchers offered to participants for free entry to 143 venues across the county including in Ashford.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/4">It is also pleasing to see that there are a broad range of initiatives and programmes across the SE associated with building a legacy from the games. The SE currently has nine projects that have been awarded the Inspire Mark of which four are in Kent. There were around 70 events held in the SE during Open Weekend which launched the Cultural Olympiad in September 2008, of which, around 10 were in Kent. To celebrate London officially becoming host to the 2012 games handover events were held in the SE on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-24">24 August 2008</phrase>. Ashford played a significant role in these celebrations hosting a Free Swim day to mark the raising of the Olympic Handover Flag.</p>

	<p pid="a.956W.12/1">We believe that the changes proposed in my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing's statement will require primary legislation. This is because the provisions relating to the housing revenue account (&quot;HRA&quot;) and HRA subsidy contained in part VI of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 will not be wide enough to provide for the proposals set out in the statement. Section 80B of the Housing Act 1985, inserted by section 313 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, enables the Secretary of State and a local authority to agree that specified houses owned by the authority will not be subject to the HRA subsidy provisions. However, the provision only allows for individually negotiated terms agreed individually by the authority. This cannot provide for the changes proposed in the ministerial statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.12/2">We cannot be certain of what will be required until the outcome of the consultation exercise is known.</p>

Therefore some tax repayment claims are subject to security checks, which may delay repayments from being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.967W.5/2">Some self assessment customers have unfortunately experienced such delays this year caused by a combination of a very much sharper peak of repayments in January and February, arising from the move to greater online filing, and more repayments being selected for our security checking.</p>

	<p pid="a.976W.6/1">Grant eligibility conditions and compliance measures are set out in local authority social services letters (LASSLs) and local authority circulars (LACs), as published by the Department. These official circulars notify local authorities of their specific revenue and capital grant funding and the Department's contributions to the area based grant (ABG) in support of social care policies (including children's personal social services funding insofar as this is provided by the children and adolescent mental health services contribution).</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/2">From April 2008, the majority of revenue grants will be delivered to local authorities through the Department's contribution to the ABG. The ABG is paid on an unringfenced basis and as such local authorities are able to determine locally how best to spend these grants in order to deliver local and national priorities. As an unringfenced grant, there are no restrictions on carry forward between financial years. This represents a considerable increase in the flexibility open to local government to take local spending decisions in line with the new performance framework. The ABG is administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) and paid to local authorities on a monthly basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/3">For the small number of ring-fenced grants, these are allocated via a bidding process. Therefore, there are 'eligibility' criteria and compliance measures attached to the use of these monies in order to meet the specific social care policy.</p>

This includes both our national level programming and our support to the state governments of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. DFID ensures that the programmes we support are designed to particularly help the poorest and most excluded groups, such as scheduled castes and tribes.

	<p pid="a.987W.5/1">The Government have announced a number of measures that should increase demand for steel in the UK. In the pre-Budget report my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that a fiscal stimulus, including &pound;3 billion of capital expenditure would be brought forward from 2010-11 to 2008-09 and 2009-10, to support the economy. Projects include increasing capacity in the motorway and rail network, improving and building new social housing, renewing primary and secondary schools, and investing in energy efficiency measures. In his Budget statement the Chancellor also announced private sector investment worth over &pound;4 billion pa for 2009/10 and 2010/11 in energy (nearly 50 per cent. higher than five years ago).</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.5/2">In addition, much of what the Government are doing to support business through the downturn is aimed at the many enterprises that are customers of companies in the steel industry. This includes the vehicle scrappage scheme, which for a temporary period will give people a discount of &pound;2,000 for trading in vehicles older than 10 years when buying a new vehicle. This comes on top of measures in our Real Help for Business programme, launched in January which included a &pound;1.3 billion Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.990W.13/1">The Department does not stipulate energy efficiency standards for circulator pumps within the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. Our approach is to set targets for carbon emissions by a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.13/2">We have developed guidance to help the designers of newly built schools achieve their target level of carbon reduction. This guidance encourages the use of energy efficient equipment without being prescriptive about design solutions.

	<p pid="a.991W.2/1">Following the commitments made in the Children's Plan in 2007 and the National Play Strategy in 2008, every top tier local authority in England will receive either play pathfinder or playbuilder funding between 2008 to 2011 through the play capital investment programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/2">On average all play pathfinder authorities will receive around &pound;2 million capital funding and &pound;500,000 revenue funding, while playbuilder authorities will receive around &pound;1 million capital and &pound;45,000 revenue funding. Play pathfinder authorities will use their allocated funding to deliver a minimum of 28 play areas plus a new staffed adventure playground, while playbuilder authorities will deliver a minimum of 22 play areas by 2011. The play areas that are delivered can be either completely new areas or existing areas which are significantly refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/3">Local authorities have joined the programme, and so started receiving their funding, in two phases: Wave 1 started in April 2008 and wave 2 in April 2009. Knowsley and Sefton are both wave 1 authorities, while the other three authorities in Merseyside (Liverpool, St. Helens and Wirral) joined the programme in April 2009. Knowsley is a play pathfinder authority and the other four are all playbuilder authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/4">The following tables show the capital and revenue funding allocated to Merseyside authorities and the phase they joined the capital play programme. Allocations for 2010-11 are indicative and will be confirmed in January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/5">Decisions on where the capital funding is spent within local authority boundaries are taken locally, based on grant requirements around improved play spaces being provided where they are most needed and based on a robust consultation process with local children and young people, families and wider communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/6">We are encouraging all Members of Parliament to proactively engage with their local play capital programmes as they roll out, and we are asking local authorities to ensure that their local Members of Parliament and council elected members are appropriately consulted, and briefed, about where the capital funding is spent.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-06">6 July 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/4" class="indent">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-02">2 July 2009</phrase>, Ofsted employs 443 Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI), including 82 that have a management role. Of the total, 245 (55%) inspect schools. The remainder inspect further education, work-based learning, social care and other sectors. All of the 245 who inspect schools have teaching experience in one or more education sectors as this is a key criterion for selection to the role.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/5" class="indent">I am unable to provide the information you seek about which inspectors were formerly headteachers, as we do not record electronically the career profiles of individuals. This information could only be obtained at disproportionate cost through a review of each individual's personnel file or by a request to each individual to provide the information.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/6" class="indent">There are also 1948 additional inspectors provided through our regional inspection service providers (RISPs), of whom 1567 (80%) undertake school inspections. I can confirm that almost all of these additional inspectors have teaching experience, as this is one of the key criteria for selection to the role. However, there is a very small number who were former lay inspectors under the framework for inspection that was known as section 10, superseded by the current framework in September 2005. In the former framework, each inspection team included a lay inspector who was fully trained as an inspector, but had no previous experience in teaching or school management. Their purpose was to bring a lay person's view to the inspection process. A few of the most experienced of them have been employed by RISPs as additional inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/7" class="indent">I am unable to provide you with the number of these inspectors as this information is contained in the personnel records held by the RISPs. It can only be obtained at disproportionate cost through a manual search of personnel files.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/8" class="indent">With regard to the proportion of additional inspectors who have been headteachers, Ofsted does not have access to this information as we are not involved in the recruitment process. This work is undertaken by the RISPs.</p>

Please be aware that the framework for inspecting maintained schools changed in January 2000 and September 2005. As a result, there has been no consistent 'inadequate' category over time.

This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br/> 2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DFES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. Each table represents a change in source. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and from the RO1 form previously.<br/> 3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &pound;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &pound;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br/> 4. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DFES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> 5. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place during the mid to late 1990's and those LAs that did not exist either pre or post LGR are shaded out for those years.<br/> 6. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br/> 7. The 1999-2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Consequently LAs where there entire pupil provision were educated in GM schools will show a unit cost of zero prior to 1999-2000.<br/> 8. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br/> 9. School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br/> 10. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10. Cash terms figures as reported by local authorities as at 30 June 2009.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1001W.8/1">Schools are under legal duties to promote both race equality and community cohesion. Ofsted inspections include checks on whether schools are promoting community cohesion and providing an environment where all pupils feel safe and are able to learn and achieve. This makes it compulsory for schools to have measures in place to prevent and tackle all forms of discrimination and bullying however, it is motivated and to foster good relations between different groups of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.8/2">In March 2006 we published specialist guidance on bullying around race, religion and culture which focused on preventing and tackling racist and religious bullying in schools and included specific material on bullying related to anti-Semitism. We are funding the Anti-Bullying Alliance and the National Strategies to ensure the guidance is effectively embedded in local authorities and schools. We have also published guidance on promoting community cohesion to schools in July 2007 and an online resource pack in May 2008 to help schools with building understanding and appreciation of others from different backgrounds among their pupils, as well as developing a shared vision and promoting good relations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002W.2/1">Section 52 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires local authorities to prepare a statement containing information relating to their planned expenditure as prescribed before the beginning of each financial year and at the end of each financial year a statement of the expenditure actually incurred in the year in a prescribed form. The prescribed forms are currently set out in the Education (Budget Statements) (England) Regulations 2008 (as amended) and the Education (Outturn Statements) (England) Regulations 2009. The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill currently before Parliament includes provision's to replace Section 52. In addition, the Consistent Financial Reporting (England) Regulations 2003 (as amended) require maintained schools to prepare a financial statement in accordance with approved headings and in compliance with the normal established accounting practices of the local education authority. Copies of these returns are sent to the Department. The financial data are validated and published.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.2/2">The local authority information is published on the section 52 website:</p>

	<p pid="a.1002W.2/4">The Consistent Financial Reporting data underpin the Schools Financial Benchmarking website. This site provides users with the tools to compare their school's income and expenditure profile with that of similar schools so that they can make informed decisions on how to manage their resources effectively. They can tailor their spending and re-allocate resources to ensure that education spending reflects local educational policy and priorities and is effective in delivering them. Benchmarking is not used solely to focus on reducing costs, but to also improve the quality and impact of a school's services. Benchmarking is a requirement for meeting the Financial Management Standard in Schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.1003W.2/1">In 2006-07 there was a bidding round under the Targeted Capital Fund (TCF) against published criteria, aimed at raising standards through addressing building need. This resulted in allocations of some &pound;311 million (with payments phased over the life of each project).</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/2">As part of the CSR07 process it was decided that much of the available resources available for new TCF projects would be allocated to those authorities who were not yet in the Building Schools for the Future programme. This meant that 76 authorities were allocated &pound;8 million each to invest in their schools to address building needs concerned with the 14-19 agenda and/or special educational needs and disabilities, totalling &pound;608 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/3">This was originally phased to be paid as &pound;152 million in 2009-10 and &pound;456 million in 2010-11, although the subsequent fiscal stimulus initiative has now changed this phasing to &pound;303 million in 2009-10 and &pound;305 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/4">The other main TCF categories announced through the CSR process were the application based Standards and Diversity programme, through which &pound;131 million has been allocated in 2008-09 (with payments phased over the spending period), and kitchens and dining facilities, through which &pound;150 million has been allocated over the spending period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1004W.0/1">The Standards and Diversity Targeted Capital Fund supports our aims to improve choice and diversity of school provision as part of our drive to raise standards across all schools. It provides an incentive for local authorities and schools to work together to develop capital investment plans at those schools where the investment coming through the Department's strategic investment programmes&mdash;Building Schools for the Future and the Primary Capital Programme&mdash;will not provide the necessary resources required in a timely fashion to help raise standards for pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/2">The purposes of projects supported through the fund include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/3" class="indent">developing provision at maintained boarding schools, non-maintained special schools and Music and Dance Scheme schools;</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/4" class="indent">removing significant numbers of surplus places;</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/5" class="indent">helping to raise standards through increasing parental choice and diversity of provision in an area through the expansion of successful and popular maintained schools;</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/6" class="indent">encouraging new entrants to the maintained sector (including proposers of new Trust schools and voluntary aided schools and independent schools seeking to enter the sector) and</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/7" class="indent">supporting federations of schools and groups of schools working together under a single trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/8">In order to maximise the impact of the capital investment, it is important to allocate funding to projects as early as possible in the spending period. To date, 66 projects totalling &pound;131 million have been approved in this spending period. We continue to review the operation of all our capital programmes and any lessons learned through this process will, of course, be reflected in the design of future programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/9">Of the 66 projects approved to date through the Standards and Diversity Targeted Capital Fund, 18 projects involving 24 faith-based schools have had funding allocated. The other main strands of the Targeted Capital Fund are allocated at local authority level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/10">This applies notably to allocations for:</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/11" class="indent">supporting the reform of education for 14 to 19-year-olds</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/12" class="indent">enhancing facilities for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities,</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/13" class="indent">strengthening cookery in the curriculum,</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/14" class="indent">enhancing kitchens and dining facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.0/15">With all of these, it is the responsibility of the local authority to decide priorities for investment of these funds, including at voluntary-aided or other faith based schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.1004W.3/3">The Education Procurement Centre is working with schools to carry out procurement health checks which help to identify where savings can be made. The e-procurement tool OPEN has been developed to help schools buy products online and compare prices of a range of suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.3/4">The report supports our position on surplus school balances. It is sound financial management for schools to retain a small surplus from year to year, but revenue funding is primarily for teacher and support staff pay and to support the education of children in school. It should not be needed for capital improvement projects given that separate capital funding is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.3/5">Schools and authorities must work to reduce high balances over the next two years. If total revenue balances and the excessive balances held by individual schools do not reduce substantially by 2010-11, the Government will consult on further action from 2011-12 to bring the total down.</p>

An independent evaluation report of FMSiS, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-21">21 August 2008</phrase>, recognised that the standard is helping to provide a consistent approach on resource management across all schools.

This site provides users with the tools to compare their school's income and expenditure profile with that of similar schools so that they can make informed decisions on how to manage their resources effectively. They can tailor their spending and re-allocate resources to ensure that education spending reflects local educational policy and priorities and is effective in delivering them. Benchmarking is not used solely to focus on reducing costs, but to also improve the quality and impact of a school's services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1006W.6/1">In answer to this question; where a joint approach to procurement (or collaboration) is adopted, the benefits typically seen are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.6/2" class="indent">Improved value for money;</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.6/3" class="indent">More reliable quality of supply; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.6/4" class="indent">Better quality of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.6/5">These benefits are achieved by aggregating the demand for goods and services across a number schools and offering that increased volume to a larger pool of suppliers via structured competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.6/6">The use of procurement collaboration to achieve improved value for money, quality and reliability of supply is a key Government initiative. This is demonstrated by the importance placed on the Office of Government Commerce's (OGC's) collaborative agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.6/7">Where this approach is adopted to a category of spend, for example support staff or facilities, an assessment of the specific merits to be achieved should be undertaken prior to undertaking the work (i.e. a business case is developed) and the subsequent measurement of the merits/benefits which should be recorded and reported as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.6/8">The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) currently encourages schools to make use of contracts and frameworks that have been competed in the market place across a range of products and services. Where arrangements for specific categories of spend have not been addressed by DCSF, a school will be directed to an appropriate collaborative contract or framework which may be owned by the local authority, OGC or some other public body.</p>

	<p pid="a.1012W.2/1">We want all children to have an equal chance to succeed, but children from disadvantaged backgrounds need extra support from their school to make that a reality. The current formula for the distribution of the dedicated schools grant includes an element to recognise the pressures faced by those local authorities with high deprivation. For 2009-10 the DSG included &pound;3 billion for deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/2">We are undertaking a review of the dedicated schools grant to develop a new funding formula which would be available for use from April 2011. The aim of the review is to develop a funding formula which distributes resources in line with relative need, recognising the different costs of educating particular groups of pupils and providing education in different areas. Our aim is to support schools and LAs in raising the educational achievement of all pupils and narrow achievement gaps, particularly those from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/3">As part of this review we are investigating how best to provide funding for additional educational needs (AEN) and have commissioned research to investigate such issues as the different types of AEN in terms of level of incidence and severity; the best measures for identifying pupils likely to under-achieve and the potential role of financial incentives in tackling deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.2/4">The review is ongoing and it would not be appropriate at this stage to pre-empt its outcome. We expect to go out to consultation on proposals for a new funding formula in early 2010, after which proposals will be further developed in the light of the consultation responses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1015W.2/1">Initial details of our plans for the roll-out of a 'licence to teach' were set out in our White Paper 'Your child, your schools, our future' published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June 2009</phrase>. In setting up specific arrangements, we want to build on the best elements of the existing registration arrangements for teachers but place more emphasis on a teacher's record of professional development and practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/2">Our intention is to begin to roll out the new arrangements for qualified teachers and head teachers teaching in maintained schools, non-maintained special schools and short stay schools (formerly pupil referral units) from September 2010. We envisage that, as with current registration arrangements for teachers, the 'licence to teach' will follow the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and any qualification, for example a Post Graduate Certificate in Education, that a teacher may have attained as part of their initial teacher training.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/3">As we set out in our White Paper, we envisage a 'licence to teach' being valid for five years, at the end of which the licence holder would have to undergo a process of revalidation, building on the performance management arrangements and including other feedback.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/4">We are mindful that this represents a major change for the teaching profession and we will, therefore, work and consult closely with the many stakeholders here, including our social partners. These discussions will help inform the precise shape and details of the 'licence to teach' including: whether or not we set a minimum number of hours of teaching practice to keep the licence current; and what arrangements we may make to enable teachers from overseas to obtain the licence to teach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/5">In relation to cost, all qualified teachers working in maintained schools, non-maintained special schools and short stay schools (formerly pupil referral units) are currently required to pay an annual fee to the General Teaching Council for England (GTC) in order to be fully registered with the GTC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/6">This provides them with the right to teach in the maintained sector. The fee must also be paid by those teachers who work in academies who have to pay the fee as part of their employment contract, and any other teachers who wish to register with the GTC. As part of consulting stakeholders, we will consider how the 'licence to teach' will interact with the current annual registration fee and will be seeking the views of the profession before making a final decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1017W.2/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) does not make a distinction between <i> (a)</i> charities, <i> (b)</i> voluntary organisations or <i> (c)</i> social enterprises in relation to provision of grant funding. As per the Cabinet Office definition, DCSF regards charities, voluntary organisations or social enterprises as Third Sector Organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/2">The DCSF pays most of its funds through local authorities and children's centres. These organisations commission locally, thereby benefiting the local third sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/3">DCSF has two established grant funding agreement templates covering funding under and over &pound;200,000. Managers responsible for the management of a grant programme have the flexibility to decide which agreement template to use, based on the level of the agreed funding. Each grant funding agreement has clearly defined terms and conditions governing funding including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/4" class="indent">how the grant should be used</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/5" class="indent">responsibilities and accountabilities of the grant recipient</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/6" class="indent">terms and conditions of payment</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/7" class="indent">Intellectual property right arrangements</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/8" class="indent">capital asset management</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/9" class="indent">access to information in order to monitor compliance and performance</p>

	<p pid="a.1017W.2/11" class="indent">repayment of unspent funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/12">Grant funds are never paid before they have been formally approved and the grant recipient has accepted the terms and conditions of the grant agreement by signing and returning the agreement. Funding is usually paid in arrears. However, funding may be paid in advance when a request is made and a clear need for advance payment can be shown.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/13">The funding offered will reflect the full cost of the service, including legitimate overhead costs and is paid for up to three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/14">Contract funds adhere to Government procurement policy, based on value for money, and the EU procurement rules. This ensures that all sectors within the market are treated equally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/15">DCSF guidance reflects the recent guidelines on proportionate monitoring issued by the Cabinet Office. Monitoring must be proportionate to the risks and benefits involved.</p>
