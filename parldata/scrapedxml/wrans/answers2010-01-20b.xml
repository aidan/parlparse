However, where the holder of a premises licence is convicted by a court of an offence under section 147A (in respect of the sale or supply of alcohol, following an offence of persistently selling to underage children) to which the licence relates, the court may order that the licence, so far as it authorises the sale by retail of alcohol, be suspended for a period not exceeding three months.</p>

The total amount of biodegradable waste (food and garden waste) sent for treatment in this way, reported as part of the Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate reporting process is presented in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="b.328W.2/10">The increase year on year is largely due to the introduction of the food waste recycling scheme across the London Estate. This has diverted food waste from landfill and increased the volume of waste sent for composting.</p>

	<p pid="b.328W.5/1">The Government consider that landfill should be the last resort for most wastes where more sustainable options are available but recognise that landfill may continue to have a role in the disposal of certain hazardous wastes and as a means of restoring exhausted mineral workings.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.5/2">Some types of waste are already banned from landfill under EU legislation. The EU Landfill Directive bans the landfilling of liquids, wastes which are explosive, corrosive, oxidising, highly flammable or flammable, hospital and clinical wastes and whole or shredded used tyres.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.5/3">The Landfill Directive further limits the waste that may be disposed of at individual landfill sites by classifying them into one of three types, inert, non-hazardous or hazardous.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.5/4">The Government are assessing the case for introducing further restrictions on the landfilling of biodegradable and recyclable wastes. DEFRA and the devolved Administrations have commissioned further research on the environmental, economic and practical impacts of introducing further restrictions. We aim to consult on the options for introducing further restrictions early this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.5/5">In addition, the EU Batteries Directive introduced a ban on disposing of automotive and industrial batteries both via landfill and incineration.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.5/6">In line with the waste hierarchy set out in the Government's Waste Strategy 2007 and the Revised Waste Framework Directive, it is preferable to prevent, reuse and recycle waste. However, recovering energy from residual waste via a combination of complimentary processes, including incineration, is preferable in both environmental and economic terms to landfill. The waste must be treated in a facility compliant with the Waste Incineration Directive. This applies stringent regulations to emissions from incineration to protect health and the environment. Landfill sites and incinerators are subject to the requirement for an environmental permit, the terms and conditions of which may further restrict the types and quantities of waste that may be handled.</p>

The CJTF received &#163;1.63 million of funding in 2006-07, &#163;2,142,180 in 2007-08, &#163;1,375,532 in 2008-09, and we expect to contribute &#163;1,275,600 in 2009-10.</p>

Costs were lower in subsequent years as Afghan capacity increased, allowing Afghans to take on more of the roles and better value for money. This ongoing project is meeting its programme goals and is contributing to UK strategic objectives. It has seen a year on year increase in quality convictions, and last year successfully prosecuted its first high-level trafficker, who was sentenced to 20 years, imprisonment.</p>

Executions are often carried out in public and sentences we are concerned that many handed down as the result of an unfair trial.

However, the Government play a leading role in international efforts against money laundering, notably through its membership of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

	<p pid="b.336W.0/1">We have serious concerns about the Israeli restrictions on Gaza and the impact they have on the lives of Gazans. Although there is no permanent physical Israeli presence in Gaza, given the significant control that Israel has over Gaza's borders, airspace and territorial waters, Israel retains obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as an occupying power. The Fourth Geneva Convention is clear that an occupying power must co-operate in allowing the passage and distribution of relief consignments. The restrictions currently imposed on the passage of relief supplies are, as we see it, a disproportionate response to the security threat.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.0/2">The extent of Israeli restrictions, and the threat to Israel from militants in Gaza, varies constantly. Rather than focus on whether the restrictions at any given time amount to collective punishment, we have consistently pressed the Israeli Government to comply with their obligations under international law and allow passage of relief supplies.</p>

	<p pid="b.338W.0/1">There have been some changes to recording crime practices over this period which mean that the data for these offences codes cannot be compared for every year between 1997 and 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.338W.0/2">Since 1997, there have been two major changes to the way crime is recorded. The effect of extending the coverage and changing the counting rules in 1998 was to artificially increase total recorded crime nationally by 14 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.338W.0/3">It is estimated that the effect of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 caused a further artificial increase of 10 per cent. in total recorded crime in its first year.</p>
	<p pid="b.338W.0/4">For these reasons data between 1997 and 2008-09 are not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="b.338W.0/5">Additionally, the Home Office does not hold data for the offence categories of assault and offences involving the carrying of an offensive weapon for 1997.</p>

Patients may qualify for an NHS sight test on more than one criterion. However, they would only be recorded against one criterion on the form. Patients are more likely to be recorded according to their clinical need rather than their age. For example, a patient aged over 60, with glaucoma is likely to be recorded in the glaucoma category only. The count by eligibility is therefore approximate. Patients may also have had more than one sight test in the specified time period.</p>

These data have been used for this answer rather than 18 weeks referral to treatment (RTT) data, because in-patient waiting time data are available for longer historical time series than RTT data.<br/> 2. The median waiting time reflects the amount of time that the 'middle' patient treated has waited.

	<p pid="b.380W.6/2">Up to and including <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-13">13 January 2010</phrase>, the latest date for which figures are available, the total number of non-domestic EPCs that has been prepared since the regulations came into force in relation to non-domestic buildings in April 2008 is 141,339.</p>
	<p pid="b.380W.6/3">We recognise that non-compliance is a cause for concern in the non-domestic sector, although these requirements were only extended to include all non-domestic buildings from October 2008. From April 2008, only buildings with a total floor area greater than 10,000 square metres required an EPC and from July 2008 only those with a total floor area greater than 2,500 square metres. It is also important to note that the estimates included in the impact assessment pre-dated the economic downturn, which is likely to have had a negative impact on demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.380W.6/4">The regulations stipulate that local weights and measures authorities are responsible for enforcement. We have taken a number of steps to assist them in this task, including providing advice and guidance to trading standards officers (TSOs) about what is required and who is responsible, and providing them with full access to the EPC Register for enforcement purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.380W.6/5">We are also considering what more might be done through the regulations themselves in order to clarify when the need for an EPC for non-domestic buildings is triggered and whether to bring forward elements of the recast of the EPBD once it has been adopted by the European Union to make it easier for TSOs to identify the person responsible for making that an EPC is made available to prospective buyers and tenants can more readily be identified and targeted for enforcement action.</p>

	<p pid="b.383W.3/1">Our priority is to give businesses real help now so that they are able to manage in the current economic climate. The deferral scheme is part of a wide package of support the Government have put in place, and it was up to businesses to decide whether to use this option depending on their individual circumstances. We have asked local authorities to collect figures on the total number of deferrals granted and the total amount deferred and we intend to publish that data after the end of the billing year.</p>

In the majority of cases the type and scale of use together with the domestic nature of a room and furniture will not result in rateability. Each case is treated on its own merits as explained in the VOA factsheet 'Working at or from home' accessible on the VOA website.</p>

This calculation assumes that local authorities freeze their council tax, and in year two are also compensated for the fact that their council tax base did not increase in year one. It is also assumed that reductions in tax receipts, compared to the case if this policy were not implemented, are completely offset by reductions in local authority self-financed expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.400W.6/1">The prediction of sea level rise is at the forefront of scientific research. While prediction of the component from thermal expansion of the ocean is well understood, the contribution from polar ice sheets represents a major source of uncertainty, resulting in a wide range of projections of sea level rise.</p>
	<p pid="b.400W.6/2">The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007) estimated that the contribution to globally averaged sea level rise by the end of the century from thermal expansion would be in the range 18 to 59 cm, with up to a further 10 to 20 cm coming from the melting of ice sheets, but that higher values could not be excluded. Since then the literature has suggested that values for the total globally averaged sea level rise are more likely to be in the range 60 to 100 cm, with some papers estimating values as high as 200 cm, although these are thought to be highly unlikely.</p>

	<p pid="b.402W.7/2">Although I am sympathetic to the view that ACTA negotiations should be more transparent and I have instructed my officials to press for more transparency, we are not in a position to place the drafts held by my Department in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.402W.7/3">As is common practice in trade negotiations, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is taking place in confidence. Disclosure of any documents without the agreement of all our ACTA negotiating partners would damage the United Kingdom's international relations. This would harm our ability to protect, promote and secure an outcome in the UK's interest, and the premature release of documents that are not agreed and not fully developed may also have a negative effect on the Government's reputation.</p>

	<p pid="b.404W.8/2">Passenger cars are by some distance the biggest source of emissions from road transport, forming almost 60 per cent. of total UK domestic C02 transport emissions compared to less than 1 per cent. by motorcycles. As such, the focus of government support is on cars where it will have the biggest impact on greenhouse gas emissions from road transport. We recognise that electric motorcycles offer environmental benefits compared to conventional motorcycles and they are already zero rated for VED purposes and exempt from fuel duty. We anticipate that electric motorbikes will be able to access the re-charging infrastructure installed as part of the &#163;30 million Plugged in Places framework.</p>

It is resource originally set aside in the event that school projects found it problematic to secure PFI funding. Although the start of 2009 was a challenging time for the PFI market, BSF schemes have not had to use these additional resources. Partnerships for Schools has closed 17 PFI deals since the beginning of this financial year so we have been able to free up the resource set aside and use it for other purposes.</p>

Estimates for 16-year-olds are a very close proxy for the destinations of KS4 students, but will include a small number of 16-year-olds who have not yet completed KS4 due to their repeating a year of learning. The estimates will also include those young people who entered the country, either from elsewhere in the UK or abroad, after KS4. The figures can be found on the DCSF website here under &quot;additional information&quot;:</p>
