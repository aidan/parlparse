	<p pid="d.1440W.3/2">UK law enforcement agencies have reported a recent growth in the trafficking of illicit drugs through West Africa, including Cape Verde. We welcome the Cape Verdian Government's strong commitment to enforcing the rule of law and taking action against international organised crime. As a result of a short-term assessment of the increased use of Cape Verde as a drugs transit route, we are engaged with the Cape Verdian Government and other international partners in the region to identify both the nature of this development and how shared resources might be deployed to the region to best effect.</p>
	<p pid="d.1440W.3/3">Our Ambassador to Senegal, who has responsibility for the Islands of Cape Verde, met with Cape Verdian Ministers and officials in December 2005 to discuss a range of issues affecting the islands. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Department for International Development (Hilary Benn) is writing to the Cape Verdian Minister of Foreign Affairs about our work, with EU partners, to help the Cape Verde authorities tackle the growing problem of illicit drug trafficking through the region.</p>

	<p pid="d.1441W.2/1">The UN framework convention on climate change least developed countries fund will support national adaptation programmes in the poorest developing countries. Operational guidance for the fund was recently adopted by parties at the climate change conference in Montreal, December 2005. When the programming document for the fund is agreed by the Council of the Global Environment Facility, who will oversee the operation of the fund, the UK will consider providing finance. We recognise the fund's importance in helping Governments of the poorest developing countries manage the effects of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/2">As of April 2005, nine donors, including the UK, pledged approximately &pound;19 million to the special climate change fund. The UK contribution amounts to over half of this;&mdash;&pound;10 million over three years: 2005&ndash;06, 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. This will be available to support any developing country in managing the effects of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/3">Parties to the UN convention on climate change deferred a decision on activating the adaptation fund until management arrangements have been agreed, which should take place this year. The principle revenue stream to the fund will come from a 2 per cent. levy on emissions trading under the clean development mechanism.</p>

It includes support for the Uganda Electoral Commission, domestic election observers, increasing women's participation in the political process and strengthening independent media coverage of the elections. DFID has also committed &pound;400,000 to the national civic education programme, which aims to empower Ugandans to participate effectively in promoting accountability and transparency in national and local politics. A further &pound;50,000 has been contributed to a donor basket fund supporting the Parliament of Uganda with the aim of improving democratic governance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.5/5">In Eritrea, DFID does not have any projects to support the promotion of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.5/6">In Pakistan, DFID has provided &pound;525,000 to build the capacity of parliamentarians at the federal and provincial levels; &pound;326,000 to strengthen the capacity of local political party branches and &pound;208,531 for election monitoring to develop an understanding of the processes and outcomes of the 2005 local elections. DFID is also supporting the promotion of grassroots democracy across its projects by providing: &pound;2.8 million for a Gender Equality Project through the British Council to strengthen the capacity of local organisations to achieve access for women to political and economic decision making, protection from violence, and equal treatment in law; &pound;18 million through the Asian Development Bank to strengthen the ability of civil society to demand improved delivery of services and access to justice and approximately &pound;5 million for a Citizen Empowerment Initiative to strengthen the capacity of civil society organisations to engage government on issues of social exclusion, human rights and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.5/7">In Russia, DFID has promoted democracy by addressing issues of community participation, voice and accountability across the technical cooperation programmes. The ongoing projects include: a &pound;3,800,000 Public Administration and Civil Service Reform Project to ensure greater transparency of the civil service, to promote freedom of information and to encourage civilian participation in the public administration reform process; &pound;4,980,000 Support to Poverty Reduction in Leningrad Region (Oblast) Programme to strengthen the capacity of the region and municipal authorities to develop community-based alternatives to service delivery and alternative approaches to income earning for young people of mixed abilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.5/8">In Burma, DFID does not fund any projects solely focused on promoting democracy. DFID works with a range of partners including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the UN and international NGOs across health, education and livelihoods issues in a way that empowers civil society and communities. For example, DFID is providing &pound;4 million to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) over four years to help improve livelihoods for poor rural people through participatory local-level decision making.</p>

	<p pid="d.1447W.9/2">Health and Safety audits and Display Screen Equipment (DSE) assessments are conducted on work stations as a matter of course, but should a member of staff feel that their 'work station' is not comfortable or their chair, desk or position of their computer terminal is causing discomfort to their back, they can request a DSE risk assessment.

	<p pid="d.1449W.8/1">The electoral process needs to fit with modern lifestyles and allow better access for those who find the voting process difficult. To this end, the Government are exploring options to improve the process of electoral registration and voting process. Any improvements to the system would however need to take into account security considerations; being at least as secure, if not more secure, than arrangements currently in place.</p>
	<p pid="d.1449W.8/2">When the Co-ordinated Online Record of Electors (CORE) project is fully implemented we are proposing that electors may be able to access their information securely online and notify an ERO of any changes via the CORE system. Some EROs already use email and the internet to improve efficiency in parts of the registration process. However the law does not permit the use of email or internet for all electoral registration functions. In additional to this, we will also look at how email and the internet might play a role in increasing access to and participation in voting.</p>

The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA), as part of its ongoing programme of democratic engagement, is actively working with committed organisations to promote awareness of voter registration at the national and local levels and in particular to deliver a pan-London campaign (&quot;Get London Registered&quot;) directed at London's 'urban youth'. DCA is also working with the Department for Education and Skills, student unions, universities and colleges and local authorities to encourage London's eligible student population to register to vote.</p>

	<p pid="d.1456W.3/1">The Government are keen to promote the production of biomass heat and electricity, and transport biofuels. Electricity suppliers are required to source 15 per cent. of their electricity from renewables, including biomass, by 2015&ndash;16. The co-firing of biomass with coal in conventional power stations is permitted. &pound;66 million of funding has been allocated to develop dedicated biomass power stations, combined heat and power schemes, and heating boilers. &pound;12.5 million is available for household and community renewable energy projects, including biomass heating.</p>
	<p pid="d.1456W.3/2">Support is available to process biomass into a form suitable for use by energy end-users. A cross-departmental team is looking at the recommendations from the Biomass Task Force on ways to overcome the barriers to developing biomass energy. The Government will publish a full response by April. Support for the production of transport biofuels is through the 20 pence per litre cut in the duty rate for biodiesel and bioethanol. Last November, the Government announced that a Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation will be introduced to require 5 per cent. of road fuel to come from a renewable source by 2010. Other measures being considered include duty incentives to encourage the mixing of biomass with hydrocarbons in the conventional refinery process, and an enhanced capital allowance scheme for the cleanest biofuels processing plants. The latter scheme would allow the cost of capital assets to be written off against taxable profits. Regional support grants for capital investment in production plants are already available.</p>

	<p pid="d.1468W.8/1">Programmes within pillar II of the CAP are designed, in part, to encourage farmers to adopt environmentally beneficial land management practices, and progress is being made. The UK's position is that such targeted programmes need to be continued, and perhaps strengthened with reform. The overall budget for the Rural Development Regulation was agreed as part of the financial perspective (2007&ndash;13) negotiations and has been set at &euro;69.75 billion for the whole EU. This is in line with existing expenditure, although the precise allocation of funding is still to be proposed by the Commission. We will continue to argue that this should be based on the need for rural development and not on historical expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="d.1468W.8/2">In addition, as part of the 2003 reforms it was agreed to move some funds from pillar I to pillar II, a process called 'compulsory modulation'. This will increase pillar II funding from the original budget allocation by around &euro;1 billion a year by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1468W.8/3">The UK has also chosen to undertake significant voluntary modulation from pillar I to ensure that sufficient funds are available for domestic rural development. It is possible to transfer up to 20 per cent. of pillar I funds in this way to agreements made after 2006. It is vital to the UK and in England will fund our new Environmental Stewardship Scheme. However, Ministers are still to decide what level may be needed and on the likely size of the new rural development programme to operate from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>. In England, we are currently planning to launch a public consultation concerning the content of the new England Rural Development Programme for 2007&ndash;13 in February 2006.</p>

	<p pid="d.1469W.5/1">The effects of biofuels have been assessed under studies commissioned by DEFRA and DTI from Sheffield Hallam University and the Central Science Laboratory. These found that:</p>
	<p pid="d.1469W.5/2"><i>(a)</i> Biodiesel and bioethanol from energy crops can deliver greenhouse gas savings of at least 55 per cent. compared to fossil fuels. This can be increased to 80 per cent. if the energy used in production is from renewable sources. The technology to convert straw into bioethanol is at an early development stage but offers the potential for greenhouse gas savings of around 85 per cent. compared to conventional diesel.</p>
	<p pid="d.1469W.5/3"><i>(b)</i> The production of biofuels from UK biomass has a net beneficial impact on the UK economy due to the incomes that are generated in the agricultural, manufacturing, engineering construction, retail distribution and transport haulage sectors. There is additional employment where energy crops are grown on set-aside land as more labour is invested in crop production than in maintenance of set-aside. For oilseed rape, about two farming jobs are created (or sustained where crops substitute for other cultivation) for each1,000 tonnes of biodiesel produced. Bioethanol production from wheat and sugar beet would generate around 5.5 jobs/1,000 tonnes of bioethanol production. For both energy crops and straw feedstocks, additional jobs would be created in biofuel processing. A 100,000 tonne biodiesel plant would employ around 62 staff in processing and blending industries. A similar sized bioethanol plant would employ 50&ndash;55 staff, plus a further 16&ndash;28 in fuel blending and transport. Cambridge University is currently carrying out a review of the farm level economic impacts of energy crop production, including the use of oilseed rape, sugar beet, wheat and straw for biofuel production.</p>
	<p pid="d.1469W.5/4"><i>(c)</i> The crop management of energy crops for biofuel use is broadly the same as that for food crops. Biofuels production from a mix of feedstocks and replacing crops for food would have a neutral effect on biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid="d.1469W.5/5">Any replacement of spring sown break crops with winter oilseed rape would have negative effect on crop diversity and farmland birds. If arable crops replaced natural-regeneration set-aside, this would reduce habitat diversity. The use of straw as a biofuel feedstock would not affect the environment significantly.</p>

	<p pid="d.1471W.14/1">The main impact on people living under or close to flight paths around airports relates to aircraft noise. There can also be impacts on local air quality around major airports as a result of air traffic and associated activities, such as road traffic travelling to and from the airport.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/2">A noise level of 57 dBA Leq (equivalent continuous noise level) over a 16 hour period is regarded as the threshold for the approximate onset of significant community annoyance. This figure was derived from government sponsored research in the 1980s, in particular The United Kingdom Aircraft Noise Index Study&quot; published by the Civil Aviation Authority in 1985.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/3">The Department publishes annual daytime noise contours covering 57 to 72 dBA Leq for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. These show the geographical area and estimated population numbers affected by this range of noise levels. Elsewhere it is the responsibility of individual airports to produce aircraft noise contours and a number of major airports do so.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/4">The Government have also sponsored research into the impact of aircraft noise on sleep. The former Department of Transport published in 1992, the Report of a Field Study of Aircraft Noise and Sleep Disturbance&quot;. This study was and remains to date the largest survey of its kind in the United Kingdom. It was found that noise events below 90 dBA SEL (equivalent to about 80 dBA Lmax) were unlikely to affect average sleep disturbance rates, while events noisier than this gave a mean probability of disturbance of about 1 in 75, with a range of individual sensitivities around this average.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/5">Subsequent government sponsored research resulted in three reports concerning aircraft noise and sleep:</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/6" class="indent">Adverse Effects of Night-Time Aircraft Noise&quot;, CAA, March 2000;</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/7" class="indent">Aircraft Noise and Sleep 1999 UK Trial Methodology Study&quot;, Ian Flindell <i>et al</i>, November 2000;</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/8" class="indent">Perceptions of Aircraft Noise, Sleep and Health&quot;, Ian Diamond <i>et al</i>, December 2000.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/9">Having considered these reports the Government decided&mdash;in 2001&mdash;to commission a major new study that would concentrate on subjective responses to annoyance to aircraft noise. This study is reassessing attitudes to aircraft noise&mdash;including re-assessment of the association between the Leq index and reported annoyance&mdash;as well as attempting to examine subjective valuation of the nuisance from aircraft noise. It is due to report later this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/10">The Future of Air Transport&quot; also sets out the impact of the Government's policies on air quality standards around airports, with further information contained in one of the supporting documents, Air Quality Assessments Supporting the Government's White Paper&quot;. Although on a national scale the contribution of air transport and associated activities to local air quality problems are small, locally their effect can be significant. This is especially so at Heathrow and the reason why the Department has set up technical panels to review air quality issues at the airport as part of the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.14/11">Copies of reports referred to are available in the House Library and many can be accessed electronically on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="d.1473W.0/1">Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 provides for the Agency to assist the Commission in monitoring the application of the Regulation by conducting standardisation inspections of member states national aviation authorities. This provides for a more effective standardisation of aviation safety standards across Europe than was possible under the mechanisms put in place by the Joint Aviation Authorities which had no legal force.</p>
	<p pid="d.1473W.0/2">However, the Agency cannot put in place its standardisation processes until the European Commission has adopted the necessary implementing measures. The draft text of the Standardisation Regulation was agreed in December 2005 by the committee of member states representatives which assists the Commission in drawing up the various implementing regulations it is required to develop. The draft has to complete formal Commission processes before its adoption which we expect within the next month.</p>
	<p pid="d.1473W.0/3">We consider the effective monitoring and standardisation of standards in member states to be one of the most important aspects of the new EASA system. We hope that the Standardisation Regulation can be adopted soon, so that the Agency can devote the necessary resources yet to this work.</p>

	<p pid="d.1475W.3/1">The European Aviation Safety Agency provides a range of advice to various parties. It issues opinions to the Commission, which will be concerned with the quality and consistency of the advice it receives from the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="d.1475W.3/2">The Agency also issues specifications and guidance material to be used in the certification process. There is no specific process for monitoring the quality and consistency of this advice. However there is an appeal process against the decisions of the Agency and it is possible that appellants could refer to any weaknesses in the advice. In addition an advisory body of interested parties has been set up which may monitor matters of this kind.</p>
	<p pid="d.1475W.3/3">The Management Board has a key role. It is empowered to advise the executive director at any time on any matter related to the strategic development of aviation safety, such as the quality and consistency of advice provided by the Agency or the effectiveness of its methods of regulation. The board may consult the advisory body of interested parties before raising such concerns with the director.</p>
	<p pid="d.1475W.3/4">Also, by September 2006 the board must commission an independent evaluation of the implementation of the regulation which established the Agency. The evaluation will include an examination of how effectively the Agency fulfils its mission, and will thus need to examine both the quality and consistency of its advice and the effectiveness of its methods of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1475W.3/5">The Civil Aviation Authority is keeping under review all aspects of the performance of the Agency and reporting its findings to the Secretary of State. This advice also informs the positions taken in the Management Board by the UK representative, who is the deputy chairman of the board.</p>
	<p pid="d.1475W.3/6">The Secretary of State has written to Jacques Barrot, vice-president of the European Commission to stress the Government's concern about the Agency's performance in the areas covered by this and the hon. Member's related parliamentary questions on the subject. The Secretary of State has sought the commissioner's proposals for resolving these problems as soon as possible and an early meeting at the highest official level.</p>

	<p pid="d.1476W.5/1">The European Aviation Safety Agency's Management Board has placed considerable emphasis on the importance of developing better working relationships between the Agency and national aviation authorities. The board has agreed that the joint Agency/national aviation authority group it set up to monitor the Agencies manpower planning should also address other issues affecting the Agency/national aviation authority interface as they arise.</p>
	<p pid="d.1476W.5/2">One of the recommendations of this group is that the Agency should hold discussions with each national authority on certain aspects of manpower planning and it is hoped that these discussions will provide an opportunity to build up working relationships more generally. Initial discussions have already been held with the UK Civil Aviation Authority.</p>

	<p pid="d.1484W.5/1">We have made no estimate of the extent of unlicensed taxi operation either in England as a whole or in particular local areas. However, relevant data is held by the Court Proceedings Database of the Office for Criminal Justice Reform.</p>
	<p pid="d.1484W.5/2">Taxis in England must be licensed by the relevant local authority under the Town Police Clauses Act 1847. Individuals who attempt to provide a taxi service without being properly licensed normally do so by contravening section 45 of the 1847 Act by illegally plying for hire or section 167 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 by touting.</p>
	<p pid="d.1484W.5/3">The Court Proceedings Database shows the numbers of offenders found guilty of offences under the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 (wider than just illegal plying for hire) and s167 of the 1994 Act are as follows; these data are provided on the principal offence basis.</p>
	<p pid="d.1484W.5/4" class="indent">In 2004, 215 people were found guilty of offences under sections40&ndash;68 of the 1847 Act in England; 16 people were found guilty of these offences in the West Yorkshire Police Force Area.</p>
	<p pid="d.1484W.5/5" class="indent">In 2004, 311 people were found guilty of offences under s167 of the 1994 Act in England; none of these offences were in the West Yorkshire Police Force Area.</p>

	<p pid="d.1485W.0/2">The primary purpose of the MOT test is to help safeguard against unroadworthy vehicles being used on the road. The average failure rate at annual test is, and has been for many years, around 30 per cent. for cars (equating to 6,752,700 cars), 35 per cent. for light goods (about 173,250 light goods vehicles between 3 and 3.5 tonnes) and 20 per cent. for motorcycles (about 149,000 motorcycles). The failure rate for cars undergoing their first MOT since their initial registration is around 16 per cent. (and equates to 375,000 vehicles). This reflects mainly items prone to wearing such as brake pads and tyres, which high mileage drivers who fail to check their vehicles regularly can easily overlook.</p>
	<p pid="d.1485W.0/3">The current frequency of the test represents a reasonable balance between the cost to the motoring public and the risk to road safety of allowing defective vehicles to go undetected. However Ministers keep this under review.</p>

	<p pid="d.1490W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, 1 have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning the registration rate in each ward of each constituency in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Northern Ireland and <i>(c)</i> Scotland listed in descending order and grouped according to region.(41187)</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/5" class="indent">I attach tables giving a comparison between the number of registered electors and the estimated population for wards in each parliamentary constituency in England and Northern Ireland. Data for Scotland are not currently available. Because of the length of the tables they have been provided in electronic format and will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/6" class="indent">It should be borne in mind that the percentage of the resident population who are registered to vote does not provide a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population. This is mainly because there are definitional differences between usually resident&quot; and eligibility to vote and therefore the estimated resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. For example, the resident population includes all those who usually live in an area irrespective of nationality whereas the parliamentary electorate excludes foreign nationals (but Commonwealth and Irish citizens are included) and may include some overseas electors who do not currently live in the area. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate and this can occur for a number of reasons. People who have more than one address, including students, may register in more than one place. Electoral registration officers may vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/7" class="indent">Table 1 contains data for England. The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. The electorate counts are on electoral ward boundaries and it has been necessary to convert these to the CAS ward geography.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/8" class="indent">The latest available population data available at ward level are for mid-2002, published in April 2005. The ward electorate counts are for December 2002 parliamentary electors, including attainers. The parliamentary electorate has been used rather than the local government electorate even though the latter is definition ally closer to the resident population because the local government electorate is not available at ward level. No adjustment has been made to reflect the difference between these two time points. There are a number of wards that are split by parliamentary constituency i.e. they fall within two or more parliamentary constituencies. These are shown by an asterisk * alongside their ward name, and appear under both constituencies. Electorate and population figures for the whole ward are shown. Some wards will therefore be double counted. It is not possible to split the data for these wards.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/9" class="indent">The population data are estimates and as such are subject to a margin of. confidence. This margin of confidence is proportionately larger for ward level estimates than for local authority level estimates. The GAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/10" class="indent">There are a relatively small number of wards (19) where the electorate counts are more than 10 per cent. greater than the population estimate. These cases are attributable to definitional differences between the estimates and electoral counts, the margin of confidence in the ward estimates, the accuracy of the electoral registers and limitations in the methodology used to convert electoral counts to the GAS ward geography.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/11" class="indent">Table 2 contains data for total electorate for electoral wards in Northern Ireland. The latest available population data available at ward level are from the 2001 Census, taken on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-29">29 April 2001</phrase>. The ward electorate counts are for <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-15">15 October 2001</phrase> and include all those registered to vote in any election.

	<p pid="d.1492W.2/1">The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development provides for retirement by making lump sum payments to employees to be invested by them to provide retirement income. As stated in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-12-20.2797W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 2797W</phrase>, a payment made by the bank from the bank's funds to enable an employee to purchase retirement income is, as an emolument of his employment, exempted from UK income tax by paragraph 14 of Statutory Instrument 1991 no 757.</p>
	<p pid="d.1492W.2/2">The emolument paid to staff is determined in accordance with the rules of the bank's retirement plans. At the creation of the bank, its consulting actuaries advised that, based on a range of actuarial assumptions, the lump sum benefits under the plans would enable a married participant with 30 years service to purchase a single life annuity, with contingent spouse pension and indexation, equivalent to 70 per cent. of final EBRD gross base salary. This 70 per cent. figure was purely indicative and was not a commitment to provide a retirement income of such amount. Any income would depend upon the rate of return of the investment. However, this gross salary was initially calculated as the employees' net salary grossed up by the bank's own internal income tax. In 1992 a report by the bank's consulting actuaries found that this approach led to a level of benefits lower than in comparable organisations. Following this report the board of directors&mdash; as representatives of the bank's shareholders&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="1992-12-15">15 December 1992</phrase> decided that the appropriate measure of gross salary for pension purposes would be one that took account of average UK tax rates. Since UK tax rates were, and are, higher than the bank's internal tax, the level of lump sum necessary to generate the same potential level of income, using the original actuarial assumptions, was greater.</p>
	<p pid="d.1492W.2/3">As a result, both bank and employee contributions to the retirement plans which provide the lump sum payments were increased. The tax position of these lump sum payments remains as set out earlier in this answer. As stated in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-12-20.2797W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 2797W</phrase>, retirement income arising from the investment of the payment is liable to income tax in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid="d.1492W.2/4">The EBRD does not make pension payments, it provides a lump sum which is intended for individuals to make investments to provide income in retirement. The form of these investments is for individuals to determine.</p>
	<p pid="d.1492W.2/5">The bank has two plans which support the payment of lump sums at retirement: the Final Salary Plan and the Money Purchase Plan. The payments made since the inception of the plans to end March 2005&mdash;the latest date for which audited figures are available&mdash;are &pound;50,993,820 and &pound;47,683, 290 respectively. As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, the value of assets held by the bank in respect of the Money Purchase Plan is &pound;77,628,896 and the value of the assets held by the bank in respect of the Final Salary Plan is &pound;73,810,750.</p>

	<p pid="d.1494W.0/35">In a Lone parent family, the family reference person (FRP) is taken to be the lone parent in a lone-parent family. In a couple family, the FRP is chosen from the two people in the couple on the basis of their economic activity (in the priority order; full-time job, part-time job, unemployed, retired, other).

This is a change from the 1991 definition which was a person aged 0&ndash;15 in a household or a person aged 16&ndash;18, never married, in full-time education and economically inactive. The revised 2001 definition has been agreed following consultation with users. An 'adult' in a household is any person who is not a dependent child.</p>

	<p pid="d.1495W.2/1">Performance against the golden rule is measured using fiscal aggregates that cover the entire public sector: central Government plus local authorities plus public corporations.

	<p pid="d.1495W.2/2">As such, the impact on the golden rule is:</p>

Most transactions within the public sector associated with the transfer of housing stock from local authorities to housing associations and the writing off of associated local authority debt where necessary have no effect on the fiscal aggregates for the public sector as a whole. It is only with 'negative value' stock transfers, where the receiving association requires a dowry payment in order to take on the stock and associated liabilities, that there is a requirement for public expenditure. However, as this is a capital grant there is no consequent impact on the golden rule, which only includes current expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="d.1506W.3/1">Many of the most important recommendations from the Ofcom report into premium rate service regulation have already been implemented. For example, from <phrase class="date" code="">15 September</phrase> network operators have been obliged to withhold payments to services providers for 30 days after a call has been made thus enabling repayment or the payment of penalties to be guarantees. This is a powerful discouragement to fraudulent or exploitative activities. Other measures have also been implemented by DTI. For instance we have increased the maximum penalty for breaching the ICSTIS code of practice from &pound;100,000 to &pound;250,000. I expect the remaining recommendations to be implemented in the spring. It is important to get these regulatory changes right for the future and we have to meet requirements for extensive consultation of the industry and the public.</p>

	<p pid="d.1512W.5/1">The Government takes the recent increases in gas prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. We understand that this creates tough trading conditions, especially for energy intensive users, and we are aware of a few companies having reduced production in response to the very high prices since November. This will, of course, have a negative impact on UK industrial output, but in terms of overall GDP this will be relatively minor.</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.5/2">I have visited a number of major industrial gas users and am continuing to meet with companies, business representatives and gas suppliers to discuss gas prices and security of supply. Energywatch and DTI held a seminar with smaller gas users and the public sector on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-30">30 November 2005</phrase> to discuss energy purchasing strategies. We are also undertaking some research into the capability of UK industry to reduce their gas demand.</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.5/3">The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.5/4">Provisional data for October 2005 shows that UK retail gas prices for small, medium and large industrial users were below the EU15 median. However, individual companies will have agreed commercially confidential contract terms and prices that might differ from these averages. I am also aware, from my industry visits and meetings, that, there is some evidence that gas prices in the UK for some of our very large industrial users is above those on the continent, and I recognise the risk that this presents to UK competitiveness. Officials are working closely with industry and OFGEM, with a view to help, wherever possible, to mitigate the situation and reduce these impacts.</p>

	<p pid="d.1513W.2/1">Any increase in overall annual CO <sub>2</sub> emissions from coal fired power stations running at a higher rate than usual will need to be covered by allowances under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. There is a fixed number of allowances which are allocated directly to installations, such as power stations. If an installation wants to increase emissions above its allowance, it will need to buy extra allowances from other holders of allowances who are able to abate emissions and therefore have allowances to sell. Allowances can also be bought through Kyoto protocol mechanisms whereby credits can be bought for emissions reductions in mainly developing countries. The Emissions Trading Scheme therefore works to ensure that those responsible for increased CO <sub>2</sub> emissions on an annual basis have to pay for offsetting reductions in emissions elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="d.1513W.2/2">Other environmental impacts from coal fired electricity generation are subject to controls which are monitored and enforced by the Environment Agency. These controls are designed to offer sufficient flexibility to respond to changing commercial circumstances without compromising overall environmental objectives.</p>

The current review of energy policy will consider policy options to ensure that the UK is on track to meet the medium and long-term goals in the Energy White Paper, against the background of developments since 2003, including our increasing dependence on imported gas.</p>

	<p pid="d.1516W.5/1">The UK meets its international obligations to hold stocks of oil for use in the event of disruption of supplies by imposing obligations on companies. We believe that stocks held by companies are, in the event of an emergency, likely to be where they will be needed and capable of being quickly processed into the supply chain. The release of stocks following Hurricane Katrina has shown that the UK system was able to respond well to the disruption which occurred.</p>
	<p pid="d.1516W.5/2">The UK is currently required to hold stock equivalent to 67.5 days annual consumption, both in total and also in each of the three categories into which the total is divided. Obligations are based on sales. Changes in the market, with small companies below the threshold for the obligation entering a supply chain previously dominated by oil companies, meant that between March 2000 and October 2004, although the UK met the total obligation in all but two months, in 41 of the 56 months we did not hold the full level of stocks necessary to meet that part of the obligation relating to category 2 (gas oil, diesel oil, kerosene and kerosene based aviation fuels). In order to return to full compliance with the UK obligations the Government agreed increases in company obligations with industry, and the UK has been fully compliant with the obligations since November 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.1516W.5/3">We must, however, consider future needs. The UK's obligation will increase as our domestic production of oil declines. We have, therefore, consulted the oil industry and others about a new system which will ensure that the UK can continue to meet its obligations in future. We propose that this system should be based on products from refineries or entering the UK as imports. As we work with the industry to establish the system, we have agreed to explore the long-term potential of establishing an agency to ensure that stocking obligations are met.</p>

	<p pid="d.1518W.5/2">The review will be undertaken by a cross departmental team and will be followed by a full consultation exercise in the spring before we proceed to transpose the main provisions of the directive into UK law. A new timetable for implementation will not be set until the review is concluded.</p>

	<p pid="d.1521W.3/1">Aspartame was first reviewed in 1982 by the United Kingdom's Committee on toxicity, consumer products and the environment (COT), a committee of independent experts who advise the Government on the safety of food chemicals. New data on aspartame was reviewed by COT in 1992 and the UK Committee on the carcinogenicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment (COC) in 1996. The COT was satisfied that aspartame was acceptable for use in food and the COC considered there was no link between brain tumors and aspartame.</p>
	<p pid="d.1521W.3/2">In 2001, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on food (SCF) revisited its previous safety assessment of aspartame and concluded that there is no evidence to suggest a need to revise the outcome of their earlier risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="d.1521W.3/3">In July 2005, the COC considered the findings of a study published by the Ramazzini Institute on the potential carcinogenicity of aspartame. The Committee made initial observations on the data and noted the data will be fully evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority. The Food Standards Agency will consider its position on aspartame in light of the advice from EFSA, when this is received.</p>

The study found that of 18,820 patients aged over 16 years admitted to hospital over a six-month period, there were 1,225 admissions judged to be related to an ADR, giving a prevalence of 6.5 per cent. Of these 1,225, the ADR was judged to lead directly to the admission in 80 per cent. of cases. The median bed stay was eight days, accounting for 4 per cent. of the hospital bed capacity.

	<p pid="d.1530W.8/1">Work to consider the benefits of rationalisation and collocation of the two main Army HQs-HQ land (currently based in Wilton) and HQ Adjutant General (currently based in Upavon)&mdash;is ongoing. The Army is still determining the possible size and structure of the new HQ organisation and, in parallel, assessing a number of site options. We intend to inform the House about the final size and structure of the new HQ towards the end of this year. It is planned that an announcement about possible future locations will be made by the spring. Full collocation&mdash;assuming it is finally approved&mdash;is unlikely to be completed before 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.1537W.5/1">The relocation of people and property in Abuja is part of a long-running policy of city structure planning and affects both residents and businesses in all levels of society. The Nigerian Minister for the Federal Capital Territory has assured us that only structures built without planning permission and valid land allocation have been affected, that occupants and property owners are given notification well in advance, and that alternative arrangements are being made for communities affected including the offer of plots of land at subsidised rates. We have raised this issue with the Nigerian Government to ensure that humanitarian concerns are being taken into account. The Department for International Development Nigeria Office is in contact with the Nigerian authorities about possible support on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.1537W.5/2">In Lagos, civil servants have been moved out of government housing. This is a result of a change in the remuneration package for Nigerian civil servants, as part of a wider programme of civil service reform. The entitlement to many non-monetary allowances such as free housing and vehicles has been replaced by higher salaries. We have not made representations on these evictions.</p>

It is for the Government of Sudan to set the terms of contracts for infrastructure in its territory, and to ensure that these terms are complied with. Our ambassador discussed the dam project with the Governor of River Nile State, where the dam is located, on his visit to the area in December 2005 and pressed the Sudanese Government to work closely with those communities affected by the project and ensure that their rights and interests are respected. The embassy will continue to raise the consequences of the dam project with the Government of Sudan, and stress the importance of ensuring that such projects, and those implementing them, do not violate the local population's rights.</p>

	<p pid="d.1543W.11/3">English Partnerships has also provided funding for the acquisition of four former industrial sites and the remediation of one of those sites.</p>
	<p pid="d.1543W.11/4">Any further investment by English Partnerships in Sefton will be dependent upon the identification of projects which deliver strategic and transformational physical change which could not be otherwise achieved, and the availability of funding (in addition to Housing Market Renewal Fund allocations, of which some &pound;9 million has been allocated to Sefton in 2005&ndash;6).</p>
	<p pid="d.1543W.11/5">Funding for housing market renewal areas has been increasing year by year, and against that background and an updated agenda for English Partnerships, English Partnerships is now taking a more strategic role in housing market renewal areas going forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.1543W.11/6">In such areas, English Partnerships is no longer providing general funding to assist land assembly and demolition. It is intended that core housing market renewal funding will be used for these purposes. Instead, English Partnership will focus on a limited number of major strategic interventions which fit English Partnerships role in delivering and supporting regeneration projects of national significance, and which would not otherwise be achievable. By definition these projects will be large scale, complex in nature and involve transforming rundown urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.1543W.11/7">English Partnerships is also continuing to offer valuable advice and support to pathfinders, including on masterplanning, delivery models and best practice drawn from other national programmes.</p>

	<p pid="d.1546W.0/1">It is for local housing authorities to assess, as part of their strategic housing function, the reasons why dwellings in their areas are vacant. In general, the Government recognises that dwellings are vacant for a variety of reasons. About half of all private sector vacant dwellings are empty for less than six months and many of these will be unoccupied for transactional reasons to do with sale and renovation and will come back into occupation once sold or renovated. Dwellings that are vacant for non-transactional reasons often have problems associated with disrepair that must be overcome. From April local authorities will have new powers to bring empty houses back into use. We urge every local authority to use their new powers to improve housing in their area.</p>

	<p pid="d.1547W.3/1">We keep under review the way that information is made available about benefits so that bereaved people, at this very difficult time in their lives, know about their possible right to benefit and can act on it at the right time. Information is available from the local Jobcentre Plus and social security offices, and the Department for Work and Pensions website gives information about bereavement benefits together with leaflets and claim forms for downloading. Leaflets NP45 A guide to Bereavement Benefit&quot;, D49 What to do after a death in England and Wales&quot; and D49S What to do after a death in Scotland&quot; are available for professional advisers and the public, and are reviewed and revised as necessary annually.</p>
	<p pid="d.1547W.3/2">As well as providing traditional sources of information, we have been working in partnership with funeral directors, registrars and voluntary groups such as Cruse, National Association of Widows and Citizens Advice Bureaux who may be contacted by bereaved people. In addition we will continue to look for opportunities across Government and their services as they develop, to improve advice about this particular benefit, to those most in need of it&mdash;the newly bereaved.</p>

	<p pid="d.1553W.2/2">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the chief executive Mr. Stephen Geraghty. He will write to the right hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how much child maintenance outstanding from 1993&ndash;94 to 2004&ndash;05 from non-resident parents with cases with the Child Support Agency resulted from <i>(a)</i> full maintenance assessments and maintenance calculations where the outstanding amount is deemed to be possibly uncollectable or collectable, <i>(b)</i> full maintenance assessments and maintenance calculations where the outstanding amount is deemed probably uncollectable, <i>(c)</i>interim maintenance assessments where the outstanding amount is deemed to be possibly uncollectable or collectable and <i>(d)</i> interim maintenance assessments where the outstanding amount is deemed to be probably uncollectable; and what proportion of each category of debt has been recovered.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/6" class="indent">The tables provided show Agency debt from 1994&ndash;1995 to 2004&ndash;2005 split by collectability and assessment type. These are cumulative figures representing debt arising from the respective year and all previous years as no debt has ever been written off by the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/7" class="indent">As reported in the 2004/05 annual report, the Agency updated the classification criteria used to analyse debt. This was to reflect improved management information around the recoverability of debt, resulting in more debt being classified as collectable. The outstanding amounts will be pursued vigorously through the Enforcement Directorate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/8" class="indent">The Agency currently receives over &pound;585 million maintenance per year however there is still a culture surrounding its activities whereby some non-resident parents perceive it as acceptable not to comply with the Agency and make their maintenance payments. The Agency has therefore begun to take steps to tackle this issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/9" class="indent">Debt has been increasing year on year because many non-resident parents actively avoid their obligations for example by changing jobs when the Agency imposes enforcement action on them or changing addresses whenever the Agency locates them. The Agency recognises that it needs to make more use of its powers of enforcement, and has started to take steps to do this, however this is constrained by the requirements of the legal process and dependent on decisions made by the courts.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/10" class="indent">A dedicated Enforcement Directorate has been set up to focus on the collection of debt from the more difficult cases and the Agency is aggressively pursuing non-compliant clients more pro-actively than in the past. The directorate's aims are also to change the culture to one where it is not acceptable to deliberately avoid payment of maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/11" class="indent">The creation of the Enforcement Directorate has already improved the Agency's enforcement performance and effectiveness with improved outcomes at the more routine stages of enforcement for example, bailiff action, third party debt orders and charging orders.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/12" class="indent">The number of liability orders granted is improving with more than 4,500 liability orders being granted already this financial year. Also this year the amount collected by bailiff teams has doubled to &pound;3 million and the Agency has achieved successful outcomes in increasing numbers of committal actions. In addition, the directorate has achieved collections of &pound;8.39 million from April to November 2005, with November achieving the highest in month collections of &pound;1.42 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/13" class="indent">The actions outlined above should therefore start to reduce the historic debt levels and improve compliance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/14" class="indent">The achievements are modest in the context of the total debt but demonstrate that more focussed enforcement action can be successful. I have also made recommendations to Ministers on further improving enforcement following my review of the operations of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/15" class="indent">I hope you find this response helpful.</p>

	<p pid="d.1553W.2/49">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/50">1.The annual report and accounts for previous years were re-published in 1997&ndash;98, due to a change in accounting policy in reporting collectability of the debt. Also, the Agency did not publish audited accounts in 1993&ndash;94; and no figures are therefore shown for this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/51">2.The new scheme was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March 2003</phrase>, and (monies from new scheme cases and default maintenance decisions) began to accrue in the 2002&ndash;03. Information is provided from this date.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/52">3.The Deferred&quot; figures represent arrears maintenance that the Agency has agreed not to collect from non-resident parents because the Agency was wholly or partly responsible for the build-up of those arrears.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/53">4.Full maintenance assessments and interim maintenance assessments include new and old scheme cases. Maintenance calculated and default maintenance decisions are new scheme only.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/54">5.The Agency is unable to provide the proportion recovered for each debt category. The principle behind the recoverability of debt as reported in the annual report and accounts is based on a sample of cases examined as part of a National Audit Office approved annual debt analysis exercise.</p>

	<p pid="d.1560W.3/5" class="indent">A deduction from earnings order is a method of enforcement action to be used on non-resident parents in employment if there is an indication that payment will not be made or when payment breaks down.

	<p pid="d.1560W.3/11" class="indent">Our staff are advised that whether or not a deduction from earnings order can be imposed depends upon the type of income the non-resident parent is receiving.

	<p pid="d.1568W.0/1">The Government have taken a number of steps to help all people save for their retirement, including contracted and sub-contracted workers who do not have access to a suitable company pension scheme. For employees, the introduction of the state second pension in April 2002 is helping around 18.7 million people to build up entitlement to a second tier pension: this includes around 5.8 million low earners, and around 8.8 million moderate earners.</p>
	<p pid="d.1568W.0/2">We also introduced stakeholder pensions in April 2001 as an additional pension option. These are flexible and portable with a limit on annual management charges, and they allow for minimum contributions of as little as &pound;20 at a time. As stakeholder pensions are also open to non-earners, policy holders can continue to contribute to their pension plan in any periods of non-employment. These features may be of particular benefit to contracted and sub-contracted workers, who may have interrupted work patterns.</p>
	<p pid="d.1568W.0/3">The Government's informed choice programme is also helping people, including contracted and sub-contracted workers, improve their pension provision by raising overall levels of financial education and awareness of the need to plan and provide for retirement. We aim to ensure people have tailored, accurate and timely information, and to improve levels of financial literacy and capability. Overall we are trying to achieve a behavioural and cultural change so that all people actively plan for their retirement.</p>

	<p pid="d.1569W.0/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions; how many telephone calls to the Child Support Agency were <i>(a)</i> received <i>(b)</i> engaged and <i>(c)</i> disconnected during the interactive voice response process for the period April 2002 to September 2005 for (i) all calls and (ii) calls relating to the cases being progressed on the new computer system; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/5" class="indent">The information requested is contained in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/6" class="indent">As you will see, since experiencing the major, well-documented problems associated with the introduction of the new Child Support Scheme in March 2003, the Agency has shown significant improvements in telephony performance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/7" class="indent">In particular, for those calls for which management information is available as to the eventual outcome of the call:</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/8" class="indent">In the period April-September 2005, 82 per cent. of total calls received were answered, up from 58 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/9" class="indent">In the period April-September 2005, only 3 per cent. of total calls received were ineffective (which means they received an engaged tone, or failed due to other system problems) down from 14 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/10" class="indent">Calls abandoned can be split into two types, those abandoned while in queues waiting for staff to answer them and those calls abandoned in the automated touch tone/Interactive Voice Response (IVR) part of the process before they have joined a queue to be answered by staff (for example if the client does not have a National Insurance number to hand and hangs up to go and find it before calling back).</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/11" class="indent">Calls abandoned in the automated touch-tone/IVR part of the process have remained relatively stable at around 6 per cent. of total calls received over the last 3 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/12" class="indent">Calls abandoned once in a queue has fallen from 22 per cent. of total calls received in 2003&ndash;04 to 10 per cent. in the period April-September 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/13" class="indent">89 per cent. of calls which entered a queue after passing through the IVR/touchtone part of the process were successfully answered between April and September 2005, up from 73 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.0/14" class="indent">I hope you find this information helpful.</p>

	<p pid="d.1575W.2/1">There are no plans to bring the number down. The relatively large number of people on the British National DNA Database means there is a greater chance of matching DNA found at the scene of a crime to a suspect. The Database provides the public with a vital intelligence tool, providing around 3,000 intelligence matches per month. There has been a four-fold increase in the number of detections obtained through the use of DNA between 1999 and 2005.</p>

	<p pid="d.1575W.5/1">The Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) aims to make the most of opportunities provided by the criminal justice system to direct drug misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment and break the destructive cycle of drugs, offending and prison.</p>
	<p pid="d.1575W.5/2">Key elements of the Programme are delivered in all areas of England while the intensive&quot; elements of the Programme are currently operational in 97 areas with high levels of acquisitive crime. This includes testing individuals for Class A drugs who are charged with a trigger offence. Testing on Arrest is currently operational in three areas of England and will commence in all other DIP intensive areas in England on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>. The results of the tests are also used to inform court decisions on bail and sentencing. It is a matter for the courts to determine the most appropriate sentence according to the offence committed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1575W.5/3">From October 2000 until the introduction of the community order of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 in April 2005, drug treatment was delivered as a requirement of a community sentence through the Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTO).

	<p pid="d.1582W.8/1">As regards adult offenders, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides that a custodial sentence may only be imposed on adult offenders when the offence is so serious that no other sentence can be justified. A wide range of non-custodial sentences is available to deal with offenders. While sentencing in individual cases is entirely a matter for the courts, the Government believes that prison should be reserved for dangerous, violent and seriously persistent offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.1582W.8/2">The 2003 Act also provides that before passing a custodial sentence on an offender who is or appears to be mentally disordered, the court must consider any information before it relating to his mental condition, and the likely effect of a custodial sentence on that condition. Section 166 of the Act specifically allows the court to mitigate sentences for mentally disordered offenders, and to impose non-custodial sentences where normally a custodial sentence would be justified.</p>
	<p pid="d.1582W.8/3">Hospital orders rather than custodial orders can be issued at the sentencing stage, and where mental health issues come to light only while in custody, the offender can be removed from prison and transferred to a secure hospital.</p>
	<p pid="d.1582W.8/4">The Sentencing Guidelines Council (which issues sentencing guidelines to which criminal courts in England and Wales must have regard) has issued a guideline confirming that mental illness is generally a mitigating factor in sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="d.1582W.8/5">The 'Development Programme for Extending Offender Health Support', a joint initiative between the Home Office and Department of Health, has recently been introduced to help the courts identify, assess and make appropriate recommendations for the care and management of offenders with health and social care needs. The programme's underpinning goal is to ensure that prison is not a default destination for vulnerable individuals whose care and management needs could more appropriately be met elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="d.1582W.8/6">Juvenile offenders are dealt with under a separate sentencing structure that provides for their special vulnerability.</p>

	<p pid="d.1584W.2/1">The Department does not collect the information in the form requested. A National Complaints Procedure, agreed by the Secretary of State, enables local probation areas to handle complaints. Complaints must be from offenders or their nominated representatives. Unresolved local complaints are escalated to the independent Prison and Probation ombudsman. The following table details the number of complaints received by the Prison and Probation ombudsman since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-01">1 September 2001</phrase>, the date on which the NPS complaints procedure, and the ombudsman's responsibility for investigating complaints about the probation service were implemented.</p>

	<p pid="d.1584W.2/14">The number eligible column shows the number of complaints out of all those received that have been eligible for the ombudsman to investigate. The ombudsman's terms of reference (and the NPS complaint procedure) require that all three stages of the complaint procedure must have been completed before the ombudsman may investigate a complaint. The three stages are: informal investigation by the local office, formal investigation by the Chief Officer or a senior officer nominated by the CO, and finally the appeal stage when a panel of three Board members hears the appeal. The ombudsman may accept complaints that are referred to him within one month of the complainant receiving the result of the appeal.</p>

	<p pid="d.1585W.3/1">We have no reason to believe that any convictions will be affected by this ruling. In criminal proceedings in England and Wales, the courts have a range of powers to prevent the admission of evidence that may have been obtained improperly or illegally, including through means of torture. Courts have the discretion to exclude evidence if it is unduly prejudicial or unfair, and a judicial discretion to stay proceedings if they are considered to be an abuse of the court's process. Defendants also enjoy the protections afforded by Article six of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), the right to a fair trial. Article three of the ECHR also prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.3/2">In addition, a confession is not admissible unless it meets the requirements set out in sections 76 and 78 of Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE).

Section 76(8) of PACE states that oppression includes torture, inhuman and degrading treatment and the use or threat of violence</p>

	<p pid="d.1585W.6/1">Reconviction rates for young offenders following a pre-court disposal, a non-custodial sentence at court or discharge from custody have been published as part of the Home Office's monitoring of its PSA (Public Service Agreement) target on reducing reoffending. The most recent data were published in Juvenile reconviction: results from the 2003 cohort&quot;. The report shows one year reconviction rates for juvenile offenders (those aged 10 to 17) for 1997 and 2000 to 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.6/2">Some statistics on reconviction rates for young offenders released from prison or starting a community sentence have been published in Prison Statistics: England and Wales&quot; and Probation Statistics, England and Wales&quot; but these are on a different basis from the PSA results. These publications are available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.6/3">Reconviction rates should be used with caution as a number of different factors can influence them. Reconviction rates can be adjusted to take account of the changing characteristics of offenders and these adjusted rates are published on the Home Office's website. The most recent data show that there has been a reduction in re-offending for young offenders of 2.4 per cent. against the 2000 baseline. The Home Office Public Service Agreement target is to reduce re-offending by 5 per cent. by 2006.</p>

	<p pid="d.1591W.0/1">There are two distinct sets of guidelines which cover police officers and police staff. These are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/2" class="italic">1.Police Staff are covered by NICS code paragraph 1084, which states:</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/3" class="indent">An individual may at any time be suspended from duty if, in the opinion of the person exercising disciplinary powers, that course is a necessary precaution in the public interest pending the outcome of criminal or disciplinary investigations or proceedings, and no alternative course eg transfer to other duties is appropriate. Suspension in these circumstances, as distinct from suspension as a disciplinary penalty (see paragraph 1093d), does not imply any decisions about the case, and this important distinction should be kept in mind whenever any record or report of the period of absence is necessary. Pay in respect of any period of suspension may be withheld wholly or in part so long as such suspension continues, if the person exercising disciplinary powers so decides. In such circumstances individuals may be told that they may be eligible to claim for National Insurance benefits such as unemployment or sickness or supplementary benefits. Where it is decided that pay, in the whole or in part, should continue, for the purposes of calculating the amount to be paid the person on suspension should be treated in the same way as staff treated during the first six months of sickness absence. This would entail, among other things, paying shift disturbance (SDA) for the first 30 days but not paying notional overtime. Any decision to withhold pay will be subject to early and regular review; among the factors taken into account will be the circumstances of the alleged offence and the person's dependents. If disciplinary proceedings result in a penalty any withheld pay in respect of the suspension will be forfeited wholly or in part if the person exercising disciplinary powers so determines after consideration of all the circumstances of the case. Any withheld pay which it is decided will not be forfeited will be paid. Someone cleared of all charges, will receive a net sum making up any shortfall in net pay that would have been received during the period of suspension. Where it is concluded that someone should be paid during the period of suspension including retrospective payment, the period, the period should reckon under the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme in the normal way. The procedures set out in this paragraph do not affect the practice whereby a line manager may send someone home if the circumstances seem to require this: unless this is for a very brief period, however, consideration should be given by the person exercising disciplinary powers to the need for formal suspension.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/4" class="italic">2. Police Officers</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/5" class="indent">The PSNI has introduced a very robust, human rights compliant suspension policy which was crafted following a long and detailed consultation process with counsel, human rights etc. The policy takes into account 20 substantive considerations when deciding whether or not an officer should be suspended from duty (Code Section 9 App. 9 as attached). In practice the investigating officer, the District Commander, the Supervising Member and the Head of Internal Investigation Branch forward recommendations to the Deputy Chief Constable regarding the issue of suspension. These recommendations are based on the substantive considerations. The Deputy Chief Constable is the person responsible for deciding whether or not an officer should be suspended from duty. The circumstances of the suspension is reviewed on a monthly basis by the Head of Internal Investigation Branch and the Supervising Member.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/6" class="italic">Appendix 9(9)&mdash;Suspension: Substantive Considerations&mdash; (See RUC Code Section 9, paragraph 25)</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/7" class="indent">Matters to be considered&mdash;Listed below are various factors which may be taken into account in considering whether to suspend a member from duty. These factors provide general guidance and are not exhaustive of the considerations which may be examined and weighed in any given case. Further, the weight, if any, to be accorded by the decision-maker to the factors which they consider will be a matter for them.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/8" class="indent">1.Whether continued duty by the member concerned would be conducive to the promotion and maintenance of high standards of discipline within the police service.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/9" class="indent">2.The nature and seriousness of the alleged misconduct and any apparent aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/10" class="indent">3.Relevant medical reports on the member concerned.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/11" class="indent">4.The member's personal and family circumstances, including the impact which suspension from duty is likely to have on them.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/12" class="indent">5.The past performance and disciplinary record, if any, of the member concerned.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/13" class="indent">6.Consideration of the wishes and interests of the victim of the member's alleged offences, including any reparation they may have obtained in some other form of proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/14" class="indent">7.The strength of the case against the member concerned, including the member's defence to, or explanation of, the matters under investigation, (where known).</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/15" class="indent">8.The range of penalties available, or likely to be available, in the event that the member s conduct was determined not to have met the appropriate standard.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/16" class="indent">9.The likelihood of getting a member to a discipline hearing, especially where medical considerations might militate against a discipline hearing. (See N1O Guidance paragraphs 3.67 and 3.68 and Annex T.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/17" class="indent">10.Recommendations from the member detecting the offence/investigating officer, divisional commander(s) and 'G' Department. [Code Section 9, paragraph 25(2)].</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/18" class="indent">11.The member's apparent role in the matter under investigation. Were they, for example, under the influence of a higher rank? Were they a victim of circumstances? Have they been adequately dealt with by the criminal courts? Was the member concerned in a supervisory position, which brings with it the necessity to provide an example to more junior members? etc.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/19" class="indent">12.The message required to be sent to the police service or wider community. Relevant considerations may include recent events which have impacted upon, or shaped the expectations of the public regarding the professionalism, probity and conduct of police officers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/20" class="indent">13.Cognisance to be paid to the Chief Constable's policy on the circumstances surrounding the discipline incident, egdiscrimination, harassment, equal opportunities policy, drink driving.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/21" class="indent">14.Any possible or actual legal proceedings&mdash;such as a civil action or employment tribunal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/22" class="indent">15.The need to remove the member from an area, in order to protect witnesses, evidence or the integrity of the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/23" class="indent">16.In criminal cases, whether a prosecution has been initiated against the member concerned or the prospects of a direction to prosecute issuing.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/24" class="indent">17.The member's continued credibility to perform police duties, ie give evidence in court, interview suspects or witnesses, or deal with other police matters of a sensitive or delicate nature.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/25" class="indent">18.Whether temporary transfer of the member concerned from their normal duties during the formal investigation or pending the outcome of misconduct proceedings, is appropriate and proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1591W.0/26" class="indent">19.The public interest generally.</p>

	<p pid="d.1593W.6/1">With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults (NI) Order 2003 (POCVA) introduced a statutory requirement for childcare organisations to carry out a vetting check on prospective employees wishing to work with children in Northern Ireland. Vetting checks provide details of an individual's criminal record which includes all cautions, convictions and bind overs and whether the individual has been included on the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety Disqualification from Working with Children List or the Department of Education's List 99. PSNI can also share non-conviction information where they consider it appropriate to do so applying the pressing needs test. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis but records are likely to be disclosed where it is clear that this is necessary to protect children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1593W.6/2">POCVA also introduced disqualification orders, which may be issued by a court when an individual is convicted and sentenced to at least 12 months imprisonment for any offence listed in POCVA. These offences include sexual and violent offences against children. It is an offence for anyone who is subject to a disqualification order or whose name appears on any of the lists created under POCVA, to seek employment in a regulated position. It is also an offence for anyone to knowingly offer work in a regulated position to such a person, or fail to remove such a person from such work.</p>

	<p pid="d.1603W.5/1">The IFS report covers the first phase of the Employer Training Pilots (ETP) and has highlighted that we need to do more to attract the harder to reach employers. The subsequent phases of the pilots have shown us better how to do this, which has been one of the many real values of the pilots and their evaluation. ETP has also been the subject of an ongoing evaluation by the Institute of Employment Studies (IES). The development of the new national programme, Train to Gain, was based on the lessons learned from these evaluations. The final IES evaluation report is due in the spring, and we will consider the findings of that report alongside the IFS report.</p>
	<p pid="d.1603W.5/2">Skills brokers in Train to Gain will have a target of at least half the employers they engage being hard to reach&quot;, additional employers. We are making &pound;15 million available in 2005&ndash;06 and &pound;20 million in 2006&ndash;07 to develop the capacity of the brokerage network and implement a performance management system that focuses services on this priority and rewards achievement accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="d.1603W.5/3">A number of evaluations, including the IFS report, have shown that employers identify many benefits from ETP including productivity improvement, changed attitudes to learning, improved motivation and provided employers and employees with a platform for progression. Participating employers were more likely to train their low-skilled staff to the benefit of their business and say that ETP has allowed them to train more people over a shorter period of time. So we are confident that we are already involving more hard-to-reach learners.</p>
	<p pid="d.1603W.5/4">We expect Train to Gain to deliver over 40,000 additional level 2 qualifications in 2006&ndash;07; over 140,000 in 2007&ndash;08 and, by the time the programme reaches full capacity, 175,000 in 2008&ndash;09 and in each year thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="d.1604W.2/1">We do not currently hold data on the number of children and adults that have made use of extended services accessed through schools and it could only be provided at disproportionate cost. However we do have data on the number of schools offering access to extended services from a baseline survey of maintained schools published in September 2005. This survey showed that 87 per cent. of primary and 95 per cent. of secondary schools provide some form of childcare or activities outside of normal school hours; 69 per cent. of primary and 66 per cent. of secondary schools provide some form of parenting support; and 75 per cent. of primary schools and 97 per cent. of secondary schools provide wider community access to their facilities such as sports, arts and ICT facilities. This is a good baseline to build on and we will continue to monitor progress.</p>

This includes the costs of adapting existing systems that will supply the data to the index and ensuring that data are accurate; adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners so they can access the index from those systems; introducing robust arrangements to ensure security, and training staff to use the index properly.</p>
	<p pid="d.1605W.0/2">Estimated operating costs, thereafter, will be &pound;41 million per year. Most of this will pay for the additional staff needed to ensure the ongoing security, accuracy and audit of the index.</p>
	<p pid="d.1605W.0/3">Since the start of the feasibility phase of the index project in February 2004 we have spent around &pound;5 million on consultants and other specialist staff. We expect to spend around a further &pound;15 million on such support between now and the completion of index roll-out in 2008. Developing and implementing large IT-enabled systems is not an area where DfES can rely on employing permanent civil servants to deliver, since we cannot offer the career structure or range of projects that people with the necessary specialist skills will be seeking. There is no alternative approach which will deliver to Government at lower cost the expert people with the skills we need to deliver this project.</p>

The majority of learners access mainstream programmes where their needs are met through core funding or through additional funding support where required. In the most recent year for which information is available the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) supported 579,000 learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities at a cost of around &pound;1.3 billion. The figures for 2005/06 are not yet available. We do make available a separate budget for specialist colleges for learners with the most severe needs. We are providing &pound;158 million for this purpose in 2006&ndash;07. Support for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities is a key priority identified in our grant letter to the LSC and is in turn reflected in the LSC's annual statement of priorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.1608W.2/1">Overseas teachers are subject to the same vetting procedures as UK teachers. The Department provides detailed guidance on the necessary checks which must be carried out before engaging any teacher, including a supply teacher. The guidance requires that employers conduct checks to confirm that a teacher has declared their true identity, that supply teachers have the necessary qualifications and experience and that foreign nationals have permission to work in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="d.1608W.2/2">In the future we will require mandatory CRB checks as part of any appointment process on anyone selected for appointment who is or has been resident in the UK. However, it will not be possible to check someone who has never lived in this country because he/she will not have a criminal record here and will not be on List 99. We already advise employers to take extra care in other checks on overseas candidates and to seek information about the person's criminal history from their country of origin wherever possible. The CRB provides advice to employers about countries from which it is possible to obtain such information and how to obtain it.</p>

The EPPE study uses the same quality measures as in key US studies to facilitate comparisons. It will continue to follow children's development to the end of Key Stage2, looking at comparisons with international research. Additionally, in 2003, my Department's Early Years and Childcare International Evidence project reported on the relationship of early years programmes to child outcomes.</p>

The DfES Circular Child Protection: Preventing Unsuitable People From Working With Children and Young Persons in the Education Service&quot; sets out the procedures schools should follow in deciding whether to appoint staff. It emphasises that decisions must be made on after considering a range of pre-employment checks. It points out that a criminal record does not automatically make an individual unsuitable to work with children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1612W.8/2">The guidance advises prospective employers to consider several factors, including the nature of any offence(s); the length of time since the offence was committed; and the frequency of offending. It emphasises that sexual, violent, or drugs related offences are likely to indicate that someone is unsuitable to work with children, and that recent offences and/or a history of repeated offending are of much more concern than an isolated minor conviction many years ago.</p>
