	<p pid=".1403W.9/1">Agreement was not reached because of an unresolved issue over whether translations of the claims of the patent, which are required to be filed in all official languages of the European Union, should be for information only, or whether they should have full legal effect. One view is that a company should not be disadvantaged if it infringes a patent due to a bad translation. At the other end of the spectrum, various delegations believe that giving legal effect to translations would raise costs for everyone and increase uncertainty. The UK is anxious to see a compromise which recognises industry's clear view that excessive translation costs would make a Community Patent of little value compared to existing arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".1405W.6/1">Government are committed to reducing the regulatory burden on small business, in particular those regulations that act as a barrier to start-up and growth. We are determined to ensure that we only regulate when there is good reason to do so and when the benefits clearly justify the costs. Government have strengthened both the Regulatory Impact Assessment process and the guidance on the small firms impact test. Costs and benefits of proposed regulations are now properly analysed&mdash;and published.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/2">Some of the highlights of the specific measures we have introduced to improve the regulatory environment for small business include:</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/3" class="indent">Publishing the Government Action Plan for Small Business reiterating not only the commitment to better regulation but also our commitment to improving the regulatory environment for small firms.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/4" class="indent">Cutting form-filling and red tape for 700,000 small businesses with the new flat rate VAT scheme as well as abolishing automatic penalties for late filling of VAT which cost businesses &pound;99 million in 1996&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/5" class="indent">Securing agreement across Government that there should be 12 weeks between the making of new regulation and its implementation, thereby allowing small firms more time to adopt and adapt to new regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/6" class="indent">Publishing the Regulatory Reform Action Plan&mdash;setting out over 250 proposals for better regulation and reform. The Action Plan is designed to make it quicker and easier to repeal out of date legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/7" class="indent">Raising the small company audit exemption threshold to the EU maximum of &pound;5.6 million, saving 219,000 small businesses up to &pound;274 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/8">Announcements in the recent budget also highlight Governments commitment to reducing the regulatory burden for small firms.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/9" class="indent">A further increase in the VAT threshold to &pound;58,000 keeping 5,000 of the smallest businesses out of the VAT system.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/10" class="indent">Government Departments reporting on their own regulatory performance. The independent Better Regulation Taskforce will publish its own analysis of these reports and Departments regulatory performance will be taken into account in the 2004 spending review.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/11" class="indent">Regulatory proposals that are likely to impose major new burdens on business will have to be cleared by the Panel for Regulatory Accountability, chaired by the Prime Minister, based on a thorough Regulatory Impact Assessment that has been agreed by the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/12" class="indent">We have already introduced common commencement dates for employment legislation on two days per year in April and October. The Small Business Service will be consulting with Government Departments and small business on extending common commencement dates to other areas of legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/13" class="indent">Government accepts in principle the benefits to business of moving to direct payment of the Working Tax Credit. This has the potential to reduce the cost of payroll administration benefiting 1.2 million small businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/14">All of these measures are designed to reduce the regulatory burden on small firms but it should be noted that the UK is not over-regulated compared to other countries.</p>

Greater effort now goes into researching, targeting and stopping/investigating vehicles selectively and this is reflected in the above trend (figures).</p>

	<p pid=".1417W.3/4" class="indent">Average earnings are estimated from the 2003 New Earnings Survey (NES) and are shown in the attached table. These are provided for full-time employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period. This is the standard definition used for NES tables. The NES does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work. Area figures are provided according to the location of workplaces.</p>
	<p pid=".1417W.3/5" class="indent">The NES, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in Great Britain. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay.

	<p pid=".1420W.3/1">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs keeps the situation in respect of all controlled drugs under review. Methylamphetamine was considered at the ACMD's Technical Committee meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-11">11 March</phrase>. Evidence given at the meeting suggested that the level of methylamphetamine use in the UK at present is not a significant problem, and there is no evidence to suggest it is likely to become one in the foreseeable future. The Advisory Council is to further consider the matter at its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1420W.3/2">It was highlighted at the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-11">11 March</phrase> that methylamphetamine is a dependent inducing drug that is stronger than normal amphetamine. It has links with the development of mental illness, with users sometimes showing signs of violence, paranoia and anxiety. The effects of the drug last longer than cocaine or crack. The effects of amphetamine are similar to, but generally less severe than for methylamphetamine. Cocaine is a very dependence-inducing drug. Its harms include chest pains which can lead to potentially fatal heart problems. Crack has the same short-lived effects as cocaine but is much stronger. Crack is very addictive and chronic users are likely to suffer from mood swings, paranoia, aggression and mental illnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".1420W.3/3">The level of methylamphetamine use in the United Kingdom is not at present significant. In 2003 only 415 grams of methylamphetamine was seized by the police. Laevoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine are two isomers that are used to make amphetamine and are not misused separately. According to the British Crime Survey 2002&ndash;03, 1.6 per cent. of the population in England and Wales in the 16 to 59 age group have used amphetamine in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid=".1420W.3/4">No specific assessment has been carried out of the extent to which amphetamine use leads to violent and aggressive behaviour. The Advisory Council last formally considered amphetamine in November 1995. As stated above, the Advisory Council's Technical Committee considered the harms of methylamphetamine at its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-11">11 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".1421W.2/1">The Home Office has not commissioned or evaluated any formal research on the efficacy of animal experiments. Animal experiments must be judged to be potentially efficacious in order to be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which requires that animals may only be used in scientific procedures where such use is fully justified, where the likely benefits outweigh the costs to the animals involved, and where the procedures are most likely to produce satisfactory results. Also, under the conditions attached to their certificates of designation under the 1986 Act, all places that undertake animal experiments are obliged to have an ethical review process, one of the functions of which is to review the efficacy and conduct of the work undertaken under licence at the establishment. In addition, research councils and charities fund many research projects carried out under the 1986 Act and the work done is reported to and evaluated by them. Other work is funded by pharmaceutical companies and is subject to internal scrutiny within those companies. The safety and efficacy testing needed before people are exposed to new drugs is evaluated by the relevant regulators.</p>

	<p pid=".1421W.5/1">The deployment of officers to units dealing with child abuse investigations and their training in forensic investigation skills is a matter for individual chief officers. In addition a number of private companies provide forensic examination services which are regularly utilised by law enforcement agencies. There is no centrally aggregated figure of these resources.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/2">In addition to the on-going support for high tech crime, in December 2002 the Home Office provided a one-off payment of &pound;&frac12; million to the Association of Chief Police Officers to support operations to combat child abuse on the internet. This money has been used in part to provide relevant hardware and software, and also to train 86 individuals within forces in basic forensic analysis this financial year. The Home Office is currently producing tactical guidance for managers of computer crime units within forces which will include advice on running these units and practical guidance on procedures and tools for forensic analysis.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/3">Every police force in England and Wales has a computer crime unit and a child protection/child abuse investigation team which has expertise in the recovery of forensic evidence and network investigation. These skills are utilised in on-line child abuse investigations. Whilst the degree of expertise and training within these units will vary from force to force, all forces have specialists in dealing with such cases.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/4">With regard to training police who are not part of specialist units, there is a module included in the probationary training for all new police officers covering the internet and new technology to raise their awareness of how paedophiles and other criminals can exploit this technology. Centrex are also developing an on-line training package for existing officers. I have also made available &pound;100,000 to facilitate the development of a joint awareness package covering how children and those who exploit them use these technologies. This package will be aimed at all professionals with a role in child protection, including social workers, police and probation officers.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/5">A major consultation on the future of police reform was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-04">4 November 2003</phrase> entitled 'Policing: Building Safer Communities Together'. This raised a number of questions including whether there is a need for larger strategic forces, and specialised 'lead' forces to tackle certain issues, such as on-line paedophilia. Responses to the consultation paper are now being considered and we will publish firmer proposals for consultation later this year in relation to these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/6">I understand from figures provided by the Internet Watch Foundation that from the images reported to them in 2003, 55 per cent. of child abuse content is believed to be hosted in the United States. My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, has recently met the Deputy Attorney General and has discussed how we can co-operate to close down illegal sites that are based in the US. There will be a UK/USA working group to take this issue forward bilaterally.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/7">All G8 countries, including the UK and US, adopted a strategy on Protecting Children from Sexual Exploitation on the internet in October 2002. The aim of the strategy is to protect children from sexual exploitation on the internet and help make cyberspace a safer environment for all internet users.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/8">A problem for all law enforcement agencies is the identification of children featured in child abuse images. As part of this G8 strategy the UK is leading the development of an international (not restricted to G8 countries) Child Image Database, housed at Interpol. It aims to act as a global repository of images of child abuse with the capacity to carry out automated analysis. It will be a significant tool for international law enforcement contributing to the identification of victims and offenders and analysis of images.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/9">In the UK, where the Internet Watch Foundation discover that child abuse material is produced or hosted overseas, arrangements exist for notifying the relevant law enforcement agency and Internet Service Provider (ISP) concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.5/10">There are also a variety of funding mechanisms to assist in furthering international co-operation such as through the provision of equipment and training to overseas law enforcement by UK agencies, and the provision of specialist training courses. For example the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and National Crime Squad are hosting a second conference for international law enforcement experts later this month.</p>

	<p pid=".1423W.5/1">The London Criminal Justice Board is one of 42 Local Criminal Justice Boards tasked with improving the performance of the Criminal Justice System (CJS).</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.5/2">The local boards are responsible for delivery of the CJS Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets. Their key priorities are to improve the delivery of justice by increasing the number of crimes for which an offender is brought to justice and to improve the level of public confidence in the CJS. Additionally they have targets to ensure the Persistent Young Offender pledge is met and where applicable, including in London, they have a target to reduce street crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.5/3">Each local board has set out in delivery plans what their precise targets are and how they intend to achieve them. Progress against these plans are monitored and assessed by teams made up from representatives from across the three CJS Departments&mdash;Home Office, Department for Constitutional Affairs and Crown Prosecution Service&mdash;and appropriate feedback and support is given.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.5/4">Additionally the National Criminal Justice Board, at its monthly meetings, discusses the performance of local boards and members of the board&mdash;Ministers and senior officials&mdash;regularly visit local areas to offer support, build good working relationships with board members and challenge boards on poor performance.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.5/5">London also benefits from having a CJS Ministers Group that works with the board to identify and remove any obstacles to improved performance.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.5/6">The board recently reviewed its sub-structures and has now set up 28 borough level Criminal Justice Boards that will allow them to focus attention and resources on those areas that most require them.</p>

	<p pid=".1424W.2/1">Information relating to the number of Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) made in the York Petty Sessional Area (PSA) broken down by bench areas together with success rates of these orders and the number that have been revoked and reasons for this is not centrally available.</p>
	<p pid=".1424W.2/2">Data provided by probation areas to the National Probation Directorate show that in England and Wales between October 2000 and December 2003 18,397 orders were made. 16 per cent. of these were completed successfully, and 34 per cent. remained on the order. In the same period, 11,750 orders terminated, 24 per cent. of which were for successful completion.</p>
	<p pid=".1424W.2/3">Completion rates of DTTOs do not necessarily show the whole picture in respect of success of these orders. An evaluation of the three DTTO pilots found that, on average, offenders committed 75 per cent. fewer offences while on the order and reduced their spend on drugs by over 90 per cent. A two-year follow-up reconviction study found that there was a significant reduction in the average number of convictions per year in the two years following the order in all three pilot sites.</p>
	<p pid=".1424W.2/4">In respect of DTTOs, the timescales for first contact with the probation service and treatment provider are determined by the Home Office National Standards for the supervision of offenders in the community. These require that the first appointment with the probation area shall be arranged to take place within one working day of the order being made and contact with the treatment provider shall be arranged to take place within two working days of the order.</p>
	<p pid=".1424W.2/5">No recommendation is made in respect of commencement on any specific programme, nor in respect of prescribing substitute drugs; this is determined on an individual basis following assessment and is dependent upon the treatment needs of the offender. Contact, including treatment, across all requirements of the orders is expected to be on five days per week, for a total of 20 hours per week, for the first 13 weeks of the order.</p>

Even with a change in the political climate, the need for a humanitarian response in Zimbabwe will continue at least until the April 2005 harvest, and possibly beyond.</p>

	<p pid=".1431W.6/1">According to the EFA Global Monitoring Report 2003&ndash;4, girls' enrolments have increased faster than those of boys over the decade to 2000. The Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) for girls' primary enrolment in developing countries has increased from 73.5 per cent. in 1990, to 78.9 per cent. in 2000. The Gender Parity Index (GPI), which measures the ratio between girls' and boys' enrolments rates, has also improved from 0.89 in 1990 to 0.93 in 2000 for primary education, thereby closing the gap in East Asia and the Pacific. Of the 128 countries for which there is data currently available (including developing countries), 81 countries have achieved gender parity in primary education.</p>

	<p pid=".1432W.5/1">The Great Lakes region is emerging from 10 years of conflict, from the 1994 genocide in Rwanda to five years of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which appalling human rights violations were committed and which involved, amongst others, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. There has been real progress but expectations of progress in reconstruction must be seen in this context.</p>
	<p pid=".1432W.5/2">The UN Secretary General is assisting preparations for an International Conference to address all the issues arising from reconstruction within the Great Lakes region. The UK fully supports this and will assist as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".1432W.5/3">In the Democratic Republic of Congo, a transitional national government was inaugurated in July last year. It brings together the main warring factions in a power-sharing arrangement. This is a major step towards providing an environment in which reconstruction can take place. Its task is to take the country to the first democratic elections in 30 years in 2005&ndash;06. It has also started to reconstruct the country but the challenge and needs are huge given the high levels of poverty, dilapidated infrastructure and continuing ethnic tension.</p>
	<p pid=".1432W.5/4">In Rwanda, in the context of the events in 1994 and the reconciliation challenges posed since, progress towards national reconstruction has been remarkable. In order to deal with the large numbers of accused &quot;g&eacute;nocidaires&quot; in prisons throughout Rwanda, the Rwandan Government introduced a traditional system of community justice to handle the lower categories of crime. The Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (RDRP), which co-ordinates the demobilisation, reinsertion and reintegration of ex-combatants, has led to the demobilisation of 46,000 soldiers since 1997. 2003 saw the culmination of the transition period marked by a referendum on a new Constitution and the election of a new government&mdash;the first pluralistic elections in Rwanda's history. Despite mixed reviews from some election observers, the election process represented a significant milestone in Rwanda's democratic evolution.</p>
	<p pid=".1432W.5/5">Uganda has benefited from a period of relative internal stability since 1986. Significant progress has been made in relation to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The HIV/AIDS MDG was achieved in 1996 and Uganda is on track to meet the income poverty MDG, which requires that only 28 per cent. of the population be living in income poverty by 2015. High economic growth has been achieved over a sustained period through sound economic policies, favourable terms of trade, and the positive effects of rural livelihood diversification. The latest data suggests 38 per cent. of the population currently live below the national poverty line compared to 56 per cent. in 1992. Much of this success has been achieved through the implementation of the Government's Poverty Eradication Action Plan. This is now being revised, and will be the basis for future poverty reduction activities. The current conflict in northern Uganda could negatively affect the progress that has been made. We are monitoring this situation closely.</p>
	<p pid=".1432W.5/6">Burundi's three-year transition from civil war to peace and a democratically elected government is due to be complete in November this year. However, conflict still continues between the government and the FNL, the remaining rebel force. The international community, within which the UK is playing an active part, is helping Burundi achieve the goal of a fully comprehensive ceasefire, prepare for elections, and begin the process of demobilising the combatants and reintegrating the bulk of them into civilian life.</p>
	<p pid=".1432W.5/7">DFID fully supports all the countries of the Great Lakes region in their efforts towards reconstruction, with programmes in 2003&ndash;04 of &pound;20 million for the DRC, &pound;37 million for Rwanda, &pound;64.5 million for Uganda and &pound;11.6 million for Burundi.</p>
	<p pid=".1432W.5/8">We are also encouraging the normalisation of regional relations. We have facilitated regular dialogue between Rwanda and Uganda. We have urged the governments of Rwanda, Uganda and DRC to work up good neighbourly relations as the basis for national and regional stability. In this respect, we welcome the signing in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-25">25 September 2003</phrase> of a Good Neighbourly Pact, which included commitments by the governments that all support for armed groups should end and that there should be no involvement in any illegal exploitation of natural resources of the DRC.</p>

	<p pid=".1440W.0/1">For those projects implemented under the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme, the Department is involved through contributing the UK's share of the European Commission budget allocated to CARDS and by participating in the Management Committee established to define country strategies and oversee the programme. In addition proposals for CARDS projects in Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are approved by the Governing Board of the European Agency for Reconstruction, on which the Department is also represented. For those projects implemented under the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democracy, a similar oversight role is played by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Implementation of specific projects (including procurement, which is governed by EC procurement rules) is the responsibility of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".1440W.0/2">When considering Commission funding proposals, the Department took a wide range of factors into consideration, including likely impact, cost-effectiveness and value for money. Many of the 2002 projects are in the early stages of implementation. An assessment of the projects, and production of final spending figures, will only be possible once they have been completed. The EC, through its results-orientated management system and strengthened evaluation systems, is best placed to carry out such an assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".1441W.6/1">In sub-Saharan Africa HIV/AIDS is killing people in the prime of their working lives and weakening the ability of many countries to fill key public service posts needed to maintain essential service delivery. The problem is compounded by the increased demand for HIV/AIDS services (treatment, care and prevention) that must be met by a diminishing workforce.</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.6/2">We are, however, still at an early stage of understanding the direct extent of the impact on front-line health and education personnel as a result of death and illness from HIV/AIDS. The data available has limitations in terms of consistency and comparability.</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.6/3">The Department for International Development is working with development partners to assist Ministries of Education in assessing the impact of HIV/AIDS on teachers and in developing educational and management plans to mitigate those impacts. We have supported the preparation of impact assessment studies on the education systems in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Rwanda. We are working as a member of the UNAIDS Inter-Agency Task Team on Education and HIV/AIDS, to train education planners on HIV/AIDS through a programme of workshops under the leadership of the World Bank. We are further supporting the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning to carry out research on the impact of HIV/AIDS on education in sub-Saharan Africa. DFID also supports the work of the United Nations Commission on HIV/AIDS and Governance (CHGA), which is currently undertaking research to map the implications of capacity losses from HIV/AIDS for the maintenance of state structures and economic development in Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The research will specifically investigate the implications of HIV/AIDS on service provision in the public and private sector. It will report its findings to the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan in 2005. One study by CHGA estimates that 10&ndash;15 per cent. of health service staff in Mozambique could die from HIV/AIDS between 2002 and 2010. This would have very damaging consequences for an already extremely weak and under-staffed health system.</p>
	<p pid=".1441W.6/4">The UK's new strategy on HIV/AIDS is being developed in consultation with stakeholders. The strategy, which will be published in July, will emphasise the importance of assisting countries to develop both short-term &quot;emergency&quot; solutions to address the current shortage of health and education personnel, and to take a longer-term view of human resource planning and management in the light of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>

	<p pid=".1442W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises the hazards of indoor air pollution from cooking on poorly designed wood, dung and coal burning stoves&mdash;the main source of cooking and heating for half the global population. Women are disproportionately affected because the burden of cooking tends to fall on them. In addition, high levels of indoor smoke pollution can have a particularly bad effect on the health of small children, increasing mortality from pneumonia.</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.2/2">DFID is working to develop a multi-sector approach to this issue, that takes account of appropriate stove technologies and the behavioural changes required to reduce women and children's exposure to indoor smoke from biomass fuels.</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.2/3">As part of our China programme, DFID is supporting the environmentally sustainable and efficient use of locally available sources of fuel in poor rural areas, whilst working to reduce associated health hazards and improve livelihoods, by co-financing a substantial World Bank managed project on indoor air pollution. This project addresses both technology design and product marketing, and seeks to raise awareness of the effect on health. Earlier DFID-supported research work introduced stove improvements to countries in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.2/4">DFID is also supporting the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG), which is a key player in this area. ITDG's November 2003 report: &quot;Smoke: the Killer in the Kitchen&quot;, which addressed the impact of indoor air pollution on health in developing countries, was, in part, the result of DFID-funded work under the Knowledge and Research (KaR) programme. DFID also supports two other ITDG research projects:</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.2/5" class="indent">Smoke, health and household energy; and,</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.2/6" class="indent">Finding ways of scaling up effective and sustainable means of reducing the problem of kitchen smoke.</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.2/7">DFID is looking forward to signing off a Partnership Programme Agreement with ITDG in April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.2/8">Further details of DFID-supported research work can be found on DFID's Energy Website, which provides information on all research and development projects in the energy sector supported by DFID's Engineering KaR programme [<a href="http://www.dfid-kar-energy.org.uk">www.dfid-kar-energy.org.uk</a>]. Projects R8021, R8345 and R7368 are the most relevant, but others also touch on the subject.</p>

	<p pid=".1446W.6/1">The existence of high quality teacher training institutions and infrastructures is central to the delivery of Education For All in Africa. Likewise, well-educated health professionals are critically important for the delivery of programmes designed to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Appropriate distance education programmes, delivered in part through the use of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), can help to provide courses and resources to teachers and health professionals who would not otherwise have access to them.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.6/2">DFID is therefore committed to providing support to African Governments and educators to help them to develop sustainable and relevant programmes that will deliver such training. We do this both through the substantial budgetary support that we provide for African Governments, and also through more focused programmes of technical assistance. The Department for International Development is committed to spending over &pound;1 billion for education in the next three to five years, including a substantial investment in Africa. Furthermore, the &pound;7 million Prime Minister's Imfundo initiative (<a href="http://www.imfundo.org">www.imfundo.org</a>) is working in eight African countries to use ICTs to deliver enhanced educational programmes in association with partners drawn from the private sector, civil society and academic institutions, and focuses particularly on teacher training. We are also working closely with colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills, to help ensure that best UK practice in educational training can be shared with our partner governments in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.6/3">Other relevant initiatives supported by DFID include &pound;2 million support for the African Virtual University (<a href="http://www.avu.org">www.avu.org</a>) which delivers distance based university level courses across Africa, and &pound;1 million a year funding for the Commonwealth of Learning (<a href="http://www.col.org">www. col.org</a>), an intergovernmental organisation created by Commonwealth Heads of Government to encourage the development and sharing of open learning and distance education knowledge, resources and technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.6/4">The UK Higher Education Institutions are independent and autonomous bodies, and as such no central record is kept of the number and range of distance learning courses suitable for delivery in Africa, or indeed elsewhere. The Higher Education and Research Opportunities (HERO) website (<a href="http://www.hero.ac.uk">www.hero. ac.uk</a>) has details of courses available at UK Higher Education Institutions, including those delivered by distance learning. However, many UK institutions do indeed provide support for capacity building and course development in the fields of education and health. DFID has, for example, supported specific distance-learning initiatives between African and British universities in these fields through the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, and organisations such as The British Council also help to co-ordinate such collaborative activities.</p>

	<p pid=".1447W.3/1">There is no set amount of money that overseas students need to show that they have available in order to gain entry clearance to study in the UK. The Immigration Rules state that students must be able to show that they have sufficient funds to pay for their course and accommodate themselves without working or help from public funds. There are two exceptions to this. A student can meet some of his/her costs through earnings from employment if that employment is either at a publicly funded institution of further or higher education which is itself providing and guaranteeing the employment or a sandwich course placement which the college or university can guarantee will be available to the student.</p>
	<p pid=".1447W.3/2">As a rough guideline the British Council estimates student living costs (excluding fees) for 2002&ndash;03 as &pound;768 per calendar month (&pound;6,912 per academic year, which is a nine month period) for a course in London and &pound;600 per calendar month (&pound;5,400 per academic year) for a course outside London. Offer letters from educational establishments often contain an estimated cost for living expenses and the Entry Clearance Officer can also use these figures as a guide.</p>

	<p pid=".1461W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and I represented the UK at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 22&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-03-23">23 March</phrase>. Ministers with agriculture and fisheries responsibilities for Scotland and Northern Ireland were also present.</p>
	<p pid=".1461W.6/2">The Council marked with a period of silence its respect for the victims of the Madrid bombs.</p>
	<p pid=".1461W.6/3">The main item of business was a discussion on the Commission's proposals for a regulation to reduce the level of small cetacean bycatch. Many member states were concerned about the resource implications of the proposal, both for the fishing industry and government. In discussion we dropped our request for exemptions from mandatory use of acoustic deterrent devices (&quot;pingers&quot;) in the 0&ndash;6 nautical mile zone and in ICES Area VIId. We argued against exemptions for under 12 metre vessels to have to use &quot;pingers&quot; on fishing nets and for those under 15 metres to be exempt from observer requirements. We thought only smaller vessels should be exempted but most other Member States supported the proposal. We were pleased that the Regulation offers flexibility for those member states which already have robust bycatch data to design appropriate monitoring schemes alongside provisions for mandatory monitoring schemes for those that do not. A requirement has been included in the Regulation for pilot projects to monitor the effects of &quot;pinger&quot; usage and to observe bycatch on under 15 metre vessels. These pilot schemes have to be designed to deliver good quality scientific data which will be used to review the Regulation after two years' experience. The Regulation also provides for the progressive phasing out of drift nets in the Baltic, which will culminate in a total ban on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>. Taken as a whole the package is an important advance in the protection of small cetaceans.</p>
	<p pid=".1461W.6/4">A regulation was also adopted to protect permanently an area of cold water coral reefs off the north west of Scotland (known as the Darwin Mounds) from the impact of damaging fishing activities.</p>
	<p pid=".1461W.6/5">The only agriculture business was further discussion of the Commission's proposals for reform of the olive oil, cotton, tobacco and hops regimes, together with some technical amendment of existing regulations to accommodate the new Member States joining the EU in May this year. The Presidency acknowledged that several delegations were not in a position to conclude negotiations at this Council and announced an additional Council on 19&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-04-20">20 April</phrase> in Luxembourg to deal specifically with this package. Discussion concentrated on cotton, olive oil and tobacco and largely re-confirmed existing positions. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs stressed the case for the Commission's proposal of 100 per cent. decoupling in the tobacco sector and joined those arguing for a higher level of decoupling than that proposed for cotton.</p>
	<p pid=".1461W.6/6">Under other business, Commissioner Byrne reported on a recent visit to the USA, Commissioner Fischler reported on progress in EU/Mercosur trade talks and Austria raised a point on harmonisation of approval procedures for pesticides.</p>

	<p pid=".1463W.5/1">Ecologists have tried to classify setts according to size and function. The normal convention in ecological badger surveys is to recognise four categories of setts: main, subsidiary, annex and outlier, although there are other methods of surveying. Defra Wildlife Unit staff distinguish main setts on the basis of a number of factors including the number of holes, activity, latrine location, topography and relationship to other larger setts; secondary or 'other' setts are those not fitting the description of main setts.</p>
	<p pid=".1463W.5/2">Population estimates may be based on the number of main setts, with an estimated average number of badgers for a social group being applied per main sett. This approach relies upon accurate identification of main setts, and would not be affected by any other type of sett being missed; however if a main sett were mis-classified e.g. as a subsidiary sett, it would affect the population estimate.</p>

	<p pid=".1466W.5/1">A vaccine targeted at badgers would not be required to protect individual badgers against TB, but would need to reduce the transmission to cattle. Thus a vaccine that reduces the severity of the disease and/or reduces shedding of the bacteria from infected badgers by inducing protective immunity could have the desired effect. This is the current objective of badger TB vaccine research.</p>

These will bring together fishermen, scientists and all with an interest in the fish stocks and their exploitation to help develop ways forward to which all parties can subscribe. The industry and other organisations in the UK are at the forefront of action to establish RACs, and a Council Decision is likely to be adopted next month which will allow interested parties to take forward their proposals quickly.

	<p pid=".1476W.0/1">English Nature has initiated proceedings on four management schemes under section 28J of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended. In each case, a voluntary management agreement was reached with English Nature, before it was necessary to formally serve notice of the schemes. None of these concerned SSSI land owned or managed by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1476W.0/2">English Nature may enter into voluntary management agreements with any owner or occupier of SSSI land. According to English Nature, management agreements have been entered into with local authorities on 204 separate SSSI units covering 4,734 hectares of SSSI land. I will write to my hon. Friend with further details.</p>

Overall, English Nature estimate that local authorities own or manage at least 47,000 hectares (ha) of SSSI land. Many local authorities do not have digital mapping data for their own landholdings against which English Nature can compare their comprehensive data on SSSI boundaries and condition.</p>

Of these 32,000 ha, according to the last condition assessments completed on the land, approximately 19,400 ha is in favourable condition, 6,900 ha is in recovering condition, and 5,700 ha is in unfavourable no change or declining condition.

	<p pid=".1484W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence has no record of missiles being lost in the Bristol Channel or Severn Estuary in either 2001 or 2003. We are aware of only one incident of armaments being lost in the Bristol Channel or Severn estuary in the last five years. In March 2002, a pallet of munitions was lost at the St. Thomas' Head range near Weston-super-Mare, which is operated by QinetiQ. The pallet is presumed to have been swept away by very strong spring tides. The pallet contained eight anti tank bar mines (with the fuses removed) and 20 warheads which had been removed from Swingfire missiles.</p>
	<p pid=".1484W.0/2">Extensive searches have been undertaken by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, HM Coastguard, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Navy Southern Diving Group (SDG) and QinetiQ. The pallet has not, however, been located.</p>
	<p pid=".1484W.0/3">The SDG conducted two searches of the range area, consuming around 160 man-hours in March 2002 and about 220 man-hours in October 2002. QinetiQ carried out searches on foot and by boat and helicopter, expending a total of more than 110 man-hours. The RAF consumed a total of 15 man-hours on the task, including transit to and from the search area. The MOD does not have details of the resources consumed by either the Avon and Somerset Constabulary or HM Coastguard.</p>
	<p pid=".1484W.0/4">Use of the St. Thomas' Head range continues to be covered by the Long Term Partnering Agreement that has been negotiated with QinetiQ for the delivery of a long term test and evaluation capability to the MOD.</p>

Gifts over &pound;100,000 require a Departmental Minute to be laid before both Houses, under the normal 14 working days rule, before a final decision is taken. An export licence, or export licence waiver, is sought as appropriate. Potentially lethal military equipment (such as weapons and ammunition) can only be gifted through the GCPP with the approval of Ministers.</p>

	<p pid=".1486W.2/1">Postal services for HM Forces on overseas operations form part of the overall Operational Welfare Package (OWP). The postal element of this consists of free Forces Air Letters (&quot;Blueys&quot;) and their electronic equivalent, the &quot;e-Bluey&quot;, and airmail letters and packets up to 2kg at a subsidised rate equivalent to UK inland first class postage. When operational circumstances permit, a surface parcel service is also made available at a subsidised rate.</p>
	<p pid=".1486W.2/2">In addition to these comprehensive arrangements, an exceptional extension to the service for Iraq only was provided from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-17">17 April 2003</phrase> to enable families of deployed personnel to post airmail letters and packets up to 2kg free of charge. The free packet service was introduced in recognition of the particularly austere conditions faced by personnel in Iraq and of the fact that parts of the OWP were not available to them. Since the entire OWP will be available from April, I advised the House in my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-27">27 February 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-02-27.69"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 69&ndash;70WS</phrase>, that this temporary free postal service would be discontinued with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-08">8 April 2004</phrase>, to bring provisions in Iraq into line with those for other operational theatres.</p>

	<p pid=".1488W.3/1">Work was undertaken between October 2001 and March 2002 to remove radiological contamination from the former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' site in Aldershot following a Land Quality assessment and surveys undertaken by Defence Evaluation and Research Agency Radiological Protection Services. The work was limited to the removal of detectable radium above the regulatory limit.</p>
	<p pid=".1488W.3/2">When contamination was first identified, the local authority, local inhabitants and the media were made aware of the project, and they were kept informed of progress. The site was also fenced and warning signs erected. Tenders were only invited from contractors with an established reputation in radiological decontamination and the work followed current best practice including on the minimisation of waste transferred to licensed landfill sites and to British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., Drigg. I can confirm that the project was completed on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-08">8 March 2002</phrase>.</p>

This will reflect the new business model being rolled-out in Jobcentre Plus including more front-line staff conducting work-focused interviews; a Pension Transformation Programme and reductions in staffing in the Pension Service; the introduction of Child Support reform; and savings in &quot;back office&quot; functions in HR, finance and IT support.</p>
	<p pid=".1494W.2/3">The detail of how reductions will be allocated and profiled between businesses and corporate services will be developed in the normal way through our business planning processes and in discussion with the trade unions.

This will reflect the new business model being rolled-out in Jobcentre Plus including more front-line staff conducting work-focused interviews; a Pension Transformation Programme and reductions in staffing in The Pension Service; the introduction of Child Support reform; and savings in &quot;back office&quot; functions in HR, finance and IT support.</p>

	<p pid=".1499W.5/4">(1) ONE NorthEast (the Regional Development Agency for the North East) in 2000 was asked to lead a Task Group to make a strategic response to the job reductions on Teesside announced by Corus at that time. This group completed its work in 2002. In response to the group's announcements in March and April 2003 on the future of its UK operations and the Teesside steel making facilities, ONE NorthEast reassembled the Task Group to work with the company to help to secure steel manufacturing at Teesside.

	<p pid=".1499W.5/11">(1) The Planning Inspectorate (PINS) plays an essential role in the planning and other land-use related processes in England and Wales, handling planning appeals, development plans and other casework under planning, housing, environment and other relevant legislation. In doing so, it also plays an important part in the achievement of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister PSA targets and the delivery of its sustainable communities programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1499W.5/12">(2) The review demonstrated that PINS has performed well in carrying out its duties, at a time when the volume of planning appeals is increasing.

The Government do not hold information on the extent of new responsibilities in Somerset since 1997. However Somerset has benefited from the 30 per cent. real term increase in overall Government grant for local authorities since 1997, which has enabled local authorities to comply with new responsibilities while continuing to improve services. This grant increase provides funding for the cost pressures and new burdens on local government including those identified with the Local Government Association in the context of the relevant Spending Review.</p>

But there may be circumstances in which an assembly wishes to borrow to raise money for capital expenditure in addition to that provided by central Government.

	<p pid=".1512W.11/1">The average gross fee income of a general dental service (GDS) dentist for national health service work in 2002&ndash;03 was &pound;98,000 in England. Gross fee income of a NHS dentist includes both their personal remuneration as well as business expenses such as staff salaries, laboratory charges and dental consumables.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.11/2">The income distribution is very wide reflecting the large differences in the amount of GDS work done by individual dentists. Principal GDS dentists do not have a standard working week. They are self employed and choose the amount of GDS work they do. Most dentists will have other income either from private dentistry or from other NHS work. Almost one-quarter of GDS dentists had gross fee income of less than &pound;40,000 in 2002&ndash;03; these dentists will have spent only a small proportion of their week doing GDS work.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.11/3">To produce an income estimate for dentists with a reasonable commitment to the GDS, dentists with gross fee income of less than &pound;55,600 may be excluded. This gives average gross fee income for dentists with a reasonable GDS commitment of &pound;137,000 in 2002&ndash;03. The excluded dentists with gross fee income of less than &pound;55,600 will have spent about two days a week or less doing GDS work.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.11/4">Taking into account estimated expenses, average net fee income of a GDS dentist with a reasonable GDS commitment was around &pound;61,000 in 2002&ndash;03. The average GDS net fee income for all dentists including the lowest GDS earners was about &pound;43,000 in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.11/5">In addition dentists receive other payments such as commitment payments which increase average net income by about &pound;2,000 in 2002&ndash;03. So total net income from the GDS averaged about &pound;63,000 for dentists with a reasonable GDS commitment whilst the average net income from the GDS for all dentists including the low GDS earners was about &pound;45,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.11/6">Income of dentists working solely privately is not available. Inland Revenue information for 2001&ndash;02 shows that for GDS dentists' average gross income for all self employed work in Great Britain was 163,000 gross or 71,000 net of expenses. This average covers both full-time and part-time dentists.</p>

	<p pid=".1515W.2/1">A comprehensive range of drug treatment is available to address the differing needs of drug misusers. The general health examination/assessment a prisoner receives on first reception into custody aims to identify past and present drug usage and engagement with community drugs teams. A clinical decision is then reached about the next steps in the management of each individual prisoner. This can be either detoxification or substitute prescribing, as a prelude to a broader based drug treatment programme.</p>

CARAT workers, together with healthcare staff where possible, assess a prisoner's treatment needs and devise a care plan based on level of need and time in custody. CARAT provides case management and lower level interventions and is available in all establishments. Intensive rehabilitation programmes are provided through a range of 60 accredited drug rehabilitation programmes, including four therapeutic communities.</p>

	<p pid=".1516W.0/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 provides a regulatory framework for the provision of treatment involving in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and human embryo research. These activities are licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Inspection of licensed establishments is the cornerstone of the HFEA's work to ensure compliance with Act, the HFEA's code of practice and the conditions upon which the establishment's licence has been granted.</p>
	<p pid=".1516W.0/2">It is not a simple matter of an establishment either &quot;passing or failing&quot; a HFEA inspection. Licensed establishments are expected to operate to set standards and regular inspections take place to ensure these standards are maintained. Where an inspection team considers that an establishment needs to make improvement in a certain area of its operation, a HFEA licence committee that considers the inspection report may decide to attach additional conditions to the licence, with a deadline for implementing improvements if necessary. Failure to comply with the conditions of a licence would be considered by a licence committee and could lead to the revocation of the licence. Were practice to be found of so poor a standard that patients were placed at risk, a licence committee would, as a matter of urgency, consider suspension of the licence and, if necessary, revocation.</p>
	<p pid=".1516W.0/3">The HFEA code of practice sets out standards of conduct and practice that licensed establishments are expected to observe. The new edition of the code, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-01">1 March 2004</phrase>, limits the number of eggs or embryos that can be placed in a woman under age 40, in any one treatment cycle, to a maximum of two. The purpose of this is to limit, as far as possible, multiple pregnancies, which can have a significant medical and social impact on the resulting children and their families, as well as having cost implications for the national health service for the care of the mother and babies. This guidance is supported by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's guideline on fertility treatment which also recommends that ovarian stimulation should not be offered where the female patient has no fertility problems herself to prevent the risk of a multiple pregnancy. Together these measures should reduce the number of multiple births.</p>
	<p pid=".1516W.0/4">There are no plans to require licensed treatment clinics, a number of which operate within the NHS, to reimburse the health service for costs resulting from the care of multiple pregnancies and births.</p>
	<p pid=".1516W.0/5">The Government have not commissioned any research into the long term effects of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, the HFEA has been working with the Medical Research Council to determine what follow-up studies may be needed to assess both the treatments used and any long-term health implications for patients and children born as a result of fertility treatments, including IVF.</p>
	<p pid=".1516W.0/6">When considering applications for embryo research, members of the HFEA are required to reach decisions on the basis of a fair and impartial assessment of the facts. The HFEA only licences embryo research to take place in circumstances specified by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and in accordance with the requirements of the Act. No HFEA members have expressed objection to the principles in the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".1516W.0/7">Compliance with the prohibition in section 3(4) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 on the keeping or using in treatment or research of embryos beyond the 14 day limit is monitored though the HFEA inspection process.</p>
	<p pid=".1516W.0/8">Section 3A of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 prohibits the use in fertility treatment of eggs taken from aborted fetuses. There are no plans to change this. Under the Human Tissue Bill storage of fetal tissue for research purposes would be subject to licensing by the Human Tissue Authority.</p>

Over 300 regional public health professionals, including representatives from health services responsible for Crosby, will learn of the latest obesity data for the region and will collaboratively plan a regional obesity action plan. The workshop will draw together best practice from across the region and in addition to the HDA guidance on obesity, this will provide the basis for local and regional work to tackle obesity in the coming years. The North West HDA is currently working with the North West public health observatory and the regional cancer registries to review the main causes of cancer related deaths across the region.</p>

	<p pid=".1520W.2/1">The need for services to be appropriate and responsive to the communities they serve is laid out in the consultation document, 'Delivering Race Equality: A Framework for Action' (October 2004). To support this, the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) will be developing work to address the cultural capability of organisations, and staff within them, with a clear focus on improving outcomes for those who use services. The importance of this issue is also highlighted in 'Mental Health Services&mdash;Workforce Design and Development: Best Practice Guidance (2003).</p>

In 2002&ndash;03, 120 black and minority ethnic staff networks received seed funding through 'Positively Diverse'. All have agreed to report back on good practices, particularly related to the effect on recruitment and retention of staff from black and minority ethnic heritage. The Positively Diverse programme will also be developed within NIMHE to address these issues within the organisation.</p>

	<p pid=".1521W.9/1">Effective sex and relationships education (SRE) is essential if young people are to make responsible and well informed decisions about their lives. It should teach young people to understand human sexuality and to respect themselves and others. It enables young people to mature, to build up confidence and self-esteem and understand the reasons for delaying sexual activity.</p>
	<p pid=".1521W.9/2">The position with regard to SRE in the Chief Medical Officer's Update is informed by high quality reviews of the international evidence.

Health Development Agency) considered the evidence from all high quality systematic and other reviews and meta-analyses published since 1996. They concluded that 'good' evidence (for example, drawn from high quality reviews) exists for the effectiveness of 'school-based sex education', particularly linked to contraceptive services (measured against knowledge, attitudes, delaying sexual activity and/or reducing pregnancy rates). In contrast, there was no good evidence for the effectiveness of abstinence based education (which focuses only on promoting sexual abstinence).</p>
	<p pid=".1521W.9/3">The Health Development Agency was asked by the Department to undertake a review of the research evidence underpinning the teenage pregnancy strategy. They reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses and literature reviews of what works to prevent teenage pregnancy, which have been published since 1996. To be included reviews needed to meet strict quality criteria. This document was endorsed by an expert reference group and was subject to external peer review.</p>

	<p pid=".1525W.2/1">The estimated total level of revenue funding per pupil (age 3 to 19) for Devon for 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;3,630. Devon's Net Current Expenditure on pre-primary, primary, special and secondary pupils in 1996&ndash;97 was &pound;2,220, as recorded by the authority on its RO1 form. The figures are not directly comparable since the former reflects the total provision made available to the authority whereas the latter reflects what the authority actually spent within schools. 2004&ndash;05 funding figures are based on pupil numbers used in the Education Formula Spending Share calculation. Expenditure figures are calculated using pupil numbers from the annual school census adjusted to the appropriate financial year.</p>

The Department does not promote a particular organisational model since this depends on the needs and circumstances of an area. Our plans for transforming secondary education remain fixed on improving teaching and learning supported by a drive for building strong school leadership teams; specialism and collaboration; reforming the school workforce and developing partnerships beyond the classroom. Whatever the pattern of local school provision, our aim is that all schools should be equipped to personalise learning to ensure high expectations for all, based on a sound knowledge and understanding of each child's learning needs.</p>

	<p pid=".1538W.5/28">All members of the Teachers' Pension Scheme (IPS) pay the same main scheme contribution of 6 per cent. The TPS has options for individual scheme members to pay, on a voluntary basis, a higher contribution in order to purchase additional benefits within the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1538W.5/29">The TPS is a group scheme where the cost of scheme benefits is shared between employers and employees, with the greater part being met by employers. All TPS employers pay the same contribution rate which is currently 13.5 per cent. Between 1972 and 1988, the scheme has provided automatic family benefits for married male teachers and female teachers with a financially dependent husband. In 1988, the scheme was extended to provide automatic family benefits cover for all married teachers.</p>
