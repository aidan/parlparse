	<p pid="b.1341W.11/1">Under the Unfair Contract Terms in Consumer Contacts Regulations 1999, the Office of Fair Trading has a duty to consider any complaint it receives about unfair terms. Using its powers in this legislation, the Office of Fair Trading has carried out an investigation into the fairness of penalty charges for defaults in respect of credit cards and has stated that it believes that credit card default charges had been generally set at a significantly higher level than was considered fair and set a &pound;12 threshold for OFT intervention unless there were exceptional business factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341W.11/2">The OFT is of the view that the broad principles do read across to the retail banking area and has decided to undertake further work on the application of these principles to bank current accounts. This fact-finding exercise is expected to take between three to six months, at which stage the OFT will consider whether a further detailed investigation of the fairness of individual bank default charges is needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1346W.3/1">Biofuel produced from sugar beet can offer a number of environmental benefits, with the precise benefits depending on a range of factors, including the energy used to fertilise and process the crop. The Government will be introducing a renewable transport fuel obligation in April 2008 which will require all transport fuel suppliers to ensure that a set percentage of their total fuel sales is made up of biofuels or some other renewable transport fuel. This will create a major new market for biofuels in the UK, and it will be up to individual transport fuel suppliers to source their biofuels from whatever feedstock they deem most appropriate. From the outset the RTFO will include environmental assurance schemes to monitor the carbon savings achieved and the impact on the wider environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1349W.0/1">In 2002 the Home Office, in partnership with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), introduced the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), designed to improve the quality of crime recording in all forces. NCRS was developed following extensive research undertaken by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), and Her Majesty' Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), as well as research commissioned by the Home Office, which demonstrated wide-ranging inconsistencies in the way that forces were managing crime reports taken from the public. NCRS is based on a number of key principles including the requirement for forces to create incident reports for all incidents and to record these incidents as crimes if, on the balance of probabilities, the circumstances of the incident amount to a crime and if there is no credible evidence to the contrary. NCRS was designed to secure a better quality of service for the victims of crime, particularly around reporting, and has delivered significant improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1349W.0/2">The Home Office, through the Police and Crime Standards Directorate, has provided a strong lead in ensuring that forces are complying with NCRS. A three-year programme of annual external audit has been undertaken in partnership with the Audit Commission across a wide range of crime types, to ensure that forces are recording the crimes reported to them accurately and consistently. In 2003 the independent audit found that only 2 per cent. of forces were achieving a good or excellent level of performance for data quality. Self-improvement by forces, supported by the Home Office, have resulted in an outstanding improvement in performance. The Audit Commission's report Crime Recording 2005, published in June 2006 found that 81 per cent. of forces are now rated as either good or excellent, with no forces scoring poor. This represents a significant step forward in ensuring that the quality of reports taken from the public is robust and capable of supporting the investigation of crime. The Home Office remains committed to maintaining this high level of quality and fully intends to work with forces to build upon the achievements to date.</p>

	<p pid="b.1351W.5/1">People who consider they are the victim of a miscarriage of justice can, if they regard a particular party or body as being responsible, make a complaint in accordance with any established complaints procedure. For example, all police forces have such procedures in place, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ensures that complaints are dealt with effectively. The IPCC sets standards for the way the police handle complaints and, when something has gone wrong, they help them learn lessons and improve the way they work. In terms of redress, people can lodge an appeal against conviction, and if that is unsuccessful they can, in certain circumstances, apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission for a reinvestigation of their conviction and possible referral to the Court of Appeal. Compensation in respect of a miscarriage of justice is payable, on application, if the criteria of section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 are met. It is also open to people to pursue a civil claim in the courts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1351W.8/1">Policy responsibility for the administration of estates rests with the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). Officials in the Home Office liaise with officials in the DCA, as necessary. In appropriate cases, advice on the administration of estates could also be sought from independent counsel. The decision whether a person is eligible for compensation under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 is one for the Secretary of State. However, the assessment of the amount of compensation payable under section 133, and in cases within the discretionary scheme for compensation for miscarriages of justice which operated until <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>, is for the independent assessor. The current assessor is Lord Brennan, QC, who is experienced in the assessment of such claims. Home Office lawyers, the Treasury Solicitor and, as necessary, independent counsel advise Home Office Ministers about alternative dispute resolution.</p>

The most recent assessment is contained in the departmental report 2006, which was published in May. The next assessment will be contained in DFID's autumn performance report, which will be published in December. All DFID projects and programmes over &pound;1 million in value are reviewed annually. Currently, 74 per cent. of those projects are judged to be largely or wholly meeting their objectives. DFID also has a framework for monitoring the effectiveness of our contributions to multilateral agencies, and a programme of independent evaluations of major policies and country programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1359W.8/1">DFID has been one of the major supporters of the humanitarian response to the failure of the short season rains at the end of 2005. Since then we have committed over &pound;56.2 million to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs. Additional DFID contributions have been made via our support to the UN-managed central emergency response fund (CERF) to which the UK is the largest contributor, and through the EC Humanitarian Office (ECHO).</p>
	<p pid="b.1359W.8/2">Prospects are generally quite good for the main 2006 season in east Africa. Crop production is, however, only one of the factors affecting humanitarian needs. While most communities demonstrate impressive resilience in the face of adverse conditions, some remain in need even when crop production is good. There is evidence that in many communities, notably in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea, acute malnutrition remains well above levels that are regarded as sufficient to trigger humanitarian interventions. We will continue to monitor these needs carefully and respond where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1359W.8/3">In Eritrea, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda indications are that the main 2006 crop will be good but there is not yet any quantitative assessment. In Kenya production is estimated to be up 15 per cent. on last year, and the numbers of those estimated to require food aid has been reduced from 3.1 million to 2.4 million. Somalia main season production, normally 80 per cent. of total annual crop production, has been estimated to be 30 percent. down. In general however UN estimates of those in urgent humanitarian need in Somalia are down from 1.8 million to 1.4 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360W.2/1">Over the last five years, DFID has given over &pound;35 million in aid to Angola through its bilateral programme. Statistics are not yet available for DFID's multilateral contributions for 2005, but from 2000-04, the UK's imputed share of multilateral funding to Angola (European Commission, World Bank and United Nations) was &pound;46.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.2/2">DFID has given approximately &pound;16.5 million to the Luanda Urban Poverty Programme (LUPP) since 1999. A recent DFID end-of-project evaluation of LUPP found that it has been a notable success. We anticipate that it will provide lessons for DFID and our partners on urban poverty and operating in post-conflict countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.2/3">In the context of a declining donor presence in Angola, we consider it very important that LUPP and similar programmes are able to have a sustained impact and reduce their reliance on external funding. We are pleased, therefore, that the Government of Angola has been seeking inputs from LUPP for its own work in urban poverty and service delivery. We are also pleased that LUPP partners will continue similar work in municipalities within and outside Luanda with the support of other partners, including the private sector (Chevron, Coca Cola and the diamond company Lazare Kaplan). To complement this, we have invited LUPP partners to submit a further proposal to DFID for our consideration, focused on their governance and influencing work. This should help capitalise on the gains made by LUPP to date, enable stronger links to be forged between the Government of Angola and civil society on urban poverty, and be manageable for DFID in light of our reduced administrative and financial resources for Angola.</p>

This will provide a legal basis for acting in cases where animals have been abandoned for any reason and are likely to suffer as a result.</p>

	<p pid="b.1362W.5/1">There has been no reduction in funding to the National Fallen Stock Company. Government allocated &pound;20 million for the scheme over a three-year period in order to help with initial pump priming. We have recently agreed to extend that funding for a further year, but it was always intended that central Government's contribution would reduce over time. The recent reduction in the percentage contribution to farmers' collection costs reflects this approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.5/2">Last year the Government commissioned an independent review of the National Fallen Stock Scheme to: examine the operation of the scheme to date; make recommendations for retaining and enhancing the membership of the scheme in the future; and identify the transitional steps needed to move towards a post-subsidy situation. The review team delivered its recommendations in April 2006. The Government are now working closely with the National Fallen Stock Company to develop appropriate responses. We aim to publish these later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1363W.2/1">French trawlers can legitimately operate outside the 12-mile limit off the Yorkshire coast. They also have limited access rights in the 6-12 mile area between Flamborough Head and Spurn Point to fish for herring. The activities of these vessels have been closely monitored by the Marine Fisheries Agency (MFA). A French trawler was successfully prosecuted on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-07">7 July</phrase> in Grimsby for fishing illegally inside the 12-mile limit and total fines and costs amounted to &pound;14,750. Since this incident, no further evidence of subsequent incursions within the 12-mile limit have been found.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.2/2">The MFA monitors fishing activity through a programme of inspections on land and at sea, using the Royal Navy's Fishery Protection Squadron. Aerial surveillance, combined with a satellite Vessel Monitoring System, precisely records the position of all vessels over 15m in length, including any French vessels. In recent weeks, approximately 80 per cent. of French vessels operating off the Yorkshire coast have been inspected when their catches are being landed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.2/3">The MFA will be hosting a meeting between members of the UK and French fishing industries in London on <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>. This will help to develop a dialogue about practical ways of minimising interference with each others' fishing operations, and reduce the risk of damage to fishing gear.</p>

An increase in the European Union minimum landing size for brown crabs is one of the possible measures upon which the Department is inviting comments before formulating more specific proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1369W.0/1">The Government's 10-year child care strategy sets out our commitments: to extend the free early education entitlement to 38 weeks a year across all settings; to increase the number of free hours each week from 12.5 to 15; and to offer them more flexibly than at present. Around &pound;3 billion per year is provided to local authorities to fund the free entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369W.0/2">The first of those changes was implemented this year with flexibilities to help those providers not able to extend their provision to 38 weeks. Additional funding of &pound;82 million in each of financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08 has been made available to LAs to support the extension to the free entitlement in private, voluntary and independent settings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369W.0/3">We are testing the extension to 15 hours, delivered more flexibly, in 20 local authorities next year, with a view to a full roll-out by 2010. We will conduct a full assessment of impact in the light of findings from the Pathfinders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369W.0/4">We expect there to continue to be sufficient places available to deliver the free early education entitlement to all three and four-year-olds. The closure rate of child care places has fallen significantly since the introduction of the 10-year strategy, indicating that the Government's policy of refocusing local authority budgets towards supporting sustainability, rather than creating new places, is working.</p>

	<p pid="b.1373W.2/15">The Student Income and Expenditure Survey is a regular study on students' income, expenditure, borrowing and debt. The most recent survey, carried out in 2004/05, shows that for full time, English domiciled dependent students who are in receipt of a higher education grant and hence have a household income of &pound;15,200 or less, the mean level of student support received was &pound;5,925. For students from high income families, who are those deemed to be paying full tuition fees ie whose household income is &pound;31,973 or more, the mean level of student support received was &pound;2,577. Both figures include student loans, the higher education grant, fee remission grants as well as supplementary grants and allowances for students in particular circumstances. They represent the average level of support for one year, not the duration of the course. The next survey is planned for the 2007/08 academic year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1373W.2/16">In addition to the financial support given directly to students, the Higher Education Funding Council for England's allocation of teaching grant, paid to support teaching and learning, equates to an average &pound;3,820 per student in HE.</p>

	<p pid="b.1376W.2/1">There is no classification system in place for obscene material in films. Both films and printed material are covered by the Obscene Publications Act 1957. Ultimately it is a matter for the courts to determine what exactly is covered, but obscene material in films or in newspapers is illegal, and could not appear in a classified film, or in any publication. We have no proposals to introduce a classification scheme for newspapers and magazines; because of the extremely tight production deadlines involved, it would quite simply not be possible to factor in the time required for scrutiny. DCMS officials continue to monitor the situation for any evidence of a significant problem that might require Government intervention.</p>

	<p pid="b.1376W.8/1">The Government are determined that the whole of the UK, including Surrey, can contribute to and benefit from the 2012 Olympic games and Paralympic games.</p>
	<p pid="b.1376W.8/2">In order to maximise the potential benefits arising from the games across the UK, a Nations and Regions Group (NRG), comprising representatives from every nation and region, has been established. The south east is represented by Mary McAnally, Chair of the South East Regional Sports Board and board member of the Regional Development Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1376W.8/3">In April 2006 the South East England Development Agency commissioned Locum Consulting to prepare a preliminary review of the potential impacts arising from the games, Review of the Impacts of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games on the South East Region. A copy of the report is available online at the following web address:</p>

	<p pid="b.1376W.8/5">The report concluded that potential areas of benefit would include business and inward investment opportunities, the hosting of pre-games training camps, the four-year cultural festival prior to the games, volunteering opportunities, and tourism.</p>

	<p pid="b.1377W.2/2">A premises licence or temporary event notice will be needed wherever any &quot;sales by retail&quot; of alcohol take place. Whether an event is held privately or for profit is not relevant. If alcohol was given away for free at a private event such as a wedding it would not need a licence. However, where there is a &quot;cash bar&quot;, or where a ticket is sold for a private event and alcohol is provided as a result of the purchase of the ticket, then a licence would be required. A caterer selling alcohol will need a premises licence for the place where the sales take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377W.2/3">If event organisers are not sure whether an authorisation is required, they should contact their licensing authority (usually the local authority). However, we are currently drawing up guidance to assist people who are organising community based activities and small fundraising events and we will look at including guidance on this kind of scenario.</p>

	<p pid="b.1379W.9/2">It is estimated that the prosecution costs in this case were in the region of &pound;600 (excluding VAT). This figure comprises the advocate's costs. It does not include witness costs, as all witnesses were police witnesses. Neither does this figure include staff or running costs, which are attributable to the operation of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as a whole and cannot be assessed on an individual case basis. I am also unable to comment on police, court and defence costs as these figures are not kept by the CPS (which is solely responsible for the prosecution). Prosecutions are not about cost, but justice.</p>

The Department recognises that bullying, in whatever form and for whatever reason, has no place in schools. The Department has taken proactive steps to tackle bullying through development and publication of guidance. Further, the Education and Libraries (NI) Order 2003, which came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, places a duty on all grant-aided schools to have an anti-bullying policy and to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.</p>

The Forum enables members to share models of best practice, disseminate information, to develop and co-ordinate joint initiatives to ensure that schools and organisations working with children and young people are able to develop appropriate strategies to prevent and deal with bullying behaviours.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381W.6/3">In addition, information about the scale and nature of bullying in Northern Ireland schools is contained in a research report published in October 2002. A research briefing summary is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.deni.gov.uk/rb8_2002.pdf">www.deni.gov.uk/rb8_2002.pdf</a>. The Department has commissioned updated research into bullying, in all its forms, and the results are expected to be ready for publication by mid 2007.</p>

This means that former detainees cannot bring compensation claims now for injuries they may have received while they were detained. In addition, prior to 1948, claims would have been prevented from proceeding by virtue of Crown Immunity. In accordance with MOD's policies for the selection of records for permanent preservation, any MOD files relating to claims between 1948 and the disbandment of the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre would have been destroyed many years ago.</p>

This will give them the opportunity to comment on the proposals and contribute their ideas to the training framework. While it is proposed that Land Registry will provide the training material, it will be the stakeholders' responsibility to ensure that their staff have the appropriate IT skills and equipment to enable them to use the electronic conveyancing system.</p>

	<p pid="b.1394W.6/1">The Government have not commissioned formal research in this area. They do, however, recognise that onerous and burdensome monitoring and reporting requirements do not deliver best value for money, either for funding organisations or recipients of funding. This will be addressed through deregulatory changes to the audit regime for charities in the forthcoming Charities Bill. The Bill will also make a number of other deregulatory changes that will particularly benefit small charities. The Government have looked at detailed ways in which the audit and reporting framework for funding the Third Sector can be more effective through a series of regional pilot schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1394W.6/2">These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1394W.6/3" class="indent">The Combined National Audit pilot by the Government Office for the West Midlands. This has been developed to streamline monitoring, evaluation and audit activity for organisations funded by the public sector The pilot, which is based in Birmingham, is initially testing a joint approach to monitoring and audit for the public funders of community and voluntary sector organisations;</p>
	<p pid="b.1394W.6/4" class="indent">Three regional pilots (in London, the South West and Yorkshire and the Humber and led by the relevant regional Government Offices) to test the concept of 'lead funder' with regional stakeholders. These have been designed to establish the feasibility of one public sector organisation co-ordinating applications and monitoring on behalf of others. The Office of the Third Sector is currently evaluating the results of the pilots.</p>

	<p pid="b.1395W.6/1">The background and suitability of individuals for posts as governors and police chiefs is a matter for President Karzai and the Afghan Government. We do monitor senior appointments and should there be serious concerns about an individual's background or suitability to perform the role, we would consider raising the issue with the Afghan Government. While the appointment of suitable individuals for posts within the administration is important for strengthening good governance, human rights, the rule of law and economic growth in Afghanistan, many of the factors that influence opium poppy cultivation go well beyond the appointment of specific individuals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1396W.2/2">The elections are coming at a critical time for Bangladesh. It is essential that these elections are seen to be free, fair, peaceful and accepted. Recent election evaluation missions by the UN, EU and US have consistently identified important points for the main political parties to address to ensure elections reach the required standards. A fully independent and competent Election Commission has a vital role to play in compiling a complete and accurate voter list. Law enforcement agencies will need to ensure that there is no manipulation of ballots. The electorate should be able to exercise its democratic mandate in a secure and peaceful way. Political parties should be allowed to campaign freely and protest peacefully. The caretaker Government charged with overseeing the elections should ensure no political bias. The election must enjoy the confidence of all international observers. We will continue to take a close interest in preparations for elections, but ultimately it is for the parties and the people of Bangladesh to find solutions and make their elections a success. We encourage the parties to continue talking with each other to this end.</p>

	<p pid="b.1397W.8/1">The media in Haiti is dominated by private radio stations and while levels of state censorship are low, there are problems such as violence against journalists and resulting self-censorship. Press freedom was severely limited in Haiti during former President Aristide's period in office, which ended in February 2004. While some improvements in the situation were reported in the following months, the situation remained fragile under the interim Government that led Haiti until this year's presidential elections. There were a number of reports of violent attacks on journalists by armed gangs, and of impunity for the perpetrators in that interim period. An event of particular concern was the kidnap and murder of journalist Jacques Roche in July 2005. Bringing those responsible for attacks on press freedom to justice is essential and is one of the motivations behind the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti's focus on the reform of the police and judicial system. Encouragingly, the recently elected President, Rene Preval, has also expressed his determination to tackle this and other human rights problems in Haiti.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary told the House on <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase>, North Korea's nuclear test jeopardises regional stability in North East Asia and poses a clear threat to international peace and security, <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 163. It contravenes North Korea's commitments under the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), breaches the North-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, and ignores UN Security Council resolution 1695. It also runs counter to the spirit of the September 2005 Declaration to which North Korea has signed up.</p>
	<p pid="b.1401W.6/2">Both Syria and Iran are parties to the NPT. We expect them to abide by all their obligations in this area. Iran is currently defying calls by the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors and the UN Security Council to suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. These activities would enable it to develop the capability to produce fissile material that could be used in nuclear weapons. North Korea's test and the international reaction to it, in the form of UN Security Council resolution 1718, is only likely to reinforce international determination that Iran should comply with its obligations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1405W.0/1">Ulugbek Khaidarov and Djamshid Karimov are well known to our embassy in Tashkent. The embassy has met both journalists on numerous occasions. They last met Ulugbek Khaidarov on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-21">21 July</phrase> in Jizzakh. Our embassy keeps in close contact with the human rights groups who have been to see Ulugbek Khaidarov in custody. We are very disturbed by the sentencing of Ulugbek Khaidarov and concerned for his welfare. Human rights groups have suggested that the charges against him were trumped up. There has been no official confirmation of Djamshid Karimov's whereabouts from the Uzbek authorities. Press reports suggest that he may be in an asylum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1405W.0/2">We have repeatedly and consistently drawn to the attention of the Uzbek authorities our concerns about the freedom of the press and the harassment of journalists. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) 2006 Annual Human Rights Report published on <phrase class="date" code="">12 October</phrase> and available on the FCO website at: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a> draws attention to the difficulties independent journalists experience in Uzbekistan, including in the Jizzakh region.</p>

	<p pid="b.1406W.9/1">The Department appointed a commercial director in 2002 who has led the development of a corporate commercial strategy that applies to the Department for Work and Pensions, its agencies and associated non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). The strategy sets out the vision, values, objectives and targets for the procurement function and has a general principle of continuous improvement. With board level agreement the strategy was strengthened in 2004 to respond to the challenges for departmental procurement under the efficiency review and again in 2006 to support the Department in delivering its services within budget allocations under the comprehensive spending review 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1406W.9/2">Under the commercial strategy, the Department has delivered significant improvements to its procurement capability. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1406W.9/3" class="indent">(i) The first overall reduction in DWP commercial spend&mdash;in 2005-06 spend with external suppliers reduced by 3 per cent. to &pound;4.161 billion;</p>

The improvement derives from significant renegotiations of our IS/IT commercial relationships with EDS and BT and from improved procurement and contract management performance across other supply categories;</p>
	<p pid="b.1406W.9/5" class="indent">(iii) Board level engagement with our top suppliers to manage the relationship at a strategic level, identify ways to reduce mutual costs and develop a shared vision of future goals and objectives;</p>
	<p pid="b.1406W.9/6" class="indent">(iv) Improved professionalism&mdash;the proportion of professionally qualified staff in the Department's 634 key specialist procurement posts exceeded the 75 per cent. target by December 2005;</p>
	<p pid="b.1406W.9/7" class="indent">(v) Completion in September 2006 of a procurement modernisation programme that introduced category management, supply chain management and integration, benefits realisation and improved commercial intelligence. It also established better links between procurement and business and finance staff to identify ways to optimise business demand and specifications for goods and services. A new operating model, which will result in a 22 per cent. smaller and more highly skilled procurement organisation, will be in place by April 2007;</p>
	<p pid="b.1406W.9/8" class="indent">(vi) The launch in December 2005 of a DWP Sustainable Procurement Strategy with related targets to ensure the Department uses its purchasing power and market influence to further economic, social and environmental policy initiatives; and</p>

	<p pid="b.1410W.2/2">The in-work credit (IWC) pilots are running in 22 Jobcentre Plus districts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.2/3">Eligible participants are paid &pound;40 a week over and above their total income when they start work for 16 hours or more a week. The payment is tax-free and is paid for a maximum of 52 weeks. It is payable on top of any other in-work benefits which eligible parents may be entitled to, for example working tax credit and housing benefit. The IWC is primarily paid to lone parents but in April 2005, it was extended to other eligible parents in four London Jobcentre Plus districts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.2/4">We have commissioned a full evaluation of the IWC to assess the impact of the pilot on eligible parents, including movements off benefit and into work. Initial findings from the quantitative evaluation are expected to be published in February 2007. In addition, a qualitative evaluation has explored the impact of the pilots on the attitudes, motivations and actions of participants, and will also examine the effectiveness of delivery. We expect to publish this report in spring 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.2/5">In November 2005, the latest date for which information is available, more than 11,000 eligible parents were in receipt of the in-work credit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1416W.5/1">As a result of the measures we have introduced since 1997, we will be spending &pound;10.5 billion more on pensioners this year than would otherwise have been the case. Our policies target help on the poorest pensioners in particular, with over &pound;5 billion of the additional money going to the poorest third of pensioners. Between 1996-97 and 2004-05, the number of pensioners living in relative low income, fell from 2.8 million to 1.8 million, and a pensioner in Britain today is no more likely to be in poverty than anyone else.</p>
	<p pid="b.1416W.5/2">In total, in 2006-07 we plan to spend &pound;78.8 billion in cash benefits for pensioners. Additional help is provided through benefits in kind such as free prescriptions, eye tests, bus travel and television licences, and help with home insulation. Around &pound;14 billion will be spent on benefits targeted on low-income pensioners: pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit. This ensures that no single pensioner need live on less than &pound;114.05 a week, and no couple on less than &pound;174.05 a week.</p>

	<p pid="b.1416W.8/1">To ensure that all pensioner households are able to keep their homes warm throughout the winter period we introduced winter fuel payments in 1997. We have increased these from &pound;20 in 1997-08 to the current value of &pound;200 for people between 60 and 79 years of age, and &pound;300 for the over 80s.</p>
	<p pid="b.1416W.8/2">The Government are committed to combating poverty among today's pensioners, for example by uprating the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit in line with earnings growth.

	<p pid="b.1416W.8/3">Between 1996-07 and 2004-05 (the latest year for which pensioner income is available) incomes increased by 25 per cent. in real terms, compared with a 15 per cent. real terms increase in fuel prices and water bills between 1996-07 and 2006. It is important to note that while pensioner incomes tend to increase on a linear basis, with 4 per cent. real growth between 2003-04 and 2004-05 building on the growth in earlier years, utility prices tend to fluctuate. According to Office for National Statistics data, fuel prices and water bills fell by 9 per cent. in real terms between 1996 and 2003, before increasing by 27 per cent. between 2003 and 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1424W.12/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1424W.12/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-19">19 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1424W.12/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your question concerning the number of eligible voters missing from the Electoral Register of each Parliamentary Constituency in Nottinghamshire. (94488)</p>
	<p pid="b.1424W.12/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics does not provide estimates of the number of eligible voters missing from the Electoral Register. However, we can compare the estimated usual resident population aged 18 and over from the last Census with estimates of those who were registered to vote at the time. By dividing the latter by the former, a &quot;ratio&quot; can be derived and this is shown in the attached table for the various parliamentary constituencies in Nottinghamshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.1424W.12/5" class="indent">These are the closest available figures to those you have requested. The resulting data are not reliable estimates of registration rates and should be treated with appropriate caution. At best, they might help to identify where there might be issues with registration rates but you should also take account of local factors, for example the presence of a prison in an area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1424W.12/6" class="indent">There are various limitations with this type of comparison. The UK parliamentary electorate excludes citizens of countries other than the UK, Ireland, and the Commonwealth and includes UK citizens resident abroad. In addition not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (prisoners, members of the House of Lords, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Also there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. The latter is the main reason why in some constituencies the population aged 18 and over will be less than those registered to vote. These factors may have a different impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1424W.12/7" class="indent">Population data by Parliamentary Constituency are not available on an annual basis, consequently these tables have been prepared from 2001 Census data. In order to give an estimate of the number of electors on Census day (<phrase class="date" code="2001-04-29">29 April 2001</phrase>), a weighted average is taken of the <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-01">1 February 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-01">1 December 2001</phrase> electoral data. The census database was subsequently revised and more details on these revisions can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/lastudies">www.statistics.gov.uk/lastudies</a>.</p>

It is intended that the value for money programme for local government in CSR07 will build on the value for money programme under way in the current spending review period, and secure greater cashable efficiencies to meet new priorities.</p>

Specialised services are high-cost, low-volume interventions and treatments that are commissioned by groups of primary care trusts, and it is therefore not appropriate to devolve this commissioning to practice level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1434W.0/105">It is not possible to say how many women have been screened using LBC techniques in each strategic health authority. Statistics on the programme are collected annually, and those programmes who converted to LBC would have done so at different times during the years of roll-out. As 72 per cent. of local screening programmes will have implemented LBC by <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, we would expect nearly three million women to benefit from their cervical screening samples being processed with LBC techniques in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1434W.0/106">LBC techniques began being introduced into the programme following a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal published in October 2003. NICE is currently considering whether to review the appraisal based on any new evidence, which would include evidence from the national roll-out. Strict quality assurance and data collection are operated within the programme, and we would expect to start seeing an effect of LBC on the rate of inadequate samples when the statistics for 2005-06 are published in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1434W.0/107">Women are only offered human papilloma virus (HPV) testing in the NHS as part of clinical trials. As part of the pilot of LBC, which took place between 2001 and 2002, we also piloted the use of HPV testing as triage for women with mild or borderline test results. Following the receipt of the independent evaluation report of the HPV arm of the pilot in 2004, the advisory committee on cervical screening set up a dedicated working group to advise on how best to introduce HPV testing into the NHS cervical screening programme. A protocol for HPV testing sentinel sites has been developed, and the sites are expected to begin operations in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1434W.0/108">There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of HPV testing as a primary screening tool. In addition to the pilot, the Government are funding two large studies looking into HPV testing as a primary screening tool:</p>
	<p pid="b.1434W.0/109" class="indent">trial of management of borderline and other low grade abnormal smears, funded by the Medical Research Council. This study was set up to determine the most appropriate way to deal with HPV positive results and associated psychological issues. The study is due to report in 2007; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1434W.0/110" class="indent">a randomised trial of HPV testing in primary cervical screening, funded by the Department's health technology assessment programme. This trial is investigating the use of HPV testing as a primary screening tool. The study is due to report in mid-2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1442W.2/1">I made the observation, after having heard this issue anecdotally from both health professionals and young women, that some young pregnant women may take the message that smoking leads to low birth weight babies and that low birth weight or smaller babies may make childbirth less painful. It is important that we understand what stops young women making healthy choices and tailor our messages accordingly. In this case childbirth is no less painful if your baby is low weight.</p>
	<p pid="b.1442W.2/2">The Department's advice remains that women should not smoke during pregnancy. Women who smoke are less likely to carry their babies to full term and there is a 26 per cent. increased risk that they will miscarry or experience a stillbirth. Babies of smoking mothers are an average 200 g lighter at birth.</p>
