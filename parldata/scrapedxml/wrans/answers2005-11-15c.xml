	<p pid="c.1051W.0/1">The last H5 avian influenza virus to be isolated in England was the H5N1 virus responsible for the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in turkeys in Norfolk in 1991&ndash;92. This virus is genetically distinguishable from the H5N1 viruses currently causing the problems in East Asia and the virus isolated recently in quarantine birds in Essex.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.0/2">The genetic material (RNA) of influenza viruses is segmented into eight distinct genes, which code for 10 proteins. Because this viral RNA is segmented, genetic reassortment can occur in mixed infections with different strains of influenza A viruses. This means that when two viruses infect the same cell, progeny viruses may inherit sets of eight RNA segments made up of combinations of segments from either of the parent viruses. The epidemiological significance of this for humans is that in theory if, for example, an H5N1 virus and a human influenza virus infect the same animal and same cell a reassortant virus could emerge that possessed the virus genes that enabled it to be transmissible in humans, but with the H5 haemagglutinin gene, which would mean that humans had no immunity to this virus. This mechanism is thought to have been the way the H2N2 and the H3N2 pandemic viruses emerged in 1957 and 1968 respectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.1051W.3/1">Promotion of beef exports is undertaken primarily by the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC), their devolved bodies such as Hybu Cig Cymru in Wales and the beef industry itself. The Government recently fully supported their efforts to promote British beef at the International Food Fair, ANUGA, in Cologne in early October. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-14">14 October</phrase>, Lord Bach held a high level meeting with the industry, agreeing to work together on opening up export markets for beef once the export ban is lifted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.3/2">The European Commission has acknowledged that the essential preconditions for lifting the EU export ban have been fulfilled. We are now awaiting proposals from the Commission for legislation to lift the ban. Such proposals would have to be submitted to EU member states to consider in the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH). If the member states were to vote in favour of the proposals in SCoFCAH, they would be translated into all EU languages and presented to the College of Commissioners for formal adoption. We hope that these processes will be completed in early 2006. but this is a best case scenario. We will continue to argue for an early resumption of beef exports.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.3/3">The MLC estimate that UK beef exports could be about 40,000 tonnes, divided equally between prime beef and cow beef, in the first year after the ban is lifted.</p>

	<p pid="c.1053W.8/2">Previous discussions with the European Commission and other member states, following pressure from the UK, resulted in the adoption in April 2004 of Community measures to address cetacean by-catch (Council Regulation EC No. 812/2004). These measures include the mandatory use of observers to widen knowledge of where by-catch occurs and the use of pingers to deter porpoises from gill nets. A review of the effectiveness of these measures is due to take place in 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.8/3">More recently, pressure from the UK in relation to common dolphin by-catch in the Western Channel secured agreement at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of Ministers' meeting in March 2005 to an early review by the International Council for the Exploration of Sea (ICES) of the interaction of fisheries and common dolphins in the North East Atlantic. Following publication of this ICES advice, Commissioner Borg has written in September 2005 to all member states stressing the urgent need to provide timely reports to the Commission on the results from the observer schemes required under the council regulation to ensure that any future by-catch reduction measures can be targeted effectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.1056W.5/1">Under the Montreal Protocol, which phases out chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), CFC's can continue to be used in pharmaceutical metered dose inhalers (MDI's), until the party concerned declares that use to be non-essential. The EU (and corresponding UK) Transition Strategy for the Phase Out of CFC's in MDI's sets out how the transition away from CFC's in MDI's will be managed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1056W.5/2">The Transition Strategy states that when an adequate number and range of CFC-free metered dose inhalers (MDIs) to meet patient needs are available for an individual drug, the use of CFCs will no longer be considered essential for that drug product. To date, the UK has declared salbutamol as non essential.</p>
	<p pid="c.1056W.5/3">The variations between EU member states, shown in Annex 1 of Commission Decision 2005/626/EC, are partly dependent on clinical practice which varies from country to country. The majority of products listed in Annex 1 are either not marketed in the UK or are not available as MDI's, hence the UK has had no need to declare the use of CFCs as non-essential.</p>
	<p pid="c.1056W.5/4">The European Commission, with member states, is currently reviewing the scope for further declarations of non-essentiality in relation to a number of other drug products used in inhalers. Following this review the UK may be in a position to declare further drug products non-essential.</p>

	<p pid="c.1057W.5/1">Fishing close seasons in England and Wales are specified in the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act, 1975, and byelaws made under that Act. The rationale for the statutory close seasons is to protect fisheries from the impacts of angling during the spawning season. Coarse fish are returned alive to fisheries and therefore a close season for these species may no longer be justified on all waters.</p>

	<p pid="c.1057W.8/2">The Environment Agency is responsible for regulating fishing methods, under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act, 1975. Individual fishery owners and the police are responsible for enforcing the Theft Act, 1968.</p>

	<p pid="c.1058W.2/1">Defra has made no estimate of the cost of actual damage due to flooding in 2004&ndash;05. Our latest National Assessment of Defence Needs and Costs study estimated average annual damages from flooding at some &pound;1 billion per year. However it must be emphasised that this is an expected average over the very long term derived by combining the potential damages from a wide range of possible events from the rare and extreme to the very frequent with their probabilities to provide an estimate of the annual expected average. It is not a useful estimate for any specific year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.2/2">Climate change has the potential to increase probability of flooding due to increases in sea level and potential changes in the frequency, duration and intensity of storms. Increased economic wealth will also tend to increase the value of losses. In 2004 the Foresight 'Future Flooding' report, sponsored by the Office of Science and Technology, estimated that, taking these and other factors into account, annual average flood damages could increase by between two and 20 times by the end of the century. The actual increases will be highly dependent on actual patterns of growth, development and future flood management activity.</p>

	<p pid="c.1060W.2/1">Currently no such research has been commissioned by this Government. As yet, there have been no formal intergovernmental discussions of the design of a future commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. The UK will chair the EU at the UN climate change conference at the end of this year at which the first formal discussion will take place when the parties of the Kyoto Protocol meet for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/2">The EU is also looking forward to using this discussion to initiate a process among all parties to explore how to implement better the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Following this conference, next year we plan to start discussions to prepare the UK position on further action.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.2/3">The UK Government and the EU want to build on the Kyoto Protocol and its key elements such as targets and timetables, monitoring and reporting, compliance and the flexibility mechanisms for the period after 2012. At the March meeting of the European Council of Ministers, the European Heads of Government stated that the EU looks forward to exploring with other parties strategies for achieving necessary emission reductions and believes that in this context, reduction pathways for the group of developed countries in the order of 15 to 30 per cent. by 2020, compared to the baseline envisaged in the Kyoto Protocol and in the spirit of the conclusions of the Environment Council should be considered.</p>

	<p pid="c.1060W.5/1">The ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that avoids dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system&quot;. As yet there is no consensus on what constitutes this level. It is, however, accepted that dangerous levels will be different for different impact sectors and for different regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.5/2">The Environment Council stated in 1996 that adaptation to a global temperature rise of 2C would be possible, but that the impacts associated with a temperature rise greater than 2&deg;C are likely to be severe enough to be classified as 'dangerous'. A 2&deg;C temperature rise was the starting point for the analysis carried out in preparation for the Energy White Paper, underpinning the conclusion by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution Secretariat that we should put the UK on a path to reducing carbon emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="c.1060W.5/3">Our scientific understanding of the links between atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration, the scale of emissions reductions required and the risk of extreme climate change is rapidly developing, but still uncertain. The issue of stabilisation levels of atmospheric greenhouse concentrations was addressed at the Defra-funded international science conference, Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, held in Exeter in February this year. The report of the steering committee concluded that:</p>

	<p pid="c.1061W.5/1">The Government have used its presidencies of the G8 and EU to really focus on the issue of illegal logging and to promote the FLEGT Action Plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/2">The Government see the bilateral approach of the Forests Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) dossier as an important way to develop experience in tacking illegal logging and to build the consensus that could lead to a multilateral agreement. The dossier, recently agreed under the UK presidency of the EU, allows for Partnership Agreements which will involve the establishment of a licensing scheme to ensure that only legal timber from Partner Countries is allowed into the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/3">Illegal logging was also one of two topics of discussion at the first ever G8 Environment and Development Ministerial meeting in Derbyshire in March 2005. Ministers'; agreed to a range of actions and officials will meet in 2006 to review progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/4">The UK has also led in promoting and supporting Regional Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) processes in order to intensify national efforts and strengthen bilateral, regional and multi-lateral collaboration to address violations of forest law and forest crime. The UK has, from late 2004, been working with Russia to develop the European and North Asia FLEG regional process. The first Ministerial meeting is taking place in St Petersburg this month, November 2005. Other regional processes which the UK supports are the East Asian and African FLEG processes, the Asia Forest Partnership and the Congo Basin Forest Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/5">The UK Government also recognise that Government purchasing policies can also send a strong signal to the market and timber suppliers. Since 2000 the UK Government have committed its central departments to seek to procure products made from timber that has been legally harvested and grown in a sustainably managed forest or plantation. The UK timber trade tells us that this policy has been the single most important driver of change of behaviour in the UK private sector. As a leader in this field, this year the Government committed to extend guidance on legal and sustainable timber procurement to the wider public sector, and to share our knowledge on procurement with the G8 and other countries.</p>

The agreement also encourages producers of direct mail to avoid using materials that contaminate the recycling process. In addition, the agreement aims to improve the targeting of direct mail, thereby reducing the volume of direct mail that is distributed in the first place by encouraging the use of suppression files, which are lists of people who have opted out of receiving direct mail.</p>

Health and Safety Executive staff investigate complaints involving ill health arising as a result of a work activity. Once an investigation is complete details of investigated cases are sent for examination by the HSE's Pesticides Incident Appraisal Panel (PIAP). PIAP reviews all the reports and publishes its conclusions in an annual report which is reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. Following recommendations in the recent report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) on Crop Spraying and the Health of Residents and Bystanders&quot; the Government will be reviewing these arrangements.</p>

They considered a scheme whereby an obligation would be held by the suppliers of the fossil fuels from which heat is produced, and renewable heat certificates would be granted to heat producers and users who could demonstrate that they had substituted renewable heat for fossil-fired heat. However, they judged that such a scheme would be complex since most heat is not supplied by commercial companies but is produced by domestic and industrial/commercial end-users by using purchased fuel in boilers which they themselves own. They reported that a fundamental flaw in the proposal was that the obligation would rest with a supplier who had no control over the many, varied and often small users and producers of heat. In view of the complexities, they also noted that it would take considerable time to draw up a suitable scheme. They concluded that quicker progress would be achieved by offering capital grants to aid all biomass heating boilers and the heat element of combined heat and power (CHP) biomass-fuelled plants.</p>

	<p pid="c.1071W.2/2">The State Veterinary Service was a very different organisation in 1997 and so any comparison with today would not be comparing like with like.

In order to better manage and co-ordinate operations, both in normal circumstances and during a disease emergency, the agency has implemented a new structure during this year. The agency's corporate management team includes an operations director, strategic planning director and professional services director, who are all senior veterinary staff. The professional services director is also the Chief Veterinary Officer for Scotland. The head of operations in Scotland is also a senior vet. A new role of lead divisional veterinary manager (LDVM) has also been created. The organisation has seven LDVMs and a further 17 divisional veterinary managers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1072W.2/1">Low winter rainfall may cause supply difficulties for some water companies in 2006.

	<p pid="c.1072W.2/2">It is for water companies to plan the investment necessary to deliver their services, including the necessary financial provision, and it is for Ofwat, in the light of companies' plans, to ensure that companies carry out and are able to finance their functions. In its recent periodic review Ofwat set water price limits for 2005 to 2010 in the light of water companies' business plans for that period.</p>

	<p pid="c.1075W.3/1">DFID operates an annual review of budgets that includes deciding how much money to allocate to each developing country. The process involves dialogue at all levels, starting with country offices and culminating in approval by DFID's management board and Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.3/2">To help inform the discussion, DFID uses a financial model to generate suggested allocations for bilateral country programmes. The model takes account of both the extent of a country's poverty and the likely effectiveness of aid in reducing its poverty. Vulnerability to economic shocks and the amount of aid which countries are likely to receive from other donors are also taken into account. In addition to the model's results, the regional divisions responsible for DFID's bilateral country programmes analyse a range of factors when considering allocations. These include the effectiveness of multilateral channels, conflict and reconstruction needs, inequality and social exclusion, our historical engagement and the political environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1075W.3/3">The central process to allocate resources between developing countries and regions does not give specific consideration to levels of public subsidy for agriculture. However, at country level, DFID allocates its resources to support national strategies for growth and poverty reduction. DFID country programmes work with national governments to identify the most effective way for DFID to support these strategies. Discussions with governments on the allocation of DFID resources at country level are likely to take into account the broad range of policies and programmes set out in national strategies.</p>

	<p pid="c.1076W.2/1">DFID has not held any discussions with the World Bank on water privatisation in Bolivia as DFID does not work and has not worked in the water or sanitation sector in Bolivia.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.2/2">DFID supports a World Bank managed facility called the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA). GPOBA supports the design and piloting of performance based approaches for targeting public funding to subsidise the delivery of basic services to poor people. In early 2005, officials discussed with the managers of GPOBA, the possible involvement of GPOBA in piloting subsidies for water connections in El Alto, but this has not happened.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.2/3">The UK Government's position on water privatisation in general is made clear in our policy on conditionality, available on the DFID website at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/conditionality.pdf">www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/conditionality.pdf</a>. The Government do not make its aid conditional on policy decisions by partner governments, or attempt to impose policy choices on them, including in the area of water privatisation. Where appropriate, DFID responds to requests from developing country governments for assistance to help improve the efficiency of water utilities. If a country has held an extensive public consultation exercise and has decided that it wishes to involve the private sector in the management of water, then DFID can provide them with the information to help them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.2/4">The UK Government also uses its position on the Board of the World Bank and IMF to influence their approach to conditionality in general, and conditionality in sensitive areas such as water privatisation in particular. The UK led calls for a review of the Bank's policy and practice on conditionality, and this has just concluded. New best practice principles have been endorsed, which accord well with the UK approach, and we will be monitoring their implementation carefully.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.2/5">The World Bank systematically considers the impacts of its operations on poor people in recipient countries. The Bank's mission is to reduce global poverty and all its operations are designed to improve the lives of the poor. The Bank also uses a range of tools to assess the likely impact of its operations on specific groups of poor people. When the Bank lends for specific projects, it uses safeguard policies which are designed to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and their environment in the development process. When the Bank lends to support countries' policy and institutional reforms, it conducts Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) which assesses the likely impact of policy reforms on different groups, with a particular focus on the poor and vulnerable. Both safeguard policies and PSIA are used before projects are discussed at the Bank Board, and often result in changes to project design. More information on both can be found on the World Bank website, at <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/safeguards">www.worldbank.org/safeguards</a> and <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/psia">www.worldbank.org/psia</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1078W.6/1">Female circumcision or 'Female Genital Mutilation' (FGM) is a fundamental violation of the human rights of women and girls and is explicitly denounced in a number of human rights treaties and conventions.

As well as this, in 2004&ndash;05 DFID provided annual core funding to support the work of multilateral organisations, including &pound;19 million for UNICEF, &pound;20 million for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), &pound;12.5 million for the World Health Organisation (WHO) and &pound;3 million to the United Nations Women's Fund (UNIFEM), which all advocate and support programmes to combat FGM globally, not only because of its harmful impact on the reproductive and sexual health of women, but also because it is a violation of woman and girls fundamental human rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.1078W.6/4">DFID provides indirect funding through social development and health programmes that support rights-based work at country level. DFID is also supporting the forthcoming United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) African conference in Senegal, which will bring together parliamentarians, religious and traditional leaders, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and former practitioners to plan actions to help eradicate the practice of FGM.</p>

	<p pid="c.1080W.2/1">DFID recognises that fruit production and horticulture more generally, is playing an increasingly important role in driving agricultural growth and providing sustainable livelihoods for millions of poor households. In India for example, horticulture already accounts for over half the value of agricultural output.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/2">However, increasingly stringent product standards set by the retail trade can create particular difficulties for small producers seeking access to valuable European markets. To address this DFID has recently begun a three year programme working with retailers, importers, standard-setting bodies (in particular the Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group&mdash;Good Agricultural Practices (EUREPGAP) and producers aimed at ensuring that standards, such as requirements to produce fruit of a specified shape and size, do not discriminate against small-scale and developing country producers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/3">DFID is also active in a number of developing countries where we fund projects to support suppliers to meet supermarket standards. For example in Kenya, in the last two years, DFID has given approximately &pound;582,000 in support for export horticultural development. An additional &pound;290,000 will be spent by June 2006. Much of these funds are spent assisting smallholders to cope with the process and cost of compliance with EUREPGAP standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/4">Buyers are extremely concerned about the use of pesticides with potentially harmful effects and European regulations and market health and safety requirements are increasingly difficult for developing country exporters to meet. At the request of African, Caribbean and Pacific country suppliers, the European Commission has put in place the Pesticides Initiative Programme; it aims to provide concrete responses to fruit and vegetable producers and exporters adaptation difficulties and assists suppliers to conform to the expectation of European buyers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/5">DFID supports the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) through a network of 15 International Research Centres and Global Programmes. Research is conducted on all major world crops of relevance to the poor with particular emphasis on crop improvement through genetic enhancement to withstand stresses of various kinds including attack by pests and diseases. New pest and disease resistant crop varieties significantly reduce the need for applications of harmful pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/6">DFID's bilateral Crop Protection Programme has developed successful technical solutions known as Integrated Pest Management whereby crop husbandry and natural resource management methods are systematically combined to reduce or eliminate the incidence of pests thereby reducing the need for pesticide applications.</p>

	<p pid="c.1081W.2/1">The World Bank's latest estimate for Somalia's external debt is just under $3 billion, on which they have not been able to make repayments for many years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1081W.2/2">The G8 proposal discussed in July, will cancel 100 per cent. of the debts owed by heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to the International Monetary Fund and the concessional funds of the World Bank and the African Development Bank. To qualify, countries must first complete the HIPC Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="c.1081W.2/3">In order to benefit from the exceptional debt relief given under the HIPC Initiative, Somalia would need to establish a minimum track record of macro-economic stability, demonstrate a commitment to poverty reduction by developing an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and clear its arrears. The fundamental priority for the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia now is to establish political stability, with the support of the international community, and by doing so begin to shore up national and international credibility. Once political reconciliation is under way, donors will clearly need to focus on what support needs to be provided to help Somalia address its unsustainable debt and arrears. The UK will remain actively involved in helping to find solutions to Somalia's problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.1082W.2/1">Since 1997 up to the end of financial year 2004&ndash;05 (the latest period for which figures are available), the UK provided &pound;137,000 of assistance to Somalia that is categorised as financial aid.

	<p pid="c.1082W.5/1">In 2004&ndash;05, DFID provided more than &pound;83 million in support to rural livelihoods in low income countries.

	<p pid="c.1082W.5/2">More generally, DFID is working to support the development of a vibrant private sector in developing countries. Much of our work focuses on support for establishing a sound business environment to enable domestic investors and entrepreneurs to operate productively.</p>

	<p pid="c.1083W.2/1">DFID's policy on conditionality sets out how we intend to strike a balance between ensuring aid is used effectively for poverty reduction, strengthening countries leadership of their own development and making aid more predictable. It makes clear that we will use conditions to ensure aid is used effectively, but we will minimise any negative effects of these conditions on partner Government leadership and aid predictability. In particular we will not use conditionality to impose specific policy choices on partner Governments, including in sensitive areas such as privatisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.2/2">The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are also both committed to the principle of country ownership of reforms. The World Bank's 2005 review of its use of conditionality resulted in five good practice principles for conditionality, the first of which is country ownership. At the annual meetings of the World Bank in September 2005, we successfully pressed for agreement that the Bank would report back next year on the implementation of these principles.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.2/3">The Paris Declaration re-affirmed donors' views that countries must lead their own development process. DFID strongly supports this approach. Countries should lead their own policy making processes and are free to decide to implement market-based reforms in the water sector. In cases where Governments are committed to reform of the water sector and request our support, we would be ready to consider assistance to ensure policy options are thoroughly considered, and the appropriate regulation is put in place so that affordable services are delivered to poor people. In 2004, of the &pound;93 million DFID spent in country programmes on urban, rural and humanitarian water supply and sanitation services, 95 per cent. was spent through Governments, not for profit or humanitarian agencies. Rather than focussing on who delivers these services we concentrate on ensuring that services are delivered to the poor and that Governments can make informed choices between approaches.</p>

	<p pid="c.1086W.2/1">The Army has a policy of zero tolerance as far as bullying is concerned and any allegations made are thoroughly investigated, with disciplinary action taken where appropriate. All commanders are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect others from the differing forms of harassment, physical and mental intimidation and discrimination. This is reinforced throughout all military training.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.2/2">There is no evidence to suggest a culture of bullying at Bicester but, like all Army personnel, members of 23 Pioneer Regiment Royal Logistic Corps have access to a wide-ranging welfare support network, which includes a confidential help line. Welfare support is publicised widely throughout the Army.</p>

We have no reason to question German judgment on this. Access by Israel as a NATO partner, to the NATO Maintenance and Service Agency (NAMSA) is currently under discussion. No agreement has yet been reached. The UK would only agree to such an arrangement if it was clearly understood that requests from Israel would be carefully examined on a case-by-case basis, were consistent with the UK's consolidated criteria on export licensing and approved by the NATO Atlantic Council.</p>

During the transition period, we retain the option to deploy Harrier GR9 with the Future Carrier. The ISDs for the Future Carriers will not be set until the main investment decision is taken and therefore it is too soon to determine whether there will be any case for extending the Invincible class carriers in service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1089W.8/2">There is a clear relationship over the longer term (though a less predictable one in the shorter term) between changes in the oil price and the costs of fuels used in Defence, with rises in the oil price translating into increased unit costs for fuel for the Department. Fuel price rises have not, however, had an adverse impact on the delivery of Defence outputs, as the Department actively seeks to forecast and plan for movements in fuel prices, in both its forward financial planning and in-year financial management.</p>
	<p pid="c.1089W.8/3">The Department has not requested additional funding from the Treasury to alleviate the consequences for Defence of oil price rises. In line with established practice, the net additional costs of operations, including the costs of fuel consumed on operations continue to be met from the Treasury Reserve. The resource costs of the consumption of fuel, oil and lubricants by the Department in support of operational and non-operational activity in each of the last four years are shown in the table. As the Department's fuel consumption ranges across a number of joint organisations as well as Service budget areas, breaking these figures down by Service could be provided only at a disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1090W.8/1">The RAF Gibraltar air traffic control requirement was competitively tendered as part of the re-let of the airfield support services requirement at RAF Gibraltar. The tender exercise was undertaken in accordance with MOD guidelines with an invitation to tender issued in February 2005 and an award of contract in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.8/2">The requirement was initially advertised for expressions of interest in the MOD Contracts Bulletin in June 2004. A total of six companies expressed an interest in the requirement and were issued with invitations to tender. Three companies responded and entered bids which were evaluated under technical and commercial criteria published in the tender documentation, with the award of contract to the National Air Traffic Services as the highest scoring bidder offering the best overall value for money.</p>

The RMP HIT are currently examining their information holdings in order to establish and inform the PSNI whether they hold information relevant to these cases. The RMP HIT remit is to retrieve relevant material regarding specific cases in response to requests for information from the PSNI.</p>

The UK labour market is performing well, both by international standards and on a historical comparison, with high levels of employment and low levels of unemployment. In addition, the Scottish labour market has hit new record levels, with employment at its highest since quarterly records began. We will continue to work in partnership with the Scottish Executive to deliver prosperity for all the people of Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="c.1100W.8/1">There are different rates prescribed for the many separate schemes across a variety of services provided within the Criminal Defence Service (CDS). The changes to the prescribed basic legal aid rates for work in the criminal courts are set in the following table.</p>

			<tr pid="c.1100W.8/14"> <td></td> <td>Criminal higher courts&mdash;Remuneration changes in October with the introduction of a common graduated fee scheme by the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Crown Prosecution Service for advocates in all trials lasting up to 25 days in the Crown court. The effect of those changes was to raise total remuneration for 1 to 10 day cases by about &pound;3.2 million and to leave the level of remuneration for 11 to 25 day cases broadly the same. These changes also included changes in the graduated fee scheme to allow for some payment for conferences and the attendance fee for plea and directions hearings was increased from &pound;75 to &pound;100.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1100W.8/15"> <td>2002</td> <td>Contract mileage rate under the General Criminal Contract increased to 45p.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1100W.8/16"> <td></td> <td>Nil remuneration uprating.</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="c.1100W.8/20"> <td></td> <td>Criminal courts&mdash;Remuneration changes in August to the Very High Cost Criminal Case contract rates and Criminal Graduated Fee schemes. The effects of the changes were: to reduce bureaucracy for the Bar by taking some 50 per cent. of VHCC cases into an extended graduated fee scheme, which now covers cases up to 40 days; raising the graduated fee rates for 11 to 25 day cases to the level which was expected in 2001 when the scheme was introduced and carrying those rates through to the 40 day extension; all Category 4 VHCC cases will be paid at the same rates as Category 3 VHCC cases; substantially increasing refreshers so that the same rate is now paid for Category 2 and 3 cases as for Category 1; moving terrorism cases into Category 1; moving under five-year advocate call rates to over five-year call rates. This settlement was a package to the Bar worth approximately &pound;17 million. &pound;11 million came from changes to the VHCCC scheme, and a further &pound;6 million from the changes made to the 11 to 25 day graduated fee scheme where we made good the unintended shortfall that had occurred since the scheme was extended to 25 days on October 2001.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1100W.8/21"> <td>2005</td> <td>October&mdash;Cuts in rates paid in some graduated fee and Very High Cost Criminal Case contracts (to both advocate's and litigator's rates). Extension of the existing graduated fee scheme for cracks and guilty pleas. Estimated savings in RAB terms from these additional measures, excluding Cracks and Guilties, are &pound;5.1 million and &pound;20.8 million for 2005&ndash;06, 2006&ndash;07 respectively. The extension of the Cracks and Guilties schemes is anticipated to increase savings by an estimated total of &pound;20 million over 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1104W.10/2">Funding is available to support the growing of energy crops for use in the generation of biomass heat and electricity and transport biofuels. &pound;29 million was made available to farmers throughout England under the Energy Crops Scheme to support the planting of short rotation coppice (SRC) and miscanthus, and the setting up of producer groups to supply SRC to biomass heat and electricity end-users. The &pound;3.5 million UK-wide Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme, which is now closed for applications, provides grants to develop the supply chain for energy crops, straw and woodfuel from harvest through to delivery to biomass energy end-users. Several of the successful applications are based in the West Midlands area. Farmers who grow crops for biomass heat and electricity and transport biofuels can receive the single payment for certain crops grown on set-aside or where the &euro;45/ha Energy Aid payment is claimed for crops on non set-aside land.</p>
	<p pid="c.1104W.10/3">Funding is also available to develop markets for energy crops in the generation of heat, combined heat and power, electricity and transport biofuels. It was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-10">10 November</phrase> that the Government will introduce a Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation which will require 5 per cent. of fuel sold in the UK to come from a renewable source by 2010. The Government are also considering further initiatives to support investment in biofuel processing plants. These measures may open up opportunities for farmers to supply crops to be used to produce biofuels. A number of biomass and biofuel projects are being established in the West Midlands area. Marches Energy Agency, the Community Renewables Initiative's local support team for Shropshire and Herefordshire is working to develop further projects in the area.</p>

	<p pid="c.1105W.5/2">A person's credit reference file will automatically indicate when an account is in default. Communications between a debt collection agency and a debtor will depend on the circumstances concerned but the Office of Fair Trading, which is responsible for the licensing of debt collection agencies, has issued guidance that the debt collection sector must follow. The guidance sets out the types of behaviour that the Office of Fair Trading considers to be unfair and which could call into question a company's fitness to hold a licence. For example, the guidance makes clear that it is unfair for a debt collection agency to communicate with consumers in an unclear, inaccurate or misleading manner.</p>

	<p pid="c.1108W.2/17">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.1110W.5/2">The Competition Commission found in their report in April 2003 that the market in prescription-only veterinary medicines was not working well for animal owners. They recommended a package of measures aimed at opening up the market to competition.</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.5/3">A key element of the package of measures is to enable customers to take up prescriptions, so they can shop around for medicines rather than be forced to pay the prices charged by the veterinary surgeon treating their animal. The three-year moratorium on prescription charges is seen by both the Competition Commission and Government as essential to encouraging take-up and opening the market.</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.5/4">This is not currently applied to other professional groups as it follows a detailed analysis by the Competition Commission in response to complaints specific to the market for veterinary medicines.</p>

The European Commission is bound by a negotiating mandate granted and updated by the Council of Ministers but has the freedom to determine strategy and tactics within the parameters of that mandate. The assessment of Her Majesty's Government is that the offers tabled by the European Commission on 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-28">28 October</phrase> are within the remit of the negotiating mandate.

	<p pid="c.1115W.5/1">The Government's approach is to ensure that infrastructure, including public services, is provided in step with growth, as plans for individual growth locations are developed. There are three elements to this: first, to ensure that main public expenditure programmes, such as health and education, are sufficiently flexible and responsive to the needs of growing communities; second, to secure an appropriate contribution from developers and private investors; and third, to provide additional support through growth areas funds, including the Community Infrastructure Fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.5/2">Hertfordshire and the rest of the East of England have already benefited from a significant increase in identifiable public expenditure, receiving &pound;28.1 billion in 2003&ndash;04&mdash;a 26 per cent. real terms increase on 1999&ndash;2000. In particular between 1999&ndash;2000 and 2003&ndash;04:</p>

Following extensive public consultation, that draft strategy is now subject to an independent Examination in Public, which began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-01">1 November</phrase> and runs to early March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.5/8">It is for the Examination in Public, after considering all the evidence and representations before it, to make recommendations to Government on the appropriate long-term strategy for the scale and location of development in the East of England.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.5/9">Once Government have received the recommendations of the Examination in Public, and consulted on any changes it proposes, the final strategy will be issued. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is already engaged in discussions with partners on infrastructure and growth issues in the East of England and we will develop plans further in the light of the final strategy. Public service providers will then have the long-term certainty they need in which to plan future levels of service provision. Detailed development decisions need to be made at the local level as part of the preparation of local development documents.</p>

	<p pid="c.1120W.2/1">A table showing formula grant per head for 1998&ndash;99, 2001&ndash;02 and 2004&ndash;05, together with the relative level of grant per head for each authority in each of these years has been placed in the Library of the House. Formula Grant comprises Revenue Support Grant, Redistributed Business Rates and Police Grant. It is not appropriate to look at only the amount of Revenue Support Grant an authority receives since floor damping operates across formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="c.1120W.2/2">Please note that for every area in England there is more than one authority providing services. In order to get a true comparison for an area compared to the English average for the year it is therefore necessary to add together the authorities that cover that area, thus for the Isle of Wight it is necessary to add together the data for the Isles of Wight plus that for Hampshire police. For example, in 1998&ndash;99 the Isle of Wight received &pound;592.77 per head to cover all services except police and Hampshire police received &pound;88.08 per head to cover police services. Therefore, the figure for the Isles of Wight area to cover all services was &pound;592.77+&pound;88.08=&pound;680.85 which compares to an England average of &pound;653.14.</p>

Regional Spatial Strategies (RSSs) for the South East of England and the East of England regions are currently under review.

	<p pid="c.1131W.5/1">The public service agreement to halt the year-on-year rise in obesity among children under 11 by 2010 in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole is the joint responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the Secretary of State for Health, and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Joint cross-departmental programme management arrangements have been established to drive action to meet this target. Progress against the target will be measured through the Health Survey for England. The baseline will be established for the years 2002&ndash;04: data from the 2004 Health Survey will be available this winter. The 2005 Health Survey data will be available next winter, 2006&ndash;07, for the period 2003&ndash;05. We shall assess progress at that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.1131W.5/2">There is no single intervention for obesity. A wide variety of Government programmes make a valuable contribution to tackling the causes of obesity, including, from this Department, advice and support to parents in establishing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle delivered through Sure Start local programmes and children's centres, the Healthy Schools programme, new standards to improve the quality and healthiness of food in schools, increases in the time spent by pupils in PE and school sport delivered through the roll-out of the national PE, School Sports and Club Links strategy, and measures to improve the well-being and emotional health of children and to develop their social and emotional skills.</p>

	<p pid="c.1134W.2/1">Banding systems can have the effect of reducing inequalities in school intakes, ensuring fair access to all and reducing the clustering of disadvantaged pupils in certain schools. Combined with our proposals to extend entitlement to free school transport for more disadvantaged families, the introduction of fair banding could enable more children to access schools to which they were previously unable to gain admission.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.2/2">Research has suggested that pupils' attainment at key stage 4 is affected by the characteristics of the school. Schools with a large proportion of disadvantaged pupils tend to have lower results, even after taking account of the prior attainment and other characteristics of the pupils measured in the pupil level annual schools census. Reducing the clustering of disadvantaged pupils in certain schools can benefit these pupils and give them a better chance of achieving their potential in secondary schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.1135W.6/1">The Government have made it clear that they wish to take a cautious approach to the development of new casinos, in order to assess whether their introduction leads to an increase in problem gambling. The decision to reduce the number of regional casinos permitted by the Gambling Act 2005 from eight to one was consistent with this cautious approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.1135W.6/2">We have not ruled out the possibility of asking Parliament to agree to more regional casino licences, up to a maximum of eight, being made available, if further evidence is presented to us that it is safe and prudent in regulatory terms to do so.

	<p pid="c.1140W.6/1">The Department received business case submissions that included appraisal information from Merseytravel in August 2003 and February 2005. The latter updated the 2003 submission in accordance with changes to the scope and costs of the scheme, and also alterations were made to the appraisal to reflect changes in the Department's appraisal guidance. Merseytravel sent a number of additional documents necessary for the appraisal to meet the Department's guidance throughout February and March 2005. These included an Economic Impact Report, a Quantified Risk Assessment, and details of consultation on the environmental impacts of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.6/2">The Department has worked with Merseytravel on the appraisal of Merseytram Line 2 since 2003. The Department's assessment of the appraisal documentation began in early 2004, although before that, in 2003, it also audited the highway model used to underpin the appraisal results. The Department could not complete its assessment of the appraisal as the documentation was incomplete and it became apparent that the cost estimates for the project were changing. The 2005 documentation goes further towards addressing the Department's concerns, but the Department's focus this year has been to work with Merseytravel on the appraisal of line 1. The line 2 appraisal assumes that in its opening year line 1 will already be open and operational. Therefore some of the benefits claimed in the line 2 appraisal are contingent on city centre sections that would be provided only if the line 1 project goes ahead.</p>

	<p pid="c.1141W.2/1">The European Union proposals for new requirements in respect of motorcycles are part of the proposed new European Community Directive on driving licences. The Government are continuing to negotiate the terms of the Directive with European partners, through the Council of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1141W.2/2">The proposals for motorcycle licensing are not as the UK Government would wish, but there is very strong support in other member states and the European Parliament for staged access arrangements for young motorcyclists wishing to drive larger machines, so it is likely that such a proposal will prevail.</p>
	<p pid="c.1141W.2/3">The current proposals involve:</p>
	<p pid="c.1141W.2/4" class="indent">classifying motorcycles into three categories: small machines not exceeding 125cc cylinder capacity, power not exceeding 11 kW and power/weight ratio not exceeding 0.1 kW/kg; middle sized machines with power not exceeding 35 kW and power/weight not exceeding 0.2 kW/kg and not derived from a vehicle of more than double its power; and large machines;</p>
	<p pid="c.1141W.2/5" class="indent">introducing a system of staged access for new licences, such that the minimum age for access to middle sized machines would be at least two years greater than the minimum age for access to small machines.</p>
	<p pid="c.1141W.2/6">As currently proposed these rules would come into effect in the UK no sooner than 2012. In the meantime the Government would have the opportunity to take advantage of flexibilities offered by the proposals to devise an appropriate system for training, testing and developing the experience of young motorcyclists in the UK. In devising such a system, the Government intend to continue consulting a wide range of stakeholders with interests in road safety, motorcycling, and the motorcycle industry.</p>

In parallel a cross-industry timetabling working group is examining the timetable simulation work undertaken so far.

Routine maintenance consists of work to keep the road network safe and in good condition, for example, minor repairs, drainage cleansing, sign cleaning, grass cutting, gritting in winter, street lighting work and energy, etc. Capital maintenance consists of structural work to strengthen and renew carriageways, footways, bridges and street lighting columns.</p>

	<p pid="c.1157W.3/1">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has registered) in excess of 600 projects since its inception, including initiatives that were first registered by the Department for Social Security and the Department for Employment and Education. DWP does not differentiate between information technology projects and other types of project such as business change. Currently the Department has in excess of 100 individual projects, which embraces both information technology and business change.</p>
	<p pid="c.1157W.3/2">All Office of Government Commerce (OGC) Gateway Reviews are conducted on a confidential basis for the senior responsible owner (SRO) and ownership of the report rests with the SRO. This approach promotes an open and honest exchange between the programme/project and review teams delivering maximum added value. The DWP has a strong record in adopting OGC policy and best practice initiatives and all the Department's mission critical/high and medium risk projects are subject to OGC Gateway Reviews. The Department does not publish Gateway Review Reports as a matter of course, in line with OGC policy. OGC and Departments have received a number of Gateway requests under Freedom of Information and the first of these is currently on appeal to the Information Commissioner.</p>

	<p pid="c.1164W.0/1">The BS7799 part 1, recently updated and now known as ISO/IEC 17799, provides the foundation for the best practice security management of the national health service's information assets. Central arrangements have already been established that enable all NHS organisations to obtain a full reference copy of the standard for their own use. In addition, key requirements of the ISO/IEC17799 are included within the existing NHS Information Governance Framework, along with relevant topic guidance and illustrations. These are available to NHS organisations through the centrally provided and maintained NHS Information Governance Toolkit service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.0/2">The NHS Information Governance Toolkit supports NHS organisations to meet information security requirements but also numerous other closely associated requirements including best practice in terms of records management, information quality, data protection and the confidential management of records. Bringing these requirements together in this way has eliminated considerable duplication of effort as each of these aspects of information governance are based on similar principles and working practices but in the past they were addressed separately. The Information Governance Toolkit is provided free of charge to NHS organisations and replaced a range of existing data collections and has generated significant savings in staff time and resources across a wide range of NHS organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.0/3">Compliance assessment of NHS information security management, is based upon the ISO/IEC 17799 framework and is currently achieved on an annual basis through self-assessed organisational attainment reporting within the NHS Information Governance Toolkit. A review of these arrangements is currently under way and that will further refine and extend assurance criterion. These new arrangements should also in future form a significant part of formal NHS audit programmes at both local and national level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.0/4">In addition to contractual obligations, it is also intended that equivalent information governance assurance reporting arrangements will shortly be developed and implemented for a range of non-NHS information partner organisations, including those private sector organisations treating NHS patients. These requirements already exist for commercial service provider organisations involved in the delivery of the NHS National Programme for Information Technology and whose security management performance is routinely monitored against the ISO/IEC 17799.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.0/5">Although there is no current requirement for NHS organisations to seek or maintain a formal BS7799 part 2:2002 registration, NHS organisations are able to do so as a local decision. This part 2 of the original BS7799 standard has recently been replaced and is now known internationally as ISO/IEC 27001:2005. The Information Governance toolkit was developed, in part, to provide a cost effective alternative to individual NHS organisations requiring assistance from independent qualified lead accreditation consultants at commercial rates. As formal registration is not an NHS requirement, there are no central records of NHS organisations that may already have chosen to formally register or that may be considering doing so.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.0/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase>, a departmental official met with two representatives of the British Standards Institute to outline and discuss the NHS approach to BS7799. The British Standards Institute are therefore now fully aware of the significant steps taken by the Department to both adopt and promote the values of this standard to NHS organisations and relevant others.</p>

Through this and other mechanisms, the Department explained the key role of implementing the system reform programme, and other efficiency measures, in delivering better services for patients within the funding available.

	<p pid="c.1176W.9/1">Delaying to 2025 the introduction of a normal pension age (NPA) of 65 for members of the national health service, teachers' or civil service would not reflect Government policy or be consistent with the principles agreed at the public services forum. Those principles provide for NPA 65 to be introduced for new entrants as soon as practicable, and for the pension terms of existing members to be discussed in scheme specific negotiations. The estimated net present value of the savings arising from reform of the public service schemes generally is expected to be around &pound;13 billion over the next 50 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1176W.9/2">Savings to the Exchequer from introducing NPA 65 from 2025 have not been estimated and could be done only at disproportionate cost. It is, however, likely that delaying the introduction of NPA 65 until 2025 for the NHS, teachers' or civil service pension schemes would absorb a substantial part of the expected &pound;13 billion savings that will arise from the immediate implementation of scheme reform within the framework of the principles agreed at the public services forum.</p>

We have also urged Iran to return to talks with the E3/EU on the basis of the Paris Agreement. At its last meeting, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a resolution finding Iran to have been in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations under the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. We have made clear to Iran that it can, by the actions it now decides to take, influence the timing and nature of the IAEA's report of this non-compliance to the United Nations Security Council.

	<p pid="c.1185W.2/1">The situation in Co(r)te d'Ivoire remains fragile and the Government are concerned at any report of activities by either the Co(r)te d'Ivoire Government or rebels which could re-ignite conflict. United Nations Security Council resolutions 1572 and 1584 imposed an arms embargo on all parties involved in the conflict, to be closely monitored by the UN. A group of experts has recently submitted a report to the Security Council on the present state of the embargo. We and other Security Council members are now carefully considering this report. We would view with the utmost concern evidence of the Government of Co(r)te d'Ivoire rebuilding their airforce, which would clearly contravene the embargo and threaten the fragile ceasefire. We also strongly support recent efforts by the UN, African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to move the peace process forward following the postponed elections of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-30">30 October</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1195W.0/1">The Housing Executive measures the time taken from receipt of a recommendation from an occupational therapist (OT) to the commencement of works against agreed standards and a classification of cases according to their urgency/priority. Each adaptation is tailored to the specific needs of the individual person concerned. The length of time taken by a contractor to then complete a job is variable and can range from a few days to a few months for extensions.</p>

However, ward boundaries are reviewed periodically, and the results are presented for the wards current at the time of the census, The outputs from the last three censuses were thus based on different ward structures and it is not possible to track change at ward level over time directly from available census outputs. Estimates on a single ward geography could be made for each census using best-fit approximations, but this would require additional work and the interpretation of any observed trends would need to take cognisance of factors such as changes in the questionnaire wording, differences in the levels of non-response to the religion question, different population bases and different treatments of non-response in each census.</p>

	<p pid="c.1197W.9/1">Section 34 of the Food Standards Act 1999, which established the Food Standards Agency (FSA), states that the FSA must take account of, and consult with, the Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB)&mdash;also known as safefood&mdash;in carrying out its activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.9/2">There has been significant contact between the FSA Board, particularly through the Northern Ireland member on that body, and the FSPB. In the current year, the Northern Ireland member has met with the chair of the FSPB Advisory Board, and addressed a formal meeting of the FSPB governing body. The FSPB chief executive has also made a presentation on relationships between his organisation and the FSA at a meeting of the Nl Food Advisory Committee, which is chaired by the FSA's Northern Ireland Board member.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.9/3">At official level, a concordat has been established between the FSA and FSPB to guide working relations. Two formal meetings of senior management teams from both organisations have taken place, with the next meeting planned for March 2006,</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.9/4">Practical examples of both organisations working together in the past year include: the Director of FSA Nl Chairs an All Island Nutrition Forum&mdash;the Secretariat is provided by the FSPB; representation from FSA Nl on the FSPB's Consumer Focused Review; a jointly resourced stand at the Balmoral Show; jointly co-ordinated and sponsored National Food Safety Week initiatives in Northern Ireland; a jointly organised and resourced seminar in Dublin, on the subject of salt consumption. Both organisations continue to explore how they jointly carry out their work in an effective and efficient way, and this scope for review is enshrined in the UK legislation and in the concordat between the FSA and FSPB. The relationship between both bodies continues to develop and this can only further enhance the effectiveness of their joint work and ensure cost efficiencies for the taxpayer. A good example of this are plans in 2007 for FSA to carry out a major UK-wide survey on food consumption, the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, which will for the first time include a sample for Northern Ireland. The costs of the sample for Northern Ireland are high, and could not be met out of the current FSA NI budget. The FSPB has agreed to make a significant financial contribution to facilitate the survey.</p>
