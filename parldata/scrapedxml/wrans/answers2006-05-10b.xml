	<p pid="b.248W.8/1">The successful delivery of alternative livelihood programmes is highly dependent on the ability of organisations doing the delivery on the ground, being able to operate safely. Security in many parts of Afghanistan is improving, particularly in central, northern and western areas and further progress can be made by strengthening the effectiveness of the Afghan police and criminal justice system. However security remains a particular challenge in the south and east of the country, where the insurgency is most active.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.8/2">Continuing threats to the safety of Afghan and international staff have meant that some non-governmental organisations and international contractors are finding it increasingly difficult to operate in some parts of the country. The majority of DFID's livelihoods programme is channelled through the National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This helps to reduce some of the security risks by using local contractors, but there have been a number of attacks on implementing partners of these national programmes. Although attacks have increased, so far they have not caused widespread suspension of alternative livelihoods programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.8/3">Helmand province will be a particularly challenging place in which to deliver programmes that will support the development of alternative livelihoods. DFID is currently designing a large multi-year programme to support rural development in Helmand through the National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This support will only be successful if implementing partners are willing to work in the province. The UK military deployment to Helmand should help to facilitate a greater Afghan Government presence in the province, and improve the capacity of the police and the Afghan National Army to provide the necessary security for development partners to operate effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.253W.2/1">The Department is fully committed to equality and diversity. The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 places new duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people, 'the Disability Equality Duty.'</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/2">Through the Act, we, like many public bodies, have an obligation to publish a Disability Equality Scheme every three years. Our Equality and Diversity Unit has begun work on the Department's first scheme, to be published later this year. Policy officials will be undertaking a full departmental-wide examination of our policies and functions in relation to disability and other equality issues. Action plans will be produced to address all issues and these will be monitored and reviewed through the annual business planning process. The scheme will be published on the Department's website. This information will contribute towards preparations for the Secretary of State's report on progress, due in December 2008. My Department has also provided support on implementing the new duties to a number of other public authorities including schools and other public bodies. Further information on this and other support is shown as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/3" class="italic">Annex 1</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/4" class="italic">Examples of DfES support for other authorities include:</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/5" class="italic">Schools and early years:</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/6">The Department for Education and Skills is holding a series of events in May and June to launch the new resource &quot;Implementing the Disability Discrimination Act in schools and early years settings&quot; to help schools and local authorities implement the reasonable adjustments duty and planning duty they have under Part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act by providing:</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/7" class="indent">An explanation of the DDA duties and their relationship to the statutory SEN framework;</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/8" class="indent">a DVD resource filmed in over 40 schools?illustrating how schools have made reasonable adjustments to prevent discrimination against disabled pupils and increase their access to education; plus supporting written materials;</p>

	<p pid="b.253W.2/10" class="indent">guidance for local authorities on increasing access to early years settings for very young disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/11">The resource will help schools and local authorities to make adjustments for their disabled pupils both in the short and longer term by improving access to all aspects of school life. The guidance identifies how schools and local authorities' access planning arrangements will help compliance with the Disability Equality Duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/12">The Disability Rights Commission will give a presentation at the events providing an overview of the duties schools and local authorities will have under the Disability Equality Duty. They will also make participants aware of the sixth section that will be added to the resource in the autumn as part of the non statutory guidance being developed for schools by the Disability Rights Commission on the new Disability Equality Duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/13" class="italic">DfES's work with DRC/LSC/FE/HE in preparing for implementation of the new disability duty:</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/14">DfES has been participating in a series of round-table workshops over the past year with the Disability Rights Commission (DRC), Learning and Skills Council, Higher Education Funding Council for England and external partners in the Further and Higher Education sectors, to prepare for the forthcoming public sector duty to promote disability equality. DRC plans to publish guidance for the FHE sector in May.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/15" class="italic">LSC's existing statutory duty to promote disability equality:</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/16">Section 14 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, requires the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), in carrying out all of its functions, to have due regard to the promotion of equality of opportunity in terms of disability, race and gender. In addition, section 13 requires the LSC to pay particular regard to the needs of young people and adults with learning difficulties and disabilities, when performing its duties to secure facilities and provide resources for education and training.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.2/17">DfES are working with the LSC to run an equalities impact assessment across the skills strategy programme. This will include disability. We aim to complete this by the end of October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.255W.3/1">The key recommendations in the social exclusion unit's (SEU) report on 'Young Runaways' were that young people at risk of running away should know who they could talk to about their problems, that local services needed to work closer together to make sure young people got help, and that a safety net of community-based emergency accommodation was needed for those who did run away.</p>
	<p pid="b.255W.3/2">The findings of the SEU report, which was published in 2002, influenced the wider Government strategy on children's services, which was set out in the Green Paper 'Every Child Matters' (2003). It is through the 'Every Child Matters: Change for Children' programme currently being taken forward by local authorities, and including the reforms set out in the Green Paper 'Youth Matters', that the Government are promoting measures that respond to the SEU report.</p>
	<p pid="b.255W.3/3">'Change for Children' aims to help local services respond to the full range of children's needs&mdash;including their health, their safety and their economic well-being. It is particularly concerned with improving targeted support for those children most at risk of negative outcomes, such as those associated with running away or going missing from home. The programme, drawing on the Children Act 2004 reforms, is enabling local areas to improve integrated working arrangements by establishing multi-disciplinary teams, while adopting a lead professional model&mdash;someone who is a single point of contact for a young person who can co-ordinate a package of support when multiple needs are present requiring help from various sources. Improved integrated working at a local level is being accompanied by enhanced information sharing between services, leading to earlier identification of children's needs. This in turn allows young people to be referred to the right source of support, at the right time. New Joint Inspection Arrangements will judge the effectiveness and co-ordination of such local provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.255W.3/4">We have also run six projects to test out how best to provide safe, flexible and responsive community-based services that can be easily incorporated into mainstream children's services. We will disseminate the lessons learnt from these to local authorities later this year.</p>

We also ensure that the main trade associations representing small shops are notified directly about relevant public consultations.</p>

	<p pid="b.273W.8/1">The Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 1971 have been superseded by the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2002. Recent representations in relation to those regulations have focussed on the release of information from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's (DVLA) vehicle register.</p>
	<p pid="b.273W.8/2">Regulation 27(1 )(e) of the 2002 regulations require that DVLA release particulars held on its vehicle register to anyone who can demonstrate 'reasonable cause' for having the particulars made available to him. The term 'reasonable cause' is not defined in the legislation and each request is considered on its merits.</p>
	<p pid="b.273W.8/3">These regulations consolidate legislation that has been in force and working efficiently for over 40 years. However, when the provisions were originally introduced they did not anticipate the introduction of electronic databases, the large number of vehicles on the roads, or the range of bodies now requesting access. Concerns have also recently been raised about the breadth of organisations that have access to the register. For these reasons, I announced a review of the regulations governing the release of information. A consultation paper was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February</phrase> which sought to address all aspects of the release of information from the vehicle register. The consultation period closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> and our conclusions will be published in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="b.290W.11/2">A 'voluntary shop in a rural area' has been taken to refer to a shop that is<i></i>set up and run by volunteers. Such shops will generally pay corporation<i></i>tax on any profits in the usual manner.</p>

	<p pid="b.291W.3/1">Royal Mail offer a range of products that provide bulk purchase and business mail discounts, but these apply only where there is a central point of posting and administration which enables Royal Mail to use their automation of bulk postings to reduce operational costs. As Parliament's pre-paid envelope service provides the ability to post in constituencies anywhere in the UK, often in small volumes, these services are not applicable. Given a background of increasing deregulation within the mail industry the House authorities keep the possibilities of alternative contracts under continuous review.</p>
	<p pid="b.291W.3/2">A thorough evaluation of the external market through the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Commission was also carried out in 2005 in respect of Parliament's own mail service. Four firms were short-listed and Royal Mail won a new three year contract after they were able to convince the evaluation panel that they could deliver to a demanding specification and provide value for money.</p>

	<p pid="b.292W.2/1">The House Authorities regularly re-tender the contract for the supply of stationery. During the contract term they have regular meetings with the contractor in order to monitor the service and costs, most recently in April 2006. Costs are presently lower than they were in 2002 and the contract is due to be re-let in competition in 2007. Members' bespoke stationery is high quality comprising specially designed and milled environmentally friendly paper and envelopes. The stationery contract includes the provision of a next day delivery anywhere in the UK and a unique management system which allows two accounts to be held for each Member&mdash;one for their own stationery and one for the bespoke stationery provided separately by the House.</p>
