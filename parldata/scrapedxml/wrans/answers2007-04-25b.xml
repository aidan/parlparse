	<p pid="b.1101W.5/2"><i> </i>We can calculate an estimate of the UK consumer cost of the Common Agricultural Policy by comparing the difference between UK and world prices for agricultural products and applying that difference to the volume of UK consumption. On that basis the cost of higher spending on food to a notional family of four in 2004 was approximately &pound;260. Our provisional estimate for 2005 is approximately &pound;220.</p>

	<p pid="b.1103W.0/2">The approved UK national allocation plan (NAP) for phase I (2005-07) of the EU emissions trading scheme is set to deliver carbon dioxide emissions savings of around 65 million tonnes (roughly 8 per cent.) below the projected business as usual emissions of the installations covered by the scheme during phase I. The rationale behind emission trading is to ensure that the emission reductions take place where the cost of the reduction is lowest thus lowering the overall costs of tackling climate change. The emissions reductions referred to above may not therefore all take place in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1103W.0/3">Comparing 2003 and 2005 emissions in the UK from installations in the EU ETS shows a reduction of around 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) which equates to 4 per cent. However, a number of new installations commenced operation and entered the scheme in 2004 and 2005, emitting a total of around five MtCO2 in 2005. Therefore, the net total reduction in emissions from UK installations (incumbent and new) in the EU ETS was approximately five MtCO2 between 2003 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1103W.0/4">The UK NAP for phase II (2008-12) is set to deliver an annual reduction of 29.3 million tonnes of CO2 against projected business as usual emissions for 2010. The allocation level has been set at 13 per cent. below emissions from these installations in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.1104W.8/1">The need to preserve peat bogs for their biodiversity value, and as stores of carbon, is being addressed on a range of fronts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.8/2">Agri-environment schemes provide for good management of around 230,000 hectares of peat bogs . A progress review of environmental stewardship (ES) is due to begin shortly. Increasing the contribution of ES to climate change mitigation, including the role of peat restoration, will be examined as part of this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.8/3">We are also working towards our current public service agreement target to ensure that 95 per cent. of the area in England designated as sites of special scientific interest is in favourable or recovering condition by 2010. A considerable proportion of peat bogs are designated as SSSIs and currently around two thirds of this area meets the target. Improving the condition of the remainder is a priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.8/4">The England biodiversity strategy also contributes towards the protection of peat bogs, as does the UK air quality strategy which sets objectives to protect vegetation and ecosystems. The forthcoming soil strategy for England will draw together all these strands and DEFRA will consider, as part of this strategy, what further activity is required to protect existing carbon stocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.8/5">Our long-term policy is to promote management which (i) minimises further losses of carbon from peat soils, and (ii) allows peat bogs to act as a carbon sink. The potential for significantly off-setting carbon emissions may be somewhat limited because of the time it takes for peat to form.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.8/6">There are significant areas of peat bog in Scotland (which has over 70 per cent. of the UK peat resource), Wales and Northern Ireland. The devolved Administrations have policy responsibility in their territories, and DEFRA will continue to work closely with them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1106W.0/11">We will be making available approximately &pound;600 million over the seven years of the programme in support of these priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/12">We have devolved responsibility for delivery of these priorities to the regional development agencies in England. The RDAs are currently working with partners to finalise the picture of the needs and priorities for their regions and sub-regional areas.

	<p pid="b.1106W.0/13">Funding will be available once the EU Commission has approved the programme, which we expect to submit later in the spring. The approval process may take around six months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/14">Each of the RDAs has been operating an expressions of interest approach since October 2006, so that potential beneficiaries from rural development funding can discuss their ideas at the earliest possible stage. They will be making available further information about how to access funding when there is greater certainty about when the programme will begin, following approval by the EU Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.1110W.6/1">The operation of the Eurostar trains is a matter for Eurostar and London and Continental Railways as operator of the railway on which they run, and not for the Secretary of State. There are no current plans to increase the speed of Eurostar trains.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.6/2">Section 2 of the Channel Tunnel rail link, now known as high speed 1, will open on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase>. As a result journey times to the Channel Tunnel from London will reduce by some 23 to 25 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.6/3">It needs to be borne in mind that higher speeds require additional power and the right balance needs to be struck between keeping journey times short and carbon emissions down.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.6/4">The speed of the trains on high speed 1 is governed by the design speed of the railway based on track geometry, and the maximum speed of the trains themselves. The maximum speed of the current Eurostar train sets is around 335 kph based on the 2003 record run on section 1. The scheduled line speed between Ebbsfleet and the Channel Tunnel is 275 kph, although trains can travel at up to 300 kph if necessary.</p>

It is too early to predict how many of the existing fleet of approximately 11,400 rail carriages will be replaced by 2014. I can, however, reiterate the Government intention to commit to contracting with train operators for 1,000 additional carriages by 2014 to meet the rising demand for rail travel. This will form part of the capacity procured through the rail high level output specification to be published in July and will be in addition to any carriage replacements. The HLOS will be accompanied by a statement of funds available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1115W.5/1">Defence information infrastructure (Future) (DII(F)) is a &pound;4 billion programme over 10 years, which will provide a single, coherent information infrastructure across defence. Its implementation, on an incremental basis, will underpin MOD's change programme and modernising Government agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.1115W.5/2">The ATLAS Consortium (comprising EDS Defence Ltd as the principal contractor, with Fujitsu, General Dynamics, EADS and Logica CMG as key sub-contractors) was awarded the DII(F) contract on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-21">21 March 2005</phrase> for a period of 10 years following full and open competition. The contract is subject to incremental commitment and implementation and at contract award the Department committed to the first increment only for the provision of a fully networked and managed IT service to around 70,000 user access devices and 200,000 users around the world. The contract was amended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-29">29 December 2006</phrase> to incorporate a second planned increment (2a) which will provide for nearly 44,000 additional user access devices and 58,000 user accounts in support of the defence change programme and other identified business priorities. This amendment was made in the light of an assessment of ATLAS' performance in supplying increment 1 up to that point in its delivery schedule. The number of employees within the consortium is a matter for them but it is of the order of 2000, on average.</p>
	<p pid="b.1115W.5/3">The number of consultants employed by MOD on the DII(F) project has varied and will continue to vary across the life of the project. As a result, the precise information requested together with the associated expenditure can be provided only at disproportionate cost, when looked at over the total life of the programme from its inception. The total budget for consultants approved to date under the DII programme is &pound;57.5 million (rounded) since the inception of the programme, including work during the concept and assessment phases, leading up to the main competition and subsequently for later increments. As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-18">18 April 2007</phrase> the number directly employed on the project was 164.</p>
	<p pid="b.1115W.5/4">Throughout its life, the DII(F) project has been subject to regular review under the Office of Government Commerce gateway review procedure. Those reviews confirmed that the project is proceeding satisfactorily. As a result, I see no need for a further strategic review of the project at this time; the case for it remains valid and the contracted increments are proceeding within budgetary provision.</p>

This transition occurred in Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces in July and September 2006 respectively.</p>

Coalition forces continue to provide training and mentoring and much remains to be done in the areas of logistics and leadership.</p>

	<p pid="b.1118W.5/1">The temporary increase in levels of disease or non-battle injuries in both Operations Telic and Herrick was a result of the roulements in both theatres. An increase in those being treated for diarrhoea and vomiting type illnesses is common at such times, largely as a result of the climatic, food and environment changes experienced by those deploying into operational theatres. While such symptoms are unlikely to result in a patient being admitted to a hospital in the UK, individuals are admitted to hospital in theatre as returning them to barracks may lead to the spread of disease.</p>

	<p pid="b.1124W.6/1">The Government implemented the National School Sport Strategy in 2002. This is underpinned by a joint DCMS/DfES PSA target, to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds participating in at least two hours high quality PE and school sport each week to 85 per cent. by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.6/2">The 2005-06 annual school sport survey showed that 80 per cent. of pupils in school sport partnership schools are participating in at least two hours in a typical week, which surpassed the target of 75 per cent. We are therefore making excellent progress towards the PSA target of 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition is to offer all children at least four hours of sport a week by 2010, comprising two hours at school and a further two to three hours delivered by a range of school, community and club providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1130W.9/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-24">24 April 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland 4 Parliamentary Questions regarding:</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/4" class="indent">how many complaints his Department has received about the lack of pedestrian crossing provision on the High Donaghadee Road in Bangor, near to Montgomery Court. (133111)</p>

	<p pid="b.1130W.9/8" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/9" class="indent">I should explain that Roads Service's policy in relation to pedestrian crossings is to provide such facilities where there is an identifiable need and where the conditions at any potential site make it difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the road. An integral part of the process is an assessment of the 'demand' and 'difficulty' of crossing the road at the location concerned. The initial part of our assessment process uses the number of pedestrians (the initial demand factor) and the volume of traffic (the initial difficulty factor) to give an indication of the potential 'conflict' at a site. The assessment of the need for a crossing is then supplemented using a scorecard, which assigns scores to various other 'demand' and 'difficulty' factors, including collision history at the site. This policy is designed to assess the need and to prioritise locations where pedestrians encounter difficulties in crossing the road due to the high volumes of vehicular traffic. This is applied consistently and impartially when assessing all requests in Northern Ireland, so that available funding can be directed at those with the greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/10" class="indent">With regard to the number of complaints received in relation to the lack of crossing facilities on the High Donaghadee Road between the roundabout with the East Circular road and the junction with the Ballycrochan Road, I can advise that since September 2005, five individuals have corresponded with Roads Service over this issue. In total these five people have written on nine occasions, with one resident including a petition of approximately 150 signatures. Roads Service has no record of complaints about the lack of pedestrian crossing facilities at this location prior to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/11" class="indent">In relation to health and safety implications, I am advised that survey observations, obtained as part of the process for determining the need for a controlled pedestrian crossing facility, concluded that there were a very small number of pedestrians wishing to cross the road at this location and as such, it was considered that there was little conflict between pedestrians and vehicular traffic.</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/12" class="indent">In light of the survey findings, I am afraid that it is not possible to make funding available for a controlled pedestrian crossing facility at this location at this time. However, in such circumstances Roads Service may consider other measures to assist pedestrians, such as footway build-outs and central refuge islands, which shorten the crossing width and improve visibility thereby reducing the crossing difficulty. Central refuges can be particularly useful to vulnerable pedestrians such as elderly people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/13" class="indent">I am pleased to advise you that Roads Service is presently designing such a scheme for this location. However, I have to stress that this proposal is at a very early stage and will require a degree of public consultation prior to the detailed layout being finalised. Hopefully we will be able to complete this work within the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1130W.9/14" class="indent">Finally, with regard to your enquiry for details of the surveys, I can advise that they were carried out on the High Donaghadee Road, between Ballymaconnell Road South and Ballycrochan Road, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-07">7 September 2005</phrase> between 8 and 10 am, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-03">3 October 2005</phrase> between 2 and 4 pm and on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-05">5 October 2005</phrase> between 4 and 6 pm. Surveys were also carried out on the High Donaghadee Road, between Ashford Drive and Kilmaine Road, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase> between 4 and 6 pm and on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-10">10 November 2005</phrase> between 8 and 10 am. These surveys involved the counting of vehicles passing along the High Donaghadee Road and the numbers of pedestrians crossing within 50m either side of the centre of the survey zone.</p>

	<p pid="b.1136W.2/1">Later this year I intend to consult on a set of draft legislative proposals for a radical change to the structure of sentencing in Northern Ireland. These proposals include the introduction of indeterminate and extended public protection sentences that would in future put an end to automatic 50 per cent. remission for dangerous violent and sexual offenders. These sentences would mean that those committing the most serious offences could if necessary be detained indefinitely, while those committing other specified offences could be detained to the end of their prison sentence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1136W.2/2">Separately I also intend to publish draft legislation to reform the law on sexual offences, with tough new penalties proposed for abusive sexual behaviour which violates the criminal code.</p>

	<p pid="b.1141W.0/2">Extending the British Crime Survey to include those aged under 16 years old was one of the recommendations of the independent review of crime statistics led by Professor Adrian Smith that reported in November 2006. Smith recommended the Home Office should draw on the advice of experts in making such changes and there should be careful piloting so that the effect of such a change could be properly assessed before the extension is incorporated into the main BCS sample. We intend to commission work in the near future from experts in sampling and conducting surveys to provide advice on how this work could be taken forward. We expect to reach a conclusion on this work in the autumn of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.0/4">The National Identity Scheme is being built around plans first to issue biometric passports incorporating; fingerprints which many countries will be implementing in 2009; and second, to issue biometric visas and immigration documents to foreign nationals. The procurement projects will therefore in the main deliver generic facilities covering, for example, the recording and storage of biometric information for passport and immigration purposes as well as ID cards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.0/5">As with any major project or programme, cost estimates will continue to be revised as it reaches key stages in its development, such as commencing procurement, signing contracts with suppliers and the commencement of live operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/2">There are a number of schemes under which non-EU nationals can apply to work in the UK. Details of these, including the requirements and evidence which should be submitted, can be found on the UKvisas website (<a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk">www.ukvisas.gov.uk</a>). Two of the largest schemes are Work Permits and the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) and details of the requirements and processes of these are given.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/3">Non-EU nationals can also be permitted to work if they enter the UK under a long-term category, such as husband/wife/partner, though there is no requirement for them to demonstrate their employability in order for entry clearance to be issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/4" class="italic"> Work Permits</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/5">If a non-EU citizen is required to have a work permit to apply to enter the UK, their UK-based employer, as part of the work permit application process, is required to:</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/6" class="indent">demonstrate that the non-EU citizen has the skills, qualifications and experience to enable them to do the job on offer (except under the Sectors Based Scheme);</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/7" class="indent">inform the Border and Immigration Agency how they verified the non-EU citizen's qualifications and skills for most Business and Commercial and Training and Work Experience applications; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/8" class="indent">demonstrate that the non-EU citizen has appropriate registration with a UK professional organisation, for example, the Nursing and Midwifery Council or the General Medical Council, where that is required by legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/9">The employer is required to provide supporting documentation. The Border and Immigration Agency may request original documents where copies have been supplied and, if necessary, check their authenticity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/10">A work permit holder must apply for entry clearance before travelling to the UK. This will be granted provided the Entry Clearance Officer is satisfied that the applicant:</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/11" class="indent">holds a valid work permit and is capable of undertaking the employment specified;</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/12" class="indent">is not below the age of 13 years;</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/13" class="indent">does not intend to take employment except as specified on the work permit;</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/14" class="indent">intends to leave the UK on expiry of the work permit (where a work permit is due to expire within 12 months); and</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/15" class="indent">is able to be maintained and accommodated (and any dependants) adequately without recourse to public funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/16" class="italic"> HSMP</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/17">The HSMP is a points based immigration route. If a non-EU citizen wishes to enter the UK as a highly skilled migrant they must demonstrate their highly skilled status by scoring 75 points across the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/18" class="indent">qualifications held;</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/19" class="indent">previous earnings;</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.3/21" class="indent">UK experience.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/22">Applicants must also demonstrate that they hold English language skills to the required level. Successful HSMP applicants do not require a prior offer of employment to enter the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/23">When considering HSMP applications, the Border and Immigration Agency requests original documents and, where necessary, checks their authenticity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1147W.2/2">Work focused interviews were introduced nationally for some lone parents from April 2001. They were extended in stages to all lone parents making new or repeat claims to Income support, and from April 2004 to all lone parents with an existing claim to income support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1147W.2/3">Lone parents making a new or repeat claim for income support are expected to attend a work focused interview before an income support payment is made, unless the interview is deferred or waived. Failure to attend this first interview would result in the claim being disallowed rather than a benefit sanction being imposed. Benefit sanctions are imposed on existing customers who fail to attend their first work focused interview.</p>
	<p pid="b.1147W.2/4">Between April 2001 and March 2006, 1.76 million initial lone parent work focused interviews have been booked and, in the same period, 1.62 million initial interviews have been attended, with 39,920 sanctions applied for failure to attend an initial work focused interview.</p>
	<p pid="b.1147W.2/5">The number of work focused interviews (WFIs) booked for lone parents in the year to March 2006 was around one and a half times the number booked two years earlier, and over two and a half times the number booked three years before. This has, inevitably, resulted in an increase in the number of sanctions imposed. However, at less than 5 per cent. of the number of interviews booked, this represents a very low proportion of the total.</p>

The New Deal 50 plus cost figures up to 2002-03 include the DWP-funded ND50 plus employment credit. In 2003-04 this was replaced by the 50 plus element of the working tax credit, which is the responsibility of HMRC, so New Deal 50 plus costs reduced very significantly between 2002-03 and 2003-04.<br/> 4. Following agreement with HM Treasury in 2002/03, ringfences for New Deal were removed from New Deal. Administrative costs are excluded as it is no longer possible to identify the costs of administering the costs of each New Deal separately from the costs of other labour market activities.<br/> 5. Cost data includes start-up costs.<br/> 6. Following changes to the New Deal 25 plus programme in April 2001 when a mandatory intensive activity period was introduced, programme costs rose significantly resulting in an increase in the costs of helping people into work through the programme.<br/> 7. The costs of helping someone into work through New Deal for Lone Parents are lower as support provided to participants is primarily Adviser support and administrative costs are excluded from cost calculations.<br/> 8. Costs for voluntary programmes are also lower than the mandatory New Deals as a higher proportion of participants on voluntary programmes will be job ready without additional intervention.<br/> 9. Programme start dates are: New Deal for Young People: January 1998; New Deal 25 plus: July 1998; New Deal for Lone Parents: October 1998; New Deal for Partners: April 1999; New Deal 50 plus: April 2000; New Deal for Disabled People: July 2001.<br/> 10.

	<p pid="b.1154W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide my hon. Friend with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-24">24 April 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what the latest performance statistics are for each office where Social Fund applications are processed. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/4" class="indent">The time it takes to process Social Fund applications is measured by counting the average length of time taken to clear all claims processed within a set period (usually monthly). The measure is referred to as the Average Actual Clearance Time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/5" class="indent">The clearance time for an individual application is measured in whole working days from the date the application is received to the date the decision is taken (on whether to make an award or a loan offer), plus, if a loan offer is made, the number of whole working days between receiving the applicant's reply to the offer and the recording of that reply. The minimum clearance time recorded for an individual application is one day, even if the application is cleared immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/6" class="indent">Applications are made for five elements of the Social Fund: Community Care Grants, Crisis Loans, Budgeting Loans, Sure Start Maternity Grants and Funeral Payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/7" class="indent">The Average Actual Clearance Time service level expectations for each element are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/8" class="indent">Community Care Grants&mdash;9 days,</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/9" class="indent">Crisis Loans&mdash;2 days,</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/10" class="indent">Budgeting Loans&mdash;6 days,</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/11" class="indent">Sure Start Maternity Grants&mdash;5 days,</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/12" class="indent">Funeral Payments&mdash;16 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/13" class="indent">However, applications for Crisis Loan living expenses must be cleared on the same day as the application is made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/14" class="indent">The attached table shows the performance of each of the 42 operating units that are currently responsible for Social Fund applications. The data covers February 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.5/15" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1165W.8/1">The World Health Organisation, UNAIDS and UNICEF published a new report last week&mdash;&quot;Towards Universal Access: scaling up priority HIV/AIDS interventions in the health sector&quot;. The report shows that countries in every region of the world are making substantial progress in increasing access to HIV treatment. More than 1.3 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving treatment in December 2006, representing coverage of approximately 28 per cent. of those in need compared to just 2 per cent. in 2003. Coverage in other regions varied, from 6 per cent. in North Africa and the Middle East, to 15 per cent. in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and 72 per cent. in Latin America and the Caribbean. Overall, while encouraging trends continue, just 28 per cent. of the estimated 7.1 million people in need of treatment in all low and middle income countries were receiving it in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.8/2">Substantial challenges remain, which is why DFID continues to work with Governments and the international community to help deliver a comprehensive response. DFID is committed to spending at least &pound;1.5 billion on tackling the HIV and AIDS epidemics. In 2005-06 DFID spent &pound;385 million tackling HIV and AIDS, an increase of nearly 30 per cent. on the 2004-05 figure of &pound;298 million. The UK has committed &pound;300 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria from 2002-08 including, &pound;100 million for 2006 and the same for 2007 subject to performance. To date, Global Fund-financed programmes have provided treatment to over 600,000 people with AIDS. DFID is also committed to improving access to medicines and announced support of &euro;20 million for UNITAID, the new drugs purchase facility established in September 2006, as part of a 20 year commitment, increasing to &euro;60 million per year by 2010 subject to performance. Following its first two board meetings in October and November 2006 UNITAID has already approved several significant items of expenditure, including $61.7 million for paediatric anti-retroviral therapy (ART), $70 million for second line ART and $52.5 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.</p>

	<p pid="b.1166W.5/1">DFID's 2005-08 public service agreement (PSA) includes a target shared with Her Majesty's (HM) Treasury, that 90 per cent. of heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) that have reached Decision Point by end 2005 should receive irrevocable debt relief by end 2008. By the end of 2005, 28 HIPCs had reached HIPC Decision Point (thereby demonstrating their commitment to poverty reduction and qualifying for interim debt relief). Of these 28 countries, 22 have now completed the HIPC initiative and received irrevocable debt cancellation. The PSA target requires that four more countries complete HIPC before the end of 2008. Current indications are that this target will be met.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.5/2">The public service agreement framework will change for the period 2008 to 2011. New departmental strategic objectives are under discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.5/3">In addition to our existing PSA target, DFID and HM Treasury work closely to deliver the UK Government's commitments on debt relief. We remain committed to the full implementation and financing of the HIPCs and multilateral debt relief initiatives (MDRI). We exceed our commitments under HIPC, cancelling 100 per cent. of bilateral debts for qualifying countries. We are also the second largest bilateral donor to the HIPC Trust Fund which helps multilateral organisations deliver HIPC debt relief in a timely manner. We continue to pay our share of the costs of the MDRI at the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank. We also support debt reduction facility operations managed by the World Bank which allow poor countries to buy back their commercial debts at a considerable discount (generally over 90 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.5/4">The UK remains committed to 100 per cent. bilateral and multilateral debt relief for poor countries that will use the savings for poverty reduction. We have cancelled bilateral aid debts from low income countries (except Zimbabwe and Burma, neither of which are making payments) and qualifying lower middle income countries. We also pay our share (10 per cent.) of debt service to the World Bank and African Development Fund for eight low income countries that are not eligible for assistance under HIPC. We hope that other countries will soon also reach the standards of public financial management and commitment to poverty reduction necessary to receive this support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.5/5">Avoiding the re-accumulation of unsustainable debts is crucial. The UK supports debt management capacity building for countries. We are also working with the international community (including the international financial institutions, export credit agencies and emerging lenders) to ensure responsible new lending to poor countries. We support the World Bank and IMF's debt sustainability framework (DSF), and promote its use wherever possible. The DSF identifies countries that might struggle to repay loans, and these are offered grants, or a mixture of grants and loans, by the World Bank and African Development Bank.</p>

	<p pid="b.1168W.2/1">The UK made AIDS a centrepiece of the 2005 G8 and EU presidencies. We pressed for and secured international commitments to universal access to HIV treatment. We subsequently worked hard to ensure that this commitment was endorsed and expanded by the international community in the Political Declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS (<phrase class="date" code="2006-06-02">2 June 2006</phrase>). This Declaration committed to achieve comprehensive HIV prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010. It also agreed that countries would develop ambitious targets, including interim targets for 2008, to measure progress towards universal access. Crucially, it also set out a process by which countries will develop national AIDS plans to scale up towards universal access by 2010; and made the commitment that no credible, costed, national AIDS plan should go unfunded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/2">By early 2007, 90 countries had developed targets for achieving universal access, and at least 23 countries had proceeded with costing their strategic plans. The UK is pressing UNAIDS to define what constitutes a credible national AIDS plan. We are also pressing for a multi-stakeholder process in country to review universal access plans as they are developed, to agree their credibility and ensure they are fully funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/3">We will push hard to ensure an ongoing focus by the G8 on achieving its commitment to universal access. We see our work with UNAIDS as central to unlocking the G8 and international community's commitment to funding credible, costed national AIDS plans. We will ensure that this work is discussed as we prepare for the G8 Heiligendamm summit in June.</p>

	<p pid="b.1168W.5/1">At the Berlin meeting G8 Development Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to get as close as possible to universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care by 2010. They acknowledged that the price of some drugs remains prohibitive for many countries, and more needs to be done to help lower their cost including the use of TRIPS flexibilities to the fullest extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.5/2">By early 2007, 90 countries had developed targets for achieving universal access, and at least 23 countries had proceeded with costing their strategic plans. The UK is pressing UNAIDS to define what constitutes a credible national AIDS plan. We are also pressing for a multi-stakeholder process in country to review universal access plans as they are developed, to agree their credibility and ensure they are fully funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.5/3">We will push hard to ensure an ongoing focus by the G8 on achieving its commitment to universal access. We see our work with UNAIDS as central to unlocking the G8 and international community's commitment to funding credible, costed national AIDS plans. We will ensure that this work is discussed as we prepare for the G8 Heiligendamm summit in June.</p>

It is expected that the allocation will be used to fund multilateral activities, such as the World Bank and Regional Development Banks' clean energy investment framework and other initiatives, as well as bilateral projects with countries.

	<p pid="b.1169W.5/1">The Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) Latin America Strategy was established in late 2004 and a detailed evaluation will be undertaken later this year or early next year. A GCPP steering team consisting of officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), Ministry of Defence (MOD) and DFID hold regular meetings to monitor progress of the Strategy and decide changes with input from a Regional Conflict Adviser (RCA) who is based in Venezuela. Country analyses are regularly provided to the GCPP steering team by the RCA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.5/2">At project level, activities are monitored and evaluated by the RCA on a regular basis. Projects are designed to address individual needs in specific circumstances and therefore vary widely in scope and scale. Monitoring and evaluation is built in, and is undertaken against the objectives and projected outcomes. The positive impact of GCPP supported projects is being seen through these evaluations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.5/3">The Latin America conflict prevention strategy has at its heart the objective of resolving existing conflicts and preventing new conflicts from breaking out. In delivering this objective, evaluation shows that this has been successful. For example, working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) a successful border management model has been developed around Colombia's borders to assure refugees' rights and to resolve and manage conflicts. In Colombia, GCPP support has contributed to the visible presence of community defenders in remote and vulnerable communities who have helped to reduce the risk of internal displacement of people by providing increased access to legal services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1170W.5/1">Technical cooperation or technical assistance is the provision of know-how to developing countries in the form of personnel, training, research and associated costs. DFID spends approximately 10 per cent. of bilateral official development assistance on technical cooperation. In 2008, DFID will review its provision of technical cooperation personnel, i.e. contracted specialists who share know-how and expertise with developing countries. The review will assess DFID's progress in implementing guidance for country offices written in June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/2">DFID's long-term vision for technical assistance is that our partners in developing countries should lead in identifying needs for technical assistance, designing terms of reference, and contracting and managing consultants. DFID considers it important that Southern partners and recipients of technical assistance play a significant role in the review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/3">We are still at the early stages of planning the review so no decisions have yet been made. We are considering the following ideas to ensure Southern partners participate fully in the review:</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/4" class="indent">the reviewers make some country visits to interview partner governments and recipients of technical assistance</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/5" class="indent">a small reference group of representatives of partner governments and recipients of technical assistance advise on the review</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/6" class="indent">one of the criteria for selecting consultants to carry out the review is that Southern-based consultants play a significant role.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/7">DFID has agreed that the terms of reference for the review will be developed jointly with the UK Aid Network, a network of UK development NGOs including ActionAid, Christian Aid, Oxfam and WaterAid. We hope they will also contribute ideas on this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/8">While Southern partners' contributions are critical for the DFID review, internationally agreed aid effectiveness principles indicate donors should not make excessive demands on Southern partners' time. This is particularly so for individual donor initiatives. We need to use our partners' time wisely when inviting them to work on the DFID review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1172W.7/2">The Department for International Development has allocated up to &pound;30 million over three years to the Government of Afghanistan to support its Helmand Agricultural and Rural Development programme (HARDP). This programme is designed to extend the Government's National Priority programmes to Helmand, and will fund projects in the road-building, community development, micro-credit, water/sanitation and agriculture sectors. Since the programme started in January, over 1000 wells have been surveyed and designed. Of these, 120 wells have been completed, benefiting around 21,000 people and work is continuing on a further 30. A second batch of 150 wells will begin construction shortly. Construction has also started on four roads, totalling 51 km. These roads should be completed by May, security permitting. In 2006-07, the UK Government also committed &pound;6.2 million to fund 128 quick impact projects. These have included improvements in flood defences; humanitarian assistance to drought victims and those who have had to flee their homes; refurbishment of 30 tractors and ploughs; permanent vehicle checkpoints to improve security; and improvements to two local markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1172W.7/3">The UK has committed &pound;270 million to support counter narcotics activity in Afghanistan, including support for the National Drugs Control strategy. This includes &pound;30 million for the Counter Narcotics Trust Fund, which was set up specifically to support the National Drugs Control strategy. The fund will bring counter narcotics funding on budget; give the Afghans greater ownership over this important agenda; and ensure that assistance is targeted as effectively as possible. In 2006-07, the Department for International Development also spent &pound;33.7 million on programmes to strengthen and diversify legal rural livelihoods.</p>

	<p pid="b.1176W.2/1">The Darfur Peace Agreement marked an important milestone in the development of the political process for Darfur. It provided for a comprehensive and fully monitored ceasefire, reinforced by detailed measures on Security Sector Reform and Disengagement, Demobilisation and Reintegration, and on humanitarian protection. It provided for fair political representation for Darfur as part of Sudan. It also provided mechanisms for compensation and for fair and transparent redistribution of Sudanese national wealth to Darfur as part of the overall redistribution set out under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. However, there was insufficient support among the parties to the conflict in Darfur to support the agreement. This is the main reason there has not been further progress in implementing it. We are pressing for a renewed political process under the auspices of the UN and African Union. I made clear our concerns over Darfur to the Sudanese Minister for Justice at a meeting held during the Human Rights Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-13">13 March</phrase>.</p>

In November 2004, the Vietnamese passed legislation which set out the terms under which religious groups may gain official recognition. However, implementation of the new rules has been variable between regions.

	<p pid="b.1180W.5/1">The following guidance is issued by the Department to staff on the provision of alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="b.1180W.5/2">There is a general principle that alcohol should not be provided at public expense and never when only civil servants are present.</p>
	<p pid="b.1180W.5/3">Moderate amounts of alcohol can be provided at public expense when entertaining non-civil servants if not providing alcohol might be regarded as unusual or cause embarrassment. Examples of such events are hospitality from Ministers, at publicity events such as launches or the rare occasions when senior staff judge that official business can best be transacted by hosting a meeting over lunch or dinner.</p>

The Department makes no manpower planning assessment for this group of local authority employees.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181W.8/2">Funding for the training of EPs has previously come from within the Local Government Employers' (LGE) organisation's top slice of the Revenue Support Grant (RSG), as distributed by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). For the 2007-08 RSG settlement, the LGE top slice was reduced by &pound;2.088 million and distributed by the DCLG to local authorities through formula grant, as proposed by the Local Government Association (LGA).</p>
	<p pid="b.1181W.8/3">As we made clear in our response to the House of Commons Education and Skills Select Committee report on special educational needs (October 2006, Cm 6940), we do not believe that it would be appropriate for us to intervene in the funding arrangements for those wishing to become EPs. Local authorities, and their representative body the LGA, should determine these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181W.8/4">Lord Adonis, the Under-Secretary of State for Schools, met with representatives of the educational psychology profession and the local authority employers' side on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January 2007</phrase> for an update on the funding arrangements. As a result of those discussions, it was agreed that the Children's Workforce Development Council would help facilitate further discussions between the employers' side, in the form of the LGA, representatives of the EP professional interests, and training providers. We expect a report on those discussions shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1183W.9/2">All occupiers of non-domestic property, known as hereditaments, pay business rates as a way of contributing to a range of local services. Business rates are payable regardless of ownership and are based on the rateable value of the hereditament in question. The level of business rates payable by a ratepayer depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Depending on the facts, a building may for rating purposes constitute more than one hereditament. In such cases, the occupiers of those separate units would be liable for rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183W.9/3">Rateable values are generally based on the assumed rent the property would attract if let on the open market on a specific date. These values are assessed by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), an independent agency of HM Revenue and Customs, in line with well-established rating principles and methodology. If ratepayers disagree with the rateable value of their property, they may challenge it by making an appeal to the VOA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183W.9/4">We are aware that the impact of business rates is greater on small businesses compared with larger concerns. The small business rate relief scheme that we introduced with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> therefore provides up to 50 per cent. rate relief for eligible properties irrespective of the use to which the property is put.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189W.8/1">All occupiers of non-domestic property, known as hereditaments, pay business rates as a way of contributing to a range of local services. Business rates are payable regardless of ownership and are based on the rateable value of the hereditament in question. The level of business rates payable by a ratepayer depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Depending on the facts, a building may for rating purposes constitute more than one hereditament. In such cases, the occupiers of those separate units would be liable for rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189W.8/2">Rateable values are generally based on the assumed rent the property would attract if let on the open market on a specific date. These values are assessed by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), an independent agency of HM Revenue and Customs, in line with well-established rating principles and methodology. If ratepayers disagree with the rateable value of their property, they may challenge it by making an appeal to the VOA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189W.8/3">We are aware that the impact of business rates is greater on small businesses compared with larger concerns. The small business rate relief scheme that we introduced with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> therefore provides up to 50 per cent. rate relief for eligible properties irrespective of the use to which the property is put.</p>

This sets out our proposals on how planning should contribute to reducing emissions and stabilising climate change. Planning is expected to make a full contribution to delivering the Government's Climate Change Programme and energy policies. This includes giving greater emphasis to local renewable sources for supplying the energy needs of new developments and looking favourably on proposals for renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.2/2">The draft PPS builds on our policies in PPS22 &quot;Renewable Energy&quot; which state that renewable energy developments should be capable of being accommodated throughout England in locations where the technology is viable and environmental, economic, and social impacts can be addressed satisfactorily. PPS22 sets out detailed considerations applicable to determining planning applications for renewable energy projects, including on sites in areas with nationally recognised designations such as those within national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. Planning permission for renewable energy projects on these sites can be granted where it is demonstrated that the objectives of designation of the area will not be compromised by the development, and any significant adverse effects on the qualities for which the area has been designated are clearly outweighed by the environmental, social and economic benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.1195W.5/1">The dental reforms launched in April 2006 give local primary care trusts (PCTs) for the first time the responsibility for commissioning dental services to meet the needs of their local populations. Under the previous system, dentists could set up practice where they wished and choose how much or how little national health service work to provide. If a dentist stopped providing NHS services, the local NHS could do very little to secure replacement services. Under the reforms, PCTs have the resources to commission agreed levels of patient services from local dentists. If a dentist stops providing NHS services in the area, the money for that service now stays with the PCT and is used to commission services from other dentists. PCTs are increasingly using these new powers to commission additional services which better reflect local needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195W.5/2">The reforms build on a programme of significant Government investment in NHS dental services and workforce expansion. The annual resources now allocated for NHS dentistry are some &pound;400 million more than in 2003-04 (excluding the money for annual pay increases). In the two years leading up to the reforms, the Government co-ordinated a major recruitment programme, which resulted in the equivalent of over 1,450 whole time dentists joining the workforce. There are currently some 20,900 dentists on NHS contracts, around 1,500 more than two years ago and 4,000 more than in 1997. To support future growth, the Government also increased annual numbers of dental training places by 25 per cent. in 2005.</p>

The following table sets out the resources allocated to the national health service for commissioning dental services in 2006-07, including resources distributed via strategic health authorities to support dental vocational training. Total (gross) expenditure on NHS primary dental services also includes income raised from patient charges. The table includes the indicative assumptions made before the start of the year about gross budgets and patient charge income. A number of factors will affect the actual levels of gross expenditure and patient charge income, including the levels of dentistry commissioned by PCTs, the time needed for new dental services to be commissioned and come into operation, and changes in the mix of charge-paying and charge exempt patients treated.</p>

The priority for modern maternity services is to enable the whole pregnancy experience to be as safe and satisfying as possible for mother and baby and to support new parents to have a confident start to family life.</p>
	<p pid="b.1200W.8/2">In line with the vision set out in the report of the Department's Expert Review Group on Neonatal Intensive Care, published in 2003, we have facilitated the development of 24 neonatal managed clinical networks to provide safe and effective services for mothers and babies. Since April 2003 over &pound;70 million additional funding has been made available to support the development of these networks. This is in addition to the general increase in national health service funding, from which neonatal services can also benefit. Because of improvements in technology and the development of health care expertise, greater numbers of very small babies are being born alive and surviving. In the past many of these babies would have died just before or just after birth.</p>
