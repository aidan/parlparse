	<p pid="a.685W.3/2">The supervision of banks in the UK is a matter for the Financial Services Authority (FSA), acting on an independent basis. The Treasury has not held discussions with the auditors of Northern Rock on its accounting practices. The accounting treatment of assets and liabilities in banks is governed by standards proposed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the EU. The IASB is re-examining through its consultative process the accounting standards for consolidation of exposures on a bank's balance sheet, with a paper planned for the second half of 2008. The Government, with the FSA and the Financial Reporting Council, will be involved in the development and adoption of any new or amended EU standard.</p>

Nor do the numbers include companies who export services.</p>

	<p pid="a.688W.0/11">It is wrong to assume that all banding appeals are about reducing a property's banding. An appeal can be made on other grounds, such as how a previously single dwelling should be split up into a number of separate units (e.g. flats), and from what date the change should appear in the valuation list. The VTS does not currently keep information on whether allowing an appeal, in full or in part, results in a change of banding.</p>

As with other compulsory purchases, compensation arrangements also differentiate between owner occupiers and others, with those who can demonstrate residence for at least a year receiving a 10 per cent. home loss payment on top of the market value for the property, and landlords or investors receiving a 7.5 per cent. basic loss payment on top of market value.</p>

	<p pid="a.690W.0/1">It is the responsibility of local authorities to plan properly for their housing provision, on the basis of specific sites that reflect clear and informed strategies for the location of housing development, and for the infrastructure needed to service it. Of course flood risk is a major factor in deciding the location of new development and the Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in such areas. We have strengthened the system significantly&mdash;new planning rules introduced last year (PPS25) make clear that councils should not give the go ahead to new housing in areas where the Environment Agency advise against it. The new rules are already beginning to have an impact and it is vital that councils continue to work with the Environment Agency to ensure that new homes are safe from flooding and property sustainable for the future. Flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable.</p>

'Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development' (PPS1) makes clear that the creation of safe and accessible environments where crime and disorder or fear of crime does not undermine quality of life or community cohesion is a key planning objectives which planning authorities should take into account. PPS1 also says that planning authorities should have regard to good practice set out in 'Safer Places&mdash;the Planning System and Crime Prevention'. The counter terrorism supplement which will accompany Safer Places will, therefore, equally be capable of being a material consideration in the determination of planning applications and in the preparation of planning policies.</p>

At project approval in May 2000, the approved in-service date was December 2009. The projected in-service date was revised in March 2003 to March 2011 due to delay in contract activation. We are currently reassessing the projected in-service date in light of industry's recent announcement that the programme is running six months late with additional risk of a further six months' delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.705W.3/1">I am not aware of any plans for a future common EU food security policy. Food security has many components, including the stability and resilience of supply; the ability of the food system to withstand disruptions; food safety; nutrition and quality; and affordability. The EU has a role to play in relation to several aspects such as food safety, trade policy and agricultural policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.3/2">What matters to security of supply is effective risk management, security of energy supplies, access to food from a variety of sources, a strong food chain and infrastructure and the capacity and contingency planning to deal with specific risks. Improved trading relationships, based on more open international markets will help facilitate these.</p>

	<p pid="a.707W.12/2">Revisions to the approved supply list (ASL) (version 8) introduced an ecotoxic classification for zinc oxide, one of the substances which is likely to be present in incinerator bottom ash (IBA). Zinc substances now need to be considered, in addition to lead and other ecotoxic heavy metals, when classifying and disposing of this kind of waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.12/3">Since there is the potential for potentially ecotoxic metal substances in incinerator bottom ash (IBA) to exist in non-ecotoxic form, I understand that the waste industry is currently developing a protocol for ecotoxicity testing of IBA.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.12/4">DEFRA and the Environment Agency both consider that the classification of IBA will remain non-hazardous pending the results of direct testing, which is being carried out as part of this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.12/5">DEFRA has not discussed the classification of IBA with other member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.2/1">The Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme was set up to return &pound;284 million raised from landfill tax back to businesses between 2005 and 2008 to improve their resource efficiency and to minimise the levels of waste that are unnecessarily sent to landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.2/2">Evaluation results for 2005-06, which are conservative, indicate that BREW saved businesses nearly &pound;88 million and increased their sales by over &pound;14 million. There were also reductions in water use, waste sent to landfill and the amounts of raw materials used by businesses. Many of the benefits will be seen beyond 2005-06. Work is currently under way to assess the impact of programme spending in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.2/3">The Envirowise Programme is a key component of the overarching BREW programme. Envirowise aims to stimulate business to reduce their costs through reducing the amount of waste they produce.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.2/4">Impact Evaluation results for the calendar year 2006 indicate that &pound;85 million was saved by business from direct use of Envirowise. This figure is conservative and accounts only for savings that would not have been made without Envirowise. The savings figure is much greater when including companies who consider themselves to have been assisted by Envirowise. There have also been large reductions in water use and use of raw materials from business using the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.711W.6/1">The Export Control Organisation at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is the licensing authority for strategic exports in the UK. It sets out the regulatory framework under which licence applications are considered, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise, Regulatory Reform takes the formal decision to issue or refuse export licence or refuse export licence applications in accordance with the appropriate legislation and announced policy. Information about arms brokers who have had their proposed export licence application either refused or revoked is shared with HM Revenue and Customs and the Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office to ensure that the decision is enforced. Where the Government receives information that an exporter has attempted to circumvent export control rules, the relevant Government departments and agencies will take action. For example, the arms broker John Knight was recently jailed for four years for breaching export controls relating to a brokered transaction between Kuwait and Iraq. This case illustrates that the legislation introduced under the Trade in Goods (Control) Order 2004 is making an impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.711W.6/2">The UK has one of the most rigorous and transparent export licensing regimes in the world. All licence applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis against &quot;The Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria&quot;. The criteria cover in detail how we assess each case. Specifically criterion 5b states: &quot;the risk of the goods concerned being used against UK forces&quot;. If there appears to any risk of this being the case, a licence will not be issued.</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.5/1">Since the death of President Niyazov in December 2006 and the election of President Berdimuhamedov in February 2007, there has been some positive progress on human rights. There has been a greater willingness by Turkmenistan to engage on human rights issues with international organisations, including the EU, UN and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Louise Arbour, the UN Human Rights Commissioner, visited Turkmenistan in April 2007 and there is an outstanding invitation to the UN Rapporteur on Religious Freedom to visit. The EU Special Representative for Central Asia, Pierre Morel, and Javier Solana, High Representative for EU Common Foreign and Security Policy, discussed human rights with president Berdimuhamedov on several occasions in 2007, including during Berdimuhamedov's visit to Brussels in November 2007. The first EU-Turkmenistan ad hoc dialogue on human rights took place in Brussels in September 2007. My hon. Friend the Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks) raised human rights concerns during his visit to Turkmenistan in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/2">In August 2007, President Berdimuhamedov pardoned and released from prison a number of individuals who had been detained following the coup attempt on President Niyazov in 2002. These included Nasrullah Ibn Ibadullah, the former Chief Mufti. The UK has regularly lobbied for Ibadullah's release, bilaterally and jointly with EU partners, most recently the week before he was pardoned. Internal freedom of movement has improved. Checkpoints and roadblocks have been removed and it is easier for Turkmen citizens to travel to border areas. In contrast to previous practice, the new president has asked the international community to provide scholarships for young citizens of Turkmenistan to study abroad and has publicly encouraged young people to take up these opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/3">However, there remains a long way to go. The education system will need time to recover from years of neglect under President Niyazov. There is still no press freedom and no freedom of expression. President Berdimuhamedov has recently made statements criticising the quality of the media, but it is too early to say if this means any relaxation of controls on the media. There is only one political party, and religion and civil society are tightly controlled. Non-governmental organisations registration remains a lengthy and complex process and the Government has not yet addressed this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/4">The UK will continue to urge Turkmenistan to address human rights issues and will support genuine efforts to do so, both bilaterally and with international partners. We will continue to work through the EU-Turkmenistan ad hoc Dialogue on Human Rights and through the EU's Central Asia Strategy, which has as one of its main themes the support for good governance, rule of law and human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.717W.14/1">National health service organisations are expected to adhere to core standards in their treatment of all patients, as assessed by the Healthcare Commission (HCC). When the HCC find that services are not meeting core standards, it may refer serious failure to the Secretary of State (or for foundation trusts, Monitor) with a recommendation that special measures may be taken. This option is rarely exercised because trust managers and, where appropriate, the strategic health authority (SHA) is expected to act as soon as a failure to reach a core standard is recognised.</p>
	<p pid="a.717W.14/2">75 per cent. of all inpatients are older people. Many elderly patients find mixed sex accommodation distressing as it reduces their privacy. The 2008-09 Operating Framework sets out an expectation that primary care trusts (PCTs), which are responsible for working with healthcare providers to agree and implement plans for improving services, will set stretching local plans for improvement in performance in reducing mixed sex accommodation. The NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement published guidance in December 2007 to help NHS healthcare providers adhere to the requirements of their local PCTs. The guidance clarifies that single-sex accommodation can be provided in single-sex wards, single rooms with adjacent single-sex toilet and washing facilities (preferably en-suite), or single-sex bays within mixed wards.</p>
	<p pid="a.717W.14/3">Where patient survey scores are available, monitoring should be based on seeking specific improvements in these scores in the next survey. SHAs are responsible for the assurance of these processes and for the performance management of NHS trusts.</p>

There are over 150 local NHS Stop Smoking Services across England that offer a range of free services in different settings. Stop smoking pharmaceutical aids, including nicotine replacement therapy, are available in many different formats on prescription and can be accessed by young smokers. Smokers can also quit with free support from the NHS Smoking Helpline and Together Programme which provide information, advice and motivation by telephone, email, post or by text message at key moments during the smoker's quitting process. The NHS Pregnancy Smoking Helpline and the Asian Tobacco Helpline are also in operation. The NHS makes a wide range of printed materials available on quitting smoking, and the NHS Go Smokefree website at <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/gosmokefree">www.nhs.uk/gosmokefree</a> has information and tools to support smokers to quit, and the location of NHS Stop Smoking Services across England.</p>

Widening access requires long term investment and change across the higher education system. We have reformed student finance, reintroducing grants and raising the income threshold at which repayments start. No one is required to pay a contribution to their higher education up-front. These reforms, together with Aimhigher, have been instrumental in bringing about progress. The proportion of UK domiciled, young, full time, first degree entrants to English higher education institutions who were from lower socio-economic groups rose from 27.9 per cent. in 2002/03 to 29.1 per cent. in 2005/06.</p>

The bulk of this support will help poor countries in Africa and Asia to develop and implement long-term education sector plans to achieve the education MDGs. At the 2007 G8 Summit in Heiligendamm, the G8 countries reaffirmed that no country seriously committed to Education for All will be thwarted in their achievement of this goal by lack of resources. We will continue to urge our G8 partners and other donors to meet their promises on education, and also seek accelerated action to meet all of the MDGs through the MDG Call to Action, jointly launched last July by the Prime Minister and the United Nations Secretary-General.</p>

	<p pid="a.725W.2/1">The number of incidents of prisoners absconding or escaping from prisons which have, or had in the past, an open element is shown in the table below for the period <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.2/2">Prisoners are classed as 'absconders' if they absent themselves from Prison Service custody without lawful authority and without overcoming physical security restraints such as that provided by fences, locks, bolts and bars, a secure vehicle or handcuffs. Escapes involve circumstances where physical security restraints have been overcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.2/3">Most absconds are from open or semi-open prisons. Those prisons which are fully open, semi-open or have an open element are shown in the tables including some cases where prisons have re-rolled and no longer have an open element. It is possible for a prisoner to escape from an open prison. For example, an incident involving a prisoner who was been held in segregation within an open prison and who then managed to break out and leave the prison would be regarded as an escape rather than an abscond.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.2/4">Data on escapes and absconds and other performance data are published for all prisons at the following link:</p>
