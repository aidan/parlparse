	<p pid="a.552W.3/1">This information has not been collected centrally in the past. The new Waste Batteries and Accumulators Regulations (SI 890/2009) will provide such data in the future. Our best estimates for the quantity of batteries on the UK market and recycled are contained in the Impact Assessment published with the Batteries and Accumulators Regulations 2009:</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.3/3">We estimate that the annual UK market for. portable batteries is around 30,000 tonnes. Market reports suggest that more than 70 per cent. of retail sales are alkaline batteries. Only about 3 per cent. of waste portable batteries are thought to be recycled currently.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/4">The most recent estimate of the car batteries market is that about 131,000 tonnes of car batteries were placed on the market in 2006. This is thought to be rising annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/5">About 143,000 tonnes of waste arise from car batteries annually. About 60 per cent. of a lead-acid battery&mdash;the type typically used in cars&mdash;is lead. We estimate that about 99 per cent. of this is recycled annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/6">The amount of industrial batteries sold in the UK in 2006 is estimated to be about 69,000 tonnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/7">About 34,000 tonnes of waste arises from industrial batteries annually and it is estimated that about 32,000 tonnes are recycled. We do not have estimates of the amount of heavy metals in industrial or portable batteries.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/8">Few if any batteries will be reused when they become waste because common practice is to dispose of batteries when they are spent.</p>

All regulations, irrespective of their origins, should comply with the principles of better regulation. Regulations should be risk based, proportionate and well designed, so as to achieve their objectives while also keeping costs to a minimum. The Government continue to work with European partners to ensure that EU regulations meet these standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.568W.5/1">Details of locations where acid and other discharge from mines, landfill sites, radioactive waste storage sites and animal burial mounds have been identified as exceeding permitted levels and resulting in poor river quality are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/2" class="indent">(i) Working mines are subject to discharge controls under Water Resources Act consents or Environmental Permitting Regulations permits issued and enforced by the Environment Agency. Permits are set to ensure that, when complied with, relevant EU Directive standards are met. Where permits are not complied with it is for the Environment Agency to take appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/3">Since 1994, over 100 discharges from abandoned coal mines to rivers have been assessed and prioritised by the environment agencies in England and Wales and Scotland. The Coal Authority has built some 50 minewater treatment plants which have cleaned up or protected more than 400 km of rivers and protected drinking water supply aquifers. A prioritised programme to deal with remaining pollution from abandoned coal mines is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/4">Research commissioned recently by my Department and the Environment Agency has addressed the impacts of abandoned non-coal mines on watercourses. It identifies those posing the greatest risk to achievement of the aims of the Water Framework Directive by assessment of impacts on water quality, ecology, fish and groundwater. It is estimated that, out of a total of some 8,000 water bodies, 221 are impacted by non-coal minewater pollution related primarily to high concentrations of metals in discharges. As a first step, my Department is currently commissioning research to identify the most cost-effective passive treatment options from which to develop appropriate remedial measures within future river basin management planning cycles. This research will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/5">Relevant annual data since 1997 is not held centrally and I will ask the Environment Agency to provide such information as is readily available to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/6" class="indent">(ii) The regulation of landfills has changed significantly since 1997 when landfills were regulated by a waste management licence. Discharges of site drainage and treated leachate were controlled through a separate authorisation. Since the introduction of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act in 1999, permits have controlled both the landfill and discharges to surface water at operational sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/7">The Environment Agency records inspections carried out at landfill and breaches of licence conditions. Since 2004 the Environment Agency has recorded data on breaches of licence conditions on a national system. Information prior to this is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.568W.5/23">While the Environment Agency records details of the type of breach, it is unable to provide a summary of the breakdown of these incidents by substance.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/24" class="indent">(iii) Low level radioactive waste is disposed of at the Low Level Waste Repository near Drigg in Cumbria. The Environment Agency and the Food Standards Agency monitor the environment and food around this facility. Since 2002, the Environment Agency has published its environmental monitoring results annually in the Radioactivity in Food and Environment (RIFE) Report series; prior to that the results were published in the Agency's Radioactivity in the Environment series of reports. Based on these monitoring results the Environment Agency assesses the radiation doses received by members of the public. The radiation dose to members of the public living near the Low Level Waste Repository is much less than the annual 1 millisievert (mSv) legal dose limit. The results of these dose assessments are also published in the RIFE report series.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/25">Small quantities of low level radioactive waste are disposed of to some landfill sites. The Environment Agency monitors groundwater and leachate from a number of landfill sites and its assessments of radiation doses based on the monitoring results show that doses to members of the public are much lower than the annual 1 mSv legal dose limit. These results are also published in the RIFE report series.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/26">The disposals of radioactive waste did not exceed permitted levels at the low level radioactive waste repository near Drigg or at landfill sites. Radioactive waste disposals did not result in poor river water quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/27" class="indent">(iv) The Environment Agency is not aware of any significant impact from animal burial mounds. The only significant burial of animals occurred during the 2001 Foot and Mouth emergency where there were 992 on-farm disposals of carcases in England and Wales. Due to the precautions taken at the time to identify suitable sites and the removal of material in some cases, very few residual risks were identified in the comprehensive review that was subsequently undertaken by DEFRA. Monitoring was found to be necessary at approximately 3 per cent. of the original burial sites. No unacceptable impact on the environment has been found.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/28">Following the outbreak, DEFRA, in consultation with the Environment Agency, commissioned an independent review of each site using a source&gt;pathway&gt;receptor staged approach. The consultants concluded that none of the 992 sites posed an unacceptable risk to the environment but recommended that 32 of the sites be subject to ongoing water quality monitoring. Monitoring of these sites commenced in 2003 and is ongoing. The results are made available to the Environment Agency on a quarterly basis. This ongoing monitoring has identified that although there have been occasional exceedences of the precautionary threshold levels at a number of sites, they are often one-off spikes and are not consistent. These exceedences are considered to reflect the fact that samples are obtained from natural bodies of water in agricultural settings and reflect agricultural practice in the vicinity rather than results from the carcase disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/29">Since 2001, DEFRA has retained and managed four animal burial sites. Of these sites, only one (Watchtree, Cumbria) releases processed water into the watercourse. This is treated water from the burial cells finished using reed-bed technologies which is subject to a managed discharge consent issued by the Environment Agency. While there have been isolated instances of permitted levels being breached, these have almost been exclusively due to unseasonal rainfall which increases the suspended solids content, and none have resulted in poor river quality being reported. The three remaining sites (Tow Law, Co Durham, Ridgeway Ground, Worcestershire and Birkshaw Forest, Dumfries and Galloway) are closed sites with water products been stored and tanked to an appropriate location for treatment. Ground water run-off surrounding the sites is also monitored with the results shared with the Environment Agency, no recurring breaches have been reported and any isolated breaches have been actively resolved in conjunction with the appropriate regulatory agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.571W.0/1">In 2005, DEFRA introduced further provisions within The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act to tackle nuisance parking. Specifically, section 3 of Act makes it an offence for a person to place two or more vehicles for sale (for the purposes of a business) on roads where they are within 500 metres of each other. The offence is not intended to target individual private sellers of single vehicles, rather the nuisance that is caused by the presence of numbers of vehicles being offered for sale by the same person or business. Any person found guilty of such an offence can be fined up to &pound;2,500.</p>

	<p pid="a.579W.6/1">I will answer these questions on the current situation at London Metropolitan university (LMU) together. In doing so it should be borne in mind that responsibility for resolving these issues falls to the funding council and the university. Ministers are precluded in legislation from decisions on the funding of individual institutions. In answer to the specific questions:</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/2">First, Ministers were first informed about by the funding council about issues with audit of LMU's data in February 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/3">Second, the funding council first raised concerns with LMU about its 2005/06 data in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/4">Third, LMU reported non-completions for each of these years based on its own interpretation of the funding council rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/5">Fourth, the funding council already has a number of processes in place to ensure the accuracy of the data institutions provide which inform their funding. It was these processes that identified the problems at LMU.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/6">Fifth, it is for the funding council to account for the funds it distributes. It has itself decided to commission an independent report into its handling of the situation at LMU. It will report to its board in July and will be made public. In addition the National Audit Office will be undertaking a study of the financial health of the HE sector later this year. It is likely to include LMU in that study. As such I will not be commissioning a separate investigation.</p>

The ITV Yorkshire region (covering the Vale of York and North Yorkshire) does not switch until 2011, therefore to date there has been no spend in this region.

	<p pid="a.585W.2/3">There are no steps envisaged to increase digital radio take-up specifically in Northern Ireland, or in any other part of the UK. However, as set out in the recently published Digital Britain White Paper, the Government recognise that building out a Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) infrastructure across the UK which meets the needs of broadcasters, multiplex operators and listeners, including improving the quality of the signal, will require additional investment. We will work closely with the BBC, transmission providers and Ofcom to agree a plan for the extension and improvement for local DAB coverage, and where the cost would most appropriately fall.</p>

	<p pid="a.585W.5/5">No date has been set for the Digital Radio Upgrade programme. The top-level principle of the upgrade programme is that it should not result in reduced access to radio services. The Digital Britain White Paper set out our intention to deliver a Digital Radio Upgrade programme across the UK by the end of 2015, when we would expect all analogue services also carried on the national and local DAB multiplexes to cease broadcasting on analogue.

	<p pid="a.596W.6/1">Global energy demand and wholesale prices have fallen since peaks last year. It is essential that falls in wholesale costs reach consumers. This is why we asked Ofgem to provide quarterly reports on price movements.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.6/2">Ofgem's most recent report found that margins are around historic levels, and falls in costs appear to be being passed on to consumers. We expect suppliers to continue to pass on any sustained falls in wholesale costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.596W.9/1">It is very difficult to provide precise figures for the proportion of UK legislation that stems from the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.9/2">The administrative burdens measurement exercise carried out by the Government in 2006 put the proportion of administrative burdens stemming from the EU at approximately one-third of the total administrative burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.9/3">The important issue is not the origins of legislation, which could of course be a devolved Administration or a local authority, as well as the Government or the EU, but the quality of the regulation. All regulations, irrespective of their origins, should comply with the principles of better regulation. Regulations should be risk based, proportionate and well designed, so as to achieve their objectives while also keeping costs to a minimum. The Government continue to work with European partners to ensure that EU regulations meet these standards.</p>

In addition, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) is conducting a review of productivity and skills in the engineering construction sector which will establish whether there is anything more Government or industry can do to ensure British firms and workers are fully equipped to fill vital jobs in nuclear new build and other large scale engineering construction.</p>

	<p pid="a.608W.5/1">The Forced Marriage Unit has been a great success in encouraging people to report potential instances of forced marriage, in intervening in specific cases and in getting across the message that forced marriage is not acceptable in any culture or any religion.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.5/2">The very nature of forced marriage means that it is likely that a number of eases go unreported. In recent years Government action to address forced marriage has focused on encouraging victims and potential victims to come forward and seek help.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.5/3">Partly as result of growing awareness of the support available, the number of cases coming to our attention is rising. Last year the Forced Marriage Unit, a joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office Unit, received over 1,600 reports of suspected incidences of forced marriage to its helpline. Of these the unit directly intervened to help victims in 420 cases, which included overseas assistance and support to reluctant sponsors in immigration cases. 14 per cent. of overseas assistance cases involved people under 16 years old.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.5/4">So far this year, figures for January to June show that the unit received 770 calls to its helpline in relation to incidence of forced marriage, which represents an increase in those seeking help of 16 per cent. over the same period last year.</p>

	<p pid="a.615W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-29">29 June 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.615W.2/2">This Government are fully committed to maximising the economic benefits of the Games to the UK, particularly in these challenging economic times. Although no specific assessment has been made of the economic effects to the Ribble Valley constituency and Lancashire, the region stands to gain from a range of opportunities created by the Games. These include businesses winning Games-related work, increased tourism, as well as training and employment opportunities. The pre-Games training camps will enable regions to showcase themselves on an international stage and attract inward investment, and UKTI is helping businesses to use the Games as a springboard for export.</p>
	<p pid="a.615W.2/3">We are already seeing progress in these areas, for example, 37 of the Olympic Delivery Authority's direct suppliers are businesses registered in the north-west, of these nine are in Lancashire, and two of these are registered in the Ribble Valley constituency. As well as these direct contracts, companies in the north-west are also winning businesses in the supply chains for the Games, for example, a Bolton-based company is providing steel for the Olympic Stadium. LOCOG's procurement will begin in earnest towards the end of the year, bringing further opportunities to businesses across the UK, including the north-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.615W.2/4">The London 2012 Business Network is providing businesses across the UK access to Games-related contracts, and any support they need to compete for them. CompeteFor, the electronic brokerage service for buyers and suppliers, a key component of the network, is opening up supply chains further than any Games previously.</p>
	<p pid="a.615W.2/5">A total of 68 facilities in the region are included in the official London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide. A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the North West Development Agency and the Oceania National Olympic Committees (representing 17 National Olympic Committees but excluding Australia and New Zealand). These 15 Pacific Island countries including Fiji and Papua New Guinea will use facilities in the region ahead of the Games in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.0/4" class="indent">The tables attached provide the number of deaths for (a) males and (b) females aged (i) under 21<sup>(1)</sup>, (ii) 21-30, (iii) 31-40, (iv) 41-50, (v) 51-60 and (vi) 61 years and over, where the underlying cause was (1) obesity (Table 1), (2) diabetes (Table 2), (3) an eating disorder (Table 3) or (4) a sexually transmitted infection (Table 4), in England and Wales, 1999 to 2008 (the latest year available), or (5) drug poisoning, in England and Wales, 1998 to 2007 (the latest year available) (Table 5).</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.0/5" class="indent">The figures provided in Tables 1 to 4 reflect the number of deaths certified as due to the specified conditions. It is not possible to identify all deaths 'related' to these conditions. For example, obesity may play an important role in deaths due to heart disease or diabetes, but is rarely recorded on the death certificate. The figures presented for obesity in Table 1 are therefore likely to underestimate the actual number of deaths in which this factor is involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.0/6" class="indent">It is likely that the figures in Table 3 underestimate the actual number of deaths where an eating disorder was involved. This is because deaths registered after a coroner's inquest usually state the immediate physical condition which caused death as the underlying cause, and not any mental or behavioural disorder which may have led to that condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.0/7" class="indent">ONS monitors deaths from drug-related poisoning using a special database, developed to enable the analysis of deaths by the specific substances involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.0/8" class="indent">The deaths included are certified by Coroners following post-mortem and inquest. Figures for 1998 to 2007 have been provided as figures for 2008 are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.0/9" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The specified age group 'under 20' has been amended to 'under 21' so as not to exclude deaths at age 20 from the table.</p>

			<tr pid="a.640W.0/39"> <td colspan="5"><sup>(1)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999-2000), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> Figures prior to 1999-00 exclude any expenditure on service, strategy and regulation.<br/> <sup>(4)</sup> Denotes figures are not available or have not been scored on a consistent basis.<br/> <i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1. The expenditure data to 1998-99 are drawn from the annual 'R01' spending returns which local authorities submitted to the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) (now CLG). Figures for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 are drawn from Section 52 (Table 3) Outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the then DFES (now DCSF). Figures for 2002-03 onwards are taken from Section 52 (Table A) Outturn statements. The change in sources is marked by an empty row.<br/> 2. School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DCSF Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> 3. From 2002-03 onwards the school based expenditure calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002-03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &pound;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &pound;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002-03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03 and would therefore be excluded from the school based expenditure calculation, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br/> 4. Expenditure was distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sector until the inception of Section 52 for the 1999-00 financial year. Consequently we have provided a combined figure for pre-primary and primary schools for 1996-97 to 2001-02 financial years.<br/> 5. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the R01 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DCSF. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) to schools and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables.<br/> 6. Secondary school based expenditure includes all expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained secondary schools. It is not possible from existing sources to distinguish this expenditure between expenditure on 11 to 16-year-olds and expenditure on 6th form pupils attending maintained secondary schools.<br/> 7. The expenditure data for 1999-2000 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br/> 8. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10. As reported by York local authority as at 10 July 2009.<br/> 9. Cash figures are converted to 2008-09 prices using the 30 June 2009 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators.</td> </tr>

Improvements in teaching have been facilitated by organisational factors, for example, careful recruitment, quality assurance schemes, support for teachers to focus on teaching and sharing of good practice (Rudd et al., 2002).</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.0/4">2. Barber and Mourshed (2007) at McKinsey and Company, argued that the biggest driver of variation in pupil learning is teacher effectiveness and present a strong argument for focusing on recruiting high quality teachers in order to raise attainment of pupils. In particular, they refer to a US study by Sanders and Rivers (1996) that showed that two average eight-year-old pupils placed with different teachers diverged in their performance by more than 50 percentile points within three years. However, this study needs to be treated with caution as the research was conducted in a small number of schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.0/5">3. Slater et al. (2009) estimated the effect of individual teachers on pupil outcomes, and the variability of teacher quality, which they refer to as teacher's impact on test scores. They used a unique primary dataset linking over 7,000 pupils, their exam results and prior attainment to the individual teachers who taught them. They found that a high quality teacher (75<sup>(th)</sup> percentile) compared to a low quality teacher (25<sup>(th)</sup> percentile) can add 0.425 of a GCSE point per subject to a given pupil, or 25 per cent. of the standard deviation of GCSE points. This further demonstrates the importance of having effective teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.0/6" class="italic"> Summary of research evidence suggesting that pupils from deprived backgrounds are less likely to experience good quality teaching:</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.0/7">1. There is evidence to suggest that pupils from deprived backgrounds may be less likely to experience good quality teaching. Sammons et al. (2006), in an analysis of teaching practice in 125 year 5 classes, found that the quality of teaching tended to be poorer in schools with higher levels of pupils eligible for FSM. Differences were apparent in areas such as basic skills development, depth of subject knowledge, social support for learning, pupil engagement and classroom routines. Cabinet Office (2008a) cited evidence that teachers in schools with more than 20 per cent. FSM eligibility were more likely to be rated worse in their teaching, and less likely to have come from an outstanding teacher training institution. Furthermore, Thrupp and Lupton (2006) reported that unchallenging work was evident among schools with deprived intakes.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.0/8">2. Also, secondary schools with higher proportions of pupils eligible for FSM have, on average, teachers with lower levels of qualifications than other schools. Charles et al. (2007) found that schools in the higher FSM quintiles had fewer teachers with degrees in the subject they taught, compared with schools in the lower FSM quintiles. This was true for most subjects analysed, with the exception of ICT and design and technology, in which teacher qualifications were higher in schools with higher proportions of FSM.</p>

	<p pid="a.646W.2/1">Existing exclusions guidance already contains strong messages on special educational needs (SEN) exclusion issues. The existing version of this guidance, last revised in September 2008, states that schools should try every practicable means to maintain a pupil with SEN in school, seeking local authority and other professional advice as appropriate. It goes on to state that this might include seeking local authority and other professional advice at &quot;School Action Plus&quot;, or where appropriate, asking a local authority to consider carrying out a statutory assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.2/2">In addition, the guidance sets an expectation that, following a permanent exclusion, the head teacher should use the period between his or her initial decision and the meeting of the governing body to review the exclusion and to work with the local authority to see whether more support can be made available or whether the statement can be changed to name a new school. If either of these options is possible, the head teacher should normally withdraw the exclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.652W.5/21">The amount of formula grant an authority receives each year is not directly comparable due to changes in funding and functions. For example, prior to 2006-07 funding for schools was included within formula grant; from 2006-07 onwards funding for schools was provided by the Dedicated Schools Grant. For this reason, we therefore adjust the prior year's formula grant, for comparison purposes only, so that it reflects the notional amount of formula grant an authority would have received in that year had we been financing the same services as in the current year.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.5/22">The Department only holds data on year-on-year changes in formula grant on a like-for-like basis from 1997-98. This is because it only became necessary to make these calculations when guarantees were introduced that formula grant would not go down from one year to the next.</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.3/2"><i> </i>The Health Protection Agency (HPA) carries out research on radiofrequency radiation, monitors other studies, and conducts comprehensive reviews of the scientific evidence. The independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) also prepares reviews for the HPA of the evidence for health effects. AGNIR published a review of health effects in relation to radio waves in 2003 (see documents of the NRPB, volume 14, number 2: &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields: Report of an independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation&quot;), and the HPA in 2004 (see documents of the NRPB, volume 15, number 3: &quot;Review of the Scientific Evidence for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (0-300 GHz)&quot;). These publications are both available on the HPA website. AGNIR is commencing another review of the health effects of radio wave exposures, which is expected to take two to three years to complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.3/3">A copy of the report &quot;Report 2007&quot; from the independently managed Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme (MTHR), funded by government and industry, has been placed in the Library. None of the studies completed demonstrated that biological or adverse health effects are produced by radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones or base stations. Further research is being carried out to address longer-term exposures and to assess whether hypersensitivity symptoms can be caused by exposure to terrestrial trunked radio (TETRA) signals. Further information on these studies is available on the MTHR website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.3/5">The HPA has concluded that there is no consistent evidence to date that exposure to radio waves from wireless networks adversely affects the health of the general population. Radiofrequency exposures are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones and well within the internationally accepted guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. The HPA keeps the situation under ongoing review. The HPA is carrying out a systematic programme of research into Wireless Local Area Networks and their use, expected to be complete in 2010. Details can be seen on the HPA website at:</p>

These folders were stored at Wellington House, a Department of Health building. While preparing an inventory of these folders in July 2008, departmental officials became aware that they also contained documents relevant to period before 1985 and a full assessment of the content of all the folders was therefore undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.657W.0/3">Many of the documents from the relevant period were found to be copies of those already released. There were 469 previously unreleased documents identified, none of which was judged to add materially to the knowledge of events in the years before 1985. One document from this batch was withheld as it contained personal information about a patient. The remaining 468 were released as soon as was practicable.</p>

	<p pid="a.658W.0/1">The groups, in addition to patients with bleeding disorders, who may have been exposed to potentially contaminated blood and blood products received treatment for a range of conditions.

	<p pid="a.658W.0/3">Recipients of transfusions of blood components may have been exposed to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) during the 1980s and 1990s. To date, four cases of vCJD infection associated with transfusion have been identified, three of which resulted in clinical symptoms in the transfusion recipient. All recipients of blood from the donors to these cases were traced and those living notified of their risk status. Some recipients of plasma products manufactured from United Kingdom sourced pooled plasma between 1980 and 2001 were identified as being potentially 'at risk' for vCJD as a result of their treatment in line with risk assessment advice from the CJD Incidents Panel in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.658W.3/1">The precise terms and duration of the look-back exercise are due to be finalised imminently with the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centres Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO). It is likely that the look-back exercise will concentrate on patients with bleeding disorders who may have been infected, as indicated in the Government response to Lord Archer's independent report into national health service supplied contaminated blood and blood products, but the UKHCDO will also take the opportunity to consider the need to include any other patient groups who may have been infected.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.3/2">There was a look-back exercise in 1995 to identify and offer hepatitis C testing to recipients of blood transfusions from known hepatitis C infected blood donors. The Department's ongoing hepatitis C awareness campaign, which has been running since 2005, highlights the risks of hepatitis C infection, including specifically from blood transfusions or blood products in the UK before it was possible to introduce safety measures, and encourages patients who may be at risk to discuss the need for testing with their doctor.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.3/3">Patients infected with HIV through contaminated blood transfusions or blood products in the UK are likely to have already been identified because of the clinical nature of the disease, as it is now over 20 years since HIV testing was introduced by the blood services.</p>

	<p pid="a.660W.0/4">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is one of the main agencies through which the Government support biomedical research. The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.</p>

The Department does not have access to the full methodology used by the Republic of Ireland for calculating its average costs, as under European Union rules, there is no obligation on one member state to share this with another.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.2/1">It is not possible to estimate the number of critical care beds required in a flu pandemic because this will depend upon a range of factors such as the clinical attack rate, the most 'at risk' population and the number of flu victims requiring intensive care. The percentage of those diagnosed with swine flu that have required intensive care treatment is less than 1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.2/2">In the 'Managing Demand and Capacity in Health Care Organisations (Surge)' guidance, it is advised that, within their local flu contingency plans, acute hospitals will aim to double the number of critical care beds available. A copy of the guidance has already been placed in the Library. Managing demand will also be achieved by cancelling elective work and redeploying clinical staff from services such as theatres to help provide a level of critical care across this increased demand. The guidance also includes measures to relieve pressure such as increased use of agency and retired staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.5/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) already have arrangements in place for antiviral collection points as part of pandemic flu planning. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have been reviewing this earlier this year to ensure that plans are robust, that a good spread is available across each PCT geographically and that sufficient collection points can be up and running to meet the needs of the population. All PCTs are able to establish an initial antiviral collection point (ACP) within 48 hours, to provide at least one ACP which can be operational on a 24/7 basis with the remainder offering a range of opening hours dependent upon demand. Within seven days of the request to mobilise PCTs are able to have sufficient ACPs up and running to meet the needs of the population as necessary. Timing of mobilisation of collection points and locations will depend upon the level of demand from swine flu in each local area. PCTs in each area are providing local communications in each area to tell the population where collection points are located. The detail of where all collection points are operating is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.671W.2/1">The full National Pandemic Flu Service continues to be planned for operation during the autumn, if required. As a result of the swine flu outbreak the build of the original 'flu line' system was put on hold so that an interim solution, including additional antiviral collection point functionality, could be developed and tested to be available more quickly if needed. The additional costs related to building the interim solution amount to approximately &pound;2.5 million and are the only additional system build costs incurred to date in respect of the interim solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.674W.12/1">Support to reconstruction and development in Helmand is led by an inter-departmental, civilian-military, multi-national Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), led by a UK Senior Representative from the Foreign Office. Four staff members of the Department for International Development (DFID) are integrated into the Helmand PRT.</p>
	<p pid="a.674W.12/2">DFID core funding for Helmand this year is &pound;18 million, which will include programmes benefiting the Babaji population such as agriculture support, basic infrastructure, and a major road.</p>
	<p pid="a.674W.12/3">The PRT has developed a stabilisation plan around Operation Panther's Claw and the Babaji area. This includes work on supporting the Afghan Government to establish itself in cleared areas, to deliver health, education and policing services and to set up polling stations for the elections in August. The cross-government Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF) has set aside almost &pound;15 million for district stabilisation across Helmand this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.674W.12/4">The Asian Development Bank has pledged $50 million to co-fund two major infrastructure projects with DFID: a road linking Lashkar Gah and Gereshk (which goes around Babaji) and a hydro-power plant in Gereshk (also funded by Denmark). USAID will deliver a major agricultural programme across Helmand over the next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.2/1">The Bolan Park was built in Bolan, Lashkar Gah, in 2007 at the request of the Governor of Helmand and in response to an identified local need: it functions as a symbol for security and development in the area. The park is providing much-needed recreational space and facilities for the people of Lashkar Gar and the surrounding area. It is open to men, women and children with one day each week being set aside for women's exclusive use. One of the first major events hosted there was a US-funded agricultural fair to promote legal livelihoods attended by 1,700 Afghans. The park was also used for a successful cultural event organised by the Helmand Governor, which attracted more than 2,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.2/2">The UK provided funding for the park through the Provincial Reconstruction Team. The park cost around &pound;420,000 and was built alongside the Helmand River. The costs reflect the fact that during construction gabion walls were put in place to support the river bank, which helps prevent erosion, and to support the Bolan Bridge. In addition, the park has extensive lighting which is important for improving security at night.</p>

This provides information about the amount of assistance received in 2008-09; the projects funded; and the duration of the projects. DFID has supported NGOs for work in Sierra Leone since the end of the conflict in 2002. DFID has not funded the EU or UN to work with NGOs in Sierra Leone from its bilateral budget.</p>

DFID staff based in Sierra Leone are in regular contact with project partners, and NGOs and others responsible for project implementation are required to submit regular reports on progress. It is a requirement to hold detailed annual reviews of each project.</p>

	<p pid="a.680W.3/2">The independent review into redress presented its findings on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-17">17 June 2009</phrase>. The review was not specifically asked to look at the issue of any compensation culture within local government. The review team did commission some focus groups with customers which found that most people, when making complaints about a public service, want a meaningful apology, an acknowledgement of what had gone wrong and a correction of the problem; financial compensation was a low motivator for people seeking redress.</p>
	<p pid="a.680W.3/3">The Department commissioned the review following a commitment made in the Empowerment White Paper. This independent review was chaired by David Cook (CEO Kettering borough council) and looked at how local authorities can not only improve how they deal with complaints but how they can get it right first time. The review focused on the more transactional services provided by local authorities, for example refuse collection, and did not focus on specific redress systems currently in place in local authorities across England.</p>

	<p pid="a.681W.2/1">Civil legal aid covers a number of different areas of civil and family justice, and the extent to which applicants' financial circumstances are taken into account in granting legal aid varies considerably across these areas. It is therefore not possible to give figures for the number of people eligible for civil legal aid as a whole. However, some estimates of the likely number that would be eligible are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.2/2">The estimated proportion of the population of England and Wales who were eligible for civil legal aid, for categories in which financial circumstances were taken into account, was 29 per cent. in 2007. We do not have a figure for 2008. In 2009, we estimate that the figure for categories in which financial circumstances are taken into account is 36 per cent.. This increase in the eligible proportion of the population is likely to be due to the effects of the recession plus the 5 per cent. increase in the civil legal aid financial eligibility limits in April 2009. In 2007-08 civil legal aid helped over 1 million people with their civil and family legal problems.</p>

They are no longer in a position to continue this subsidy. In addition, in the context of the Government's green agenda, it is increasingly hard to justify the use of public funds in this way. They have therefore proposed the introduction of a fee to use their visitors' car park. The organisation is in the process of assessing the full extent of the car park running costs, and it is their intention that the income from the fee enables them to fully recover the costs. They are consulting with users, to gather their views on the level and structure of the charge. They will continue to provide free parking for holders of 'blue badges'.</p>

	<p pid="a.690W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.690W.5/5" class="indent">The paragraph from the 2006 National Audit office report you have referenced sets out the Agency's estimate of the number of cases at the end of March 2006 affected by problems in the Agency's computer system which require cases to be progressed clerically. The Commission continues to publish information on the number of cases which are processed wholly clerically in Table 20 of the Child Support Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics; a copy of which is available in the House of Commons library, or online at:</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.5/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.childmaintenance.org/publications/statistics.html">www.childmaintenance.org/publications/statistics.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.690W.5/7" class="indent">The number of cases the Agency managed wholly clerically at the end of March 2009 was 60,000. Although the need to progress such cases clerically is not ideal, they should not be seen as stuck as around &pound;1 million in child maintenance is now collected each week for these cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.5/8" class="indent">Upgrades to the Agency's computer system one of which was also mentioned in paragraph 13 of the National Audit Office report and implemented successfully in September 2008 have reduced the incidence of cases being affected by problems and made it possible to identify and address problems more easily. At the end of March 2009, an estimated 27,500 cases which remain on the computer system also require partial clerical action to keep maintenance flowing to children. As the Agency continues to improve its client service, increasing the number of cases receiving maintenance, any additional cases identified are immediately investigated and either progressed clerically or the issue is resolved to allow the case to be wholly managed by the Agency's computer system.</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.5/9" class="indent">The number of cases managed clerically will therefore continue to rise in the medium term and information on the numbers so progressed will be published.</p>

This will only take into account the net arrears movement across the year and may miss some payments that have subsequently been cancelled out by further increases in debt within the year.<br/> 4. The figures for March 2009 are at the time of answering this question un-audited internal figures and are subject to revision which will be published in the CSA Annual Report and Accounts for 2008-09.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.695W.2/1">The data source does not allow us to provide robust numbers for estimates below the level of Government office region.</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.2/2">PSA17 includes a range of indicators related to low income for pensioners. These are relative low income (below 50 and 60 per cent. contemporary median household income), and absolute low income (below 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices), all measured after housing costs have been taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.2/3">Latest information for east of England, Government office region, is based on three year averages. There were around 0.2 million pensioners in the east of England below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income threshold between 2001-04 and 2005-07. During the same period, around 0.1 million pensioners in the east of England were below 50 per cent. of contemporary median income threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.2/4">However, between 2001-04 and 2005-07, the percentage of pensioners in the east of England being below the 60 per cent. of contemporary median income, after housing costs, has fallen from 25 per cent. to 16 per cent. The number of pensioners in relative poverty has remained unchanged due to the increase in the pensioner population in the east of England.</p>

	<p pid="a.711W.2/1">All police forces use a mixture of in-house services and those provided by external forensic suppliers to carry out forensic work. For example, crime scene investigators, who will generally be employed by a force, may find fingerprints and material which may carry traces of DNA. The fingerprints are compared with IDENT1, the national fingerprint computer system, which produces a shortlist of possible matches. The shortlist is then examined by fingerprint experts who work for the force Fingerprint Bureau to confirm a match. Analysis of material to produce DNA profiles is done by forensic suppliers rather than in-house. In other areas of forensic work, the balance between in-house and external services will vary depending on the nature of the material examined and decisions made by forces. Details of the position in each police force are not held centrally.</p>
