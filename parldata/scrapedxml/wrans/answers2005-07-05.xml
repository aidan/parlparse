	<p pid=".231W.6/1">The cost of conducting the risk assessment of communal hairbrushes and combs in Members' washrooms was staff time only. The assessment involved Serjeant at Arms staff and professionals from the Parliamentary Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Service and was undertaken as part of their normal duties. Advice was sought from other professionals in relevant enforcement authorities (i.e. Westminster Council's Environmental Health Department and the Health and Safety Executive) at no cost to the House.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.6/2">There have been no reported cases of communicable diseases or infestations relating to the use of communal combs and hairbrushes in Members washrooms over the last 10 years. However health, safety and hygiene standards now mean that the House has a duty of care properly to control health and safety risks to those working at or visiting the House of Commons. A risk assessment was undertaken resulting in the removal of communal combs and hairbrushes as a preventative health measure, following submission of the matter to the Administration Committee in the last Parliament. The risks of communicating disease or infection was one of a number of risk factors highlighted that contributed to the overall risk assessment and decision, though it is acknowledged in the risk assessment that the likelihood of contracting HIV or hepatitis is extremely low. A copy of the risk assessment as provided to the Administration Committee has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".236W.2/1">Since its launch in July 2004 Community Legal Service Direct has established itself as an important new element within the range of publicly funded legal services. The telephone service has received over 300,000 calls, and now regularly receives more than 30,000 calls per month. Many of these are for assistance in finding a local legal adviser, but more than 30,000 people have obtained direct assistance over the phone.</p>
	<p pid=".236W.2/2">The website <a href="http://www.clsdirect.org.uk">www.clsdirect.org.uk</a> has received nearly 750,000 unique visits since its launch, with the average visitor looking at six pages. More than 1.7 million legal information leaflets have been distributed in the first year of operation as more and more are added to the range.</p>

All these new initiatives are based on best practice and on the Stress Management Standards issued by the Health and Safety Executive last year. It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with these activities since they were not accounted for separately. Similarly, we have no records of costs associated with compensation for work-related stress.</p>

	<p pid=".247W.5/1">The dormouse is a priority species with an individual Species Action Plan that is led jointly by English Nature and The Wildlife Trusts. It has also been the subject of an English Nature Species Recovery Programme since 1991. The main reasons for the decline of the dormouse appear to be the fragmentation of our woodlands coupled with inappropriate woodland management. The dormouse recovery programme has sought to address these issues. Guidance on woodland management to favour dormice was published in 1996 and has been followed by a series of training courses for woodland managers. Awareness of the needs of the dormouse is now very high. In addition, the Forestry Commission has a large programme to restore planted ancient woodland sites, which will favour the dormouse. An innovative research programme, carried out at Royal Holloway, University of London, showed the importance of hedgerows for dormice and guidance on hedgerow management was published by English Nature in 2002. 'Dormouse friendly' hedgerows are now an option in the Government's new Environmental Scheme. A greatly-expanded conservation handbook on dormice will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".247W.5/2">As well as efforts to improve the countryside for dormice, the species has been reintroduced into some parts of England from which it was lost. A partnership between English Nature and the People's Trust for Endangered Species, with veterinary support from the Institute of Zoology, has now carried out 14 reintroductions to 11 counties, using dormice supplied by the Common Dormouse Captive Breeders Group. Follow-up surveys have confirmed the success of this approach, with the first reintroduction now more than 10-years-old. The most recent reintroduction was to the Chatsworth Estate, Derbyshire in June this year.</p>
	<p pid=".247W.5/3">Estimating the number of dormice is difficult as the species is very under-recorded. The first Great Nut Hunt in 1993 greatly increased the number of known sites for the species and a national inventory of more than 1,300 sites is now available through the National Biodiversity Network. More than 200 of these sites now contribute to the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme by counting the number of dormice in nest-boxes every summer. These data, summarised in the report of the Tracking Mammals Project, have shown that, nationally, the dormouse population has declined by 23 per cent. since 1993, though it has been relatively stable in recent years. However, there are indications that the species remains vulnerable at the edge of its range, particularly in the marginal uplands, so there is an on-going need for conservation work. A recent estimate of the national population suggested that there are in the region of 45,000 dormice in Britain.</p>

While this is a relatively modest share, this represents an increase of 68 per cent. from 1990 levels. Furthermore, in their 1999 Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the total climate change effect from aviation is approximately two-four times larger than the effect of its CO <sub>2</sub> emissions alone. The EU has recognised the need to tackle this growing area of emissions in the absence of other international action.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.2/2">The use of emissions trading allows the coverage of environmental costs through a mixture of emissions reductions within the sector and purchase of reductions that can be produced more cheaply by other sectors. The advantage of emissions trading is that, through the use of a defined emissions cap, it guarantees a desired environmental outcome in a way that other instruments, such as charges, do not. Furthermore, it ensures that the emissions reductions required to achieve a particular environmental outcome take place in as cost-effective a manner as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.2/3">For an international industry, an international trading regime is the best solution. The Government have made taking forward the work programme for the inclusion of aviation emissions into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme a priority for the UK presidency of the EU. While there are further instruments that may be appropriate, our focus is on emissions trading as the most cost effective way of delivering our environmental objective.</p>

	<p pid=".253W.2/1">The latest meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was a successful meeting for the UK. All key UK objectives were achieved, most notably: retention of the moratorium on commercial whaling and the Southern Ocean Sanctuary; rejection of secret ballots; adoption of a Resolution, criticising Japan's plans to significantly increase its scientific whaling programme; and agreement by consensus to hold a Workshop on Whale Killing Methods and Associated Issues.</p>
	<p pid=".253W.2/2">The UK is opposed to whaling and strongly supports the current IWC moratorium on commercial whaling. We do not believe there is any justification for whaling apart from some limited subsistence whaling by indigenous people. We believe that whaling does not serve any genuine need and involves unacceptable cruelty.</p>

	<p pid=".256W.3/1">DEFRA's current sickness absence system does not differentiate between stress and work-related stress. So the number of reported cases of work-related stress and work days lost as a result cannot be calculated.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.3/2">There are no records of compensation being paid out for work-related stress.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.3/3">The Department has set a target to reduce the number of working days lost from work-related injury and ill-health by 30 per cent. by 2010. This mirrors the revitalising health and safety strategy target.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.3/4">DEFRA was established in June 2001. Since then the management board has established a sub-committee on stress which recommended a number of actions. The Department has a stress policy and stress strategy and was one of the first organisations to pilot the Health and Safety Executive's Management Standards for Stress. The Department has several initiatives to help address stress such as assistance to aid managers when undertaking stress risk assessments. It regularly runs stress workshops and roadshows aimed at raising awareness in staff and managers.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.3/5">It is not possible to quantify the cost of this strategy without detailed analysis of all work groups which is not practicable.</p>

	<p pid=".257W.2/1">The Army Reviewing Authority has no authority over civil cases or cases heard in civilian courts. The Armed Forces Act 1996, under a revised Section 113 of the Army Act 1955, established the Army Reviewing Authority to deal with courts-martial proceedings and petitions.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/2">The Army Act defines the reviewing authority as the Defence Council or any Officer to whom all or any powers of the Defence Council as reviewing authority may be delegated. In practice the Army Board of the Defence Council has delegated its powers of review to the following personnel&mdash;the Deputy Adjutant General, the Director Personal Services (Army) or any Colonel under the direct command of the Director Personal Services (Army).</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/3">When a case is reviewed by the Army Reviewing Authority there is no actual hearing, therefore it is not possible for anyone to attend. This system of review is similar for all three services and the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force also have reviewing authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/4">All Army courts-martial proceedings are reviewed whether or not a petition by the accused or his/her legal representative has been presented. Legal advice is always provided by a judge from the office of the Judge Advocate General.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/5">The reviewing authority may quash or substitute the finding or the sentence passed by the court-martial. When a reviewing authority substitutes a sentence it must be a sentence which could have been awarded by the court-martial and it must not be more severe than the original sentence. The accused and their representative are informed of the result of a review by the reviewing authority but the result is not otherwise publicly presented.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/6">It will be proposed in the Armed Forces Bill, which is due to be introduced later this year, that the process of review is discontinued in all three services. The safeguards for service personnel can be provided in a modern system by full rights of appeal against both finding and sentence to the court martial appeal court, and by bail pending appeal.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.2/7">The detail requested about cases reviewed in the last five years could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However the following information gives an overview of activity by the Army Reviewing Authority (ARA).</p>

	<p pid=".258W.2/1">An initial Bowman operational capability has been achieved and it is having a direct and positive effect on the communications capability with UK Forces on Operation Telic 6 in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.2/2">The deployment of 12 Mechanised Brigade to Iraq in April 2005, with a core Bowman capability alongside some existing Clansman capability, marked a critical milestone in the incremental Bowman programme as this was the first operational use of the system. Overall, the feedback has been positive. In particular, the voice quality and coverage achieved over differing environments have vastly improved. It is being used in a range of modes, providing both secure and insecure communications, and interoperability with non-Bowman units.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.2/3">The personal role radio with a 500m effective range, has significantly enhanced low level command and control wherever deployed, including on operations in Iraq. 50,000 radios have been issued to date.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.2/4">Bowman is not a direct replacement for Clansman and there are still issues to be resolved. Problems encountered in fitting Bowman to complex warfighting platforms such as Challenger 2, Warrior and turreted armoured vehicles have introduced delays. The Ministry of Defence is working closely with the Bowman Prime Contractor and Design Authorities to resolve these issues. To date, over 2,600 vehicles have been converted.</p>

	<p pid=".262W.11/1">The Ministry of Defence is pursuing a twin-track strategy to explore the conceptual thinking and underlying technology for unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). The former involves participation in the US Joint Unmanned Combat Air System Programme concept work. The latter is focused on ensuring the UK is able to make intelligent choices with respect to UCAV design, technology development and manufacture, and is intended to enhance the UK's industrial position to undertake either an indigenous or collaborative programme should a firm military requirement for UCAVs emerge in the future. Under our Defence Industrial Policy we routinely consider the benefits of producing new defence equipment in the UK when taking procurement decisions.</p>

	<p pid=".264W.6/1">The UK Government are currently supporting poverty eradication in Haiti through our contributions to, and engagement with, the international community working in Haiti, and through our support to civil society organisations operating in Haiti.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.6/2">The Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) in Haiti sets out a comprehensive plan for poverty eradication and stabilisation in Haiti. The UK Government are supporting the implementation of this plan through our contributions to the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the European Commission (EC). The UK share of the pledges these institutions have made to the ICF is approximately &pound;35 million.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.6/3">The UK is also currently engaged in the negotiation of the 6th Replenishment of the Caribbean Development Bank's (CDB)s concessional fund, the Special Development Fund (SDF). A major issue for this replenishment is Haiti's imminent accession to membership of the CDB, and the terms under which Haiti will access resources from the SDF.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.6/4">Through its engagement with the international donor community, the UK Government have also been advocating for better donor co-ordination, reduction of implementation bottlenecks and greater poverty focus, in order to ensure positive impacts on the ground for poor Haitians. In light of the links between security and poverty eradication, the UK Government are also supporting the international efforts to improve the security situation and to follow up security operations with social, economic and humanitarian programmes. For example, the UK contributes 7.4 per cent. of the budget of the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), likely to be &pound;20 million in 2005&ndash;06. In 2004, DFID also provided some &pound;4 million in humanitarian assistance to Haiti in response to the political unrest, the May floods, and Tropical Storm Jeanne. This too was channelled through international NGOs, the Red Cross Movement, United Nations humanitarian agencies, and our share of European Community humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.6/5">The UK Government also supports NGOs in their poverty eradication efforts in Haiti. Currently, five of the British NGOs supported through DFID's Partnerships Programme Agreements for Latin America and the Caribbean include Haiti in their existing or planned country coverage. DFID has allocated a total of &pound;6.2 million to these NGOs in 2005&ndash;06 (CARE&mdash;&pound;1.5 million, OXFAM&mdash;&pound;1.5 million, Christian Aid&mdash;&pound;1.1 million, CAFOD&mdash;&pound;1.1 million and the International HIV/AIDS Alliance&mdash;&pound;1 million). The FCO also supports small-scale poverty-focused civil society projects in Haiti through its Small Grants Scheme. The 2005&ndash;06 allocation for this scheme is &pound;100,000.</p>

	<p pid=".265W.2/1">Health care professionals are clearly a crucial element of any health system and the UK Government are concerned about the severe shortages of health workers in some developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Migration of health workers to the UK and elsewhere can contribute to these shortages, which is why the UK has a Code of Practice for International Recruitment of Healthcare Professionals available at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">http://www.dh.gov.uk</a>. The Code of Practice prevents the NHS from actively recruiting health care professionals from low and middle-income countries unless there is a Government-to-Government agreement in place.</p>
	<p pid=".265W.2/2">International migration is, however, just one of the factors contributing to the shortages of health workers in many developing countries. Other factors include lack of training capacity, workers leaving the health sector due to poor pay and working conditions, difficulties in deploying staff to rural areas, and the effects of HIV and AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".265W.2/3">DFID believes that addressing these shortages requires the development and implementation of comprehensive country-led plans, which increase the numbers of health workers trained, but also include measures to improve pay and incentives, working conditions, distribution, effective planning and management, and improving the performance of existing workers. An example of where DFID is supporting such a plan is Malawi where we are working with the Government to implement an emergency human resource programme, which aims to almost double the number of health workers in Malawi over the next six years.</p>

	<p pid=".266W.8/1">In 2003, the global TB mortality rate was estimated as 1,747,000. 538,000 (about 30 per cent.) of these deaths are in Africa <sup>1</sup> . There are no reliable all-cause mortality data&mdash;so it is difficult to give a figure on the proportion of deaths in Africa that are accounted for by tuberculosis.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.8/2">However, TB deaths are increasing in Africa after almost 40 years of decline. In particular, TB is a leading cause of death in patients with AIDS. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa up to 70 per cent. of TB patients are co-infected with HIV&mdash;70 per cent. of the 14 million people worldwide who have both HIV and TB are in Africa <sup>2</sup> .</p>

	<p pid=".267W.6/19"><sup>(9)</sup> When making estimates using older figures, we calculate the fraud per unit benefit expenditure and uprate the monetary value estimate by applying this rate to current expenditure.

	<p pid=".267W.6/21">Benefits measured prior to 1997 are not included because the measurement methodology was different previous to this and, thus, the results are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid=".267W.6/22">For the year to March 2004, around &pound;600 million was estimated to have been overpaid due to fraud and error in housing benefit (HB). Fraud is estimated to have accounted for between a quarter and a half of the &pound;600 million, depending upon how much of the overpaid HB arising from &quot;non residence&quot; was due to fraud. Non-residence fraud and error is where the claimant is not resident at the property for which HB is being paid. In these circumstances, it is often hard for our investigators to ascertain whether there was fraudulent intent.</p>

	<p pid=".268W.8/1">During its first year, the Pension Protection Fund is expected to raise approximately &pound;150 million through the initial levy. For subsequent years, the amounts will be determined by the Pension Protection Fund within the limits set by Secretary of State through setting a levy ceiling. The Pension Protection Fund expects to consult shortly on its proposed approach to setting the levy for future years.</p>
	<p pid=".268W.8/2">It is the responsibility of the trustee or the pension scheme manager to pay the PPF levies. The levy is a charge in respect of each member, rather than a fee to be paid by each member. The trustees may choose to pass the costs onto the employer by way of increased employer contributions to the scheme. The employer may in turn pass the costs to employees who are active members of the scheme but they may not pass the cost to pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".268W.8/3">The Pension Protection Fund will not be funded with public funds. If the Government were to provide the funding the costs would ultimately fall on ordinary taxpayers, the majority of whom do not have access to a defined benefit occupational pension scheme. Further we have designed the Pension Protection Fund to be financially self sufficient without recourse to the Government.</p>

	<p pid=".285W.2/2">The Government have made clear their long-term ambition of raising R&amp;D intensity in the UK from its current level of 1.9 per cent. of national income to 2.5 per cent. by 2014. To support business investment in research, technology and development, the DTI provides a range of solutions that offer practical support and encouragement to industry at different stages of the innovation process.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/3">DTI established a business-led Technology Strategy Board in October 2004 to develop a national technology strategy to take a more strategic market-led approach to Government support for new and emerging technologies crucial to innovation.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/4">The Board has oversight of the &pound;370 million technology programme that provides grant funding for business-led projects. Over the period 2005&ndash;08, &pound;320 million of DTI funding is available to businesses in the form of grants to support collaborative research and development in technology areas identified as critical to the growth of the UK economy. A further &pound;50 million contribution has been agreed by DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/5">All businesses can take advantage of a range of business support products designed to help the transfer of knowledge from the research base to industry&mdash;collaborative R&amp;D Grants and Knowledge Transfer Networks, through the technology programme, and knowledge transfer partnerships, that provide support for business R&amp;D in kind.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/6">Additional solutions for small businesses include the Grant for R&amp;D, which provides grants to help individuals and small and medium-sized businesses research and develop technologically innovative products and processes.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/7">Companies carrying out more than a minimum level of eligible R&amp;D can claim R&amp;D tax credits that are particularly generous for small firms and include a repayable element.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/8">The DTI also supports UK businesses and HEIs as active participants in EU framework programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.2/9">In addition to these direct investment and incentives, a range of other policies influence overall R&amp;D expenditure. For example UKTI efforts to secure inward investment, public procurement, regulation, innovation infrastructure including intellectual property, skills and standards, and national and regional activities to support enterprise and business growth more generally, such as the work of Business Links.</p>

It is one element in our package of proposals for increasing access to low cost home ownership as set out in our consultation paper &quot;Homebuy&mdash;expanding the opportunity to own&quot; published in April 2005.

The development sites for successful bidders will be provided by English Partnerships and other public bodies. English Partnerships anticipate that construction of homes will start in early 2006 with some completions by the end of 2006. The competition will aim to provide 1,000 homes all to eco-homes very good standard and will include a mix of housing types and tenures as defined by site specific design briefs. We anticipate that about 30 per cent. of the homes built will contribute to the first-time buyers initiative.</p>

The cost of the Valuation Office Agency's work in preparing for and delivering the council tax revaluation in England on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> is currently estimated at &pound;139.3 million, excluding any element of contingency. This includes expenditure on electronic capture and enhancement of hard copy records and in development of an automated valuation model capability that will also benefit future revaluations. Beyond <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, the Valuation Office Agency are currently estimating additional costs above baseline of around &pound;38 million in 2007&ndash;08 arising from an expected increase in workload arising from appeals. Final costs will however depend in part on the recommendations of Sir Michael Lyons' independent inquiry into local Government funding.</p>

	<p pid=".301W.8/1">The purpose of providing the information in the proposed energy report is to encourage people to improve the energy performance of their homes. Consequently, the Energy Reports will contain a SAP rating along with information on energy consumption and carbon emissions. The SAP rating, which is based on fuel prices, is included because research indicates that people are most motivated to make energy efficiency investments by reductions in their fuel bills. The external costs of fuel use are reflected in the carbon emissions data. It is not possible to include information on other external costs from fuel use as these are insufficiently quantifiable.</p>

	<p pid=".302W.5/1">Local housing authorities can already discharge a duty to secure accommodation for a homeless household by arranging the provision of an assured shorthold tenancy in the private sector. The provision of such a tenancy can be used to provide temporary accommodation, pending the availability of settled accommodation. Moreover, where a main homelessness duty is owed to an applicant under section 193(2) of the Housing Act 1996, the offer of an assured shorthold tenancy will bring this duty to an end (as settled accommodation) if the offer is a qualifying offer and the applicant accepts the offer.</p>

	<p pid=".305W.2/1">This Government have made a number of changes to improve eligibility for homelessness assistance in England since May 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.2/2">Under the homelessness legislation, eligible applicants must also be unintentionally homeless and have a priority need in order to be entitled to accommodation. In July 2002 we extended the priority need categories to include, broadly, young people aged 16 or 17, young people under 21 previously in care, applicants vulnerable as a result of time spent in care, in the armed forces, in prison or on remand, and applicants vulnerable as a result of fleeing their home because of violence. These changes have widened the homelessness safety net and ensure that more vulnerable homeless people are given the help they need.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.2/3">In most cases, the main duty to secure accommodation under the homelessness legislation is ended with the offer of a long-term social tenancy. Local authorities' allocation schemes for social housing must be framed so as to give reasonable preference to certain categories of applicant. In July 1997, we extended the reasonable preference categories to include people owed the main homelessness duties. This effectively restored the long-standing rights of people owed the main homelessness duties that had been removed by the Housing Act 1996. In 2002, the reasonable preference categories were revised and broadened to include people owed other homelessness duties and people who were homeless, whether owed a duty or not.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.2/4">A number of specific changes to the rules on eligibility have been made since 1997 in relation to people coming to England from abroad. These have included:</p>
	<p pid=".305W.2/5" class="indent">exemptions from the requirement to be habitually resident in the common travel area (CTA) for people who left Montserrat because of the effect on that territory of a volcanic eruption,</p>
	<p pid=".305W.2/6" class="indent">removal of eligibility for all asylum seekers who claimed asylum after <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-02">2 April 2000</phrase>, when the National Asylum Support Service took on responsibility for providing asylum seekers with appropriate accommodation and support, and for nationals of countries that were signatories to, but which had not ratified, the European Convention on Social and Medical Assistance or the European Social Charter, and</p>

	<p pid=".305W.5/1">Hidden homelessness is a subjective definition, varying between different agencies and individuals. We have a number of objective measures to identify and assess levels of homelessness and a range of wider housing needs which can be used to inform housing and homelessness strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.5/2">PIE data records all decisions on households who apply to local housing authorities for homelessness assistance. This includes those who are found to be homeless (unintentionally or intentionally) and in priority need. It also includes those found not to be in priority need or not homeless. The data can be analysed, and are published quarterly, at national, regional and local authority levels. The total number of decisions on applications by authorities has been falling during 2004, indicating that fewer people are becoming homeless.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.5/3">Additionally, annual returns from local authorities identify the number of people who are literally roofless and sleeping rough on a single night, from local head counts or estimates. The number of people sleeping out on a single night has fallen by more than 70 per cent. since 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.5/4">Through Supporting People we collect data on the number of people regarded by service providers as homeless or at risk of homelessness who are provided with housing related support.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.5/5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also collects a range of data on wider forms of housing need, including concealed households, overcrowding and households living in poor quality homes. These are reported in regular ODPM publications&mdash;the English House Condition Survey and the Survey of English Housing.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.5/6">At the local level, local authorities homelessness reviews&mdash;required to be undertaken every five years by the Homelessness Act 2002&mdash;should identify levels of all forms of homelessness in the local district and be used to inform a local homelessness strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".306W.2/1">We have improved the amount of detailed information we collect on households in priority need and those in temporary accommodation, and have widened the categories of people given priority.</p>
	<p pid=".306W.2/2">We have made some minor technical changes to improve the accuracy of the regional and national estimates of households in priority need and households in temporary accommodation, to account for non-response and have taken further steps to improve the response rate, which now stands at over 95 per cent. each quarter.</p>
	<p pid=".306W.2/3">We have made no changes since 1997 to the methodology for calculating the number of rough sleepers. The most recent national figure of around 508 people sleeping rough on any one night (70 per cent. down on 1998) is based on a higher number of recent counts and less reliance on estimates than any previous national estimate and is therefore likely to be even more accurate.</p>

	<p pid=".330W.8/1">Prime Minister Sharon's stated position is that the barrier and restrictions on freedom of movement are defensive measures necessary to protect Israel against terrorism. On settlements, Prime Minister Sharon has stated that no new settlements are being built and has said that following the completion of disengagement, the Israeli Government will dismantle outposts built since March 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.8/2">The UK Government's consistent view is that, while Israel has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks such as suicide bombings, which we condemn absolutely, Israel must act within international law. Settlement construction and the building of the barrier on occupied land are contrary to international law.</p>

	<p pid=".331W.0/1">All of the military equipment the UK has gifted to Nepal since 2001 as part of our conflict prevention strategy has been non-lethal and cannot easily be adapted for offensive purposes. The main items of hardware have been two transport helicopters and two unarmed Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) surveillance aircraft. We have also provided land rovers, bomb disposal equipment and basic individual equipment.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.0/2">Both the helicopters and the STOL aircraft were provided on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and the Government of Nepal, under which the Nepalese have committed themselves not to use or adapt the aircraft for attack purposes. The Defence Attach&eacute; at the British Embassy in Kathmandu and his staff make regular random visits to inspect the helicopters, only one of which survives owing to accident, and the STOL aircraft to ensure that they have not been fitted with offensive capabilities. In the case of the STOL aircraft such fixtures would involve considerable structural alteration. We have seen no evidence to suggest that these aircraft have been armed or used improperly. Periodically we remind the Nepalese of their obligations as set out in the Memorandum of Understanding governing the use of this equipment.</p>

	<p pid=".331W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.3/2">The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill removes appeal rights for all students refused entry clearance, a policy that was announced in the Five Year Strategy Controlling our borders: Making migration work for Britain. Once the Act comes into effect genuine students will continue to be granted entry clearance to study in the United Kingdom. The majority of applications for entry clearance as a student are granted and data from 2003 indicates that only about one percent of students who gained entry into the UK did so as the result of a successful appeal. Since 2001&ndash;02 the number of people granted entry clearance to study has increased by over 20 per cent. from 121,466 to 146,538 in 2003&ndash;04. Entry into the UK to study should be a privilege and not a right and changes to the appeals system reflect this distinction. We will maintain appeal rights where fundamental issues are raised, such as when people are refused entry clearance to visit family members. Other countries, including Canada and Australia, confer no appeal rights on people who are refused entry clearance as students. Proposals are currently being developed to increase, in a manageable way, the number of people coming to the UK to study; to provide these people with a high quality education; and to ensure the integrity of the immigration control. The requirements of the new system will be as objective and verifiable as possible and for the system to be as quick and easy to operate. A formal consultation exercise will be undertaken.</p>

	<p pid=".337W.5/2">Some District Commands, in particular those where a habitual problem exists, have adopted a pro-active approach to tackle this issue producing information leaflets which are distributed both to officers and members of the public. These outline the responsibilities of people using these vehicles and the minimum legal requirements associated with their use. In addition to the owners of such vehicles and the parents of children who ride them, contact has also been made with motorcycle retailers, reminding them of the need to encourage a responsible and legal use of such vehicles by members of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".337W.5/3">The Government are committed to ensuring that the police have the powers they need to tackle illegal use of scramblers and quads.

	<p pid=".345W.1/2">Our objective is to ensure that people have a well-informed choice between private and readily accessible national health service dental treatment. In addition, we wish to ensure people on low incomes, who are particularly vulnerable to dental disease and are exempt from dental charges, continue to receive free treatment. This would not be guaranteed through the provision of either vouchers or refunds, because the dentist could require the voucher to be topped, while the refund might not meet the full cost of private dental treatment. We are, therefore, concentrating resources on the reform of NHS dentistry. In this financial year, funding for NHS dentistry in England is set to rise by &pound;250 million&mdash;an increase of 19 per cent., compared with spending in 2003&ndash;04. People requiring NHS dental treatment may contact NHS Direct, who are able to respond, to 90 per cent. of inquiries with information on a dental practice accessible within locally agreed standards.</p>

	<p pid=".348W.8/1">Health Direct will be set up from 2007. It will be developed as a telephone, internet and digital television service. The aim is to provide easily accessible information on health choices. It will include links to existing health improvement services, including diet, nutrition and support for parents.</p>
	<p pid=".348W.8/2">A scoping study is being undertaken during 2005 to establish customer, operational and technical requirements for Health Direct. The decision to determine which are the most appropriate management and operational structures to deliver the Health Direct service will be taken in spring 2006, prior to commencement of a procurement phase, which we expect to complete by the end of 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.8/1">We welcome this new development in the fight against malaria, which continues to claim the lives of one to two million people world-wide each year. Reducing morbidity and mortality due to malaria depends on a coordinated attack on the mosquito vector by personal protective measures, for example, insecticide-impregnated bed nets, and community mosquito control programmes, on prompt diagnosis and treatment of malaria in individual patients with antimalarial drugs. Vaccines are under development but will not be available in the short to medium term.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.8/2">Recent reports have shown that adult Anopheles mosquitoes can be infected and killed by several species of fungi. The fungi can be sprayed on surfaces, cloths or netting.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.8/3">Recent laboratory studies have shown that exposing adult Anopheles Stephens! mosquitoes that have been infected with rodent malaria to the fungus reduces the number of mosquitoes that are able to transmit infection by a factor of 80 <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid=".352W.8/4">A recent trial in houses in a rural area of Tanzania showed that the fungus killed wild adult Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, which are the major vector of malaria in Africa, and suggests that this method could significantly reduce the intensity of malaria transmission <sup>2</sup> .</p>
	<p pid=".352W.8/5">Further studies are required to assess the potential of this method of controlling mosquitoes for inclusion in a coordinated programme against malaria.</p>

The results revealed a small difference in the parameters mentioned in the question between the animals fed the highest amount of MON 863 maize, compared with those in one given one of the diets containing non-GM maize. Such findings are not unusual in studies of this type, where several dozen parameters are being evaluated across a number of treatment groups and interpretation of the results requires expert analysis of the statistical basis for the apparent differences and their biological significance. These data have been analysed independently by expert groups in the United Kingdom and at the European Food Safety Authority, who have concluded that the results of the study are not indicative of adverse effects due to the consumption of MON 863 maize.</p>

	<p pid=".360W.2/3">The Department is working closely with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, the NHS workforce review team and NHS organisations to help junior physiotherapists to find first posts of employment. As a result of this collaborative work, there is an action plan in place to ensure local managers have access to a range of strategies across recruitment, commissioning and skill mix. It is the responsibility of local NHS employers and strategic health authorities to ensure there are sufficient numbers of physiotherapists to meet service needs.</p>

	<p pid=".364W.2/2">For men who suspect that they have chlamydia, diagnoses and treatment are provided through genitor-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics. The public health White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&mdash;making healthy choices easier&quot; published in November 2004 sets out a number of measures to improve access to, and modernise, GUM services. These measures are backed by &pound;130 million additional revenue and capital investment over three years, and will support clinics in moving towards the target of maximum 48 hour waiting times for clinic appointments.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.2/3">In terms of detecting asymptomatic chlamydia infection, the Department's policy is to promote greater uptake of chlamydia testing and treatment through the national chlamydia screening programme. This opportunistic programme targets sexually active men and women under 25, who are most at risk of infection. We recognise that there are particular challenges in encouraging young men to access chlamydia screening as they do not attend health services as regularly as young women. We are, therefore, encouraging local programmes to evaluate which venues work best in terms of screening young men, for example colleges, workplaces and sports facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.2/4">Young men and women are also targeted with information about chlamydia through our national sexual health media campaigns, including a major new campaign to be launched later this year, as announced in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.2/5">The White Paper, also included a commitment to accelerate the roll-out of the national chlamydia screening programme, with the goal of making this available across the country by March 2007, backed by investment of an extra &pound;80 million to achieve this aim.</p>

In this context, we have been informed by the oral health division of the Centers for Disease Control that the author of the thesis has invited them to review her findings as part of the peer review process conducted before a research study is published.

	<p pid=".374W.2/1">Information on the total number of asylum seekers currently in the UK, including failed asylum seekers, is not available. This could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. In addition some applicants may leave the United Kingdom without informing the Immigration Service. E-borders and ID cards will enable us to monitor this more precisely in the future. The Home Office published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>, the outcome of the assessment of the applicability to the UK of the methods used by researchers and Government agencies in other countries to estimate the size of the illegal population. The methods had been identified in the report by the Migration Research Unit (MRU) of University College London on &quot;Sizing the Illegally Resident Population in the UK&quot;. A copy of the RDS On-line report 29/05&mdash;&quot;Sizing the unauthorised (illegal) migrant population in the United Kingdom in 2001&quot; can be found at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/notes/june_summaries.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/notes/june_summaries.html</a>. As in other countries, the number of &quot;unauthorised&quot; or &quot;illegal&quot; migrants&mdash;including failed asylum seekers&mdash;in the UK is unknown. The MRU report published last year reviewed the methods used in other countries and assessed their viability for use in the UK. That report suggested that a method which could be applied in the UK is the &quot;residual method&quot; used in the United States. The new report details how that method has been applied in the UK. It must be emphasised that, while this method is one that can be used with data available for the UK, over-reliance must not be placed on this result in the absence of the means to produce other estimates using different methods.</p>

	<p pid=".378W.11/1">Routine crime statistics used for monitoring overall crime trends do not contain information on the offender's drinking or drug habits. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the proportion of all crime that is either alcohol-related or drug-related. However, there is some information available on this area.</p>
	<p pid=".378W.11/2"><i>(a)</i> The 2003 Offending, Crime and Justice Survey (OCJS) is a large scale nationally representative self-report offending survey of 10 to 65-year-olds living in private household in England and Wales. In the 2003 OCJS one in 10 incidents reported (10 per cent.) were committed when the offender had taken alcohol. Across offences as a whole, 6 per cent. of offenders said what happened was at least partly due to being drunk, when asked for their motivation for offending. A much higher proportion of criminal damage incidents (26 per cent.) and vehicle related thefts (16 per cent.) were attributed to drunkenness than violent incidents (7 per cent).</p>
	<p pid=".378W.11/3"><i>(b)</i> Most crime by drug users is acquisitive crime. The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involved interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, provides an insight into the proportion of crimes that are drug related. In interviews carried out between 1999 and 2001, 31 per cent. of all arrestees included in the survey and 43 per cent. of those held for property offences tested positive for opiates, such as heroin. However, this survey is not nationally representative. A new Arrestee Survey is currently being undertaken which will provide nationally representative information on the proportion of crime that is drug-related in the future.</p>

	<p pid=".382W.14/1">Domestic violence is not separately identified in recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office. Figures are available within the suite of Strategic Performance Indicators for the police, relating to domestic violence &quot;incidents&quot; notified by police forces in England and Wales, however this is whether or not they are subsequently recorded as crimes. The British Crime Survey (BCS) routinely provides information on the number of incidents of domestic violence against men and women (but not on the actual number of victims), but this is not broken down by age (see the following table). The 2003&ndash;04 BCS estimated that there were, in total, 298,000 incidents of domestic violence against women in England and Wales, and 150,000 against men. The number of incidents of domestic violence as measured by the BCS has decreased by 42 per cent. from 1999 to 2003&ndash;04 BCS interviews. The BCS figures are estimates only. As they are derived from a sample they are subject to sampling error, also the context of the face-to-face BCS interview means the estimates are certain to be underestimates of the true extent due to the fact that some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. To address this, self-completion components for those aged 16&ndash;59 on domestic violence have been included in the 1996, 2001, 2004&ndash;05, and 2005&ndash;06 BCS. Results from the 2001 BCS self-completion module on domestic violence were published in Home Office Research Study No. 276, deposited in the Library. This more confidential approach to measurement, revealed prevalence (percentage of population victim at least once) rates for last year domestic assault that were approximately five times higher than in the main face-to-face BCS. This report also provides the prevalence risk of domestic violence for men and women by age group (Table 5.12). This showed that risk of victimisation generally decreased with age, for both men and women.</p>

	<p pid=".383W.2/2">Statistics on the number of persons charged with an offence are not collected centrally. Offences involving domestic violence are not identifiable on the Home Office Court Proceedings database as no specific statute covers such offences. Prosecutions brought might range from common assault to homicide depending on the level of violence, and as the circumstances of the offences for which prosecutions are brought are not collected centrally, offences involving domestic violence cannot be distinguished from other offences within these categories. However, we have now developed a new Key Diagnostic Indicator with the Crown Prosecution Service that will complement the new Compass Case Management System, to track domestic violence cases. This new indicator was implemented in April 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".385W.3/1">The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involved interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, included questions on carrying guns. A paper based on the data has been published by T H Bennett and K Holloway, &quot;Possession and use of illegal guns among criminals in England and Wales&quot; (Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, Vol 43, No three, pp 237&ndash;252). The Home Office has also conducted an arrestee survey which may highlight this issue. The results of this survey will be published later this year. There have also been discussions in the context of the Home Secretary's round table on gun crime, which has looked at possible links and appropriate interventions. This research is used to inform policy and legislative proposals. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill includes a number of measures designed to further tighten the firearms legislation, including a ban on the manufacture, import or sale of realistic imitation firearms, an increase from a maximum of six to 12 months sentence for carrying an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, and an increase in the minimum age for possession of an air weapon to 18. The Bill also includes a new offence of using another person to look after, hide or transport a dangerous weapon. These measures complement existing legislation and demonstrate our determination to tackle gun crime.</p>

	<p pid=".385W.9/1">The information requested is not available. It would be disproportionate to require the police and courts to obtain, verify and record this information in all cases. Information on nationality and immigration status can be a key part of the investigation of terrorist offences and the police and immigration service work closely together in these cases. The available evidence suggests that only a small number of foreign nationals, asylum seekers or refugees commit serious crimes. Statistics on the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism legislation from 1979 to 2001 are available on the Research and Statistics section of the Home Office website. Statistics since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, under the Terrorism Act 2000 are also available.

	<p pid=".386W.2/1">It is not possible to provide a precise time scale of when all those currently being considered under the exercise will have had a decision made on their case. The time it takes to reach a decision depends both on individual circumstances and on the number of cases in the consideration process. Sometimes people do not complete the Family ILR Exercise Questionnaire properly, or fail to provide the documentation requested. The checks we conduct on potentially eligible applicants can also take some time to complete, depending on individual circumstances. We also encounter a number of complex cases that can take some time to resolve. The main factor, though, which makes providing a meaningful completion date for the exercise difficult, is the substantial number of cases we still have to consider. In addition, cases we had not previously identified for consideration under the exercise continue to come to light which we are also required to respond to. We are hoping to have completed consideration of the majority of cases by the end of April 2006. Key statistics relating to the Family ILR Exercise were published as part of the quarterly asylum statistics on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-17">17 May</phrase>. These show the current status of the exercise up to and including <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> and are available to the public on the Home Office (HO) Research Development and Statistics (RDS) website. The full web address is:<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html</a>. These statistics will be updated in August to cover the second quarter of 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".396W.5/1">At the Association of Chief Police Officers' conference on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-19">19 May</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made it clear that he did not believe that the current structure of 43 forces was the most efficient and effective arrangement for organising policing in England and Wales. He also made clear that he had no blueprint for force amalgamations, but that the initiative for such amalgamations should ideally be driven locally. To inform the way forward, the Home Secretary has commissioned Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine the issue of force structures. As well as looking at the case for structural changes, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will also be examining the case for greater collaboration and co-operation between forces. Following the Home Secretary's speech, the chairman of the Gloucestershire Police Authority raised the matter of force amalgamations with the Home Office Director of Policing Policy who relayed to the Chairman the position as set out above.</p>

Visa fees are generally a relatively small part of the overall students costs and there are many other factors; course costs, cost of living, exchange rates that influence the decision of where to study. Following the fee increase in 2002, the number of student applications during 2003&ndash;04 increased by approximately 24 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.0/1">The Government carried out a fundamental review of the alcohol licensing regime which resulted in the Licensing Act 2003. The suggestion that a change to the legislation relating to the drinking of alcohol to make it an offence to drink in public if a person is under the age of 18 did not feature in the responses to the public consultation on those proposals, nor during the passage of the Bill through Parliament. The Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997, as amended by the Licensing Act 2003 to allow the confiscation of sealed containers, already provides the police with a power of confiscation where young people are drinking on the street. The 1997 Act was designed to allow the police to deal with situations where drinking causes a nuisance to others or may lead to further bad behaviour. It does not create an offence for a young person to have an alcoholic drink in a public place and the police are not under a duty to confiscate alcohol from underage drinkers. During the course of the legislation, Parliament made it clear that it did not wish the power to be used where young people's drinking was not perceived to be a problem, for instance at a family picnic.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.3/1">The Violent Crime Reduction Bill provides for exemptions to be made from the charge in Alcohol Disorder Zones, where the principal use to which the premises is put do not include alcohol, and the availability of alcohol is not the main reason why individuals enter or remain on the premises. The intention is to exclude restaurants from the charge. Providing that a hotel also met the above criteria, then the establishment would be exempt from the charge.</p>
