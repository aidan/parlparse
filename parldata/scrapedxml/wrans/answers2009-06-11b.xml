	<p pid="b.951W.8/1">The Government are committed to tackling sexual violence across the country. In 2007, it published a three year national Cross Government Action Plan on Sexual Violence and Abuse. Since the publication of the action plan, the Government have taken a number of measures including introducing specially trained officers and specialist rape prosecutors; supporting police forces to develop rape action plans; and funding a pilot of a dedicated rape investigation team. In April 2009, the Government announced a package of measures, having worked closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), to help ensure that victims of sexual violence receive a consistent, high quality service in every force. These measures include a new Rape Performance Group, led by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to monitor police and CPS performance on rape and undertake continuous assessments of performance; new National Policing Improvement Agency 'best practice' guidance for the police and Crown Prosecution Service on investigating and prosecuting rape; an expert NPIA/ACPO/CPS support team to ensure consistent implementation of this new guidance; and helping every police force to ensure that all victims are seen by a specially trained officer within an hour of reporting.</p>

	<p pid="b.956W.2/1">The information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/2">However, figures for the numbers of solicitor offices in England and Wales providing legal aid services in each year since 2002-03 are available and are shown in the following table. Prior to the introduction of the civil unified contract in April 2007 and criminal unified contract in July 2008, legal aid providers delivering services in more than one office would hold separate contracts for each of those offices. In addition, where providers have decided not to continue providing civil legal aid services, they may nevertheless still have an account or accounts with the Legal Services Commission while they continue to deal with their remaining clients.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/3">Over the period there has been a downward trend in the overall number of solicitor offices dealing with legal aid. This is because there has been a continuing process of offices that do only small amounts of legal aid work leaving the market or merging with other offices, so that the work is done in larger volumes at fewer offices. In addition, the Legal Services Commission has over time sought to terminate dormant accounts where no work was being done.</p>

	<p pid="b.957W.2/1">The decrease in expenditure in the South West is primarily due to reduced expenditure on criminal matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.2/2">The largest share of this was in the Crown court and here the reported decline is at least in part, only apparent. This is because with the development of contracting for very high cost cases, expenditure on these is assigned to the office from which the contract is managed, rather than the court in which the case is heard. Most high cost cases heard in the Crown court in the South West are not managed in that region.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.2/3">There has also been a decline in representation costs in the magistrates courts. This is due to the reintroduction of the means test for legal aid.</p>

	<p pid="b.960W.9/1">In 2009, the 10 metre and under fleet received an initial quota share prior to adjustments of 4.6 per cent. (30.2 tonnes) for plaice and 1.6 per cent. (10.6 tonnes) for cod caught in the Irish sea. Irish sea halibut is not subject to a quota. The Marine and Fisheries Agency significantly increases the fishing opportunities of stocks such as Irish sea plaice which are targeted by inshore fishermen.</p>

However, the latest report on rodent presence in domestic properties as revealed by the English House Condition Survey data for 2002-03 and 2003-04 is available on DEFRA's website. Key findings are that the occurrences of rats inside and outside properties in these years are not significantly different from those observed in 2001. The next report covering the period up to 2006 should be available this year, although at present there is no set date for publication. There is no breakdown in the English House Condition Survey to identify rat populations in multiple occupation properties.</p>

	<p pid="b.965W.4/1">The mission of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) is to extend the ability of the government of Afghanistan to deliver its services and this is conducted in a comprehensive manner by military and civilian personnel. The remit of a PRT is not military in nature, but rather uses military resources to facilitate its activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.4/2">For example, the UK's PRT spent around &pound;60 million in Helmand in 2008 on stabilisation and development and now has over 80 civilian staff in the province. This assistance has built nearly 2,000 wells benefiting over 400,000 people, contributed to 160 district infrastructure projects reaching over 300,000 families and provided paid work for nearly 19,000 people. The PRT has also supported projects on dispute resolution, which saw considerable progress in 2008: the Helmand Provincial Court is operating more effectively; convictions have risen 400 per cent. since June; and legal representation, including a legal aid office, has been introduced.</p>

	<p pid="b.973W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-20">20 April 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked the acting chief executive to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what steps his Department is taking to ensure that the principles of digital inclusion are applied to Jobcentre Plus. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus supports the principles set out in the Government's Digital Inclusion Action Plan and the work of the Cabinet Committee set up last year to ensure that everyone, especially disadvantaged people, benefits from the use of digital technologies in delivering public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/6" class="indent">I recognise how important this is for Jobcentre Plus and for our customers. Many of the people we help are disadvantaged and some are amongst the most vulnerable members of society. We are tackling that challenge by extending access to our online services and by helping people to acquire the confidence and ability to use those online services.</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/7" class="indent">Job vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus can be accessed online, through digital television and through Jobpoint Kiosks located in all of our local Jobcentres. We are now starting to replace and upgrade that network of Jobpoints. We are also exploring making some online services accessible by mobile telephone which, like digital television, are more extensively owned and used by our customers than home computers.</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/8" class="indent">Customers can already access information which enables them to answer some basic enquiries about their benefit entitlement through the online Benefit Adviser service on Directgov. Later this year customers will be able to make their claim for benefit online and that service will be extended in 2010 to enable customers to track progress of their claim and notify changes of circumstances through a secure personal account. We are also planning to make these services available to intermediaries and welfare rights organisations such as Citizens Advice Bureaux so that customers can access them there or be helped by those organisations to use them.</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/9" class="indent">It is equally important that we provide help for those customers who need to become confident about using digital services. Through the work-focused interviews carried out by our Personal Advisers, we identify people who could benefit from that help and refer or signpost them to a wide range of information technology training offered through DWP's Employment Programmes, Learndirect or UK Online centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/10" class="indent">I also recognise the importance of ensuring that our services are accessible to disabled people or people with other barriers to using digital technology. Our online services are compliant with the Government's Web Accessibility Standards, compatible with the main assistive software packages including JAWS, Dragon, Supernova and Zoomtext. All our services are also accessible by telephone or through our local Jobcentres for those people who need it or who find it difficult to access online services. Later this year, we will be able to offer a new &quot;Text Box&quot; service which will improve the service we provide to speech and hearing impaired people over the telephone.</p>
	<p pid="b.973W.5/11" class="indent">I recognise that improving digital inclusion is essential to ensuring that all our customers can benefit from the improvements in service that digital technologies can provide to help them move off welfare and into work.</p>

	<p pid="b.974W.5/1">Maximising the take-up of benefits is crucial to tacking pensioner poverty. Since its introduction in October 2003 the number of pensioners in relative low income has reduced by around 500,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.5/2">We want to increase take-up of pension credit and council tax benefit and are working hard to encourage those entitled but not yet claiming to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.5/3">In order to increase take-up of pension credit and council tax benefit we introduced further simplifications to the claims process so that pensioners can now claim state pension, pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in one easy free phone call, without the need to sign and return any claim forms.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.5/4">The Pension, Disability and Carers Service will continue to promote take-up of benefits by those entitled. It will continue to press forward with data matching to identify eligible non-recipients, home visits for vulnerable customers and ever closer working with partner organisations. We are rolling out a targeted take-up campaign across 20 regions where our insight suggests there are a high number of eligible non-recipients of pension credit. The approach involves local service teams working closely with national and local partners, both in planning and delivering the campaign to ensure we are using all available knowledge to deliver a highly effective take-up campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.5/5">The new campaign, launched in Sheffield and North Kent in January 2009, is designed to engage with the local pensioner population, using channels of communication and organisations that are likely to be familiar, for example WRVS, Mecca bingo, voluntary organisations. In some areas, for example the North East, the campaign will be extended to the wider region.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.5/6">In addition, we are taking powers in the Welfare Reform Bill to allow us to pilot new approaches that make better use of the information Government already have available to it for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="b.984W.2/1">Since 2007, the Government have run high-profile marketing campaigns to engage citizens on climate change issues. These serve to address the confusion and powerlessness which can impede people from taking action, and encourage genuine and sustained behaviour change to help reduce carbon emissions and meet the UK emissions targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.2/2">These campaigns have been run under the umbrella of ACT ON CO2, a Government-led and multi-partnered behaviour change brand, which aims to provide clarity and consistency across different communications on climate change and, by extension, energy efficiency. The ACT ON CO2 website aims to signpost, interact, coordinate and engage consumers on climate change, providing a clear, consistent, authoritative and credible voice. The website allows other Government departments to build and add further climate change information as and when necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.2/3">The ACT ON CO2 website, which includes a carbon footprint calculator as the key engagement tool, supports and amplifies all campaign activity. In running the website, DECC aims to maximise opportunities to 'cross-sell' behaviour messages between all climate change communications from Government departments, NGOs and other partners. DECC, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Transport, Communities and Local Government, the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust all provide information and advice or run campaigns, or both, under ACT ON CO2. An ACT ON CO2 toolkit has been developed to help facilitate a consistent message and approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.2/4">Additionally DECC is in regular contact with other relevant Government departments and delivery bodies such as the Energy Saving Trust and Carbon Trust to share communication plans and identify potential opportunities to work together to the benefit of consumers. DECC explicitly instructs its media buying agencies to avoid clashes in scheduling of advertising.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.2/5">DECC also shares analyses and findings on energy savings of various energy saving technologies with the Energy Saving Trust to ensure a consistent approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.2/6">The Government also provide a range of information and support to help businesses improve their energy efficiency, including through the Carbon Trust and Regional Development Agencies. We are taking steps to make that information easier to access through Business Link website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.988W.2/1">The Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills (BIS) oversees R and D projects under its collaborative R and D portfolio.</p>
	<p pid="b.988W.2/2">Strategic reviews of LINK, the predecessor scheme to collaborative R and D, indicate that the scheme generated research broadly comparable in terms of quality to research funded by the Research Councils. In addition to this, the LINK review concluded that there had been substantial commercial benefits that enabled more business-relevant long term research, providing a benefit cost ratio of up to 3.8 to 1 and increased profit between &pound;250 million and &pound;500 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.988W.2/3">A more recent review of the first three calls of this portfolio (formerly under DTI's Collaborative Research Programme) also concluded that the net present value of returns from successful projects is well above the investment cost. There is evidence of a high degree of 'additionality', which would not be expected if the projects were likely to produce very high private returns on average. Significant scope for 'positive spillovers' also exists. The most important factor influencing the extent of spillovers is the commercialisation of project outputs. A broad consortium was also found to enhance spillovers.</p>
	<p pid="b.988W.2/4">The Regional Development Agency (RDA) for the North East region, One NorthEast, has not done any direct work assessing the benefits of increased expenditure. It is the role of the RDAs to promote the economic growth of their region through the development and implementation of a regional economic strategy. Innovation as a driver of productivity is a key priority in these plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.988W.2/5">The North East regional economic strategy and action plan has placed significant focus on economic change through energy and environment technologies. This shared regional strategy is based on extensive stakeholder consultation and analysis. It is this knowledge of the region, its assets and industries that informs collaborations and interventions with organisations such as the Technology Strategy Board.</p>

The Department does not collect information on how much funding was allocated to recruiting teachers for Essex and Castle Point schools.

	<p pid="b.997W.6/1">Local planning authorities are unable to exempt educational and charitable organisations from planning fees. Planning permission is normally given in relation to the land to which it relates, and there is no guarantee that the successful applicant will be the one to implement the permission. Only in very exceptional instances is permission given that is personal and exclusive to an individual or corporate applicant, with a presumption that it will come to an end if the land ownership changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.997W.6/2">Accordingly, the planning system does not offer any special rate, as such, for applications it receives from charities or educational organisations, and there are no plans at present to change this. There are two exceptions to the above: certain works to improve access to buildings for disabled people are exempt from planning fees, and applications from non-profit-making sport or recreational organisations to carry out certain works and changes of use at sports grounds are liable to pay only at a concessionary rate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1011W.2/1">A low carbon economy represents a huge economic opportunity for the UK, and is at the heart of 'New Industry, New Jobs', the Government's strategic vision for Britain's economic recovery. Budget 2009 provided &pound;1.4 billion of extra targeted support in the low carbon sector. The Low Carbon Industrial Strategy, to be published this summer, will provide a framework to ensure UK business and workers can compete successfully for the jobs of the low carbon future.</p>
