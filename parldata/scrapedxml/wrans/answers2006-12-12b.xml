	<p pid="b.915W.0/2">The Government are committed to making the rail network more accessible.

	<p pid="b.915W.0/3">The funding has been allocated nationally to ensure that it delivers the greatest benefit. Stations have been chosen on the basis of the number of passengers who use them weighted by the incidence of disability in the area. A proportion of the funding has also been allocated to ensure a fair geographical spread of stations around the country. This approach was supported by the consultation responses to the draft Railways for All strategy.</p>

The 2002 Scottish House Condition Survey contains the most recent information broken down by local authority area, and shows that in 2002 there were an estimated 17,000 fuel-poor households in the area of Fife.</p>

	<p pid="b.922W.13/6">For example, at the policy and technical level, DFID is funding CGAP, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, which is co-ordinating the activities of its 33 members, donors and IFIs.</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.13/7">At the operational level, DFID has nine financial sector programmes in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, most of them in partnership with other donors and IFIs.</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.13/8">With respect to ensuring that the poorest families cross the threshold of $1 a day, an integrated approach is needed to achieve this target, including providing resources for education, health and other services. DFID and international financial institutions will continue to spend significant resources on education, health and other programmes of direct relevance, to improving the lives of poor families, in addition to microfinance, .</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.13/9">For example, DFID is contributing &pound;16.2 million to a programme with BRAC, a leading microfinance bank in Bangladesh, called &quot;Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction&quot;. It provides a number of services, in addition to microcredit, for more than 100,000 poor people.</p>

This should allow licensing authorities to make any necessary changes to their licensing policies and consult on them once before the next three-year licensing policy period begins in January 2008.

	<p pid="b.926W.5/2">UK Sport ensures that the governing body UK Athletics has a dedicated performance plan in place and that it is regularly scrutinised, in particular through a monthly meeting with the performance director and regular contact with key performance staff. UK Sport is also actively involved in senior appointments, including the current recruitment of the new CEO and chair for UK Athletics. In addition it has a member of staff with responsibility for monitoring progress in the sport and intervening where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.926W.5/3">To support this activity, in April this year UK Sport announced a funding increase of &pound;1,591,000 to UK Athletics to cover athlete preparation and training for the period 2006 to 2009. This takes the total investment in athletics in that period to &pound;20,377,000. While the majority of that funding is geared towards supporting athlete success at the Beijing Olympic games, a proportion will also be used to ensure that talented athletes are identified and developed ahead of London 2012. Investment in athletics for the period 2009 to 2013 (the London Olympic 'cycle') will be determined following the Beijing games in early 2009.</p>

During the bid to host the Games, the British Equestrian Federation undertook a feasibility study to identify potential sites to host the equestrian events, and selected Greenwich Park as the most suitable venue. Its considerations took into account the required proximity to the Olympic Park site, which was a key factor for the International Olympic Committee.</p>

	<p pid="b.927W.5/7">A proposed list of facilities will be submitted to LOCOG for final selection by January 2007, and the guide will be distributed to NOCs and NPCs in July 2008.</p>

Following recommendations on mental health services for veterans in 2005 by the independent Health and Social Care Advisory Service, officials from the Ministry of Defence, the UK Health Departments and Combat Stress have been working together to develop and implement a new community-based model for mental health services for veterans. It is hoped that, beginning in the spring of 2007, the model will be piloted at sites across the UK. The pilots are likely to last two years and, if successful, will be rolled out nationally.

The Office brings together responsibilities that were formerly in the Home Office and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).</p>
	<p pid="b.940W.6/2">The Office has already supported the passage of the Charities Bill through Parliament; established the new Commissioner for the Compact; launched programmes to promote charitable giving and volunteering by groups at risk of social exclusion and to promote and develop a series of new measures for supporting the growth of social enterprises, as set out in our recent 'Social Enterprise Action Plan'; embarked on a major review of the 'Role of the Third Sector in Social and Economic Regeneration', jointly with Her Majesty's Treasury; and prepared measures for enhancing the role of the Third Sector in improving public services, which will be published in December.

	<p pid="b.940W.6/4">SETF worked closely with the Department for Communities and Local Government to ensure that the local government White Paper proposals were built upon, and developed this approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.940W.6/5">The action plan launches a series of pilots, including 10 health-led parenting support demonstration projects from pre-birth to age two, interventions for tackling mental health problems in childhood such as 'Multi-systemic Therapy' and 'Treatment Foster Care', and alternative approaches to improving outcomes for people with chaotic lives and multiple needs. The SETF is closely involved in the development and delivery of these projects alongside other Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.940W.6/6">The SETF will be focusing on the delivery of the pilots by undertaking evaluations to assess the impact of the new demonstration projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.957W.5/1">Mariann Fischer Boel has not made a proposal to cap farm payments under the SFP. We expect proposals on a number of aspects of the SFP under the &quot;Healthcheck&quot;&mdash;and this might be one of them&mdash;although do not expect these to emerge for at least a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.957W.5/2">When Franz Fischler proposed a cap of 300 000 euros in Agenda 2000 we opposed it on the basis that this would: be distorting to the industry by discouraging the adoption of sensible, market-based, business models; prove administratively burdensome; and imbalance the CAP budget by penalising yet further net contributors to the budget like the UK and Germany. Nor did we agree that capping is an effective or rational way of supporting poor farmers as it has no direct bearing on income. The solution for poor farmers is through normal social security channels and encouraging a profitable farm sector, not perpetuating a distorting CAP.</p>

	<p pid="b.959W.2/1">Genetically modified (GM) crops will not be grown unless they pass a rigorous case-by-case assessment of their potential impact on human health and the environment. This means that separation distances are unnecessary for safety reasons, although they are still applied, on a precaution basis, in the context of GM trials.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/2">Separation distances should be based on the relevant evidence on cross-pollination for each crop species in question, which will reflect whether the crop is largely insect-pollinated or wind-pollinated.

However, it can occur infrequently over very long distances, depending on insect movements and the prevailing weather conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.965W.0/1">Government policy is to move away from reliance on landfill and to encourage more sustainable waste management through greater reduction, reuse and recycling. There are alternative waste management options for dealing with waste television sets so we would not generally expect this type of waste to go to landfill.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.0/2">The EU landfill directive introduces requirements that aim to reduce the negative effects of landfilling on the environment and any risk to human health. The Government have transposed the requirements of the landfill directive via The Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002 (as amended). The Environment Agency is responsible for enforcing waste legislation in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.965W.0/3">The landfill directive also requires that only waste that has been subject to treatment can be landfilled. Items such as cathode ray tubes, which are found in televisions, are classified as hazardous wastes. The pre-treatment requirement for hazardous waste has been in place since July 2004. The requirement to pre-treat non-hazardous waste comes into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-30">30 October 2007</phrase>. If waste television sets are destined for landfill, they will have to meet the pre-treatment requirements.</p>

There is no evidence to suggest that the need to manage woodland on a commercial basis, as required in order to be eligible for business property relief, is having a detrimental effect on the environment.

	<p pid="b.965W.6/3">Detailed plans for the initiative have yet to be worked up. However, to date DEFRA has provided &pound;30,000 to assist in developing the concept of the year.

	<p pid="b.965W.6/4">In addition, DEFRA is already actively engaged in reconnecting young people with food, farming and the countryside. For example, over 1,000 farmers around England currently receive grants to provide educational visits free of charge for schools and other educational groups as part of their agri-environment scheme agreement. Visits allow the farm to be used as a 'countryside classroom' for a variety of curricular subjects and other studies which include explanation of environmentally sensitive farming methods and how the food we eat is produced.</p>

	<p pid="b.979W.3/7" class="indent">The main components of expenditure on housing are rent (less housing benefit), mortgage interest payments and council tax. Some types of housing costs are excluded from the definition of total household expenditure. House purchases, including through mortgage capital repayments, and expenditure on major house alterations and improvements are both excluded. These are generally irregular, involve large sums of money, and the purchase of assets which are not consumed, and for these reasons they are not regarded as current expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.979W.3/8" class="indent">Chapter 2 of 'Family Spending' focuses in particular on housing expenditure and provides fuller information on all housing costs, irrespective of whether they are regarded as current or capital expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.984W.5/1">The UK has been a leading proponent of international efforts to reduce the debt burden of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries to free up resources for poverty reduction. Over the last 10 years, 30 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) have received debt relief worth more than $40 million, and another 10 countries could qualify for debt relief when they meet the criteria. In addition, $38 billion of debt relief has been delivered to 20 countries under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.5/2">Nevertheless, some developing countries are making debt repayments to the UK, as a result of commercial debt being rescheduled through the Paris Club, or of direct loans. The developing countries currently making debt repayments to the UK are: Kenya, Pakistan, Vietnam, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Egypt, Indonesia, Jamaica, Jordan, Macedonia, Morocco, Peru, Philippines, Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia, Gabon, Columbia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Philippines, Turkey and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.5/3">The UK also receives relatively small loan repayments from developing countries via the World Bank who administer a number of EU-IDA loans on behalf of a number of EC member states, including the UK. The countries making these payments are Bangladesh, Burundi, Central African Republic, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Egypt, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Kenya, People's Democratic Republic of Lao, Lesotho, Liberia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Samoa, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Togo, and the Republic of Yemen.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.5/4">The UK's policy is to hold in trust, and subsequently reimburse, the EU-IDA loan repayments received since December 2000 from IDA, for HIPCs. When these countries reach Completion Point under HIPC the UK will cancel all remaining debt stock.</p>

Authorities may chose between two award options, 'lowest price' and 'most economically advantageous tender'. UK authorities will normally use the &quot;most economically advantageous tender&quot; option, which allows them to consider, besides price, a range of other value for money criteria such as whole life costs, the quality of the product or service, its fitness for purpose and other issues linked to the subject of the requirement. This can benefit companies, including smaller companies, to be able to provide a tailored, quality product or service.</p>

	<p pid="b.991W.5/1">Tackling violent crime, much of it linked to drugs, is one of the biggest challenges facing governments in the Latin American region, including Colombia. According to official statistics, overall crime rates have reduced considerably in many urban areas in Colombia over the last decade, and particularly under the Uribe government which has been in power since 2002. Murder rates in major cities like Bogota and Medellin have fallen significantly as a result of innovative crime reduction strategies, public education programmes, community policing and active citizen participation. Recent further increases in the size of the Colombian police force are evidence of the Colombian government's determination to tackle urban crime, working with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.991W.5/2">The abundance of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) is a key factor in urban crime in Colombia. Our Embassy in Bogota has ongoing discussions with the Colombian government on SALW and crime-related issues, and my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, discussed the issue with them during his visit to Colombia in September 2006. The UK is currently supporting a regional project in Latin America, specifically Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, on strengthening community policing programmes, through the British Council.</p>

	<p pid="b.1000W.3/1">The Special Rapporteur has yet to submit his full report, which we will study when it is presented to the Human Rights Council. Our ambassador in Buenos Aires, who is accredited to Paraguay, met the Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December 2006</phrase>. They discussed the Special Rapporteur's visit, including the preliminary recommendation for the definition of torture to be widened in the Paraguayan Criminal Code so it complied with Article 1 of the UN Convention against Torture. The Foreign Minister told the ambassador that the Government of Paraguay was committed to working with the international community, including the Special Rapporteur, to improve human rights and eradicate torture.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.3/2">Multilaterally, the UK works closely with our international partners against torture. This has been a UK priority since the launch of the anti-torture initiative in 1998. The UK is a committed supporter of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT). In June 2004, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary launched a world-wide lobbying campaign to encourage other countries to sign and ratify the OPCAT. Paraguay ratified the OPCAT on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-02">2 December 2005</phrase>. In partnership with the Association for the Prevention of Torture, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has produced manuals and toolkits which have been used in Paraguay to help with the implementation of the OPCAT.</p>

The recent fighting between a militia aligned with the Sudanese armed forces in Malakal and the SPLM, southern Sudan is a cause for grave concern, and represents the most serious violation of the CPA since it was signed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1003W.8/2">Progress in Darfur has been held back by a lack of public support for the Darfur Peace Agreement. Implementation of that Agreement, which was signed in May, has been limited. There is continued fighting in Darfur, especially in the north and most recently in the town of El Fasher.</p>
	<p pid="b.1003W.8/3">The Government of Sudan and the Eastern Front concluded a Peace Agreement on eastern Sudan in Asmara on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-14">14 October</phrase>. We welcome this and hope that the Agreement will form the basis for lasting peace and security in eastern Sudan. The Agreement is the first step towards reconstruction and development in the region.</p>

	<p pid="b.1005W.3/1">The overall level of fighting in the south of Sudan has reduced since the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed in January 2005. However, we were gravely concerned by the recent fighting between a militia aligned with the Sudanese armed forces in Malakal and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, southern Sudan, which was the most serious violation of the CPA since it was signed. The CPA makes clear provisions to tackle militia that operate outside the Government's control. But this process is not yet complete. This, coupled with an undisciplined and unstructured Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA, the south's standing army), means the security situation in southern Sudan remains fragile.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005W.3/2">We are not able to provide a definitive figure for the number of deaths from conflict in the south since January 2005 due to the lack of confirmed data from the SPLA, the UN and the Government of southern Sudan. The UN does, however, estimate that approximately 200 people have died following the major spates of violence in mid October and in Malakal last week. Improving security for the people of southern Sudan remains a high priority for our political dialogue and development programme in Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1005W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-27">27 November</phrase> fighting broke out in Malakal, capital of the Upper Nile province of South Sudan, between the Sudan People' Liberation Army (SPLA) and a militia aligned with the Sudanese armed forces (SAP). The fighting spread to include regular SAP elements. Early indications are of up to 150 killed and perhaps 400 wounded. It is not clear yet what proportion of these were civilian. The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) brought senior commanders from the two sides together and organised joint patrols through the town; as a result calm was restored by <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005W.6/2">We utterly condemn the fighting and pay tribute to General Lidder and the staff of UNMIS, without whose prompt action many more might have been killed. We received regular reports from UNMIS as the situation developed.</p>

It is of the utmost importance that both sides work together to ensure that there are no repetitions of the violence. This will be a major pre-occupation of the Ceasefire Joint Military Commission, which is investigating the incident, and the Ceasefire Political Commission, to which it will report. We have called a meeting of the Security Working Group of the CPA's Assessment and Evaluation Commission, which we chair, to consider how to ensure that violence does not recur. All three of these bodies include representatives of the Government of Sudan, or its armed forces, and the SPLA/Sudan People's Liberation Movement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1021W.8/1">Many tenants relying on housing benefit have no restriction placed on their rent and eligible charges as their rents are either regulated, or in some other way controlled, so as to be lower than the market rent. These include the rent levels of local authorities, registered social landlords and certain other prescribed tenancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021W.8/2">However, as there are no such controls on rent levels within the private rented sector, claims from private tenants will generally be referred to the local rent officer for a rental valuation to determine the benefit claim. Any subsequent restriction reflects a reasonable rent for suitable accommodation of the appropriate size within the locality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021W.8/3">The rent officer either determines a reasonable rent for the property, by comparison with suitably sized properties in the vicinity or neighbourhood, or determines a local reference rent, which is based on the midpoint between the highest rent which is not exceptionally high and the lowest rent which is not exceptionally low for properties of a similar size in the same locality.</p>

In England, Department funded health assessments including TB screening can also generally be accessed where initial accommodation for asylum seekers is located. Immigration officers should also refer any entrant claiming asylum at a point of entry to the United Kingdom for a medical examination under the Immigration Act. Asylum claims are determined in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees and its Protocol. They are not based on the applicant's state of health.</p>

Since then, there has been a Green Paper, a White Paper, a Consultation Draft Bill in 2002, and a Draft Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny in 2004. There has also been widespread consultation on the so-called Bournewood safeguards. Consultation has shown this is an area where it is difficult to reach a consensus.

For example, Wales has a different approach to electronic booking of patient appointments, and a different policy on prescribing.</p>

However, through the UK Information Management and Technology Forum, and the NHS Information Standards Board, national programme officials work closely with officials in the devolved administrations and the Northern Ireland Office to ensure common standards and interoperability of clinical information systems. Where the countries are following a common approach, there are opportunities for using the same systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.1042W.5/1">Improving the nation's sexual health is a key Government priority and the Department launched its new adult sexual health campaign, Condom Essential Wear, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-09">9 November 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.5/2">The budget for this campaign is currently approximately &pound;4 million this financial year. This is a significant level of funding, which has enabled us to produce an effective, integrated multi-media campaign targeting some of the hardest to reach young people who are most at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.5/3">Condom Essential Wear, which involves TV, radio and press advertising backed by extensive public relations, partnership marketing and web and digital activity, primarily targets 18 to 24-year-olds who engage in sexually risky behaviour and who statistically are among the most at risk of contracting STIs. It has been developed on social marketing principles, which means it starts from the position of the consumer with the aim of bringing about long-term positive behavioural change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.5/4">It is one of three current Government campaigns working to improve sexual health and reduce teenage pregnancy, complementing the Department for Education and Skills's teenage pregnancy campaigns R U Thinking, aimed at 13 to 16-year-olds, and Want Respect? Use a Condom, aimed at 16 to 18-year-olds. This integrated communications approach enables us to effectively target young people across the age groups.</p>

Subsequent developments to this process allowed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (F&amp;CO) to send electronic reports of loss and theft of a passport overseas to IPS.
