	<p pid=".629W.3/2">Regular meetings with BAA and other airport operators present a good opportunity to discuss a range of airport issues. However, the refurbishment of existing airport facilities and routine methods of maintaining cleanliness are primarily matters for the operators to decide, with appropriate regard to all relevant health and safety legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".629W.3/3">Enforcement arrangements are subject to local arrangements at each airport but generally the Health and Safety Executive is responsible for enforcement airside, while local authority inspectors are responsible for enforcement at terminal buildings and landside activities. Local authority inspectors are also responsible for enforcing food hygiene and food safety legislation throughout airports, and they consider health, safety and welfare issues affecting employees, including provision and adequacy of welfare activities.</p>

	<p pid=".630W.3/1">A Crossrail station at Woolwich was considered during the development of the project, but could not be justified on the current estimates of cost, passenger numbers and benefits. Crossrail will pass under Woolwich in deep tunnels and the cost of constructing an underground station would therefore be high. In view of this, powers have not been sought for a station at Woolwich in the Bill introduced into Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-22">22 February 2005</phrase>. However, the alignment of the tunnels has been designed so as to allow a station at Woolwich to be developed in the future, if it could be justified at that time. An area of land has also been safeguarded for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.3/2">No estimate has been made of the potential cost of constructing a station at Woolwich once Crossrail is operational. However, this would entail closure of the route from Custom House to Abbey Wood for a number of years, and therefore the cost would be greater than for construction before operation.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.3/3">Cross London Rail Links Ltd., the company set up to develop and promote the Crossrail project, consulted widely including two 12-week rounds of public consultation on the project. During both rounds, public information centres were held at Woolwich and Abbey Wood, to provide information and seek residents' views. These were supported by mail drops to those potentially affected, newsletters, a dedicated website and a 24-hour telephone helpline.</p>

	<p pid=".631W.2/1">The draft Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Strategy does not propose removing the London Victoria to Gatwick airport service. It proposes keeping the fast, Gatwick to Victoria services, and increasing their frequency from four to eight trains per hour. Services will be extended to cover south coast destinations. In developing the strategy the SRA reviewed a number of documents and data sources to understand future growth demands, this included &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper. The SRA and Network Rail are continuing to work closely together regarding passenger handling issues at Gatwick airport station, and are considering the issues identified in BAA's safety assessment. Given that the RUS proposals aim to improve the performance and reliability of train services on the Brighton Main Line, making services more attractive to passengers, it is not expected to have an adverse effect on road congestion. The views raised in consultation will be taken into account before the final Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Strategy is issued.</p>

During the same period the number of injuries resulting in lost time from work fell from 43 to 15 incidents, indicating that more recent accidents are generally of lesser severity.

EDMs vary in size and complexity and the number of names added to them may be one or many. Processing and printing EDMs is only one of a number of tasks carried out by the staff involved and no realistic disaggregation can be made which can give a cost, marginal or otherwise, of all aspects of processing a single EDM. The best estimate available of the overall costs of printing and publishing Early Day Motions in 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;573,000, giving an average cost per EDM of &pound;263.</p>

	<p pid=".635W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) does not directly fund oil extraction in developing countries. We do support the World Bank's involvement in the extractive industries. The oil and gas extractive industries form a very small part of World Bank Group's lending portfolio. Investments are subject to high social and environmental safeguards that set a standard for the industry at large, as set out in the World Bank Extractive Industries Review published in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/2">We recognise that revenues from oil and gas resources can potentially support economic growth and social development that may lead to reduction in poverty. In some countries, however, the large revenues generated from oil and gas production have been associated with corruption, conflict and increased poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/3">The Prime Minister launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in September 2002. It seeks to increase the transparency of payments to Governments by oil, gas, and mining companies; and the transparency in use of revenues by Governments. DFID has led an international coalition of Governments, industry and international organisations, both within and outside countries hosting significant extractive industries, to improve transparency and reporting of revenues. Nine developing countries have committed themselves to implementing the principles of the EITI, with a further four African countries making new commitments at a London conference on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-17">17 March 2005</phrase>. The World Bank is actively participating.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/4">DFID monitors and comments on the environmental and social impacts of projects and programmes funded by the World Bank and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs), where we have stakeholder obligations as contributors. In some cases we have commissioned independent studies to improve our understanding of key economic and environmental issues and evaluate how they are being addressed. One example is the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. We have also kept in close touch with the issues raised by the proposed Sakhalin Island 2 oil pipeline development in Russia.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/5">DFID is working with others (including the IFIs) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on improved environmental assessment procedures for use at the planning stages of new projects and programmes. This will include the application of such procedures to large-scale projects in oil extraction, where these are funded by the IFIs.</p>

	<p pid=".636W.7/1">My hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Secretary, and I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March 2005</phrase>. Ministers responsible for fisheries and agriculture in Northern Ireland and Scotland were also present.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.7/2">The Council agreed a proposal concerning establishment of an EU Fisheries Control Agency, which the European Council had previously agreed to sit in Spain. We were able to support a compromise proposal for commission representation on the Agency's administrative board.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.7/3">The Commission reported progress in negotiations with the Russian Federation to agree certain plant and animal health controls. While the UK has not so far been among the member states most affected by Russian requirements, it was encouraging that progress was being made to resolve the remaining differences.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.7/4">The main item for discussion at this Council was Rural Development. The presidency focused discussion on a small number of issues in the current proposal to revise the Rural Development Regulation, principally focussing on the LEADER reserve and inviting comments on the Rural Development Strategy which it is planned to table in June. I reiterated the importance we attach to devoting at least half of the financial resources under the Regulation to environmental work, expressed some doubt as to the level of the LEADER reserve proposed and supported others in giving a general welcome to the likely shape of the strategy framework.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.7/5">The Commission presented a progress report on implementation of the EU forestry strategy. Member states took note.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.7/6">The Commission also presented proposals for EU measures to address market crises through new risk management techniques in the industry. This was a brief presentation, with substantial discussion planned for later in the year. The Commission made it clear that it opposed extending any kind of generalised safety net provision such as that found in the current beef regime. It also indicated that the use of any modulated funds would only be possible in the context of rural development programmes and measures that were compatible with the WTO Green Box.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.7/7">Under Any Other Business, we raised the question of cetacean by catches and the need for greater protection of dolphins. The Commission undertook to call for international research on the subject to be accelerated. Portugal drew attention to the difficulties that prolonged drought had caused in its rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.7/8">Over lunch, the Commission updated Ministers on the WTO agriculture negotiations. I welcomed recent progress and reminded the Council of the importance of making progress in good time for the Hong Kong Ministerial in December.</p>

	<p pid=".637W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, attended the Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-10">10 March 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/2">The main outcome of the Council was the adoption of two sets of conclusions. One set forms a contribution from the Environment Council to the Spring European Council (scheduled for the 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase>) and is a response to four Commission communications: the Mid-Term Review of the Lisbon Strategy, the 2004 Environmental Policy Review, an initial review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy and a report on implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan. The second set of conclusions represents the Environment Council's recommendations to the Spring European Council on climate change, specifically medium to long term emission reduction strategies and targets.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/3">Council conclusions on the Environment Council's contribution to the Spring European Council were adopted after a full discussion. Almost all delegations supported the presidency text and emphasised that environmental protection and economic growth went hand in hand. The Secretary of State supported the idea of a statement of principles for sustainable development, but emphasised that these should be integrated into the revised EU Sustainable Development Strategy. In this context, the Secretary of State referred to the recently published UK Sustainable Development Strategy, an executive summary of which was circulated to delegations.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/4">Council conclusions on climate change were adopted following a debate. The conclusions reaffirm the December 2004 Environment Council conclusions, referring to the global nature of climate change and the requirement for international co-operation, and to recent scientific research under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations required to meet the 2 degrees centigrade objective. Drawing on this research, the conclusions suggest the consideration of pathways to 2020 and 2050 for greenhouse gas emission reduction in developed countries. The agreed text makes clear that the EU wishes to explore the future framework with others and that the language on emissions reductions is an evidence-based assessment rather than a prescriptive call for action. The conclusions also invite the European Commission to continue its analysis of costs and benefits of reduction strategies, including the costs of inaction.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/5">Council adopted a Decision on a negotiating mandate for the second Meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters, which is scheduled for 25&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-05-27">27 May 2005</phrase> in Almaty, Kazakhstan.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/6">Council also adopted a negotiating mandate in preparation for the second meeting of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-30">30 May</phrase>-<phrase class="date" code="2005-06-03">3 June 2005</phrase> in Montreal. The negotiating mandate was adopted under qualified majority voting procedures, following a presidency compromise which included the addition of UK-proposed wording.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/7">Council conclusions were adopted in preparation for the first conference of the parties to the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants, which is scheduled for 2&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-05-06">6 May 2005</phrase> in Punta del Este, Uruguay. The presidency thanked the UK for chairing the preparatory work for this conference on its behalf. Council conclusions were agreed unanimously following a small amendment to reflect the concerns of two delegations.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/8">Minister John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), Chair of the 13th Session of the Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD 13), briefed the Council on preparations for the next session which will take place on 11&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-04-22">22 April 2005</phrase>. An exchange of views followed, in which member states and the Commission stressed the importance of links between CSD 13 and the Millennium Review Summit to be held in September.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/9">Under Other Business, the presidency gave an update on negotiations on the REACH chemicals strategy and Belgium presented items on the import of wild birds and illegal logging. Germany raised the proposed Services Directive, arguing that country of origin rules presented a threat to national environmental standards, and should not result in levelling down, a view which was supported by some other member states. The Commission referred ministers to the recent statements to the Competitiveness Council and European Parliament on this issue, and other delegations took the view it was too early for Environment Council to discuss the scope of this measure. Austria, with support from a number of member states, raised an issue concerning the Commission's approach to national safeguard actions in relation to GM maize variety MON 810. The Netherlands set out concerns about the possible dilution of EU standards in a current review of the automotive industry ('CARS 21') and the Czech Republic announced a forthcoming conference on Acid Deposition.</p>

This will enable improved modelling of the flood plain between Rochester and the confluence with the River Trent, including key tributaries.

	<p pid=".657W.5/1">The Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) Strategy is at the heart of the Government's efforts to reduce crime and disorder.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.5/2">This strategy, which was launched by the Prime Minister in March last year, looks to target not only existing prolific offenders but also those young people who are on the cusp of a prolific offending lifestyle. The strategy has three strands:</p>
	<p pid=".657W.5/3" class="indent">prevent and deter&mdash;to stop young people becoming prolific offenders;</p>
	<p pid=".657W.5/4" class="indent">catch and convict&mdash;tackling those who are already prolific offenders; and</p>
	<p pid=".657W.5/5" class="indent">rehabilitate and resettle&mdash;working to increase the number of offenders who stop offending by offering a range of supportive interventions.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.5/6">This multi-agency approach to offender management built on, and replaced, the previous persistent offender scheme. Since September 2004 PRO schemes have been established across all parts of England and Wales. These schemes allow local partners, like the police, prisons and probation to concentrate their joint efforts on monitoring and rehabilitating the relatively small number of people who have been identified locally as causing most harm to their communities and to themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.5/7">Over 9,000 existing prolific offenders have been identified by schemes across England and Wales. In addition, around 5,000 young people have been identified as suitable for support as part of the prevent and deter strand.</p>

	<p pid=".660W.8/1">The role of the National Probation Service is clearly reflected in the Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill currently before Parliament, which will, for the first time, provide a formal link between the role of the probation and prison services. The Bill clearly states that the aims of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) are:</p>
	<p pid=".660W.8/2" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> The protection of the public;</p>
	<p pid=".660W.8/3" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> The reduction of re-offending;</p>

	<p pid=".660W.8/7">The prisons and probation services are developing the core offender management function, which will improve the management of offenders moving between custody and community supervision, and are preparing themselves for future introduction of contestability. These changes to the current role of the National Probation Service will serve to break down the current organisational barriers identified in the Cater Report between prisons and probation and therefore contribute to reductions in re-offending, which has been at the centre of the work of the National Probation Service since its creation in 2001.</p>

There may be exceptional local circumstances that arise which may lead a court to decide that prevalence should influence sentencing levels. But the guideline says that it is essential that sentencers both have supporting evidence from an external source (for example the local Criminal Justice Board) to justify claims that a particular crime is prevalent in their area and are satisfied that there is a compelling need to treat the offence more seriously than elsewhere. Sentencers must sentence within the guidelines once the prevalence has been addressed.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.2/1">Section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 sets out the requirements that a witness statement must fulfil in order to be admissible in court. These include that it must be signed by the maker and contain a declaration by the maker that it is true to the best of his knowledge and belief. There is no provision in the Act governing the method or means by which that written statement is arrived at. As a matter of law, therefore, there is nothing to constrain police forces from adopting a policy whereby the text of a statement could be submitted or amended by e-mail.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.2/2">Such an approach would however usually be inadvisable and inappropriate where a statement was likely to be challenged in court, which is the majority of cases. For example, a police officer may need to interview a witness in person to find out whether an offence has actually been committed and the legal elements. The process of interview also enables the officer to assess the quality of the evidence which a witness would be likely to give in court and inform the prosecutor as may be necessary. Finally, it could be difficult for the police to assess whether statements given by e-mail were influenced by pressure or intimidation exerted on a witness by the alleged offender or their associates.</p>

	<p pid=".681W.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that all its policies, practices and services are totally inclusive, and do not discriminate against any individual. This principle underpins our strategic guidance to local authorities. Local authorities are also required to adhere to and implement equality and inclusion policies, procedures and practices when developing early years education and childcare services. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 sets out the requirements with which all listed public authorities must comply.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/2">My Department funded four projects in local authorities during 2003&ndash;04 to improve understanding of the practical steps Local authorities and childcare settings can take to ensure childcare provision is responsive to the needs of local black and minority ethnic families and is used by them. A report of findings was produced and distributed to all local authorities. Training has been made available to Children's Information Services and to early years staff to improve their practice. A very wide range of information and resources on topics such as purchasing and using culturally sensitive toys and books and resources for staff about the Muslim culture is available via links on our website to those of other organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/3">The information from these projects is already informing the design and implementation of our current and future childcare initiatives. The Sure Start Unit's own work on childcare is part of the wider DfES plans to ensure that all education services engage with Muslim communities.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/4">In particular, we will ensure that, through the significant expansion of provision in the Government's 10-year strategy on child care, we and our local authority partners work hard to further improve access to culturally sensitive childcare for Muslim families. Finally, our support and inspection arrangements for local authority childcare activities will assess that local authorities ensure local services respond sensitively to the Muslim communities in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/5">It is vital that the Muslim community and Muslim organisations help to shape policies and programmes to tackle the issues particular to their communities, both at a national and local level. In developing childcare, therefore, we will continue to ensure there is consultation and involvement of the community at local and national level.</p>

However, it also makes clear that it is for institutions to make proposals, and for the director to decide whether to approve them.</p>

	<p pid=".690W.2/2">The admission and selection of students is a matter for individual institutions. Therefore the decision on whether or not to recruit such students rests with the universities, and they would take such decisions according to the merit and potential of the individual applicants. Although there are currently no Government programmes for widening participation aimed specifically at medicine, Aimhigher, a national outreach programme operating most intensively in disadvantaged areas, enables local partnerships to design and deliver a range of activities to raise the aspiration and attainment levels of young people.</p>

	<p pid=".693W.2/1">In September 2004 St. Andrew's Junior School and Pelham Infants School, which were both located on the same campus site, amalgamated to form the Canon Peter Hall School. A part of the former Pelham Infant School site now forms part of the new amalgamated primary school but the remainder of the Pelham Infant School site is currently not in use.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.2/2">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires any council wishing to sell any land that falls within the definition of school playing fields to first seek the consent of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. North East Lincolnshire council has submitted an application to sell part of the former Pelham Infant School site and this application is currently under consideration. The Department has also received a representation from the Canon Peter Hall School, which outlines that school's desire to establish an outdoor play area on a part of the site to be sold. This representation will be taken into account when considering the local authority's application.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.2/3">The Department for Education and Skills has not received any representations from any party relating to the potential use of the Pelham Infant School, Immingham, North East Lincolnshire as a children's centre. However, officials are aware of the local community's desire for a children's centre and that the site is within an area that is defined by the local authority as a pocket of deprivation. In accordance with the Government's strategy for the delivery of children's centres it should therefore be one of the first areas where children's centres are developed. However, it is for local authorities to decide where to locate children's centres in order to best serve their communities.</p>

By 2010, we want to increase participation in HE towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30. Within that we want to see a broader cross-section of people being able and willing to go into HE. To that effect we support the Aimhigher Programme which seeks to raise attainment, aspiration and application levels of people from backgrounds currently under-represented in HE. The total budget for Aimhigher for the 2004/05 academic year is &pound;128 million.

Ante-natal and post-natal services, undertaken by midwives and health visitors, are a key element within the core health service activities undertaken by Sure Start local programmes and they will be part of the core services that will be offered in children's centres serving the most disadvantaged communities. These services are provided in different ways&mdash;through the direct employment of midwives to work with families living within the catchment area of a local programme, through secondment opportunities, and in partnership with primary care trusts.</p>

Most universities prefer to operate a special method. Customs will approve any special method that is fair and reasonable.</p>

	<p pid=".729W.3/33">1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). Due to regional volatility, regional estimates are based on a three year average from 2000&ndash;01 to 2002&ndash;03. The UK estimate is for 2002&ndash;03 only, as the FRS did not cover Northern Ireland until 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.3/34">2. Results are presented as percentages as these can be estimated more reliably.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.3/35">3. Figures are based on a total income at 2002&ndash;03 prices.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.3/36">4. The FRS is not designed to collect information on annual income. Earnings figures are based on last usual pay. Annual income is estimated by assuming that the income for the relevant period applied for the whole year.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.3/37">5. The figures relate to the percentage of individuals, including both adults and children, in households whose household income was in the band shown.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.3/38">6. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining response bias.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.3/39">7. Total weekly household income consists of total income from all sources before deduction of income tax and national insurance. This includes all tax credits.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.3/40">8. Total income has not been adjusted for family size.</p>

	<p pid=".739W.2/1">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that the use of antibiotics in human rather than veterinary medicines is thought to be the main source of resistant micro-organisms in the human population, but we recognise that transfer of resistant bacteria can also occur through the food chain. Action has been taken to phase out the use of antibiotic growth promoters in animals and to make sure that antibiotics are used responsibly in the treatment of sick animals. Measures to prevent food-borne disease, such as cooking, will also prevent the transmission of resistant bacteria.</p>
	<p pid=".739W.2/2">Antibiotic residues in food, resulting from on-farm use and their implications for consumer health, are monitored by the veterinary residues committee and the FSA. The residue levels currently reported do not raise any concerns about risks to consumer health.</p>

These notices are expected to be served in situations where requests for corrective measures to reduce the risk of contamination and consequent risk to public health have been ignored by the operator. Examples of where they might be used in slaughterhouses are:</p>

	<p pid=".754W.5/1">The safety of all medicines and vaccines, including hepatitis B vaccine, is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The MHRA uses a variety of data sources for this purpose including reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) which are reported through the yellow card scheme, clinical trials, published literature, epidemiological studies and periodic safety update reports from marketing authorisation holders.</p>
	<p pid=".754W.5/2">The known side effects of medicines and vaccines are described in their product information. Arthralgia and arthritis (joint pain and inflammation) have been reported very rarely in relation to hepatitis B vaccines and these possible side effects are included in product information. There have been reports of suspected adverse drug reactions suggesting an association between hepatitis B vaccine with rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
	<p pid=".754W.5/3">In light of concerns raised by reports of suspected ADRs, in 2003, the MHRA and the vaccine working group of the CSM reviewed all the available evidence relating to the possible links between hepatitis B vaccine and rheumatoid arthritis. This review examined published literature and studies and reports of suspected adverse drug reactions. The working group advised that there is no confirmed scientific evidence linking the vaccine with an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. The MHRA will continue to monitor the safety of hepatitis B vaccine.</p>

	<p pid=".755W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-17">17 March 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/2">Before the European Commission brought forward proposals for the Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products (Directive 2004/24/EC) a study was carried out for the Commission on the then arrangements for regulation of herbal medicines across the European Union (EU). This demonstrated that there were significant differences between member states. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) understands from discussion with industry and regulatory authorities in other EU member states that this assessment has been widely supported, and we do not see any need to replicate the work.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/3">There are many thousands of herbal products on the market of one or more EU member state and variously falling within different categories, such as medicines, foods, food supplements, cosmetics or general consumer products. We do not see a case for commissioning a comparative assessment of the position in each member state and doubt its practicality.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/4">The main requirements on quality and on the information and data to be included in dossiers flow directly from the terms of the Directive. There are existing European guidelines on the quality and manufacturing standards for medicines, including herbal medicines. We understand that the Herbal Medicinal Products Committee, based at the European Medicines Agency, may review whether any additions or modifications to existing guidelines are desirable or whether further guidelines are required on other issues relating to the Directive. However, there is no fundamental reason why quality standards, for example as to the identity and quality of ingredients, freedom from unacceptable levels of contamination, and the claimed shelf life of the product, should be lowered for traditional herbal medicines as compared with the requirements for other medicines with a marketing authorisation. The absence of such standards in the existing United Kingdom regime for unlicensed herbal medicines has been associated with evidence of risk to public health from low quality products. The UK appointed member of the Committee has extensive scientific and practical regulatory knowledge of herbal medicines and has regular discussions with industry and other interested parties. There is a range of opportunities for industry to make its views known to the Committee and the MHRA has encouraged the UK industry to contribute actively in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/5">Subject to the outcome of a further consultation on legislation to transpose the Directive into UK legislation, we intend to take advantage of the flexibility under the Directive to permit a transitional period to run until 2011 before products legally on the UK market at April 2004 are required to comply with the Directive. We also intend to permit product information to state the nature of the herbal tradition, which we believe will be helpful to consumers and to industry.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/6">The MHRA has an extensive programme of work in hand to help industry, and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, prepare for the Directive. Measures have included: a programme of workshops for industry; around 30 meetings with individual companies to advise them on the possibility of registering their products under the Directive; extensive website guidance on the Directive; and regular discussions with the industry's Herbal Forum to identify and respond to issues of concern. The Agency has received considerable positive feedback on the help provided to industry.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/7">The MHRA gave indicative information on fee levels in the partial regulatory impact assessment published in 2003. In the light of detailed work that has taken place in the interim, updated specific proposals will be published for consultation by the early summer of 2005 along with an updated regulatory impact assessment. October 2005 is the date by which a registration scheme under the Directive must be introduced. It does not represent a deadline by which companies must apply to register products.</p>

	<p pid=".760W.8/1">Isotretinoin (Roaccutane) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of severe acne, such as nodular or conglobate acne or acne at risk of permanent scarring. Its use is limited to specialists in dermatology with expertise in the use of systematic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".760W.8/2">The safety of isotretinoin has been closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines, since it was approved in 1983.</p>
	<p pid=".760W.8/3">Isotretinoin is known to harm the foetus if used during pregnancy and the product information has always carried stringent warnings to guard against its use during pregnancy. The product information for isotretinoin products was recently reviewed at a European level by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products. This has resulted in consistent updated advice to prescribers and patients throughout Europe, including the introduction of a pregnancy prevention programme. The pregnancy prevention programme consists of three parts; an education programme, therapy managements and distribution controls, which work together to raise awareness of the serious consequences for pregnancies exposed to isotretinoin.</p>
	<p pid=".760W.8/4">All female patients will receive information about isotretinoin, the risks associated with exposure during pregnancy as well as information on contraception. If clinical judgment is that a woman is not at risk of becoming pregnant she may not need to be subject to all of the requirements of the scheme in order to receive treatment with isotretinoin.</p>
	<p pid=".760W.8/5">The effectiveness of the pregnancy prevention programme is being closely monitored by the MHRA and other European member states. The marketing authorisation holders are required to submit regular reports six monthly for the first two years and annually thereafter on the effectiveness and implementation of the scheme across Europe. The pregnancy prevention programme has not yet been launched in all member states, but, in the first six months of launch in the first five member states, there were no new cases of pregnancy exposed to isotretinoin in those countries.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.2/2">In England, the Government has accepted each of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care except the recommendation to provide free personal care in all settings. Making personal care free for everyone carries a very substantial cost but would not raise the standard or range of services available; the estimated cost for 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;1.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.2/3">Free personal care would not help the poorest in society, who receive means tested support nor would it help the sickest, whose bills are paid by national health service continuing care arrangements. Free personal care does not cover all residential care costs and people in residential care would still be expected to contribute to board and lodging costs if personal care was made free.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.2/4">The estimated costs for future years are shown in the table. They take account of demographic change, in terms of numbers of older people by age, gender, household type and housing tenure. They assume that cost of care will rise by 2 per cent. per year in real terms, in line with average earnings. As with any projections, the figures should only be taken as broad estimates of the cost because of the uncertainty of projecting over such a long time scale.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.8/1">We have no specific targets for cognitive behaviour therapies. However, the national service framework (NSF) for mental health, published in 1999, sets out the national standards for mental health; what they aim to achieve, how they should be developed and delivered and how to measure performance in every part of the country. Following this, the NHS Plan, published in 2000, set plans and targets for investment and reforms in the National Health Service in England. In addition, the Department's guidance, published in July 2004, entitled &quot;Organising and Delivering psychological therapies&quot;, addresses issues for local services wanting to deliver a better quality or more readily accessible effective psychological therapies including cognitive behaviour therapies.</p>

	<p pid=".768W.2/1">Reports received by the Department on health effects associated with mobile phone technology have usually appeared in scientific journals or on the internet. The Department sometimes receives unpublished accounts, reports or letters, which it passes on to the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) for a considered view. The NRPB, or its independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR), have published reviews of the scientific knowledge based on the totality of work to date.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.2/2">AGNIR provided a comprehensive review of the science &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, (Documents of the NRPB, Vol 14, No2, 2003). More recently, the NRPB reviewed the progress on implementing the recommendations in the 2000 Stewart Report in &quot;Mobile Phones and Health 2004&quot; (Documents of the NRPB, Vol 15, No 5, 2004). These reports are available on the NRPB website (<a href="http://www.nrpb.org">www.nrpb.org</a>)</p>

	<p pid=".768W.5/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and its predecessor the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) has monitored research activities undertaken by pacemaker manufacturers to assess potential pacemaker interference from mobile phones, by participating in European and International pacemaker safety standards committees.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.5/3">For implanted pacemakers the power level and severity of interference signals from phone masts is much less than for mobile phones in proximity to the patients. MHRA issued guidance to clinicians about possible interference effects to pacemakers from mobile telephones in February 1996, via Pacemaker Technical Note PTN 61, which advised a minimum phone to pacemaker separation distance of 15 centimetres.</p>

	<p pid=".772W.9/15">1. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode.

	<p pid=".772W.9/16">2. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>
	<p pid=".772W.9/17">3. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides count and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also HES, calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid=".776W.0/1">Expenditure on the purchase and postage of official Christmas cards is governed by departmental guidance on financial procedures and propriety, based on principles set out in Government Accounting. This allows for Ministers, members of the Defence Council, Head of Defence Export Services and the Director General of Media and Communications to send Christmas cards at public expense. Additionally, resulting from representational responsibilities at management levels below the Defence Council, individual Top Level Budget Holders may personally send a modest amount of Christmas cards at public expense. The regulations also allow for some TLB business areas to send official Christmas cards (on an exceptional basis) where this would facilitate the achievement of specific business objectives.</p>

These include, the restricted airspace around civil aerodromes, glider sites, certain industrial sites, the major conurbations and other large centres of population (those towns with over 10,000 inhabitants). Coventry falls within the avoidance area afforded to the West Midlands Conurbation, which also includes Birmingham International Airport. For further details my hon.

	<p pid=".797W.2/2">We are concerned about Burma's forthcoming chairmanship of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2006. We know too that some other ASEAN members are concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.2/3">The UK attends EU-ASEAN meetings as a member of the EU. Decisions on attendance are taken by consensus with the EU. It is too early for the EU to take a decision on the approach it will take in July 2006. This will depend on developments in Burma before then. We have made clear that we wish to see real progress towards genuine democratisation in Burma including the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.2/4">We are also using our regular bilateral and multilateral contacts with all ASEAN members, who are key to progress on this issue, to encourage them to press the military regime in Burma to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the democratic opposition and ethnic groups as soon as possible. There is a clear understanding that the prospect of Burmese chairmanship of ASEAN makes the need for change all the more pressing.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister is committed to using the opportunity offered by our twin presidencies of the EU and G8 to make real progress.</p>
	<p pid=".802W.5/2">The review of the EU's sustainable development strategy provides the EU with the opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to promoting sustainable development and tackling climate change in the context of the re-launched Lisbon strategy. But this is just one element of the EU's climate change strategy: implementation of the EU emissions trading scheme is helping the EU to meet its Kyoto targets; on future action, the EU will be seeking to reinvigorate international dialogue under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Engaging countries beyond the EU will be a vital part of this. The G8 too is firmly focused on climate change. The UK presidency of the G8 aims to build on past G8 initiatives, including on technology development, by promoting a broader understanding of the challenges of addressing climate change.</p>
	<p pid=".802W.5/3">On Africa, the EU is the world's largest provider of aid to the region and an important trade partner. It is working to provide a sustainable response to the recommendations of the Commission for Africa, and to ensure that the millennium development summit gives new impetus to action on sustainable development and climate change in order to tackle global poverty and achieve the millennium development goals. The G8 is working to agree a comprehensive plan of specific actions to address the complex and inter-linked problems of Africa. This plan will build on the work of the Kananaskis G8 Africa Action Plan, the Commission for Africa, the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's Development.</p>

	<p pid=".804W.2/1">Figures from the 2003&ndash;04 approved budget (including donor funded projects) are:</p>
	<p pid=".804W.2/2" class="indent">Health&mdash;12.3%</p>
	<p pid=".804W.2/3" class="indent">Education&mdash;18.8%</p>
	<p pid=".804W.2/4" class="indent">Agriculture&mdash;3.2%</p>
	<p pid=".804W.2/5" class="indent">Security (defence)&mdash;10.6%.</p>
	<p pid=".804W.2/6">Uganda has a well-developed and consultative budgetary process. Donors are involved throughout, and have an opportunity to endorse the budget at the annual Public Expenditure Review. This level of consultation allows partners, including the UK, to ensure government meets its commitment to prioritise poverty reduction. Budget execution is generally good and closely monitored by government and donors, including the International Financial Institutions. Our Poverty Reduction Budget Support, and that of other partners such as the World Bank, is conditional on our endorsement of the budget and its subsequent execution.</p>
