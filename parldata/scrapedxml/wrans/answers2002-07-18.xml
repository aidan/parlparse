The UK representation at such meetings would depend on the subject(s) under consideration, and would normally consist of officials from the Health and Safety Executive. However, the legislation implementing the Biocidal Products Directive in Great Britain specifies the competent authorities in or as regards Scotland as the Secretary of State and the Scottish Ministers, acting jointly, and so my officials consult the Scottish Executive on agenda items in which it might have an interest.</p>

They focus on those regulations that impact on business, charities and the voluntary sector.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.5/1">Banking services should help ensure a viable future for many urban post offices which might otherwise struggle to keep and attract customers as banking will be a central part of post offices' strategy to move forward. Universal banking services, together with Post Office Limited's plans for an expansion of network banking&mdash;the provision of counter services for ordinary current accounts&mdash;should lead to substantial increases in the range and volume of banking at post offices, tapping into a very much larger customer base than benefit recipients alone.

	<p pid=".438W.5/2">The current value to Consignia of business from the Department of Work and Pensions is some &pound;400 million a year. The migration of benefit payment to ACT is scheduled to begin in 2003. How that migration affects the revenue of subpostmasters will depend on a number of factors, not least how benefit recipients and other post office customers respond to change.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/3">Universal banking services are due to be introduced in 2003 when migration of benefit payments by ACT is scheduled to begin. When that happens and whatever account people chose to have their benefits paid into, the Government are committed to ensuring that those who wish to do so will be able to continue to get their benefits in cash at post offices in full without charge.</p>
	<p pid=".438W.5/4">In many urban areas, there are too many post offices in very close proximity to each other for them all to be viable, regardless of the migration to ACT. That is why the Performance and Innovation Unit recommended a programme of modernisation and restructuring designed to ensure that urban sub post offices can operate as viable businesses for their owners and offer improved services from the right locations to serve their communities. The Government are providing up to &pound;210 million of financial support for Post Office Limited's urban reinvention programme.</p>

	<p pid=".440W.5/1">Under section 1(2) of the National Minimum Wage Act (NMWA) 1998 a person qualifies for the national minimum wage if he works or ordinarily works in the United Kingdom under his contract. The United Kingdom includes UK territorial waters.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.5/2">The minimum wage applies to all workers in all of the United Kingdom's power stations regardless of nationality. Similarly national minimum wage applies to all ferry service workers working within territorial waters. For mariners in general the right to receive at least the national minimum is extended to include any individual employed on a UK registered ship unless the employment is wholly outside the United Kingdom or the worker is not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.5/3">It is the role of the Inland Revenue to enforce the National Minimum Wage. They do that by responding to all complaints made about employers suspected of not paying the minimum wage and by visiting a sample of employers about whom no complaints have been made to check that all employers meet their obligations under National Minimum Wage Law. Checks are not made on the basis of worker nationality.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.5/4">If any worker is being underpaid, or if anyone has knowledge of a company underpaying of the National Minimum Wage, they can ring the Inland Revenue Helpline number (0845 6000 678) to report the fact. Callers can remain anonymous.</p>

	<p pid=".443W.2/1">I have decided to award 25 production licences to licence groups made up of 33 different companies. They include six companies acquiring their first offshore licences as well as more familiar names, and range from the super-giants to small new niche players.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.2/2">It is encouraging that so many companies see further opportunities for investment and development in the North sea's core areas, even after nearly 40 years of intensive exploration there. It bodes well for future licensing rounds, which will cover a lot of acreage that, by contrast, is still under-explored and under-exploited. The DTI, with PILOT (formerly the Oil and Gas Industry Task Force), will seek to give every opportunity to small, innovative companies eager to exploit the UK's hydrocarbon resources with new technology. I am particularly delighted to see the response from newcomers who fully understand the potential rewards still to be made in the North sea.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.2/3">In an effort to concentrate licensees' minds and prevent the appearance of fallow acreage in future, in pursuit of recommendations by PILOT I have made some significant changes to the licences compared with earlier versions. The first two terms will last for four years each instead of six and 12 years respectively, and there will be a mandatory relinquishment of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term. The Government will also be enabled to publish information three years after receiving it, instead of five (or at licence surrender, whichever is sooner). All this is part of the Government's strategy of bringing together acreage and the companies best fitted to exploit it.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.2/4">The companies within each licence group (with the operator named first), the blocks covered and a brief resum&eacute; of the Work Programmes, are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".445W.2/2">Consignia has not decided to impose a charge of &pound;20 per week to businesses for deliveries before 9 am. The company is currently running pilots of their new Tailored Delivery Service in 14 delivery offices across the country. Under the pilot, customers who receive 20 or more letters on a regular basis will get a delivery before 9 am. Other customers will receive their mail between 9 am and lunchtime. A new, additional service will allow customers who do not receive 20 or more items to choose to pay for a delivery before 9 am. The service will be trialled at &pound;5, &pound;10 and just over &pound;14 per week for the pilots but the Chairman of Consignia has said that the final proposed price will be part of the evaluation of the pilots in consultation with the regulator, the Postal Services Commission (Postcomm), and the consumer body, Postwatch.</p>
	<p pid=".445W.2/3">Under the terms of the licence issued to it by the Postal Services Commission (Postcomm), Consignia is required to provide a universal postal service. The licence sets out services which are to be provided by Consignia in meeting a universal postal service. This includes a requirement to make at least one delivery of mail every working day to all addresses in the UK except in circumstances that Postcomm considers exceptional. It is for Postcomm to decide whether the new Tailored Delivery Service meets this requirement.</p>

	<p pid=".447W.2/2" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.2/3">The Government's public procurement policy requires all purchases of goods and services to be based on value for money, having due regard to propriety and regularity. Value for money is defined as &quot;the optimum combination of whole life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to meet the customer's requirement&quot;. Public bodies are also required to comply with the EC Treaty, the EC procurement directives and the UK Regulations that implement them. These are designed to ensure that public procurement is fair, transparent and not used to discriminate by setting up barriers to free trade. Member States reached political agreement on a revised public procurement directive at the Internal Market Council on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-21">21 May</phrase>. This revised directive maintains the principles set out above.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.2/4">This policy and legal framework for public procurement not only secures value for money for the taxpayer but also helps to improve the competitiveness of, and opportunities for, our suppliers. It does not, however, permit public sector buyers to restrict their purchases to specific locations or suppliers.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.2/5">However, it is permitted to specify requirements that might provide the opportunity for local suppliers to make use of their proximity to customers. For example, a requirement for frequent delivery of fresh food would be acceptable provided it was reasonable and not contrived to create an artificial barrier to free trade. In principle a foreign supplier is not denied an opportunity to compete on equal terms by, for example, setting up an operation in Britain. Public bodies can also ensure that their contract specifications do not discriminate against local suppliers. For example, requiring the supply of mangetout throughout the year would necessitate purchases from overseas and deny local suppliers an opportunity to compete. To avoid such difficulties for local suppliers the buying authority can require seasonal vegetables instead.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.2/6">Issues relating to public procurement policy have also been raised by several respondents, including the organic sector, to the Department's Sustainable Food and Farming Working Together consultation paper. These are also under consideration.</p>

The Government's reforms target five key areas that can affect the rate of productivity growth&mdash;competition, enterprise and innovation, skills, investment and the productivity of public services.</p>
	<p pid=".463W.12/2">Budget 2002 and the 2002 Spending Review take forward a wide range of measures to address historic weaknesses in each of these areas.</p>

At the Spring Meetings of the IMFC and G7, the international community agreed to take forward work to develop a new approach to sovereign debt restructuring, to facilitate greater private sector involvement and to improve the framework for crisis resolution. The IMF is currently assessing the various options that may be available for achieving this and the G7 is implementing an Action Plan, which was agreed at the Spring Meeting, towards this objective.

	<p pid=".466W.5/1">The consultation document, Modernising Annuities, published jointly with the Department for Work and Pensions in February, provoked considerable interest and strong feedback. I am today placing in the Library a summary of the responses.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.5/2">The feedback confirmed that individuals need to be better informed about their annuity purchase. It is clear that many people could improve their retirement income if, at retirement, they were able to select the right annuity for their personal circumstances. It would be in their best interest to look for the best rate in the marketplace, which is not necessarily from the same financial institution that helped them save for retirement. The Government are working with the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and providers to ensure that people are able to make the right choices at the right time. One specific idea under consideration is encouraging the provision of information and advice through the work place.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.5/3">As the consultation document explains, there is no case for abandoning the requirement that people should buy a lifetime annuity by age 75. This rule ensures that they can take advantage of insurance pooling to make efficient use of their pension savings.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.5/4">Without prejudicing this rule and consistent with the principles outlined in the consultation document, the Government plan to bring forward powers to make it possible to offer people buying annuities more choice and flexibility. The aim will be to empower people approaching retirement to make the right choices for their circumstances by encouraging competition and transparency in the market for annuities. It will be important that this liberalisation dovetails with simplification and other reforms being considered in the pensions Green Paper this autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".470W.5/1">The Bank of England suspended issuance of the new Elizabeth Fry five pound note after it was discovered that, on some notes, it was possible to remove part or all of the serial numbers, when the note was rubbed vigorously. The problem was traced to unexpectedly slow drying of the numbering ink on some of the notes, when the numbers were printed over the new varnish coating. This varnish had been introduced to make the note more durable. In future the Bank will put the varnish over the numbering, as tests have shown that this solves the problem. The notes already printed will undergo extensive drying treatment to ensure that the numbering ink dries thoroughly.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.5/2">The Bank plans to resume issuing the new note in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-19">19 August 2002</phrase> and is announcing this today.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.5/3">The total cost of finding and solving this problem amount to less than &pound;250,000 (or approximately half of one per cent. of the annual costs of note issue and production). The Bank is looking to find cost savings elsewhere in note production to ensure that the taxpayer does not suffer any loss of revenue.</p>

	<p pid=".470W.8/1">As I said in my Mansion House speech in June 2002, our decision on the euro is of immense, historic importance to the long term future of our economy and our country as a whole. In 1997 we set out the case in principle for the single currency, and said that the determining factor underpinning any Government decision on membership is the national economic interest, and whether the economic case is clear and unambiguous.</p>

	<p pid=".470W.8/3">I am today depositing in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of the Sixth Progress Report on Euro Preparations. The report describes the changeover to the euro in the euro area and sets out lessons from the euro area changeover.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.8/4">It also sets out what Government and partners are doing to raise awareness of the potential impact on UK businesses and gives an update on planning for possible UK entry.</p>

	<p pid=".476W.2/2">The principal asbestos constituent of water supply pipes has been white asbestos. No water supply in the UK is carried through pipes constructed in blue asbestos, although traces of blue and brown asbestos are likely to have been present in the white asbestos construction materials.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.2/3">Regional use of asbestos cement water supply pipes varied considerably but approximately 10 per cent. of existing pipes in the UK are believed to consist of that material.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.2/4">The World Health Organisation included an opinion on asbestos cement pipes in their 1993 edition of &quot;Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality&quot;. The guidelines include the following statement &quot;Although well studied, there has been little convincing evidence of the carcinogenicity of ingested asbestos in epidemiological studies of populations with drinking water supplies containing high concentrations of asbestos. Moreover in extensive studies in animal species, asbestos has not consistently increased the incidence of tumours of the gastrointestinal tract.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".478W.8/1">Air quality in the London Underground system is required to meet occupational exposure limits as required by Health and Safety legislation. Guidance notes, issued under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, prescribe maximum occupational exposure limits for a variety of pollutants, including all of the pollutants covered by the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000. Details of the limits for each pollutant are available from the Health and Safety Executive. London Underground Limited (LUL) are responsible for ensuring that these limits are adhered to. LUL are in the process of developing an air quality monitoring standard, which would set out the monitoring arrangements and requirements in the Underground system. To date, all monitoring carried out during operational hours has indicated that levels of all pollutants are below the prescribed occupational exposure limits.</p>

	<p pid=".479W.2/1">Emissions of air pollutants from road transport have fallen significantly since the beginning of the 1990s, despite traffic growth. This is largely the result of the progressively tighter new vehicle and fuel standards introduced over this period by the European Union. Our latest modelled estimates show that by 2001, total national emissions of oxides of nitrogen and particles from road transport (two of the air pollutants of most concern) had dropped to 77 per cent. and 74 per cent. respectively of their 1997 levels. By 2010, they are projected to fall to 41 per cent. and 44 per cent. respectively of their 1997 levels. These further reductions are forecast to come about partly because older, more polluting vehicles will be gradually phased out of the UK fleet, and partly because of the even more stringent EU emissions standards for new vehicles which will apply from 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".481W.11/1">Since 1997, concern about the increasingly unsustainable nature of the bushmeat trade and its effects on endangered species led to my Department raising the issue within the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This resulted in the establishment of a Bushmeat Working Group to help Central and west African range states develop and implement their own solutions. We have contributed &pound;55,000 to the working group to help the range states participate and to support the recruitment of consultants to revise and harmonise their own wildlife policies and legislation. Work on this is currently under way and progress will be reported to the next conference of CITES parties, to be held in Chile in November.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.11/2">We have also funded research analysing existing knowledge and expertise on the bushmeat trade, highlighting gaps in data and understanding, and making recommendations on further action. The results of this research have been made available to the CITES Bushmeat Working Group and we expect them to be discussed at the group's next meeting. This is due to take place in Brazzaville later this month and the UK will be represented at the meeting by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.11/3">Through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, we have also been using the UK diplomatic missions in Harare, Accra, Abuja, Cairo, Pretoria, Kampala, Abidjan, Maseru, Dakar, Luanda, Nairobi, Kigali, Mbabane and Tunis to raise the profile of UK import restrictions and rules.</p>

	<p pid=".482W.2/1">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) set up a centralised database of seizures of illegal meat and animal products last year, receiving data from all the enforcement agencies. From <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-12">12 July 2002</phrase>, 797 seizures of consignments that included meat and animal products were reported to the database that had arrived on flights and ships from African countries. The volume of these seizures was approximately 1.58 tonnes.</p>
	<p pid=".482W.2/2">However, under-reporting and differences in the reporting procedures of the different agencies mean that these are likely to be underestimates of both the total seizures that included meat and animal products and their volume.</p>
	<p pid=".482W.2/3">The number of seizures does not reflect the total amount of meant and animal products brought into the country illegally. However, a risk assessment is currently being carried out by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency which will provide information on the likelihood of an animal disease outbreak linked to illegal imports of meat and animal products. The risk assessment will provide an estimate of the probable amount of illegally imported meat from a number of countries, including African countries, per year. This risk assessment is due to be completed in autumn 2002.</p>

A series of meetings is currently being held with local authorities and with retailers to discuss the collection and recycling requirements of the WEEE directive and possible implementation methods. A series of events has been arranged by the Small Business Service to raise awareness in the regions and discuss the directive with all stakeholder groups. Officials will also be visiting several other member states to discuss implementation of the directive and to learn from those who already have legislation in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.3/1">At present there are five sea ports where animals that meet the rules of the Pet Travel Scheme can enter England. These are Dover, Portsmouth, Harwich, Poole and Plymouth. Pets can also enter England under the scheme through Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Under the requirements of the Pet Travel Scheme, any transport company wishing to transport animals to England under the scheme must seek written approval to do so from the Government. My Department has written in the past to all ferry and airline companies operating passenger routes into England to invite expressions of interest for approval to join the scheme. Whether companies choose to seek approval is a commercial and operational decision for them.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.0/1">The Government's work to tackle unsustainable bushmeat trade is ongoing, predominantly through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES) and the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD). We have funded research to analyse knowledge on the bushmeat trade, highlight gaps in data and understanding, and recommend further action. The Government supports a number of initiatives with links to bushmeat, such as the UK Bushmeat Working Group.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.0/2">Our priorities for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) include poverty eradication and sustainable livelihoods, with a focus on implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, linked with the need for good domestic, regional and international governance and institutional capacity building. Action in these areas will address the diverse underlying causes of bushmeat trade. The draft Programme of Action (PoA) for WSSD recognises that the Conventions on Biodiversity (CBD) and International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES) are the key routes for achieving the conservation and sustainable sue of biological diversity and thereby tackling trade in bushmeat. The draft PoA calls for all countries to implement the CBD's programme of work on forest biological diversity. As you know, the work programme specifically calls for the establishment of a group to develop a work plan to bring harvesting of non-timber forest products, with particular focus on bushmeat, to sustainable levels.</p>

	<p pid=".488W.0/2">&quot;Taking Water Responsibly&quot; tasked the Environment Agency with developing plans, as part of its Catchment Abstraction Management Strategies (CAMS) programme, to convert existing permanent licences to time limited status on a prioritised basis, and also to consider establishing incentives in its Charges Scheme to encourage this. The first round of the agency's CAMS programme will take another seven years to be completed for the whole of England and Wales. It is intended to address the conversion of licences to time limited status as part of this process. The agency will also be consulting later this year on proposed revisions to its Charges Scheme, which are likely to include financial incentives to encourage voluntary conversion. &quot;Taking Water Responsibly&quot; (paragraph 7.12) acknowledged that &quot;the process of conversion of existing licences to time limited status may be quite protracted&quot;.</p>

Furthermore, the recent Pension's Appeal Tribunal's decision is specific to that case and does not set a legal precedent. It would be wrong to interpret from the tribunal's finding that Gulf war syndrome does exist. However, the fact that there is, at present, no proper basis for recognising Gulf war syndrome as an appropriate diagnostic label does not prevent a Gulf veteran getting a war pension which is paid on a no-fault basis. Gulf veterans may also be eligible for no-fault pension benefits under the armed forces pension scheme.</p>

However, we have still yet to receive any writs or claims of sufficient detail to allow these cases to be taken forward. When compensation claims are submitted against the MOD, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the Department has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so.</p>

	<p pid=".492W.0/1">Nimrod MRA4 is a highly complex, software intensive and sophisticated product. The degree of technical challenge has led to a delay in delivery, with the in-service date re-set in 1999 to March 2005. BAE Systems are driving hard for this target and the key interim deliverable of first flight, expected by the end of this year. The Ministry of Defence and the company are also ensuring that Day 1 and whole life support are in place as required. The capability to be provided will be a step change from that currently available. Nimrod will be the leading class product, evidenced by US interest in MRA4 as a contender for their Multi-Mission Aircraft programme.</p>

	<p pid=".493W.5/2">I believe that the hon. Member is referring to the A400M aircraft. The A400M prime contractor, Airbus Military, is responsible for selecting the aircraft's engines. In December 2001 the company sought new tenders for the A400M engine after deciding not to proceed with its earlier choice of engine. The hon. Member will recall that the A400M contract is for the development and production of the complete aircraft, including its engines. Airbus Military is free, therefore, to select its suppliers on grounds of performance and cost, thereby ensuring that we obtain best value for money. No EU funding for research and development is available to either Pratt and Whitney or Rolls Royce in connection with the A400M engines. We understand that Airbus Military expect to announce their engine selection when the A400M prime contract becomes effective. Partner nations are working to bring the prime contract into effect at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid=".498W.8/1">Sport, particularly at local club level, would be unable to flourish without 1.5 million volunteers, who include administrators, mentors and officials, as well as coaches. The Government's Plan for Sport recognised the critical importance of volunteers and the need to invest in maintaining numbers through training. The Step into Sport project aims to meet this need by investing &pound;7 million over two years in training 60,000 young people and 8,000 adults to volunteer in sport, and by assisting the national governing bodies of sport to produce volunteer support strategies. A further initiative, Come into Coaching, will aim to attract volunteer coaches and administrators from March 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".503W.10/2">In 1999, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) introduced an adverse outcome analysis system. This provides CPS areas with a consistent means to identify reasons for adverse outcomes and also to allocate responsibility of any failure. This information is collated centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".503W.10/3">For the last seven years, many areas of the CPS have had in place, with the police, a system of joint performance management that involves an appraisal of Crown court acquittals, including those ordered and directed by the judge. This process provides areas with information showing particular trends and a means by which improvements can be made.</p>
	<p pid=".503W.10/4">The Crown Prosecution Service produces quarterly summaries of unsuccessful case outcomes from information drawn from its various case tracking systems. This year the CPS and the police have begun to develop a joint case outcome analysis which builds on these two processes and will focus on avoidable case failure. Under this system, the reasons for judge ordered and judge directed acquittals in individual cases will be jointly assessed for individual training needs and other joint strategies for performance improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".503W.10/5">The process will be supported by more sophisticated management information following the introduction of the CPS' Compass Case Management System due to roll out between April and December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".503W.10/6">The figures in the table show a fall in judge directed acquittals from 1,777 in 1999 to 1,471 last year, a reduction of 17.2 per cent. Over the same period judge ordered acquittals rose from 9,616 to 11,825, an increase of 23 per cent. Much of this increase can be attributed to recent changes in procedures. Since January 2001, the prosecution, unlike before, have been able to discontinue cases in the Crown court. Although this is a prosecution decision, the current system records these as judge ordered acquittals.</p>

	<p pid=".507W.5/1">The Organised Crime Task Force, which I chair, recognises the lingering, significant influence of paramilitary groups in such organised crime activities and assesses that nearly half of the 76 organised crime groups identified in Northern Ireland are either controlled by, or linked with, republican or loyalist paramilitary organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/2">That said, it is very important that I confirm that the law enforcement agencies represented on the Task Force do not tackle organised criminals or crime groups on the basis of their paramilitary affiliations (or lack of them), but because of their involvement in criminal activities.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/3">The Government believe that the most effective sanctions against those engaged in criminality is to disrupt the activity and bring those involved to justice.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/4">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree with me that his firm response by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Customs and Excise and the other agencies represented on the Task Force, is the best response to those involved in smuggling, counterfeiting and, indeed, organised crime in all its forms.</p>

In brief, the Task Force has identified 76 criminal networks involved in a range of organised criminality. It has been assessed that at <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>: 41 per cent. of the groups are involved in tobacco smuggling; 30 per cent. engaged in alcohol smuggling; 26 per cent. in hydrocarbon smuggling; and 34 per cent. of the group are involved in counterfeiting goods.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.2/3">During the last financial year, 57 criminal networks were subject to detailed law enforcement investigation and 43 have had members arrested for a wider range of serious offences.

	<p pid=".511W.8/2">The Government offer financial assistance for merchant navy training through the Support for Maritime Training scheme (SMarT). The scheme, which is administered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, offers substantial financial support to eligible training providers offering to provide approved training, which includes training for maritime competence certificates. In the financial year 2001&ndash;02 the overall budget for this support was &pound;7.4 million. Funding is based on an average of course costs at the main maritime colleges. In broad terms this means that 50 per cent. of eligible costs are covered for each participant's course. If maritime competence training is identified as a need for a New Deal participant, their New Deal personal adviser can refer them to a training provider supported by SMarT if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/3">There is other provision available as well as the SMarT scheme. For example, if a New Deal participant identifies training that they wish to undertake which has not already been contracted for locally, the Jobcentre Plus district is able to buy in one-off provision (assuming that certain eligibility conditions are met and the participant's personal adviser believes that it is an appropriate type of provision for the participant to undertake).</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/4">In addition, the Adviser Discretion Fund gives New Deal personal advisers direct access to money to help people quickly into jobs. Advisers can spend up to &pound;300 on anything that will help a jobseeker obtain a job or, if offered a job, to accept that offer. New Deal participants may be able to access this fund to upgrade their maritime competence certificates, with the agreement of their personal adviser.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.5/1">The absolute time limit of three months for claiming retirement pension was introduced in April 1997 as part of the rationalisation of time limits for all benefits undertaken at that time. Before this date there were a large number of different rules and time periods for the backdating of the claims for different benefits. It was a confusing picture and it was widely recognised that there was a need to simplify the rules. It was considered appropriate for people to have three months in which to make a claim for one of the contributory benefits. Retirement pension is one of those benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.3/19">As these figures show, youth unemployment nationally has fallen by 40 per cent. since 1997, to around its lowest level since the mid- 1970s. Moreover, long term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.3/20">The New Deal for Young People has played an important part in this success. By the end of March 2002 it had helped over 360,000 young people into jobs. This includes more than 700 young people in my hon. Friend's constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.3/21">Many of these young people faced significant barriers to employment. The New Deal has given them the skills and motivation to help them move into work. However, we recognise that some young people continue to face difficulties in the labour market. We are introducing a range of measures to provide even more help for these young people.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.3/22">Action Teams for Jobs are already helping disadvantaged groups in the most employment deprived areas in the country into work. The nine teams operating in Scotland have already helped nearly 1,300 young people into work so far, more than 400 of them in Glasgow.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.3/23">This spring we introduced progress2work, a &pound;40 million initiative to give unemployed people who are recovering from a drug problem the extra help they need to get into work. The first progress2work projects have started in 27 pathfinder areas, including two in Glasgow and 3 in other parts in Scotland. Phase 2 of progress2work will start in October 2002 in a further 36 areas and the programme will be rolled out to all parts of the country from 2003. In the autumn, we will extend the progress2work model to help other groups facing disadvantage in the labour market, including ex-offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.3/24">In April 2002, we launched StepUP, a &pound;40million initiative providing transitional jobs for people who have not been able to find work through New Deal. Six pilots are already up and running, including one in Scotland, and we are introducing a further 14 throughout the year.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.3/25">We also introduced in April a new &pound;15 million outreach initiative to engage more effectively with, and improve the job prospects for people from ethnic minorities. This will build on the success of the New Deals, which have already helped over 63,000 people from ethnic minorities into work.</p>

We have recently extended the current Zone contracts to March 2004 and, as the Chancellor announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-15">15 July</phrase>, we will also be testing the Employment Zone approach with other groups such as lone parents and people returning to the New Deals for a second time.</p>

	<p pid=".524W.2/2">People aged 25 and over, living in a zone area and claiming income-based jobseeker's allowance, become eligible for employment zone help after either 12 or 18 months' unemployment (depending on the employment zone area). Jobcentre Plus identifies and refers eligible people to the employment zone at the appropriate time. Eligible participants who fail to attend an employment zone are brought to the attention of Jobcentre Plus by their personal adviser and may have their benefit sanctioned if there is no good cause for their non-attendance.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.2/3">Jobcentre Plus and employment zone contractors have developed a strong working relationship. One of the ways they have achieved this is through the secondment of Jobcentre Plus staff to employment zones. Employment zones also have access to Jobcentre Plus premises and labour market information systems. This strong partnership ensures that payments to clients are accurate, and the zones contribute to Jobcentre Plus' achievement of the best job outcomes for clients.</p>

	<p pid=".530W.3/2">All telecoms customers, including pensioners, have benefited from price reductions of over 50 per cent. since 19984. In addition BT is required by Oftel to provide a Light User Scheme (LUS) targeted at low users, including pensioners. The LUS enables those on the scheme to obtain rebates on their total bill.</p>

	<p pid=".530W.6/2">In Wales, responsibility for Children's Play issues rests with the National Assembly for Wales, who are in the process of producing a play policy for Wales, and not with Whitehall Departments, who are only responsible for play matters in England.</p>
	<p pid=".530W.6/3">In December 2000, DCMS produced a guidance document for English local authorities entitled &quot;Creating Opportunities&quot;, which encourages local authorities to develop and implement Local Cultural Strategies. The guidance explicitly lists play as something to be within the scope of cultural strategies, encompassing: children's play, playgrounds and play activities, parks and open spaces.</p>
	<p pid=".530W.6/4">DCMS also funded &quot;Play as Culture&quot;, researched and published by Playlink, a document which provides detailed guidance about incorporating play in cultural strategies. It was co-sponsored by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the then Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, and was publicised and disseminated via the Local Government Association (LGA), the Institute of Leisure and Management and Early Years Partnerships. There is also soon to be a weblink directly to the document on the Playlink website from the DCMS website and a second round of distribution is about to begin.</p>
	<p pid=".530W.6/5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently revising &quot;Planning Policy Guidance note 17: Sports, Recreation and Open Space&quot; (PPG17) which will provide guidance on the provision of a full range of urban open spaces, including play space. The revision, along with associated good practice guidance, will provide guidance for improving local assessments of need for such spaces and for carrying out audits of existing spaces. While these will encourage the setting of local standards for provision of new spaces, they will not give any specific guidance on the size of play spaces.</p>

	<p pid=".535W.5/1">Guidance on maintaining privacy and dignity was first issued to the service in 1997 and since then the national health service has been working towards a clear target to provide single sex accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".535W.5/2">The target set is for three objectives to be achieved in 95 per cent. of trusts by December 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".535W.5/3">The three objectives are:</p>
	<p pid=".535W.5/4" class="indent">Ensuring that appropriate organisational arrangements are in place to secure good standards of privacy and dignity for hospital patients;</p>
	<p pid=".535W.5/5" class="indent">Achieving fully the Patient's Charter standard for segregated washing and toilet facilities across the NHS;</p>
	<p pid=".535W.5/6" class="indent">Providing safe facilities for patients in hospital who are mentally ill which safeguard their privacy and dignity.</p>
	<p pid=".535W.5/7">Trusts are required to re-assess and report their position annually. This information has been collected through health authorities. Separate validation programmes are undertaken to ensure that information provided is robust and reliable.</p>
	<p pid=".535W.5/8">We are working with the NHS to provide professional and technical support to ensure progress towards meeting this target continues.</p>

It is the responsibility of each national health service trust to determine the most appropriate configuration to meet their specific requirements.</p>

However, the Centre for Public Mental Health at Durham University has been sponsored by the Department to develop mapping of the mental health work force. Further work is required to validate the returns but their latest information, available at <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/">www.dur.ac.uk/</a> service mapping, provides the best information we have on the distribution of the mental health work force.</p>
	<p pid=".539W.0/3">Community psychiatric nurses are a key element of both teams and community learning difficulties nurses are important for the delivery of community mental health services. Between 1997 and 2001 the numbers of nurses working in these specialties have increased by 25 per cent. and 28 per cent. respectively. Further information is shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-03">3 July</phrase>, announcing the publication of a consultation paper on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud. The consultation period will last until <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-10">10 January 2003</phrase>. The Government has made it clear that the introduction of an entitlement card would be a major step and that it would not proceed without consulting widely and considering all the views expressed very carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/2">The paper includes a number of estimates of what a scheme would cost, depending on the sophistication of the card. A reasonable estimate would be that a scheme would cost around &pound;1.5 billion over a 13 year period covering the three years it would take to set up the necessary Information Technology systems and the 10 year period for which the first cards would be valid.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/3">This would include much more stringent identity checks than currently apply for passports and driving licences in response to increased levels of fraudulent applications.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/4">It would also include the costs of using biometric information (fingerprints or iris images) which would uniquely link the card holder with a card.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.5/5">This estimate does not include any savings to Government through more efficient administration and reductions in fraud. The paper also sets out how the costs might be recovered through increases in fees for driving licences and passports and charging a fee for entitlement cards issued to those who did not qualify for or who did not want to apply for a card in the form of a photocard driving licence or passport card. It would not be the Government's intention to use funds allocated for investment in public services for a card scheme.</p>

As at that date, 30 Zimbabweans (to the nearest five) were being detained who are recorded as having claimed asylum at some stage, which excludes persons detained in police cells.

	<p pid=".551W.2/3">The suspension of removals of asylum seekers to Zimbabwe is a temporary measure. We are monitoring events in the aftermath of the Zimbabwe presidential election in close liaison with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). There is no set time scale, but it would be unrealistic to be able to make any decision on a resumption of removals until the immediate post-election situation has calmed down and we have had time to assess properly the risks to returnees and gather and consider the views of FCO and others. Zimbabwean asylum seekers have continued, where appropriate, to be detained at Oakington Reception Centre as part of the fast-track asylum process. Aside from such individuals, there will be a very small number of people who are detained at present pending removal while outstanding applications, appeals and other matters are resolved. Once such issues have been resolved, the persons concerned will normally be granted bail or temporary admission as appropriate while the suspension of removals remains in place.</p>

Friend the Home Secretary made a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-03">3 July</phrase>, announcing the publication of a consultation paper on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud. The consultation period will last until <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-10">10 January 2003</phrase>. The Government has made it clear that the introduction of an entitlement card would be a major step and that it would not proceed without consulting widely and considering all the views expressed very carefully. The consultation paper outlines how a scheme might be delivered by building on the existing driving licence and passport systems.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.9/2">In the consultation paper the Government states that it is not proposing any changes to the law on transsexual people in the consultation exercise and that the existing procedures for issuing passports and driving licences in these cases would apply for any entitlement card scheme.</p>

The Group will look further into the implications of the possible changes in policy identified in the report, and of the judgments of the European Court on Human Rights in the cases of Goodwin v. The United Kingdom and I v. The United Kingdom which were delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-11">11 July</phrase>. The Group will report to Ministers later this year but no commitment can yet be given on any likely recommendations or the timing of their implementation. Any recommendations will be taken into account in the design of an entitlement card scheme should the Government decide to proceed after the consultation exercise.</p>

	<p pid=".557W.0/1">Tackling anti-social behaviour is a priority for the Government. We have included legislative changes in the Police Reform Bill that will improve the effectiveness of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs). We will be issuing revised guidance to all agencies involved in the process of obtaining ASBOs in order that they can make maximum use of this valuable sanction measure.</p>
	<p pid=".557W.0/2">The Bill also includes measures that will enable the police to enlist the assistance of their own civilian staff as well as the staff of other agencies in the community in tackling anti-social behaviour. Chief officers will be able to appoint support staff from their civilian ranks to provide a visible presence in the community and exercise limited powers to deal with a range of crime, including those which constitute anti-social behaviour. A similar role is also proposed for some of those staff from other agencies who are already working with the police in the community, such as street wardens, and environmental health officers.</p>
	<p pid=".557W.0/3">Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships throughout the country are appointing co-ordinators for action against anti-social behaviour. They will be responsible for ensuring that robust local strategies, based on the needs of their communities, are in place.</p>
	<p pid=".557W.0/4">Finally, under the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 we introduced fixed penalty fines for a number of disorder offences including disorderly behaviour while drunk in a public place and the throwing of fireworks in a throughfare. This provision will be piloted within five police areas this summer.</p>

This makes it clear that the police can now confiscate alcohol in containers that have been opened, but not alcohol in sealed containers.

	<p pid=".566W.5/2">Police officers are entitled under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to require motorists to produce a range of driver and vehicle related documents for inspection. A motorist failing to produce such documents on request is guilty of an offence, unless he produces them at a police station of his nomination within seven days.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.5/3">If any of the required documents cannot be made available at the time of the police request, the motorist is issued with a form HORT 1. This formally notifies him that within the specified time he must present the documents at a police station of his choice, which is recorded on the form.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.5/4">The HORT 1 is in two parts. The top copy is issued to the driver, the bottom is retained within the issuing force to monitor and control the subsequent presentation of the documents. Upon their presentation, staff at the nominated police station inspect them and record the necessary details on a two part document known as the HORT 2. One part of the HORT 2 is then retained by the nominated police station and the second part sent to the originating police force so that they can verify compliance with the original request.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.5/5">The HORT system has no statutory basis. It is operated by the police for administrative convenience without any direct Government involvement. In 1996 an Association of Chief Police Officers Working Group considered whether the system should include the issue of a receipt for documents produced. The Group unanimously concluded that the costs incurred would far exceed any benefit.</p>
