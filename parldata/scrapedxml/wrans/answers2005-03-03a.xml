	<p pid="a.1265W.6/1">If there is an outbreak of disease in an exporting country, Community legislation allows member states to take appropriate emergency safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of animal products from all, or parts, of that country, pending emergency action at Community level. Once Community measures are put in place the safeguard measures will reflect them. Safeguard measures are currently in place to ban or restrict imports of meat and other animal products of susceptible species in respect of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, including the Territory of Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and South Africa and Newcastle disease in Bulgaria</p>

	<p pid="a.1265W.6/3">All live birds, poultry meat and poultry meat products imported from third countries must be accompanied by a licence and/or veterinary certification. This confirms that the birds are not derived from an area where there has been an outbreak of avian influenza or Newcastle disease; it also confirms that live birds have not been vaccinated against Newcastle disease; show no clinical signs of disease and are fit to travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.6/4">Post imports of live poultry, or eggs once hatched, must be held in quarantine for six weeks in an approved establishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265W.6/5">All poultry meat and birds imported into the EU from third countries must enter at designated border inspection posts where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks. At least 20 per cent. of consignments of animal products undergo physical checks, and a number of animals in each consignment are physically checked. These checks ensure import conditions are met.</p>

The plan outlines Defra's objectives for disease control in terms of emergency preparedness, mobilisation of the response effort, and outbreak management. The contingency plan is currently being reviewed and is due to be laid before parliament in July this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1271W.2/2">Modelling by Defra's Central Science Laboratory (CSL) has examined the likely consequences of the new policy on winter cormorant numbers. The focus on winter numbers is appropriate since this coincides with the period when licensed shooting occurs; wintering counts are also recorded annually, unlike counts of breeding birds which are only conducted infrequently at the national level. CSL have explored the limits within which the licensing system may operate without risking the conservation status of the cormorant population. The aim has been to identify prudent upper limits for shooting and not to recommend levels of population reduction. To further safeguard the conservation of cormorants Defra will monitor the national winter population and if necessary reduce or stop the granting of licences should the population not respond in the manner predicted.</p>

	<p pid="a.1272W.2/2">Mr Bradshaw Defra's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science is currently undertaking research into the use of fish refuges to reduce damage to inland fisheries by cormorants. Early results are encouraging and suggest that the technique has considerable potential for reducing fish losses at some sites, such as smaller stillwater coarse fisheries. Currently, fish refuges do not offer a solution for all fisheries. However, work is continuing to further evaluate the benefits of introducing refuges in a range of fisheries and to assess any effects of the refuge structures on anglers. Over the past two years this research has cost the Department &pound;260k.</p>

	<p pid="a.1275W.5/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 ensures that private or public landowners, who are service providers&quot;, will be subject to the provisions of the Act. Service providers are required to take reasonable steps to remove, alter or provide a reasonable means of avoiding physical features.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.5/2">As far as rights of way are concerned, we believe that this will apply to features such as stiles and gates&mdash;which might act as barriers to disabled people accessing their services&mdash;since the provision and maintenance of these is the landowner's responsibility. However, it is not clear at this stage what reasonable steps&quot; would mean in practice and this will probably only be established by case law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.5/3">Section 69 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on how the powers to authorise works are to be exercised. We plan to issue this guidance later this year and will consider using this opportunity to issue guidance on the application of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.5/4">As regards access to open country under Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, we believe that landowners are unlikely to be service providers under the Disability Discrimination Act just because their land has been designated under this part of the Act. Landowners may become service providers if they voluntarily provide signs, gates, stiles or other infrastructure to support the right of access, but there is no case law in this area. If the courts decide that the Disability Discrimination Act does</p>
	<p pid="a.1275W.5/5">apply in these circumstances, then we would expect reasonable steps&quot; to take account of factors like cost, land management, privacy and the level of demand from local disabled people</p>

A number of member states have announced installation level allocations (e.g. Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Slovenia and Ireland) but are not yet in a position to issue allowances, either as a result of the registry not being approved or because a final allocation decision has not yet been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.1290W.3/2">The Fisheries Department has received three representations regarding the withdrawal of designated port status for haddock landings from Warkworth Harbour, Amble, Northumberland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.3/3">The purpose of designating ports is to assist Defra inspectors in the monitoring of landings of fish. Amble was designated in 2004 following the introduction of the haddock permit scheme which made it compulsory for vessels with haddock permits to land into designated ports. It was made clear at the time that designation would only remain while the haddock permit scheme remained. The scheme has now ended.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290W.3/4">Under current rules, landing into a designated port is not compulsory except for vessels with more than two tonnes of cod on board. Vessels landing into Amble do not normally catch such quantities and they are therefore free to continue landing there, subject to requirements for advance notification in certain circumstances. I therefore do not propose to reconsider the decision.</p>

To date our central tracking system records that there have been a total of 14 requests for information where a reply has had to be extended past the statutory 20 working day limit due to the need to apply the Public Interest Test. Of these requests nine were under the Freedom of Information Act and five were under the new Environmental Information Regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1291W.6/1">The measures that the Government would take in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease are set out in the Defra FMD Contingency Plan, the latest version of which was laid before Parliament at the end of March 2004. These include the immediate imposition of movement controls on all susceptible livestock, strict bio-security requirements and enhanced options for controlling the disease. Vaccination would be considered from the outset of an outbreak in addition to the culling of all susceptible animals on infected premises and those that have been exposed to infection, as required by EU law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.6/2">We are engaging with operational partners and with stakeholders to ensure they are aware of their responsibilities and the measures that would be taken in an outbreak. Plans are also in place in the event of an outbreak to enable a rapid increase in resources and for the implementation of contingency contracts, including that for emergency vaccination. We have revised the instructions for staff and are ensuring that they are trained and equipped to deal with an outbreak of disease. A revised version of the contingency plan, incorporating the lessons learned from the national foot and mouth disease exercise held last June, will be issued for public consultation shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1292W.2/1">The Department commissioned and published a risk assessment to consider the risks of importation of contaminated meat and meat products and the subsequent exposure of GB livestock. Several viral pathogens were included in this work, among them Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD).</p>
	<p pid="a.1292W.2/2">As part of this work the risk of transfer and spread of contaminated material, by scavengers (including wild birds), from an infected site to livestock holdings was considered.</p>

These improvements include the replacement of the low-active drain in the late 1970s and the installation in the early to mid 1980s of filters to the discharge outlets of facilities where particles are known to have originated. A new sea discharge pipeline was installed circa 1990 and a new Low Level Liquid Effluent Treatment Plant was commissioned in 2003. The new effluent treatment plant is designed to facilitate the settlement and removal of solids from the site's active liquid effluent. In parallel with the construction and commissioning of the new effluent treatment plant, a wide range of investigations were carried out to determine whether there were still particles in the site's active liquid effluent system. These investigations failed to find any evidence that particles were still being discharged from the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.1300W.6/5">The installation of final filtration at the point of discharge to sea from the new effluent treatment plant is currently being undertaken and will provide additional reassurance that particles are not being discharged from the site.</p>

However, discharges of radioactivity to the environment from Dounreay have been regulated since 1977 by the former HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate and, since 1996, by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. UKAEA calculates the impact of these discharges on the local environment and compares this with the effects measured on local fauna and flora in its statutory environmental monitoring programme.

	<p pid="a.1307W.3/1">The Home Office-led Identity Fraud Steering Committee, which comprises public and private sector organisations that are committed to reducing identity fraud, began a project in November 2004 to explore the benefits, feasibility and legal impediments of sharing public sector deceased person information with private sector organisations involved in fraud prevention. The organisations involved are the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and CIFAS&mdash;the UK's Fraud Prevention Service. CIFAS membership includes more than 200 companies covering sectors such as financial services, utilities and insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1307W.3/2">The first phase of the project involved a sample of 50confirmed impersonation of deceased (IOD) cases. These were processed against ONS data on deceased people to establish whether the fraud could have been detected and prevented had the ONS data been available to CIFAS members when the fraudsters' applications were processed. The project found that sharing this data would not have a significant impact on reducing this type of fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1307W.3/3">The second phase of the project is exploring the benefits of sharing deceased person data held by DWP to reduce deceased person fraud. This includes confirming whether the data held by DWP would help to reduce IOD fraud; running the same cases of IOD fraud (as used in the first phase) against the information held by DWP; and establishing whether any showstoppers&quot; or legal impediments exist that would prevent DWP data on deceased people from being shared with the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1307W.3/4">Initial results suggest that sharing DWP data may help to reduce IOD fraud, but further work is needed to evaluate the benefits that could be obtained. This work is now under way along with an examination of any possible legal impediments to sharing the data.</p>

	<p pid="a.1308W.2/1">The Government are committed to professionalising the whole police workforce. A central plank of our workforce modernisation programme is to develop and implement improved learning and development for everyone in the service and ensure, in particular, that women and people from ethnic minorities have the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.2/2">The Core Leadership Development Programme will ensure that officers of all levels can develop the important leadership skills that they need to carry out their duties effectively. This programme will be open to officers from sergeant to chief inspector level. It will also be open to police staff&mdash;6 per cent. of whom are from minority ethnic backgrounds and 62 per cent. of whom are women&mdash;at equivalent levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.2/3">We intend to strengthen the Senior Careers Advisory Service to support those with potential for senior leadership. In doing so, we will learn from other organisations' experience and explore joint development opportunities with them, including secondments and exchanges.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.2/4">A career in the police service should be an opportunity for life long learning and development. We want all those working in the police service to have clear career pathways in which to develop their professional skills and have these accredited. We will develop a formal qualifications framework and are considering developing professional registers for the service in line with practice in other professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.2/5">Officers and staff will be given the opportunity to keep their skills up to date as they progress through more structured careers. We will put in place mechanisms for continuously developing the operational skills of constables. Officers will be assessed against national occupational standards and we will award those who achieve the standards with a qualification which will be recognised outside the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.2/6">We are also considering changes to regulations so that officers will no longer be required to have spent a specific number of years in a particular rank before being eligible for promotion. This will remove barriers to promotion and widen the pool of those who are eligible. We are also keen to identify members of police staff with potential for development and we will look to develop arrangements for a high potential development scheme for police staff similar to that available to officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.2/7">Police staff play an increasingly important role in the police service and we are keen to attract more women and people from ethnic minorities into the police service from outside. We intend also to draw on practice elsewhere and encourage members of ethnic minorities with successful careers in other professions to apply for lateral entry to the police service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.2/8">We will review our promotion and progression procedures to ensure they are fair, transparent and have no adverse impact on women or minority ethnic officers. Any barriers identified will be removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.2/9">We will also work closely with the British Association of Women Police to ensure women have the support and opportunities to reach their potential. Part of this will be ensuring that the working environment for women is professional and supportive and that police training will be available on a non- residential and part time basis. More opportunity for flexible working patterns, should provide greater opportunity to gain experience in a wider range of roles.</p>

However, it is clear that the increase in funding that took place after the 2001 theatre review has dramatically improved funding to theatre. The increase in funding between 2000&ndash;01 and 2003&ndash;04 represents a 72 per cent. increase in ACE funding for theatre.</p>

	<p pid="a.1310W.2/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Islington, South and Finsbury since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/2">In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. There are two school sport partnerships based in Islington south and Finsbury, involving three school sport co-ordinators and 27 primary link teachers. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Islington, South and Finsbury have benefited from four Sport England community capital lottery grants totalling &pound;4,792,287, and a further two awards worth &pound;875,736 in total from the &pound;108 million investment in innovative sports facilities through the Active England programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;5. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04, funding to Arts Council England, London increased from &pound;13.6 million to &pound;133.8 million, including from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, funding to major national arts organisations in London. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England, London investment in regularly funded organisations will be &pound;151.6 million. Islington south and Finsbury has benefited from grants to arts organisations and individuals, including the Almeida theatre and the Union Chapel Project: Ten Feet Away&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/4">Schools in Islington, South and Finsbury were included in the first phase of the Creative Partnerships programme which began in 2002. Creative Partnerships aims to give school children and their teachers the opportunity to explore their creativity by working on sustained projects with creative organisations and individuals, including artists, theatre companies, dance studios, museums, orchestras, film-makers and historic buildings. Funding of &pound;65 million was allocated for the period 2002&ndash;05 to develop creative partnerships, and the programme will receive at least a further &pound;86 million in 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/5">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Islington, South and Finsbury will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/6">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/7">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in the Islington, South and Finsbury area. The UK Film Council's First Light initiative for young film-makers aged between 11 and 18 has supported a number of initiatives in Islington, including providing a grant of &pound;30,000 to the All Change Arts&quot; organisation for the making of five films in which 95 young people were involved. Film London provided a &pound;10,000 lottery grant to the Film and Video Workshop. The Human Rights Watch Festival, also based in Islington, received &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/8">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in the Islington south and Finsbury constituency with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;4 was 3,505.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/9">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11pm on new year's eve to 11am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/10">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Islington south and Finsbury, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/11">Tourism across London has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and its successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Islington, South and Finsbury. Responsibility for the promotion of tourism in London was devolved to the Mayor of London and the Greater London Authority (GLA) under the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Since 2000&ndash;01, DCMS has worked with the Mayor and the GLA to fund marketing and tourism development activities in London. Data on the precise effect of this support for tourism in Islington south and Finsbury is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/12">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;1,567,929 to Islington, South and Finsbury since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including &pound;1,121,654 to the London borough of Islington for the Keystone Crescent Conservation Area Partnership Scheme (&pound;159,691 in 1997), the Caledonian Road and Chapel Market Heritage Economic Regeneration Schemes (&pound;459,698 from 1997 to 2004) and funding for specialist conservation posts (&pound;502,265 from 1997 to 2003).</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/13">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Islington, South and Finsbury are connected to the Internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the museums, libraries and archives council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/14">Information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Islington, South and Finsbury constituency has benefited from 868 awards totalling over &pound;189 million. Of these, 55 awards worth over &pound;44 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Sittingbourne and Sheppey will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/6">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/7">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Sittingbourne and Sheppey with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 4,885.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/8">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/9">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Sittingbourne and Sheppey, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/10">Tourism in Sittingbourne and Sheppey has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including the South East Regional Development Agency. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Sittingbourne and Sheppey.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/11">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;512,984 to Sittingbourne and Sheppey since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including &pound;169,900 to SS Mary and Sexburgha Church, Minster on Sea in 1998 and &pound;185,000 to Swale borough council for the Sheerness Town Centre Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme from 2001 to 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/12">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Sittingbourne and Sheppey are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/13">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community and informal learning value of public libraries. Kent county council has recognised this value and has undertaken initiatives such as giving access to automated services of information in 12 of Kent's libraries, including Sheerness, and training library workers to deal with the particular needs of asylum seekers and refugees across the county of Kent. These two projects were allocated DCMS/Wolfson Foundation funding of &pound;224,000 and &pound;75,000 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1312W.2/14">Information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Sittingbourne and Sheppey has benefited from over 128 awards totalling over &pound;6.1 million. Of these, 27 awards worth over &pound;3.3 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.1315W.2/1">There is no legal definition of a nightclub&quot;. Under the current licensing regime the police may object to the licensing justices about the grant or renewal of a justices' licence authorising the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premises. They may also object to the grant of a special hours certificate by the justices which authorises sales of alcohol outside of normal permitted hours until 2.00 a.m. in most of the country and until 3.00 a.m. in the west end of London. In order to obtain a special hours certificate, a nightclub must first obtain a public entertainment licence which authorises music and dancing and which is granted by the local authority. The police may also object to grant or renewal of this licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1315W.2/2">The Licensing Act 2003 provides that responsible authorities, including the chief officer of police, may make representations about applications, including those by nightclubs, for provisional statements and about the grant or variation of premises licences. Responsible authorities may also apply for a review of a licence at any time as well as make representations about a review after it has been granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1315W.2/3">Representations must be about the effects of the application on the promotion of the licensing objectives. Where a simple conversion of an existing licence is made under the grandfather rights provisions in schedule 8 of the Act then the chief officer of police may make representations based on crime and disorder grounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1323W.3/1">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) assists those who have become homeless as a result of sectarian intimidation by providing temporary accommodation and arranging for storage of possessions, as necessary. If the Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) can confirm that intimidation has taken place, the Housing Executive will award the applicant the highest level of priority for re-housing. Owner-occupiers who have become homeless as a result of intimidation have the facility to sell their homes under the Housing Executive's Scheme for the Purchase of Evacuated Dwellings and tenants of rented property are entitled to an emergency grant of &pound;692 when they are re-housed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/2">While homelessness caused by sectarian intimidation is not a problem that can be tackled solely by the NIHE, the Housing Executive works, through its Community Cohesion Unit, to prevent such intimidation by promoting good relations between communities. The Housing Executive's strategic objective to promote good relations is linked to the following aims:</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/3" class="indent">to respond quickly and effectively to the needs of people in danger as a result of community conflict;</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/4" class="indent">to work in partnership with others to address the complex housing needs of a divided society;</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/5" class="indent">to respect the rights of people who choose to live in single identity neighbourhoods, and</p>
	<p pid="a.1323W.3/6" class="indent">to facilitate and encourage integrated housing as far as this is practicable, desirable and safe.</p>

The majority of these costs (84 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 and 83 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04) were incurred by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in the course of their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1328W.8/4">The costs set out include general postage items such as standard postal charges, franking units, business reply post, and courier services etc. However, there may be other postal costs relating to mailing arrangements set up by individual units for a specific purpose such as distributing reports or other information which are not covered in the figures given but to identify these separately would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1330W.8/1">Much of my Department's activity is non-regulatory. We have a significant programme of research into best practice, and we disseminate this knowledge to the industry. The last impact assessment concluded that companies involved achieved annual savings of &pound;65 million of which &pound;42 million was attributed to the best practice programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330W.8/2">In the last two years we have funded a major programme to train truck drivers to drive in a more fuel-efficient way. Savings of up to 9 per cent. are possible on fuel bills, typically worth &pound;2,100 per year per driver. We have funded a similar programme to advise on fuel-efficient operating practices, for example advice on aerodynamic equipment and tyres that optimise fuel-consumption. Again substantial fuel and cost savings have been shown to be possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330W.8/3">We will be consulting later in the year on proposals to streamline the operator licensing system, building on the successful computerisation for the Traffic Area Network, which is already saving time and money for both operators and Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330W.8/4">Our Road Safety Bill contains proposals for a system of graduated fixed penalties for offences relating to the operation of commercial vehicles, and a deposit scheme to ensure hauliers from abroad who commit offences to not escape unpunished, as happens too often now. This will provide a more effective deterrent to those who compete unfairly by operating outside the law, to the benefit of legal operators.</p>

	<p pid="a.1332W.14/1">Our partial regulatory impact assessment, published alongside our consultation, estimated the costs to road haulage firms, in terms of need for additional staff costs of between &pound;250-&pound;500 million per year. No judgments were made about how much of this cost would be passed on to client business. Nor has any quantification been made of the possible commercial benefits of the directive, for example in reduced costs from lower driver turnover if the directive makes the job more attractive.</p>

	<p pid="a.1333W.9/1">The armed forces do not screen recruits for dyslexia, nor are personnel obliged to disclose that they are dyslexic. Nonetheless, dyslexia may emerge during initial training or in service; 394 RN and 144 RAF personnel have been identified. The Army intends in the future to capture the number of dyslexic learners receiving support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333W.9/2">While no studies have been undertaken to investigate the welfare and operational impact of dyslexics in the armed forces, every service unit has access to guidance on dyslexia. All three services have specialists which administer the dyslexia adult screening test (DAST) to assess personnel once an instructor or trainee, line manager or member of the services suspect dyslexia. The DAST result will determine whether further specialist assessment by an educational psychologist is required and also provide a profile of strengths and weaknesses which will support the remedial training programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333W.9/3">The armed forces assist personnel with dyslexia during their training and throughout their service career; for example, dyslexic personnel can attend funded training at local colleges. As a result of assessment, extra time may be given in some service examinations with the approval of the appropriate examination authority. Notwithstanding this allowance, all service personnel must achieve the training performance standard. Following learning support, if an individual is unable to meet the operational performance standard they will, where possible, be retrained or moved to another trade.</p>

	<p pid="a.1334W.5/1">Plans for the role of the armed forces in Gibraltar are unchanged. Commander British Forces' mission is to secure and maintain key sites and air and sea ports of disembarkation, which allow reinforcement, in order to ensure Gibraltar's security and territorial integrity, and provide staging and mounting facilities for UK and coalition operations elsewhere. Cascading from this, the Royal Navy's role, in conjunction with the Royal Gibraltar police, is to maintain the security and integrity of British Territorial Waters with a visible maritime presence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334W.5/2">The Royal Gibraltar Regiment contributes to the protection of key facilities in Gibraltar and provides immediate military support to the governor. The RAF's role is to sustain the airfield and associated facilities as an operational airhead, and to facilitate the safe use of the airfield by civilian operators. Linked together, these components provide a collective capability that, together with other local agencies, is charged with providing for the defence and security of Gibraltar. This also provides the capacity for British armed forces to use Gibraltar in support of other operations outside of the territory.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334W.5/3">As a result of a recent review into its structure and tasks, the Royal Gibraltar Regiment will be reconfigured, resulting in a small increase in regular soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334W.5/4">Future spending plans have not yet been set. We have yet to complete our planning round and the budget will be set in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1338W.5/1">There are seven Trafalgar Class submarines in active service of which four are currently available for FLEET programming. Of the remaining boats, two are in dock: one is undergoing a scheduled Long Overhaul Period, which includes a refuel (LOP(R)) and the other is undergoing a scheduled Revalidation and Assisted Maintenance Period (RAMP). A further boat is awaiting the start of Her LOP(R).</p>
	<p pid="a.1338W.5/2">Two boats are currently subject to unscheduled operating restrictions, due to an emergent issue that was identified during routine reviews of their safety cases. Further safety justification work is under way and, while there has been no failure of components, until a robust safety case has been re-established the safest course of action is to limit their operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338W.5/3">For the purposes of FLEET programming, no distinction is made between the Swiftsure and Trafalgar Class submarines. Consequently, there is not actually a full operating strength for the Trafalgar Class. A generic SSN Readiness Profile is used, but to release details of this would prejudice the capability, effectiveness and security of the SSN force, so this data is being withheld under exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.1339W.3/1">In 2003 the Department published the Skills for Life Survey: A national needs and impact survey of literacy, numeracy and ICT skills&quot; (DfES, October 2003). The survey provides the latest estimates [mapped to the National Standards] of literacy, numeracy and ICT levels for adults aged 16 to 65 in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.3/2">While the Skills for Life programme offers high quality, free learning opportunities to all adults who want to improve their skills to Level 2, the survey findings have helped the Department to identify and target some key groups with low skills, including: unemployed people and benefit claimants; low-skilled people in employment; young adults who leave school and begin work with low skills; parents with low skills; and people who live in disadvantaged communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1341W.6/1">As a direct consequence of the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act and the removal of the incorporated FE sector funding systems from local authority control, there was a divergence from local authority systems which has resulted in funding level differences. These differences were made more apparent when all post 16 funding became the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341W.6/2">The Government recognises that there is a funding gap between school sixth forms and further education colleges in the resources provided for students aged 16 to 18 following similar programmes.

	<p pid="a.1342W.5/1">This Government are committed to the creation of at least one 'full service' extended school in each local area by 2006. Over time, however, we want all schools to become extended schools. Our Five-year Strategy for Children and Learners outlines the core offer of extended services that we expect all schools to develop, in partnership with other children's services and the voluntary and community sectors. Our 10 year strategy for child care states that by 2010 all secondary schools will be open from 5am to 6pm all year round, offering a range of activities such as music, sport, and holiday activities. Many schools already offer some activities, recognising the benefits that extended services provide for children, their families, local communities and schools themselves. We are supporting the development of extended schools with both advice and funding including, from April this year, &pound;107 million through all local education authorities in England.</p>

If statutory proposals were not required it would then be for the admission authority&mdash;either the school's governing body or the local authority&mdash;to decide, taking into account all relevant legislation and having regard to the school admissions code of practice and any advice given by the admissions forum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1348W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-30">30 November 2004</phrase>, we announced capital funding allocations for all schools and authorities in England for the next three years. This followed the settlement of the 2004 spending review, in which schools capital increased to &pound;6.3 billion by 2007&ndash;08, a six fold real-terms increase since 1996&ndash;97. Our announcement included direct capital funding for schools, and a typical primary school of 250 pupils will receive &pound;25,500 of devolved formula capital in 2005&ndash;06, &pound;32,250 in 2006&ndash;07and &pound;34,250 in 2007&ndash;08. A typical secondary school of 1,000 pupils will receive &pound;87,250, &pound;108,500 and &pound;113,000 in these years to use for its own priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348W.5/2">Further, Sefton local education authority, which includes Corby and Formby, will receive a total of &pound;12.6 million of formulaic funding over the next three years, and a further &pound;3.5 million will be available for its voluntary aided schools. In all, over &pound;32.5 million has been allocated from 2005&ndash;06 until 2007&ndash;08 for Sefton and its schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348W.5/3">Additionally, the authority can apply to the Targeted Capital Fund for exceptional needs which it cannot fund from its formulaic allocations. Last week we announced details of how authorities can access this funding for 2006&ndash;07, and all authorities are invited to apply for this additional funding. Finally, because Sefton is not prioritised early in the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, by 2011 we aim to provide it with funding to transform at least one of its secondary school with the greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348W.5/4">My officials are currently meeting all authorities to discuss their capital strategy in the light of our recent announcements on funding allocations and BSF, and how they can best use the funding available to them from our allocations and their other resources to improve their school estate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1353W.6/1">Children's centres are one-stop shops joining up services for young children and their families, including child care integrated with early learning. Children's centres are community based, responsive to local needs and focused on tackling early disadvantage. Centre staff will help parents access services their family needs either by offering services at the centre or linking parents with other providers in the local area. This will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1353W.6/2" class="indent">early education and child care places that fit with families' needs, whether in group settings, with child minders, or at home;</p>
	<p pid="a.1353W.6/3" class="indent">parenting and family support;</p>

	<p pid="a.1353W.6/7">Children's centres are currently being developed in the most disadvantaged areas where needs are greatest. In most cases children's centres will offer early education and child care but in some less disadvantaged areas, a more flexible model may be appropriate. The services delivered at each centre will depend on local needs and existing service provision in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353W.6/8">A large number of children's centres especially those in the more disadvantaged areas will be based upon Sure Start Local Programmes and Neighbourhood Nurseries. However, children's centres can be, and already are being, based upon a much wider range of existing private and public provision including, day nurseries, schools (nursery, primary and secondary) and family centres as well as other early years settings. Local authorities should draw upon their experience delivering the full range of early years settings and services, when establishing children's centres, building on what is currently available in the immediate locality.</p>

	<p pid="a.1359W.2/14">1.A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. Figures given are for all admission methods.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.2/15">2.The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episodes statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation. OPCS4 codes C71-C72 and C74-C75 have been used for cataract operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.2/16">3.Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension. Average time waited figures given are for waiting list and booked admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.2/17">4.Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).</p>

The Office of Fair Trading report The private dentistry market in the UK&quot; published in March 2003 estimated that out of 11,000 dental practices about 210 are totally private, treating no NHS patients. Data on the percentages of complete leavers, by primary care trust and parliamentary constituency has been placed in the Library. The data do not take account of dentists who moved to other areas and continued to work in the general or personal dental services. The dentists could have ceased doing NHS work for a number of different reasons including retirement or leave to take a short-term absence. New contractual arrangements, which we are to introduce by April 2006, are intended to make NHS dentistry more attractive to dentists.</p>

	<p pid="a.1361W.3/2">The decision to allow primary care trusts and dentists more time to prepare for the full implementation of the national health service dental reforms does not affect the resources available to support NHS dentistry. While primary dental services remain predominantly demand led, the distribution of resources is not susceptible to detailed central control. However, the additional resources underpin not only the higher income levels for existing dental practices recommended by the doctors and dentists review body but also the recruitment of 1,000 NHS dentists in little over a year and the expansion of personal dental service (PDS) schemes to provide new ways of working to the benefit of dentists and patients. We now have over 4,000 dentists in over 1,400 dental practices working under PDS arrangements. By April, we expect 25 per cent. of dental practices to be operating within the PDS.</p>

	<p pid="a.1366W.5/1">The Department recently completed a public consultation exercise on draft regulations to govern the operation of the expanded national health service injury costs recovery (ISR) scheme. Although the full analysis of the responses to the consultation is still under way, one of the key messages to come out of our initial scrutiny was that high levels of concern remain about the insurance market's ability to cope with the new changes. After further discussions, I have decided that now is not the right time to introduce the expanded scheme. However, we remain committed to the principle of polluter pays&quot; that underpins the ICR Scheme, and the expanded scheme will be introduced by October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1368W.0/1">The most recent review of the research evidence about the health effects of UV radiation was published in 2002 by the National Radiological Protection Board's (NRPB) independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation (AGNIR).</p>
	<p pid="a.1368W.0/2">The review gives clear evidence that exposure to ultra-violet radiation (UVR) is a risk factor for developing melanoma and other skin cancers. There is less certainty about the relative roles of cumulative (lifetime) exposure or burning episodes in the genesis of the different types of skin cancer. Chronic exposure to solar radiation also causes photo-ageing of the skin. The risk of developing melanoma has increased substantially in white populations in the United Kingdom and Europe for several decades. The review did not consider clinical issues such as the effect of sun exposure on survival rates for melanoma.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368W.0/3">The review noted that the possibility has been raised that the immunosuppressive effects of UVR might be involved in causing lymphoma. The review concluded that overall the results are not-consistent with a major role for solar UVR in the aetiology of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), but they leave open the possibility of a minor role, or an aetiological relation for a particular subtype of NHL.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368W.0/4">The review also contains a chapter on vitamin D, which considers the amount of vitamin D needed from UV exposure or the diet to sustain adequate vitamin D levels. It considers the role of vicarious sun exposure in vitamin D synthesis. It notes that infant formula milks are fortified with vitamin D. There is no information in the review on vitamin D and multiple sclerosis, or on any relationship between vitamin D levels in early childhood and illness in adulthood.</p>
	<p pid="a.1368W.0/5">The European skin cancer society, Euroskin, is hosting an international meeting to look at the whole issue of UV exposure, vitamin D levels and health later this year. This meeting will include consideration of hypotheses of a wider role for vitamin D in long-term health.</p>

	<p pid="a.1376W.2/8" class="italic">Future financing 2007&ndash;13</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/9">The Council had an exchange of views on competitiveness for growth and employment (spending on Lisbon-related objectives). The Government argued that the budget needed to be determined according to rigorous prioritisation and clear EU value added. The Government also argued, along with other supporters of an overall 1 per cent. GNI budget package, that the proposed budget (a threefold increase) was far too high. All member states endorsed research and development as a general priority but with different emphases on where EU value-added lay. Most member states expressed deep scepticism about the proposed Growth Adjustment Fund. The next meeting of the GAERC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March</phrase> will have a broader discussion of progress in the overall future financing negotiation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1376W.2/11" class="italic">MEPP</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/12">The Council discussed the recent political developments in the MEPP, including the outcomes from the Sharm al-Sheik meeting and the Israeli Government's formal decision to implement the disengagement plan, which includes withdrawal of settlements from Gaza and part of the West Bank. The UK thanked the presidency, High Representative Solana, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and member states for their support for the <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase> London Meeting and explained the aim of the meeting was to assist the Palestinian leadership in building the institutions for a viable state. The focus would be on economic, governance and security institutions. The Council also discussed the importance of implementing UNSCR 1559 and condemned the attack which killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/13" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/14">The Council discussed strengthening the EU's relations with Iraq following last month's successful elections and agreed a package of measures to that end. These include an integrated ESDP Rule of Law Mission (EUJUST LEX) with a liaison office in Baghdad, continued assistance with the elections process, provision of constitutional experts, intensified activity on capacity building in Iraqi Ministries particularly in the trade and energy sectors, and a commitment to an EU Troika visit to Iraq and a Joint Political Declaration to frame future co-operation, as soon as the Iraqi Transitional Government is in place and political developments allow. There was also discussion on the effective co-ordination of international reconstruction assistance to the Iraqi administration based on a French proposal. The UK welcomed the French proposal and thanked member states and the Commission for their constructive approach. There was much the EU could now do to help nurture Iraq's new government and the continuing political process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/15" class="italic">Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/16">The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative, Soren Jessen-Petersen, joined Ministers for a discussion on Kosovo. The Council offered Mr. Petersen its support for his work to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1244. It noted that the Review of UN-endorsed Standards would take place in mid-2005. If positive, this Review would pave the way for a process to determine Kosovo's final status. The Council expressed hope that the Provisional Institutions of Self Government would continue implementation of Standards to allow a positive assessment. The Council encouraged Belgrade to engage constructively on Kosovo. It reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans&mdash;including Kosovo&mdash;was within the European Union; the EU would therefore have an important future role to play. The Council emphasised that Kosovo's future must be consistent with the principles of multi-ethnic democracy. The UK supported this assessment of the road ahead, agreeing that the UN would remain in the lead in Kosovo but that the EU would also have an important role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/17">The Council also discussed Croatia and adopted Conclusions which set out clearly that Croatia must co-operate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia if accession negotiations are to open on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-17">17 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/18" class="italic">Transatlantic relations</p>

	<p pid="a.1376W.2/20" class="italic">Ukraine</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/21">After a brief discussion, the Council agreed Conclusions based on the 10 point package presented to the GAERC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January</phrase> by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. The package consists of 10 concrete steps to strengthen co-operation between the EU and Ukraine beyond the European Neighbourhood Action Plan which was also launched and endorsed by the EU-Ukraine Co-operation Council in the margins of the GAERC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/22" class="italic">Revision of Cotonou</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/23">The Council discussed revisions to the text of the Cotonou Agreement (which governs EU relations with the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states) and the accompanying financial package to succeed the ninth European Development Fund (EDF) in preparation for the EU/ACP ministerial meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-23">23 February 2005</phrase>. Commissioner Michel briefed the Council of the latest state of play on negotiations of the text with the ACP. Differences between the two sides were now small and he was confident that agreement could be reached on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-23">23 February</phrase>. Agreement was also reached on the financial package with the retention of language on a performance review on which decisions about financing beyond the minimum agreed sum would be based. The flexibility in the language on the sunset clause setting 2007 as the final date for commitments of funds under the current EDF was also retained. Both are good outcomes for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/24" class="italic">Sudan</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/25">The Council agreed Conclusions which call upon the Government of Sudan and the National Democratic Alliance to sign the full Cairo Agreement as soon as possible, note the Council's concerns about violations of the ceasefire and it's readiness to support measures agreed in the UN Security Council, and welcome the International Commission of Inquiry report on Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/26" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Great Lakes</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/27">Belgian Foreign Minister De Gucht briefed the Council on his recent visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He had two concerns. First, further problems could arise if no solution was found to the training of a unified army. Belgium had trained one unified brigade, and was helping with a second. But EU funding was required to support this. He hoped that a solution could be found by the time of the next GAERC. Second, election plans for the DRC were unrealistic. If a referendum on the constitution was held in July, as planned, elections could not take place until 2006. One solution would be to hold elections in July and for both houses of the provisional parliament to vote on a new constitution immediately thereafter. The presidency suggested that EU Africa Directors meet soon to discuss the two issues raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/28" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Belarus</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/29">Lithuania called for the EU to do more to support democratisation, human rights and the independent media in Belarus. Lithuania informed the Council they would host a workshop in Vilnius on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1376W.2/31">Spain stressed the importance of the EU's strategic relationship with the Mercosur countries. The presidency said they would strengthen work with a view to the EU/Mercosur meeting in May.</p>

	<p pid="a.1379W.0/1">UK Government officials in Iraq, as members of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), and other officials in the UK were consulted and invited to comment during the drafting of CPA Order 81. The Order was the subject of consultation and co-ordination with the Iraqi Governing Council, and was consistent with the needs identified by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for the development of Iraq and its transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.0/2">The provisions of CPA Order 81 concern the registration and protection of intellectual property rights in new plant varieties. The Order should not affect the ability of Iraqi farmers to save seeds from traditional sources. Any restrictions would relate only to patented biotech inventions or protected plant varieties. This is the normal effect of introducing such an intellectual property law. To secure protection, plant varieties would have needed to have been shown to be new, distinct from other varieties in common knowledge, uniform and stable. Farmers will have a choice of sources for their seed supply: they may choose to continue using current sources, such as saving their own seeds of traditional and unprotected varieties, or may choose to buy seeds which are subject to patent or plant variety rights protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.0/3">The implementation, application and interpretation of all CPA orders is now a matter for the Iraqis. The newly elected Transitional National Assembly, together with the Iraqi Transitional Government, have the power to overturn or rewrite any existing CPA Orders that they feel do not address the needs and rights of the Iraqi people.</p>

	<p pid="a.1382W.2/1">Under the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), the Sudanese Government have committed itself to complying fully with international human rights treaties. The CPA sets out rights and freedoms to be enjoyed under Sudanese law, including the rights to fair trial and equality before the law. The UK plans to play a leading role supporting reform of the Sudanese justice sector. We have committed &pound;7.2 million for a programme which will include training for police and the establishment of key commissions to support the implementation of the Peace Agreement. We are also funding programmes through the UN Development Programme (UNDP), Christian Aid and the Sudanese Organisation Against Torture (SOAT) to support legal aid training and to raise awareness of human rights standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1382W.2/2">The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is leading the UN's effort to strengthen the rule of law in Sudan. They are focusing on training and capacity building. The UK has provided funds for UNDP to appoint two legal experts to work on legal reconstruction and reform, and to co-ordinate donor support in this area. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) is also implementing programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights in the administration of justice. It is important to seize the opportunities offered by the CPA to make progress on human rights in Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="a.1385W.2/1">Prior to April 2001 the lower capital limit was &pound;3,000 and the upper capital limit was &pound;16,000 for all client groups. From April 2001 the lower capital limit for pensioners was raised to &pound;6,000. From April 2006 the lower capital limit for working age people will be raised to &pound;6,000 to bring it into line with that of pensioners. With the introduction of pension credit in October 2003 the amount of notional income that is assumed from capital, for pensioners has been halved from &pound;1 in every &pound;250 over the lower limit to &pound;1 in every &pound;500; there is no upper capital limit for those pensioners receiving the guarantee credit element of pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385W.2/2">If the savings rules for council tax benefit were changed to match those in pension credit, there would be some 160,000 additional beneficiaries at an estimated cost of &pound;65 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385W.2/3" class="indentitalic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1385W.2/4">1.Beneficiaries are rounded to the nearest 10 thousand, costs to the nearest &pound;5 million. 2.Each beneficiary represents a benefit unit, which can be a single claimant or a couple. 3.The impact is estimated using the DWP Policy Simulation Model for 2005&ndash;06. 4.This model is based on the 2002&ndash;03 Family Resources Survey data, up-rated to 2004&ndash;05 prices, benefit rates and earnings levels, and is calibrated to latest published forecasts and policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1385W.5/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385W.5/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in North West Leicestershire will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled three and four-year old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, whilst older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1385W.5/24">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18-years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings.

These are based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for the relevant year and take account of both entitled non-recipients and non-entitled recipients.

	<p pid="a.1391W.2/3">Take-up for private households entitled to the savings element of pension credit is of the order of 60 per cent. This figure does not include those in residential care or nursing homes. It is derived by comparing administrative and survey sources, which are not directly comparable. No meaningful robust figures for the savings element unclaimed can be derived in this way. Indeed any take-up figure derived this way is indicative only.</p>

However, deemed buyback is only one of a number of options available to a member for securing their accrued rights (for example they could transfer their rights to another scheme).
