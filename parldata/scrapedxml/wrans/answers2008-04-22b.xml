The independent Committee on Toxicity completed a substantial review of evidence in September 2007 and concluded that it did not establish (or rule out) a link between cabin air and pilot ill health. The Committee recommended research to sample cabin air during 'fume events', which it estimated occur on 0.05 per cent. of flights overall. Such sampling has not been done before. The Government accepted the recommendation and has begun work to develop the methodology. Details are on the Department for Transport website.</p>

However our programme of vehicle emissions testing to develop 'emissions factors' for the purposes of national emissions inventory modelling does include measuring carbon dioxide emissions (and hence fuel economy) under a range of different types of driving condition. These include testing under relatively constant speed driving conditions from around 58 miles per hour to 70 miles per hour. The results from these tests show carbon dioxide emissions increasing over this speed range. In deriving emissions factors, our contractors also consider the results of similar research conducted elsewhere in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.1894W.8/3">The emissions factors characterise emissions against average driving speed. Below 58 miles per hour the characteristics are based on driving patterns featuring accelerations and decelerations rather than constant speed driving.</p>

	<p pid="b.1895W.5/1">The Primary Route Network (PRN) is a national network which exists to aid navigation for long-distance traffic. It connects Primary Route Destinations in England and comprises all non-motorway trunk roads and the most important local roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.1895W.5/2">A review of the Primary Route Network took place in the mid-1980s. The Regional Offices of the Department for Transport (as it then was) conducted the review in consultation with county highway authorities.</p>

Where a Government Office wants a major change to the network or change to the primary destinations this must be approved by the Department for Transport centrally. The criteria used to set the network are that the Primary Routes must be the most satisfactory routes for through traffic between places of traffic importance in the opinion of the Secretary of State (although for non-trunk roads this opinion will be formed after consultation with the traffic authority for the road).</p>

	<p pid="b.1897W.7/2">The Government take the issue of illegal construction (i.e. construction undertaken without proper planning permission or building control approval) very seriously and aims to ensure that the building control and planning systems support local authorities in identifying and dealing with illegal construction activities effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.7/3">The 2006 planning enforcement review confirmed that local planning authorities had sufficient enforcement powers to deal with breaches of planning control.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.7/4">There are penalties for developers who commence or complete development prior to obtaining planning permission. In practice, anyone who undertakes development without first obtaining the necessary permission puts the investment at considerable risk, especially in the case of a building which may subsequently have to be demolished. Alternatively, they may find themselves subject to a summary penalty on conviction of an enforcement notice or stop notice offence. The maximum penalty in the magistrates court is &pound;20,000 and there is no upper limit on the penalty which the Crown Court may impose on conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.7/5">Since 2005, local planning authorities can also now serve a temporary stop notice. The temporary stop notice enables the local planning authority to require a breach of planning control to stop immediately for a period of 28 days, during which the local planning authority can decide whether to take further enforcement action. In addition to enforcement notices, stop notices and temporary stop notices, authorities may also apply for a planning injunction in the High Court or county court, to restrain an actual or expected breach of planning control. Once an injunction has been granted, anyone who fails to comply with its terms risks imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.7/6">In the case of building control, local authorities work with builders to identify where the work they are undertaking does not comply with the building regulations and resolve any issues. However, where enforcement action is necessary they have a range of enforcement options available to them such as serving enforcement notices and fines through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.7/7">To support local authorities' enforcement efforts, legislation came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April</phrase> which extended the time limit from six months to two years for local authorities to prosecute offenders for breaches relating to energy efficiency requirements. This will be widened to cover all breaches of the building regulations as soon as possible. We are also consulting on extending the time limits in other areas, for instance the issuing of an enforcement notice requiring non-compliant work to be pulled down or rectified.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.7/8">The current consultation on the Future of Building Control proposes a further range of enforcement mechanisms to prevent illegal work from going ahead such as stop notices and fixed monetary penalties. There are also proposals to help industry forward plan and comply with the building regulations by moving towards a more planned approach to building regulation and to free up more time and resources for local authorities to focus on high-risk building work.</p>

However, it will be expected to adhere to implementing energy efficiency standards, environmental sustainability and eco-design in its programme as set out in its business plan for 2008-11. On a wider front, the Government have set out an ambitious timetable with the aim of achieving zero carbon new homes by 2016, including the progressive tightening of building regulations in 2010 and 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.1899W.5/3">Information about local authorities' actions under homelessness legislation is collected quarterly at local authority level. This information includes the number of households accepted by local authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty. The duty owed to an accepted household is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1899W.5/5">Information about decisions taken under the homelessness legislation for A8 (and more recently A2) headed households is published quarterly, on CLG's Housing Statistics website in &quot;Live Tables&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1899W.5/8">Data for 2007 show that 425 A8-headed households were accepted as being owed the main homelessness duty, comprising 0.7 per cent. of the total acceptances over the same period. The quality of A8 foreign national data submitted is improving, and we are working with local authorities to continue this improvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1899W.5/9">(ii) Non-EU nationals</p>
	<p pid="b.1899W.5/10">We are also working with local authorities to obtain better information on numbers of homelessness decisions and acceptances for other, non-EU foreign nationals on the P1E statutory homelessness form. These figures will be published as soon we are satisfied that both the response rate and quality of the data reported is sufficiently robust.</p>

	<p pid="b.1901W.0/1">Guidance to local planning authorities on the process and general content of local development frameworks (LDFs) is set out in Planning Policy Statement 12. Government have also published a number of national planning policy statements (PPSs) and planning policy guidance notes (PPGs) on different matters which should be taken into account by local planning authorities in preparing their LDFs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1901W.0/2">PPG2 sets out national policy on green belts. This makes clear that there should be a presumption against inappropriate development in designated green belt land. Such development should not be approved, except in very special circumstances. PPS3 on 'Housing' sets out national planning policies for achieving high quality housing which make the most efficient and effective use of land to meet identified needs for new housing. PPS3 is not prescriptive in terms of directing housing to particular areas but asks local planning authorities to identify, through the preparation of strategic housing land availability assessments, specific, suitable sites in their plans which may include sites within the urban fringes and existing urban areas. A site is suitable if it offers a suitable location for housing development and would contribute to the creation of sustainable, mixed communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1901W.0/3">It is for local planning authorities to assess a site's suitability for housing, taking into account factors such as policy restrictions, such as designations or protected areas; physical problems of restrictions, such as access, infrastructure, and flood risk; potential impacts, including effect upon landscape features and conservation; and the environmental conditions which would be experienced by prospective residents.</p>

The current definition of zero carbon homes as set out in the policy statement 'Building a Greener Future' means that over a year, the net carbon emissions from all energy use in the home are zero. The policy statement suggests that the zero carbon standard should be achieved through measures on the site of the dwelling or development, or through a low or zero carbon energy source connected to the development using a private wire. However, this will be the subject of a consultation process in the summer when we will be consulting on how the zero carbon 2016 standard should be achieved with a view to finalising the definition by the end of 2008.</p>

During that time culture results were obtained for 3,238 carcases. Of these, 481 (approximately 15 per cent.) were positive for bovine TB.</p>
	<p pid="b.1906W.5/3">An extended post mortem examination carried out on a sample of 205 badgers culled as part of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial revealed substantially more infected animals; approximately double the rate, compared to standard post-mortem examination. Badgers submitted under the RTA survey underwent standard post-mortem examination. Therefore, these prevalence values are likely to be under-estimates.</p>

	<p pid="b.1906W.8/1">Not all badger populations in England have been tested for bovine tuberculosis (bTB). However, <i> Mycobacterium bovis</i> (M. bovis) was detected in 16.6 per cent. of badger carcases from proactively culled areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial, located in West and South West England. The prevalence of infection in initial culls was higher in the inner regions of proactive treatment areas (two kilometres or more inside the boundary) than in the outer areas. This is not surprising as trial areas were centred on areas of high bTB risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.1906W.8/2">The results of DEFRA's Road Traffic Accident survey, carried out in seven counties between 2002 and 2005, showed similar levels of prevalence with M. bovis being detected in, on average, 15 per cent. of badger carcases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1906W.8/3">An extended post-mortem examination carried out on a sample of 205 RBCT badgers revealed substantially more infected animals, approximately double, than did standard post-mortem examination. Therefore, these prevalence values are likely to be under-estimates.</p>

	<p pid="b.1907W.2/1">DEFRA and the devolved administrations' fisheries departments published the UK Small Cetacean By-catch Response Strategy in March 2003. An update on the progress of implementing the strategy can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1907W.2/2">As part of this strategy, the UK Government have put over &pound;2 million, between 2000 and 2008, into researching by-catch mitigation measures and monitoring by-catch on vessels through observers. The purpose of this is to identify those fisheries responsible for high levels of cetacean by-catch and mitigation measures that are effective at deterring cetaceans over the long-term and safe and cost-effective for the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1907W.2/3">In December 2004, the UK Government banned pelagic pair trawling for bass by UK vessels within 12 miles off the south-west coast of England because of concerns it was the cause of large numbers of dolphin deaths. Unfortunately, the European Commission did not support the UK's request to extend this ban to the vessels of other member states operating within these waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1907W.2/4">Member states are required under Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004 to present an annual report to the European Commission on their by-catch observer programmes. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has been asked by the European Commission to look at these annual reports. I await their analysis before deciding if representations need to be made to the Commission about common arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1910W.0/1">The total Animal Health budget for 2007-08 was &pound;109,864,000. The proportion for on-farm work is 65 per cent., and is estimated to be &pound;71,412,000. This is only an estimate as not all bills have been processed.

This does not include disease outbreak costs and costs relating to abattoir visits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1910W.0/2">The reduction in percentage for this financial year is mainly attributed to staff who would have been carrying out on-farm work being required to work on the disease outbreaks in 2007 (estimated to be around 16 per cent. of budget).

	<p pid="b.1912W.0/1">The Government recognise that the marketing of local food can bring benefits for producers and consumers. In general, fewer middlemen are involved, and this allows farmers and small producers to retain a higher proportion of the end price of their produce. It also increases consumer choice and raises awareness and interest in local food by helping to improve consumers' links with, and understanding of, the rural economy and food production. Suppliers will flourish by providing what customers want and there is growing public enthusiasm for locally produced food and food with a clear regional provenance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1912W.0/2">We have helped to facilitate local sourcing by providing funding (through our various grant schemes and our support for Food from Britain) towards a range of measures helping regional and local food producers overcome barriers to market. Examples include &quot;meet the buyer&quot; events, the encouragement of food hubs and shared distribution facilities, and training seminars. Support is also available under the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) for activities linked to the promotion of quality regional and local food culture, the use of native English breeds of cattle in environmental stewardship schemes and for activities linked to promoting the economic sustainability of the livestock sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1912W.0/3">I also refer the right hon. Member to the oral ministerial statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State (Hilary Benn) on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 39, in which he announced a package of measures to help those farmers most affected by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. This included &pound;2 million for the promotion and marketing of lamb, beef and pork both at home and in our export markets. The domestic promotional activity carried out by the English Beef and Lamb Executive (Eblex) and the British Pig Executive ran from October 2007 to March 2008 and, during the specific periods of promotion, four week volume sales increased between 2 and 14 per cent. compared to the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1912W.0/4">DEFRA also provided &pound;1.2 million of funding from August 2006 to March of this year to kick-start the Beef Better Returns Programme administered by Eblex. This has involved measures to improve the competitiveness of the English beef sector and promote the product under the English Beef Quality Mark.</p>
	<p pid="b.1912W.0/5">In addition to this, DEFRA's ongoing Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI), launched in 2003 to help deliver the Government's Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy, aims to increase opportunities for small and local producers to tender to supply food to the public sector. Our funding of this initiative has helped support workshops for buyers and suppliers, regional pilot projects to develop the supply side, and a range of guides aimed at both food producers and public sector buyers. More information on the PSFPI can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1912W.0/6">However, the success of the livestock sectors in England will continue to depend upon their ability to compete upon market principles, including performance, quality and welfare standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1917W.3/1">The UK will play an important role in the conservation and protection of cetaceans at the next annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to be held in Santiago, Chile in June 2008, which I plan to attend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1917W.3/2">We will continue to support the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling and oppose all forms of whaling, other than limited whaling operations by indigenous people for subsistence purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1917W.3/3">The UK will promote the non-lethal use of cetaceans (that is, whale-watching) and continue to highlight the unacceptable level of cruelty involved in current whaling operations, supporting proposals that increase welfare provisions. We will once again vote in support of the creation of Whale Sanctuaries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1930W.8/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Derek Twigg to Andrew Mackinlay:</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.8/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February</phrase> (Official Report, columns 701-712W) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-19">19 February</phrase> (Official Report, column 1178W) about the National Army Museum (NAM).</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.8/4" class="indent">The NAM is based in London and provides a national archive for some Regimental records and collections. Items in its collections are readily accessible through its reading room to anyone who wishes to see them. Similarly, subject to considerations of copyright and conservation, it provides copies of documents to members of the public, in whatever capacity they are seeking the information, on payment of the appropriate fee. The NAM is not resourced to provide copies free of charge, nor is it permitted to use its grant-in-aid funding to subsidise other individuals or organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.8/5" class="indent">In addition to the NAM, there are currently some 130 Regimental and Corps museums and collections across the UK which provide a source of historical information including uniforms, badges, weapons, military memorabilia and archives. Museums within this network often request information from each other, or indeed the NAM. A nominal charge would be made for these official requests. However, the Curator of a Regimental museum, Miss Moreno, wrote to the NAM Director on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-01">1 February</phrase> seeking information in a private capacity as part of her studies for her degree. It was standard practice therefore for her to be charged for the information. The NAM Director replied to Miss Moreno on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February</phrase> outlining the charging policy and offering a twenty five percent discount in recognition of the inconvenience the delay in providing the information had caused. I understand that Miss Moreno has now received her information, and paid the fee.</p>

However, given the complex way in which these factors interact, a conclusive judgment on their relative importance is extremely difficult to make.

	<p pid="b.1945W.9/1">Code C issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 is the code of practice for the detention, treatment and questioning of persons by police officers. Persons who attend the police station voluntarily must be offered refreshments at appropriate times and if they are not arrested but are cautioned, informed that they have the right to obtain free legal advice. There are no restrictions on the ability of the person to make contact with people outside the police station. The code also requires that any person who is arrested at the police station having attended voluntarily must be brought before the custody officer as soon as possible after their arrest. The custody officer is then responsible for opening a custody record for the individual and ensuring that the relevant provisions and safeguards in PACE are applied.</p>

	<p pid="b.1947W.2/2">The police currently have the power to request persons aged 18 and over in police detention who have been charged or arrested with a &quot;trigger offence&quot;, to provide a sample for testing for the presence of a specified Class A drug.</p>
	<p pid="b.1947W.2/3">The trigger offences are set out in Schedule 6 to the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.

	<p pid="b.1961W.2/2">The mobile network operators build base stations in order to meet customers need for coverage and service. The decision to build in a particular location is largely a commercial matter for the operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.1961W.2/3">For new 3G networks, an 80 per cent. population coverage obligation by 2007 was placed on each licence holder to encourage network rollout. This could equate to approximately 45 per cent. land area coverage averaged over the whole of the United Kingdom. The Office of Communications (Ofcom) has now completed its assessment of compliance with the obligation and has proposed action against O2, the one operator not yet having complied. However coverage beyond this obligation would again be a commercial matter for operators. For 2G or GSM networks the original coverage obligations laid on GSM operators were discharged many years ago and have been significantly exceeded on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1961W.2/4">In some areas, opposition to mast construction can have detrimental effect on operators' plans to extend mobile phone coverage.

	<p pid="b.1962W.2/1">Government support for tourism promotion in the east of England, and the other eight regions of England, has increased substantially since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.2/2">From 1997-98 to 2002-03, the east of England tourist board received funding of between &pound;427,000 and &pound;868,000 per year from the former English Tourism Council (previously known as the English Tourist Board).</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.2/3">As part of the DCMS Tourism Reform programme, responsibility for supporting tourism passed to the regional development agencies (RDAs), including the east of England development agency (EEDA) in 2003. The RDAs together estimate total spending of &pound;43.5 million on tourism support in 2007-08. EEDA has invested substantially in sector, with &pound;0.8 million, &pound;1.5 million and &pound;1.8 million in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.2/4">At national level, DCMS funds VisitBritain to market and promote all parts of England, including the east of England, to domestic and international visitors. Spreading the benefits of this work is an important part of the relevant funding agreement, which requires VisitBritain to achieve a specified proportion of additional expenditure by inbound visitors outside London. For 2005-06, the target was 55 per cent. and VisitBritain achieved 61 per cent. For 2006-07, the target was 54 per cent. and VisitBritain achieved 57 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.2/5">Further support for the sector, including the bulk of promotion to the domestic market (which makes up around 80 per cent. of the sector), is led by local councils. DCMS has also made substantial investment in heritage, arts and culture throughout the country since 1997. These sectors, in addition to their intrinsic value to the nation's cultural life, benefit the visitor economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1962W.5/1">Government support for tourism promotion in the north east, and the other eight regions of England, has increased substantially since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.5/2">From 1997-98 to 2002-03, the Northumbria Tourist Board received funding of between &pound;241,000 and &pound;570,000 a year from the former English Tourism Council (previously known as the English Tourist Board).</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.5/3">As part of the DCMS Tourism Reform Programme, responsibility for supporting tourism passed to the regional development agencies (RDAs), including One NorthEast (ONE) in 2003. The RDAs together estimate total spending of &pound;43.5 million on tourism support in 2007-08. ONE has made a substantial investment in the tourism sector; including funding of &pound;1.7 million, &pound;4.4 and &pound;3.6 million in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively to promote the north east.</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.5/4">At national level, DCMS funds VisitBritain to market and promote all parts of England, including the north east, to domestic and international visitors. Spreading the benefits of this work is an important part of the relevant funding agreement, which requires VisitBritain to achieve a specified proportion of additional expenditure by inbound visitors outside London. For 2005-06, the target was 55 per cent. and VisitBritain achieved 61 per cent. For 2006-07, the target was 54 per cent. and VisitBritain achieved 57 per cent..</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.5/5">Further support for the sector, including the bulk of promotion to the domestic market (which makes up around 80 per cent. of the sector), is led by local councils. DCMS has also made substantial investment in heritage, arts and culture throughout the country since 1997. These sectors, in addition to their intrinsic value to the nation's cultural life, benefit the visitor economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1963W.3/1">The UK Government have committed significant funds for reducing child poverty, including &pound;8.5 billion for education (2007-15), &pound;150 million for children affected by HIV/AIDS (2004-2007) and over &pound;7 million for addressing forced labour and child labour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1963W.3/2">In addition the Department for International Development supports children and young people through direct funding to non-governmental organisations, including Plan UK (2007-2011; &pound;3.1 million for the first three years) and Save the Children (2005-2011; &pound;20.7 million for the first three years). In 2007 a joint DFID and civil society network on children was established to learn from civil society experience of working to promote child rights and reduce child poverty. DFID has also contributed &pound;7 million (2006-2009) to the 'Young Lives project', which is a 15 year study of child poverty in four countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1963W.3/3">In 2008 HMG is leading on a global 'Call to Action' around the millennium development goals (the MDGs), which focus on achieving measurably improved outcomes for millions of the world's most deprived children on for example income poverty, nutrition and access to education and health services. DFID will be renewing efforts around the MDGs and we will also be working with other international players to ensure that the global community&mdash;including the business community&mdash;commit all the resources and energy needed to reduce child poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1964W.0/1">Non-permanent members of staff at the Department for International Development (DFID) receive payment on either an annual salary basis or an hourly rate basis, depending on the terms of their contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.1964W.0/2">Non-permanent, salaried staff are recruited to fill a wide range of managerial, advisory and administrative posts, and salaries vary significantly depending on the post held. The salary may also be subject to review during the period of their appointment. Details of the hourly rates of pay for all salaried non-permanent members of staff for each of the last 12 months could only be provided at disproportionate cost, following a detailed review of each individual's salary records.</p>
	<p pid="b.1964W.0/3">DFID also appoints non-permanent staff through recruitment agencies to undertake both administrative and specialist roles, including IT and communications specialists.

	<p pid="b.1964W.0/4">Since April 2007 the majority of administrative appointments have been made through two agencies serving our two headquarters locations&mdash;one in London and one in East Kilbride.

	<p pid="b.1969W.7/2">We are aware that in parts of Chin state, as well as neighbouring areas in India and Bangladesh, people are experiencing significant hardship due to rodent infestations and consequent crop damage. The Department for International Development (DFID) is in contact with the UN Development Programme and World Food Programme about what humanitarian response may be required. DFID already provides a significant amount of support to Chin state from inside Burma. We also closely monitor the human rights situation in Burma, including abuses committed against ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1969W.7/3">We have received no reports of any recent upsurge in levels of migration across Indian and Bangladeshi borders from Chin state and as a result have not discussed the issue with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees or Indian and Bangladeshi governments. We do, however, discuss conditions in Burma generally and the plight of refugees from Burma with neighbouring countries.</p>

We have consistently informed the Chinese government of our view that greater autonomy should be granted to the Tibetans. But like all other EU members, we do not advocate Tibetan independence. We have emphasised that the current political difficulties in Tibet can best be resolved through dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama has stated publicly that he opposes violence and does not seek independence, but greater autonomy for Tibet. We consider that this provides a basis for a negotiated settlement to the issue of Tibet.</p>

	<p pid="b.1977W.2/1">The Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007 (the Act) contains provisions relating to three distinct policy areas&mdash;Consumer Voice, estate agents and contracts concluded away from business premises (&quot;doorstep selling&quot;)&mdash;which are being commenced and implemented to different timetables:</p>
	<p pid="b.1977W.2/2" class="indent">1. The new National Consumer Council, Scottish Consumer Council, Welsh Consumer Council, Northern Ireland Postal Services Committee, and new statutory redress schemes for gas, electricity, and postal services consumers, are planned to be operational on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2008</phrase>. Work is well under way on the development of these new arrangements. Commencement of the relevant provisions of the Act reflects both the progress and the needs of the implementation programme. The Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007 (Commencement No. 2) Order 2007 (SI 2007 No. 3546) brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-21">21 December 2007</phrase> the provisions which enabled the appointments of Chairs and Members to be made formally to the new bodies, and for the new bodies to make an important contribution to the implementation process. That Order also commenced provisions relating to the new redress schemes. The Commencement No. 4 Order (SI 2008 No. 905), which was made on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-26">26 March 2008</phrase>, commenced with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> the provisions which made the new National Consumer Council responsible for maintaining accounts. The Commencement No. 3 Order has been published in draft, and is subject to approval by a resolution of each House of Parliament. The draft Order seeks to commence the provisions relating to the requirement on the new National Consumer Council to publish and consult upon a forward work programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1977W.2/3" class="indent">2. Provisions in the Act that amend the Estate Agents Act 1979 by making provision for redress schemes dealing with complaints about estate agents were brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October 2007</phrase> by the Commencement No. l Order (SI 2007 No. 2934). Once the Office of Fair Trading has approved a redress scheme open to all estate agents, an order requiring estate agents to belong to an approved scheme can be made. Subject to OFT approving a scheme, the Government expects this requirement to be in force with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2008</phrase>. Provisions in the Act that amend the Estate Agents Act 1979 by expanding the grounds for the issue by the OFT of prohibition and warning orders and increasing the investigatory powers of enforcement officers, were included in the Commencement No. 4 Order and will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2008</phrase>. The Government expects to commence the remaining estate agents provisions on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1977W.2/4" class="indent">3. The Government expect to make the new Regulation on &quot;door-step selling&quot; in May and commence the Regulation on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2008</phrase>. The Regulation will extend the protections consumers have when a visit is unsolicited (e.g. right of withdrawal and cooling off period) to sales as result of a solicited visit, and require traders to include the notice of the right to cancel within a written contract.</p>

	<p pid="b.1985W.10/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June 2007</phrase>, I announced two important measures to help improve the safeguarding of vulnerable adults. This followed the publication of the &quot;UK Study of Abuse and Neglect of Older People: Prevalence Survey Report&quot;, by Kings College London and the National Centre for Social Research. The Department contributed &pound;250,000 towards this research, which was jointly commissioned with Comic Relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.1985W.10/3">Plans are now being put in place to introduce a new national monitoring system to report the extent of abuse, so that each individual council can monitor abuse locally and act on it. This will be based on a standardised method for the collection of data on protection of vulnerable adult referrals in England, offering new understanding about the size of the challenge we face and allowing comparisons between councils.</p>
	<p pid="b.1985W.10/4">No Secrets, the existing statutory guidance on safeguarding vulnerable adults, which was issued in 2000, provides for health, social services and the police, to work together to protect vulnerable adults from abuse. Seven years on, and in the light of experience and knowledge gained, we are now working to review this guidance and to consult with the public and other Government Departments that have an interest in this field. We will also consider the case for legislation as part of the review process. A copy of the &quot;No Secrets&quot;, guidance is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1985W.10/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-27">27 March</phrase> this year, I announced the launch of a further major research project, which is also to be co-funded by the Department and Comic Relief. The new study, entitled &quot;Abuse, Neglect and Loss of Dignity in the Institutional Care of Older People, will examine the experience of older people&quot;&mdash;and those caring for them&mdash;in institutional settings, such as care homes and national health service wards, and will focus more broadly on issues of loss of dignity as well as abuse or mistreatment. The tender process for this work will start shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1985W.10/6">Total funding of the new research initiative, which will comprise a series of linked studies over a three year period, will be &pound;2 million.</p>

Reducing Chlamydia prevalence has been identified as a national priority target for local delivery in the national planning guidance for the national health service in the 'NHS Operational Plans 2008-09 to 2010-11', which highlights the Government's continuing commitment to tackling this infection. A copy of the guidance is available in the Library. We will continue to work through performance management routes to support delivery of this target and increase screening volumes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1990W.3/2">Patients are not able to prevent their basic demographic and contact details from being held within the NHS CRS. The NHS has maintained registers of its service users from the earliest days of its existence to support the delivery of health care. A record is also kept of which general practice each patient is registered with, and reasons of efficiency and probity require this to be held centrally, for example to prevent multiple GPs from being paid for the same patient, and to ensure that the correct commissioning body meets the cost of care provided. A register is also needed to enable the Secretary of State to meet the obligation to provide health care, free at the point of contact, for those patients who are ordinarily resident in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.3/3">While for these reasons it is not practicable to give patients choice about whether their demographic details will be held in the system, safeguards have been built into the NHS CRS personal demographics service (PDS) which allow an individual's contact details to be hidden from NHS staff if patients request this level of protection.</p>

The statistical basis for collecting this information changed between the two years and the figures are not directly comparable.

We provided capital funding of &pound;31 million in 2007-08 for 17 projects specifically designed to help eliminate the inappropriate use of adult psychiatric wards for children and young people.</p>

	<p pid="b.1991W.2/1">Safety for the individual service user, their families, staff and the general public is central to all good healthcare. This is particularly important in mental health services. Risk assessment and risk management are central to planning safe and effective care for individuals who may be a risk to themselves or others. Effective discharge planning from inpatient care and rehabilitation in the community rely on appropriate clinical risk assessment and risk management. As an integral part of clinical care this is not something that is costed separately and therefore we do not have the information requested held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1991W.2/2">To help manage people effectively and safely in the community we introduced community treatment orders in the Mental Health Act 2007. While it is not possible to say that they will prevent all episodes of violence, they will usefully be employed in the treatment of individuals with a history of non-compliance in the community, potentially reducing the risks they pose to themselves or others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1991W.2/3">The Department has also recently published Best practice in managing risk: principles and guidance for best practice in the assessment and management of risk to self and others in mental health services. It underpins risk assessment with principles of good practice for all mental health settings and provides a list of tools offering structure to risk management.</p>
	<p pid="b.1991W.2/4">The Department has also published its review of the care programme approach (CPA), including how risk assessment and management is incorporated into CPA systems. CPA is the system of assessment, planning and a review of care for people receiving secondary mental health services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1994W.3/2">In his winter update issued in November 2007, which is sent to all doctors registered with the General Medical Council in England, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) provides a range of advice on diagnosis of CO poisoning, including the use of neurological examination.</p>

CMO's update includes recognition of the symptoms of CO poisoning, key questions to ask in diagnosis, appropriate tests and treatment. The CMO/CNO letter, distributed to community nurses, midwives, health visitors and general practitioners, provides detailed advice for recognising the symptoms of CO poisoning and specific advice about investigations and testing techniques. A copy of the letter has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1994W.3/4">In addition, the Department has recently called for research to investigate the incidence of CO poisoning, health outcomes and patient's experience following exposure, which will help inform the development of appropriate policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1994W.3/5">The Department also provides funding to leading national voluntary organisations through the Section 64 General Scheme of Grants, which helps in their work in raising awareness about the dangers of CO with both the public and health professionals and in supporting victims and providing information on how to prevent poisoning.</p>

	<p pid="b.1995W.5/2">In addition, adjustments are also made to reimbursement prices to take account of the reduction in market prices that usually occurs in the months after the introduction of a generic medicine following patent expiry of an in-patent medicine.</p>

	<p pid="b.1995W.5/4">&pound;500 million of the annual level of funding agreed by the Department and the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee is derived from profits made by pharmacies buying medicines for less than they are reimbursed by the national health service (the retained purchase margin).</p>
	<p pid="b.1995W.5/5">The increase of the Category M cost of reimbursement is attributable to the increased growth in the volume of the cost of NHS generic medicines reimbursed in England since the introduction of the Category M system. However, although the cost of Category M generic medicines prescribed and dispensed has increased (22 per cent.) that growth would have been greater (27 per cent.) if Category M had not been introduced.

	<p pid="b.1996W.5/1">It is difficult to assess the trends in incidence of psychosis or schizophrenia for this age group over the last thirty years due to the relatively small numbers of people suffering from these conditions. This makes any assessment of statistical significance of a change vulnerable to error. Also during this time diagnosis classifications have changed for these conditions, which could mean that comparisons over this period would not be measuring like for like.</p>
	<p pid="b.1996W.5/2">The Department is concerned about the negative impact of cannabis use and intoxication on acute mental health patients and on mental health services, and about the increased evidence for a possible role for cannabis in the causation of longer-term disorders such as schizophrenia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1996W.5/3">The Department advises that cannabis use is harmful for people with existing mental health problems, being linked with relapse and resistance to treatments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1996W.5/4">Research data also indicates that the impact of cannabis is likely to be on those already vulnerable to onset of schizophrenia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1996W.5/5">It is also recognised that cannabis can cause an acute, short lived psychosis, from which the person recovers quickly following cessation of cannabis use but which, in severe cases, may require a short period of inpatient care. We keep the evidence and research in this area under constant review.</p>

	<p pid="b.2000W.2/2">The Primary Care Access Survey data for November 2007 to January 2008 show that the two general practitioner (GP) practices within Westminster Primary Care Trust (PCT) reported as having closed lists have list sizes of 2,942 patients and 3,704 patients. However, the data does not identify the names and locations of the practices. In addition, information about the cost of each practice to the national health service is not collected centrally. The hon. Member may therefore wish to raise these issues with the chief executive of Westminster PCT.</p>
	<p pid="b.2000W.2/3">Under the contractual arrangements for primary medical services, GP practice lists are classed as either 'open' or 'closed'. PCTs will grant a GP practice closed list status only once both parties have made reasonable endeavours to keep the list open and the conclusion is reached that this is not possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.2000W.2/4">The Department is currently exploring, as part of the NHS Next Stage Review being undertaken by the Parliamentary under Secretary of State (the Lord Darzi), whether further action is needed to ensure patients have more choice in the practice with which they register.</p>

A jobseeker can be treated as actively seeking work while away from home, for example on holiday, for up to two weeks in any 12-month period. As they do not need to look for work during this period no proof of job search is required, but they must remain in Great Britain and be available for work during this period in order to continue receiving jobseeker's allowance. However, jobseeker's allowance is terminated when someone goes outside the country for more than a day, unless it is for an interview. There is nothing on the jobseeker's allowance payment system datasets to identify customers on holiday in Great Britain who remain eligible for jobseeker's allowance.</p>

	<p pid="b.2025W.2/1">I am very grateful to the Independent Monitoring Board for the work they do on behalf of Gloucester prison. The report is thorough and generally very positive; highlighting several areas of recognised good practice and acknowledging Gloucester's achievements in gaining level 4 status and receiving the most improved prison award in 2007. I will formally respond to the report shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/2">Gloucester continues to perform well in key areas, despite the physical constraints of Victorian buildings and a town centre location, and I have no reason to suppose that it will not continue to do so. The governor and staff are committed to maintaining and improving upon this performance, providing the best possible opportunities for prisoners to address their offending behaviour in a supportive and safe environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.2026W.5/1">Since October 2006, the Government have used police cells in significant numbers to help manage pressure in the prison population. The Government's policy, however, is that juveniles should only be held overnight in police cells in the most exceptional circumstances. Our records indicate that since October 2006, no juveniles have been held overnight in police cells in Tamworth or in the rest of Staffordshire. Data prior to this cannot be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

This includes: the costs of adapting existing systems that will supply data to ContactPoint and the costs of ensuring that data is accurate; adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners so they can access ContactPoint from them; and the costs of introducing robust arrangements to ensure proper security, and effective ContactPoint user training.</p>

These national data sources include a number of government departments, namely the Department of Work and Pensions, Department of Children, Schools and Families, Department of Health and Office of National Statistics. This is a one way process. No data will be supplied to another system from ContactPoint nor will users be able to access any other systems via ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="b.2029W.0/8">To support the Data Protection Act 1998, there will be mechanisms in place to notify data sources where discrepancies occur between differently sourced fragments. In doing so, the contents of ContactPoint records will not be shared with data sources.</p>

	<p pid="b.2029W.3/1">This Government launched a radical programme of reform in response to Lord Laming's Inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi&eacute;. Through the Children Act 2004 we have put in place a much stronger framework for children's services and particularly for safeguarding children. The Government's detailed response to the recommendations of the Victoria Climbi&eacute; Inquiry Report was set out in &quot;Keeping Children Safe&quot; which was published in 2003, alongside the Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. The actions the Government committed to undertaking in response to Lord Laming's recommendations have been carried out or are ongoing, an exception is the revision of guidance on the Children Act 1989. Volume 1, on Court Orders, has been revised and published, and many of the key messages which &quot;Keeping Children Safe&quot; said were to be incorporated in the revised Children Act 1989 guidance have been incorporated into other guidance documents and standards. We plan to revise further volumes of the 1989 guidance next year, taking into account commitments announced in Care Matters: Time for Change, proposed legislative changes through the Children and Young Person's Bill currently going through Parliament, and proposed revisions to the National Minimum Standards for children's social care.</p>

	<p pid="b.2030W.2/1">Promotional campaigns, including those using advertising, are funded from the Department's central advertising and publicity budget and from individual programme budgets held by policy directorates. The Department employs advertising agencies and public relations agencies for specific communications tasks, most commonly working alongside our press office to provide local and regional campaign support.</p>
	<p pid="b.2030W.2/2">Once all payments have been finalised, the predicted spend from the advertising and publicity budget for 2007-08 is &pound;11.8 million. In addition to funding promotional campaigns, this budget also covers a wide range of other publicity activity (including magazine production and infrastructure costs such as mailing and storage of departmental publications).</p>
	<p pid="b.2030W.2/3">The spend on promotional campaigns from individual policy directorate programmes cannot be separately identified, except at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.2030W.2/4">However, it is possible to separate all the Department's spend on advertising and publicity, as this is centrally placed through the Central Office of Information. For 2007-08, the Department spent &pound;1,567,144 on PR and &pound;5,160,218 on advertising.</p>

	<p pid="b.2035W.6/1">Keeping children and young people safe is a top priority for this Government and the Department. We have introduced new legislation, new guidance and new structures to make children safer.</p>
	<p pid="b.2035W.6/2">The Children Act 2004 put in place a much stronger framework for children's services and for safeguarding children in particular. This Act gave a range of statutory agencies a legal duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Statutory guidance, &quot;Making arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children under section 11 of the Children Act 2004&quot;, issued in July 2005 and updated in March 2007, is aimed at the police, hospitals, prisons and others covered by the requirement and sets out what they should do to make sure children are safe. The guidance makes clear for example that police need to identify vulnerable children in domestic violence cases, and that housing authorities need to consider the safety of children when they are offering help in domestic violence cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.2035W.6/3">&quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot;, published in April 2006, is the Government's main interagency guide to safeguarding. This explains what is meant by forced marriage, makes clear that it comes under the definition of domestic violence, and stresses the need for professionals to be aware of the strong links between domestic violence and child protection concerns and to take appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid="b.2035W.6/4">This Government have also created statutory local safeguarding children boards (LSCBs) to co-ordinate what local bodies do to safeguard children and to ensure that they are working effectively together. We have also required local authorities to have lead members and directors who are clearly accountable for their children's services.</p>
	<p pid="b.2035W.6/5">The cross-Government &quot;Staying Safe: Action Plan&quot;, published in February 2008, sets out specific commitments to help tackle forced marriage and domestic violence. The Action Plan is underpinned by the new public service agreement to improve children and young people's safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.2035W.6/6">Working with the forced marriage unit, we will develop materials on the issue of forced marriage specifically for use by schools and tailored to young people and we will actively encourage schools to use them. DCSF Ministers will shortly be writing to all schools and local authorities reminding them of their responsibilities and of the existing guidance&mdash;both general safeguarding children guidance and the specific forced marriage guidance for education professionals, issued jointly with the forced marriage unit. We will also set out our plans to consult on revised forced marriage guidance which will then be placed on a statutory footing this autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.2036W.2/1">Expenditure on safeguarding children from domestic violence and forced marriage is met principally by local authorities from general funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.2036W.2/2">The then Department for Education and Skills took over certain policy responsibilities from the Department of Health in 2003 and with this came responsibility for grants to the Women's Aid Federation of England (WAFE) which related to domestic violence. Under the section 64 grant scheme WAFE received &pound;300,000 between 2003-04 and 2006-07, plus WAFE received &pound;49,000 per year between 2003-04 and 2007-08 as a contribution to the National Domestic Violence Helpline service.</p>
	<p pid="b.2036W.2/3">In addition, the Department currently provides funding under the Children, Young People and Families (CYPF) grant scheme to two domestic violence related projects. 'Daybreak Family Group Conferences' are funded for a project that aims to address the impact of domestic violence on the safety and welfare of children and their chances of achieving their full potential. The funding amounts to &pound;283,000 over three years (2006-07 to 2008-09). WAFE currently receives funding to develop and raise the profile of support for women and children as victims of domestic violence. CYPF grant funding for WAFE is &pound;120,000 over two years (2007-08 to 2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="b.2036W.2/4">The Department is also committed to continued close working with the joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office/Home Office Forced Marriage Unit to revise the forced marriage guidance issued in 2005 and place this on a statutory footing. We are also working with the Forced Marriage Unit to develop materials on the issue of forced marriage specifically for use by schools and tailored to young people.</p>

	<p pid="b.2039W.3/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families does not collect data on epilepsy in schools and has no plans to make the collection of data regarding the number of children with epilepsy in schools mandatory at local authority level. It has also made no assessment of the impact of epilepsy on a child's learning or the need for statutory training requirements for those working with children who have epilepsy.</p>
	<p pid="b.2039W.3/2">Schools and their employers have responsibilities towards the health and safety of all staff and pupils, and this may include making arrangements for individual pupils with medical needs, where it is reasonable to do so. There is, however, no legal duty on school staff to manage a pupil's medicine or support a child's medical need. However, our guidance 'Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings' issued by this Department jointly with the Department of Health, encourages schools and local authorities to develop local policies on the management of pupil's medicines and on supporting pupils with medical needs, taking account of local resources and their various responsibilities. It specifically addresses what schools can do to help children with epilepsy and other medical conditions. We also produced sister guidance entitled 'Including me: managing complex health needs in schools and early years settings,' both were published in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.2039W.3/3">An individual health care plan can help staff identify the necessary safety measures to support children with medical needs and may reveal the need for staff to have further information about a medical condition or specific training. The employer should arrange appropriate training in collaboration with local health services.</p>

	<p pid="b.2040W.2/1">Children have special educational needs (SEN) if they have a learning difficulty which calls for special educational provision to be made for them. Epilepsy is a medical condition which may be a cause of, or exist alongside, a learning difficulty necessitating special educational provision. In these cases, we would expect schools and local authorities to identify the need and make appropriate provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.2040W.2/2">The Department does not collect information on the number of pupils with SEN who also have epilepsy.</p>

	<p pid="b.2040W.5/1">The Department has supported Sporting Playgrounds, a primary playground development scheme, since 2001. The scheme refurbishes existing primary school playgrounds to enhance opportunities for sporting activity. Over 600 primary school playgrounds have been developed since the programme began. Funding has been in four phases, as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.2040W.5/4"> <td></td> <td><i> Funding (&pound;)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.2040W.5/5"> <td>2001 to 2004</td> <td>310,000</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.2040W.5/11">There are no plans to fund the Sporting Playgrounds programme over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.2040W.5/12">As part of the biggest ever investment in play, &pound;225 million has been made available through the Children's plan to build and improve public play areas nationally over the next three years. Investment in school playgrounds is also part of schools capital funding, where &pound;21.9 billion has been allocated over the next three years, including to the Building Schools for the Future and Primary Capital programmes. Further, almost &pound;1 billion a year goes to schools directly for them to use for their own priorities, including their grounds and playgrounds.</p>
