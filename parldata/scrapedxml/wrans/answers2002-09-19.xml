	<p pid=".4W.9/2">Incitement to commit a particular offence, for example of child abuse or of a child pornography offence, whether on a website or otherwise, can be dealt with under existing law. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) provides a focal point for reporting material which appears to be illegal. They assess the material and refer any they agree appears illegal to the police for investigation and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) hosting the material, in order that the ISP can close off access to the offending material. Where the material is produced or hosted outside the United Kingdom, arrangements exist for notifying the relevant law enforcement agency and ISP.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.9/3">The IWF has also recently developed a policy on recommending ISPs to take down newsgroups that regularly contain, or whose names seem to advertise child pornography. We welcome this development and we will continue to monitor the position.</p>

	<p pid=".5W.2/2">The Youth Justice Board's (YJB) funding is for Youth Offending Teams (Yots) not individual offenders. The payments for general, referral order and drugs work in 2002&ndash;03 took into account levels of deprivation (covering employment, income, average of ward scores, ward ranks, extent of deprivation and the local concentration of deprivation) the size of the 10&ndash;17 population within each Yot area and its geographical size. The deprivation indices were supplied by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and are used as standard across Government. The formula was approved by the Home Office and the National Assembly for Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".5W.2/3">A copy of the Youth Justice Board's outcome decision document has been placed in the Library. The annexes show the size of the 10&ndash;17 population and the individual grants allocations. The YJB's data covers convictions not offences.</p>

	<p pid=".19W.5/1">Research carried out by the Home Department about the correlation between crime against retailers and street crime offences has been based on interviews with 1,884 prisoners in custody, carried out in February and March 2000. The full results of this survey are expected to be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".19W.5/2">In a study carried out in London, Liverpool, Nottingham and Sunderland in 1998&ndash;99, 64 per cent. of those arrested for theft from shops tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and 41 per cent. tested positive for cocaine. When interviewed, 85 per cent. of those arrested for shop theft reported using heroin or cocaine in the previous year.</p>
	<p pid=".19W.5/3">In a study carried out on behalf of the Drug Prevention Advisory Service between October 2000 and March 2001, 23 per cent. of the 19,190 arrestees who sought advice on drug or alcohol addiction had been arrested for shop theft. Similarly, 38 per cent. of those who sought advice admitted shop theft to be a main source of income, whilst 48 per cent. admitted shop theft in the previous 30 days.</p>

The HSE published &quot;Work-related violence: managing the risk in smaller businesses&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-09">9 July 2002</phrase>. The publication includes 10 case studies on reducing risk of violence to staff. The HSE has also published specific guidance for the retail sector &quot;Preventing Violence to Retail Staff&quot;. &quot;Don't Discount Crime&quot;, a new user-friendly crime reduction guide for retailers became available in May 2002. This is being circulated among their members by retail trade organisations (including the British Retail Consortium), who were actively involved in deciding its content and design. It is of particular relevance to small retailers and includes basic guidance on what steps to take to reduce crime as well as what to do in crime situations.</p>

	<p pid=".20W.5/1">No study has been undertaken to look specifically at the link between alcohol and drug related violent crime against retail staff. However, we are aware from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) ninth annual survey published this year of their concerns about the level of crime affecting retailers and the concerns they have that this is being driven by theft by drug and alcohol abusers. We are carrying out a commercial crime victimisation study of retail and manufacturing sectors later this year (the first for ten years). This will give a firm basis for identifying the main crime problems affecting business and give valuable indicators of the best ways to tackle these issues.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.3/13">Numbers of detections rose across England and Wales by 2 per cent. in 2001&ndash;02. There were rises in numbers of detections in all crime types except for fraud and forgery&mdash;for example, numbers of detections for: burglary rose by 6 per cent.; robbery by 19 per cent. and violent crime by 3 per cent. Once the increase in numbers of crimes due to changes in police recording are taken into account, the detection rate in England and Wales appears stable. Detection rates in 11 forces improved, while a further eight forces showed no change in their detection rates.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.9/1">It is for the Secretary of State to determine the pay of police officers of all ranks in England and Wales. In doing so, he is required to take into account any recommendation made by the Police Negotiating Board (PNB), the statutory negotiating body, on which all the main police organisations are represented, including the Police Federation, which represents the interests of chief inspectors.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.9/2">There is a national salary scale for chief inspectors. Currently, there are five points on the chief inspectors' scale, ranging from &pound;39,153 to &pound;42,309 outside London, and from &pound;40,761 to &pound;43,911 in London. Where individual chief inspectors are placed on that scale depends on a number of factors, including when they attained the rank of chief inspector, the length of time they have spent as chief inspectors and the length of time they spent in the rank of inspector.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.9/3">Under a PNB Agreement reached on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-09">9 May</phrase>, and approved by the Secretary of State, changes to the pay scale of chief inspectors will be implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>. With effect from that date, there will be only three salary points for chief inspectors, one for chief inspectors who were in post on <phrase class="date" code="1994-08-31">31 August 1994</phrase>, and two for all other chief inspectors. Chief inspectors who were in post on <phrase class="date" code="1994-08-31">31 August 1994</phrase> will receive &pound;42,711 outside London and &pound;44,313 in London. All other chief inspectors will start on &pound;40,362 (&pound;41,973 in London), the first point of the scale, and then progress to &pound;41,973 (&pound;42,780 in London). Once they have completed a year at the top of their scale, chief inspectors will be eligible for the new competence-related payment of &pound;1,002 a year.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.9/4">Chief inspectors perform a range of duties and responsibilities, and while many of the activities are common, there will be different responsibilities for operational and detective officers. All officers in the rank of chief inspector are required to exhibit leadership and management qualities and to take on responsibility for community safety and local crime initiatives, which includes developing local crime and disorder strategies. Operations chief inspectors would be responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring local crime and disorder plans, for formulating contingency plans for major incidents, and for managing public order and major incidents. Detective Chief Inspectors would primarily be responsible for managing and advising on criminal investigations.</p>

	<p pid=".28W.0/1">All deaths in police custody are subject to a full police investigation. Where such a death occurs the police are required to refer the investigation to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) for supervision. It is the responsibility of the PCA supervising member to approve the appointment of the Senior Investigating Officer (SIO), either from the force where the death occurred or from another force, and to agree the terms of reference for the SIO covering the parameters of the investigation. The PCA recently published their supervision manual which sets out the Authority's approach to supervision and the standards its supervising members will apply.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.0/2">Under the Police Reform Bill the PCA will be replaced by a completely new body called the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The IPCC will be at the heart of a new police complaints system, the key objective of which will be to increase public confidence and trust in the way in which complaints against the police are dealt with. In order to achieve this the IPCC, which will be wholly independent of the police and which will have its own investigating teams, will be able to choose to investigate complaints itself. There will also be improved access to the complaints system for complainants, and significantly greater disclosure of information to complainants.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.0/3">Information about the number of deaths that resulted in compensation being paid to the next of kin of the victims is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".28W.3/1">Approximately 400 hectares of opium poppies are being grown in the United Kingdom, mostly in Hampshire, to provide some of the raw material required for the manufacture of medicines such as codeine and morphine. The amount represents but a small proportion of the total required, which is sourced mainly in Australia, India, Spain and Turkey.</p>

	<p pid=".28W.3/3">Cultivation of the opium poppy is not subject to the licensing requirements of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 but details are furnished to the International Narcotics Control Board under the estimating and statistical provisions of the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. The process is being monitored by the Home Office Drugs Branch which has arranged for police to be informed of the growing sites.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.3/1">The National Refugee Integration Forum, which consists of representatives from Government departments, local authorities, the voluntary sector and refugees themselves, oversees the development of the overall integration strategy for refugees across the United Kingdom (UK). Access to employment is a key to enabling refugees to achieve their full potential in the UK. The Forum has established an Employment sub group to look specifically at the barriers to work that refugees face, and how these barriers can be removed.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.3/2">Amongst measures examined so far are the provision of appropriate English language training, provision of information about the UK labour market, and raising awareness amongst potential employers of the skills and qualifications that refugees bring with them to the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.3/3">The National Forum has also assisted in the establishment of a Scottish Refugee Integration Forum, chaired by the Minister of Social Justice Margaret Curran MSP, to look at the issues facing those refugees who have settled in Scotland. Mirroring the National Forum, the Scottish Forum has also established a satellite group to consider the barriers to employment from a Scottish perspective.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.3/4">The Home Office also funds a number of refugee integration initiatives in Scotland through the Refugee Integration Challenge Fund and the European Refugee Fund. These are:</p>

	<p pid=".36W.2/1">There is no single system for issuing passports to people who are British citizens under the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. Those who are resident in the United Kingdom may apply to the usual Passport Office for their region. Those resident in territories where British passport issuing facilities are available locally or through a convenient British diplomatic post may apply in the territory. As a temporary measure until alternative arrangements are in place, applications in other territories are being sent to the Liverpool passport office for processing. Figures are available only for those applications dealt with at Liverpool and are given in the table. Applications from UK residents are being dealt with at the same speed as other first applications: 2 weeks for the standard service, 1 week for the fast track service at United Kingdom Passport Service counters. The total turnaround times for applications from overseas territories dealt with in Liverpool depend mainly on transport links between the territory and the UK; the Liverpool office handles the application within the 2 week standard service.</p>

Also, the Passport Service is not always informed when such passports come to light.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.5/2">It was announced in February last year that Standard and Enhanced Disclosures would be issued free by the Criminal Records Bureau in the case of volunteers.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.5/3">Estimates by a number of organisations as to the level of costs charged by countersigning bodies&mdash;whether by an organisation&mdash;acting on its own behalf or an umbrella body countersigning applications at the request of others&mdash;have varied very considerably, depending upon a range of factors including the size of the organisation and the number of applications to be processed. In guidance for umbrella bodies, the Bureau has urged that any charges made for providing the service should be kept to a minimum. Organisations wishing to use an umbrella body are advised to enquire about, and to compare, any such charges.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.5/4">We have been determined that all those wishing to access the Criminal Records Bureau's (CRB's) service should have ready means of access. Up to <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-16">16 July</phrase>, a total of 917 umbrella bodies had been registered by the Criminal Records Bureau. Of those, 442 have agreed to act as &quot;open&quot; umbrella bodies to provide this service for bodies outside their own circle or sector), of which 65 are voluntary bodies. Voluntary organisations needing to find an umbrella body should access the CRB's website <a href="http://www.disclosure.gov.uk">www.disclosure.gov.uk</a> which has an umbrella body search facility, or contact the CRB direct on 0870 90 90 811. Organisations are continuing to apply for registration, and the number of umbrella bodies will increase. We are actively exploring means of developing the network further.</p>

An exploratory meeting to focus on this issue took place on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-24">Wednesday 24 July</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.5/1">The police and Jewish bodies continue to work closely to safeguard Jewish people and property. The Government are in close touch with the Community Security Trust of the British Board of Deputies, which provides up-to-date details of anti-Semitic activity in the United Kingdom, such as assaults and criminal damage. Home Office officials have also met leading representatives of the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) in order to discuss the recent increase in anti-Semitic activity within University campuses.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.5/2">The Government are fully committed to tackling anti-Semitism and racism generally wherever it occurs. Under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 it is an offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent or likelihood to stir up racial hatred. The offence covers inflammatory comments made in public or in the media as well as the distribution of printed material. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 increased the maximum penalty for incitement to racial hatred from two to seven years' imprisonment. Additionally, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced nine new racially aggravated offences, including assault and criminal damage, for which the maximum penalties available to the courts are substantially increased if it can be shown that there was evidence of racial hostility to the offences.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.5/3">The investigation of possible breaches of these laws is an operational matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. We would therefore urge anyone who believes these laws to have been breached to report the matter to the police.</p>

Staff Christmas parties in 2001 funded by staff themselves have not been included in this answer. We have identified a small number of events, held in December 2001, to recognise the contribution of staff and extend hospitality to non-civil servants who contributed to the delivery of the Department's objectives during the course of the year, which were part funded by the Department and its operational agencies. The total cost of these was &pound;7,645 attended by 1163 people.

	<p pid=".48W.2/1">The table gives figures for rates of violent crime from the British Crime Survey (BCS), for the English regions and Wales based on BCS interviews in the financial year 2001&ndash;02.

	<p pid=".48W.2/2">The BCS violence estimate for the number of violent incidents increased by two per cent. compared to 2000, but this is not statistically significant. Comparison of results reported to the BCS in 2001&ndash;02 with those for earlier years show a 17 per cent. decline in BCS violence since 1999, a 22 per cent. decline since 1997 and a 33 per cent. decline since 1995, all of these decreases being statistically significant.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.2/4">The BCS and police recorded crime figures for violence are not directly comparable. Numbers of police recorded violent crimes per 10,000 population relate to all the recordable offences in the violence against the person, sexual offences and robbery offence groups. There is also a less than complete correlation between the recorded crime and BCS figures owing to the different methods of collection, methodology and coverage (for example, the BCS only relates to victims over the age of 16, and residents), with different rates of reporting of crimes to the police also being a factor.</p>

	<p pid=".50W.2/1">Police practice on recorded crime statistics has for many years been governed by Home Office Counting Rules. These rules have covered the counting and classification of crimes for statistical purposes, although the policy on whether to record crimes that have been reported has in the past varied from force to force.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.2/2">The Home Office Counting Rules for Recorded Crime were last revised with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, principally to take account of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard which was produced by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in consultation with the Home Office. The Standard aims to promote greater consistency between police forces in recording reports of crime and to take a more victim orientated approach to crime recording.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.2/3">The latest change to the Rules is anticipated to impact mainly on the violence against the person, theft and handling and criminal damage offence groups, although all offence groups are potentially affected and the impact of the changes will vary between the different police forces.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.2/4">The recorded crime statistics cover all indictable and triable-either-way offences, together with a few summary offences closely related to more serious ones.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.2/5">A copy of the Home Office Counting Rules is available on the website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/counting/index.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/ counting/index.html</a>.</p>

The new staff are initially dealing with grants (which are easier to process) until they receive further training in September. It is expected that the output of the established staff will continue to increase with experience, and that the new staff will quickly come up to speed. Processes have been streamlined, best practice shared, and a pragmatic and sympathetic approach is being taken to any compassionate factors encountered. Processes and resources will be kept under constant review, and caseworkers are encouraged to make any suggestions for improvements in working practices that might further speed up decision making.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.5/2">All countries which are signatories of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees recognise the travel document issued to refugees under Article 28 of the Convention. We are not aware of any particular difficulties encountered by refugees resident in the United Kingdom when using this travel document.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.5/3">The Certificate of Identity (CID) is a travel document issued to foreign nationals who are resident here but unable to obtain a passport from their national authorities. It is issued on a discretionary basis, not under an international convention. Non-recognition of the document by a number of European Union Member States who are members of the Schengen Group, notably France, Germany, Greece and Spain, means that CID holders who want to travel abroad for short visits, or other temporary purposes, are often unable to do so. It is a matter for individual countries whether the CID is recognised as a travel document.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.5/4">The issue has been discussed regularly at meetings of consular representatives from the London Embassies of the Schengen Member States. At these meetings, and also in separate informal discussions, Home Office officials have given extensive assurances about matters relating to the CID, including particularly the re-admissibility to the UK of people who use the document to travel abroad.</p>

	<p pid=".53W.5/1">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires the responsible authorities&mdash;police and local authorities&mdash;for each area jointly to conduct an audit of all crime and disorder and in the light of that and following local consultation, to formulate and implement a crime and disorder reduction strategy. In so doing, they must involve other local agencies, and the local community. The Act also requires the responsible authorities to keep the strategy under review to monitor its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".53W.5/2">The Buckingham constituency falls within the Aylesbury Vale Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). The Partnership has conducted an audit of crime and disorder in their area to inform their strategy for crime and disorder reduction for Aylesbury Vale for the period April 2002 to April 2005. This strategy was published in April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".53W.5/3">Latest recorded crime figures published in July 2002 for the 12-month period to March 2002 are set out in the table, along with comparisons for the previous two years. British Crime Survey (BCS) figures are not available at CDRP or Basic Command Unit (BCU) level, but figures for 2001&ndash;02 do show significant national reductions in the key categories of crime over the two years since the last BCS with a large enough sample size to demonstrate trends (1999): burglary fell by 23 per cent.; vehicle thefts fell by 14 per cent.; common assaults fell by 28 per cent.; vandalism fell by six per cent.; and overall crime fell by 14 per cent. The BCS also demonstrates that the chances of being a victim of crime remain stable at their lowest level for nearly twenty years. In the South East region, the BCS shows that burglary and vehicle crime levels are well below the national average, although the same cannot be said for violent crime.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.2/1">There are a number of processes already in place to ensure all relevant agencies learn from cases where domestic violence culminates in murder, and measures are currently underway to try and minimise the likelihood of such a tragic event.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/2">In the event of a victim of domestic violence being murdered by her abuser, where the local police had prior contact or knowledge of the abuse, an internal police review should routinely be undertaken to consider the force's processes and identify failings. Such a review will report to the Chief Officer and will contain recommendations as to what processes are required to ensure that such a crime is not allowed to happen.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/3">Tragically, children can also be the victims of murder following domestic violence. Chapter 8 of the Government's &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; child protection guidance details the process by which Area Child Protection Committees can institute a serious case review into cases where a child dies and abuse or neglect are known or suspected to be a factor in the death. During such reviews, the agencies involved&mdash;the Police, Social Services, Education and Health Services&mdash;prepare reports of their involvement with the case. The final report then considers whether there are any lessons to be learned from the tragedy about the ways in which agencies work together to safeguard children, and the involvement between the family and relevant professionals.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/4">The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) are also currently piloting domestic violence murder reviews in cases that do not necessarily involve children, based on the same model as that just set out. Such reviews involve the key agencies and ensure an appropriate forum exists to take forward any recommendations that may prevent further homicides. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) is awaiting the results of the MPS pilots before requiring all forces to follow similar procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/5">Further, the Solicitor General has asked the Crown Prosecution Service to carry out multi-agency domestic violence murder reviews in a number of recent cases. These reviews, and those conducted by the MPS seek to predict the risk factors where domestic violence is occurring and improve risk management.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.8/2">Crime overall has fallen in recent years and the chances of becoming a victim of crime are at their lowest for 20 years. However, by contrast street crime&mdash;i.e. robberies, snatch thefts&mdash;has shown a sharp increase, particularly over the last year.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/3">Tackling street crime is now a top priority for the government, which announced a programme of action on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-17">17 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/4">The government recognises that street crime has social and economic causes that cannot be tackled by the police and criminal justice agencies alone. That is why this strategy brings together all agencies, all departments, and all systems that impact on young people at risk from crime, at risk of offending, and offenders themselves and to work together to more effectively tackle street crime.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/5">The work aims to reverse the upward trend before looking to bring about sustainable reductions in the long-term.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/6">This means tackling persistent offenders, speeding up the criminal justice system and giving a better service for victims and witnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/7">We need to tackle the roots of the problem by getting to children before they become involved in crime. This means tackling truancy, young people excluded from school should not be left to roam the streets. And from September we are providing for all permanently excluded pupils to have access to full-time education. We are also supporting the placement of up to 100 police officers in schools most affected by crime.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/8">We are also providing constructive activities to keep children out of trouble during school holidays with an additional &pound;12 million for Summer Splash schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/9">It is also part of our strategy on drugs to break the link between drugs and crime.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/10">Finally, we are supporting the work of the mobile phone industry to put stolen phones&mdash;a key factor in the rise in street crime&mdash;out of use by legislating to ban the re-programming of mobile phones.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.5/1">The Home Office does not centrally collect or collate statistics on the number of mobile phone thefts and individual police forces do not routinely collect such figures either, although some do for their own purposes. We cannot therefore estimate the proportion of street robberies that involved mobile phone theft in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/2">However, a Home Office Report on &quot;Mobile Phone Theft&quot; published in January 2002 estimated that in 2000&ndash;01 mobile phones were stolen in 28 per cent. of all robberies.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/3">The Government has made significant progress in working with the mobile phone industry and the police to tackle mobile phone theft. From the end of September, network operators will be able to bar stolen handsets across all networks by reference to the unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. To complement this measure, the Government has passed the Mobile Telephones (Re-programming) Bill which creates new criminal offences of unauthorised re-programming of the IMEI number and possessing, supplying or offering to supply equipment for that purpose. We are continuing to press the industry to put in place a long-term strategy to enhance the security of 3G devices.</p>

	<p pid=".59W.0/2">The most recently published recorded crime figures show that in the 12 months to March 2002, overall crime levels in Avon and Somerset rose by 20 per cent. Although drug offences fell by 7 per cent. during this period, Avon and Somerset saw rises in the other major categories of crime. The most significant increase was a 77 per cent. rise in robbery. This is why the Government launched the Street Crime Initiative in April of this year, which covers the 10 Police Force areas with the worst robbery problem&mdash;including Avon and Somerset. The initiative builds new measures on top of plans which were already in progress to ensure co-ordinated action across all parts of Government to bring street robbers to swift and effective justice.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.0/3">The National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), which was introduced in Avon and Somerset and several other forces in April 2001, and in all forces in April 2002, has contributed to changing levels of recorded crime. Across England and Wales, the NCRS, along with other changes to police recording practices, has had the effect of increasing recorded crime statistics by at least five per cent. this year, which suggest that crime levels have only increased by two per cent. In Avon and Somerset it has caused an uplift of 10 per cent. It is expected to have an even more marked effect on next year's crime statistics (an estimated uplift of 15&ndash;20 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".59W.0/4">The new standard aims to promote greater consistency between police forces in the recording of crime. Every police force must record all incidents, whether reported by victims, witnesses or third parties, and whether crime-related or not. This will result in the registration of an incident report by the police. Following the initial registration, an incident will be recorded as a crime (notifiable offence) if the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law, and if there is no credible evidence to the contrary. As a result, incidents which previously may not have been recorded, are being included in subsequent crime statistics. The effect has been most marked nationally in relation to violence against the person where a five per cent. fall has been turned into an eight per cent. rise by the effects of greater levels of recording by the police.</p>

	<p pid=".59W.3/2">Brislington schools have been given approximately &pound;89,000 for a schools' initiative. This will tackle issues through running &quot;Coping with Teenagers&quot; training for parents, a peer mentoring programme, 10 week Consequences of Crime course for those &quot;at risk&quot;, a Lessons Withdrawal programme for those who would have been excluded and installing a new non-attendance computer system.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.3/3">Further funding has been granted for various Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) initiatives. The Kingsdown Estate has received over &pound;257,000 for a partnership between the council, police and local residents to target an urban residential area with three tower blocks by providing additional 26 cameras to an existing system. The objectives of this scheme are to reduce fear of crime, improve personal and building security, reduce graffiti, vandalism, criminal damage and vehicle crime and improve communication and response of police patrols in the area. Further CCTV schemes have been set up in Symes, St. Paul's and St. Jude's. These form part of an integrated package to reduce drug-trading, fear of crime and prostitution.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.3/4">Several schemes have been set up under the Reducing Burglary Initiative in Knowle Estate, Hartcliffe (North and South), St. Agnes, Cromwell and Upper Easton. These involve providing additional window locks, &quot;Dawn to Dusk&quot; lighting, improved fencing and promotion of Neighbourhood Watch schemes. A significant amount of resources will placed into target hardening and measures are to be adopted to reduce repeat victimisation, improve offender detection, raise public awareness of crime prevention issues and provide research, rehabilitation and diversion of offenders. There will be interagency working including the police, Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships and Age Concern. Follow up schemes are planned to gather feedback from local agencies and offenders. Offenders will also be referred to drug rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.3/5">The City of Bristol will receive a minimum of &pound;1.6 million over the next two years for a Communities Against Drugs programme. The funding is delivered through a plan agreed between the Drug Action Team, the Crime and Disorder Partnership and Local Authority. The intentions of this scheme are to disrupt drugs markets; tackle drug related crime and strengthen communities to resist drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.3/6">Bristol is now operating an Intensive Surveillance and Supervision Programme (ISSP). ISSP is the most rigorous, non-custodial intervention available for young offenders to tackle their offending behaviour. There are 41 schemes operating nationally targeting 2,500 of the most prolific young offenders a year at an annual cost of &pound;15 million. When fully operational it will have the capacity to deal with 25 young offenders at any one time&mdash;50 in a year. Currently there are three people on the scheme. The programmes are managed and funded by the Youth Justice Board and the Bristol scheme has been awarded a grant of over &pound;895,000.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.3/7">Information on the Home Office and its policies is also published on its website (<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>). The Annual Report for 2001&ndash;02 has now been published and can also be found under the same website.</p>

The creation of one programme should streamline the current administration process and therefore reduce costs. It will also allow the European Commission and Member States to have a broad overview of all the projects which are submitted for funding in the field of criminal law and crime prevention and consequently take a more strategic approach in selecting which projects to assist.</p>

	<p pid=".63W.2/1">My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, made a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-03">3 July</phrase>, announcing the publication of a consultation paper on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud. The consultation period will last until <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-10">10 January 2002</phrase>. The Government has made it clear that the introduction of an entitlement card would be a major step and that it would not proceed without consulting widely and considering all the views expressed very carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/2">One of the purposes of the consultation exercise is to identify potential partners. Views are welcomed in the consultation paper from organisations providing services in the public and private sectors on whether they would like to link services to a card scheme and what features they would want to see in a scheme that would most benefit their services. The consultation paper also discusses sharing revenue generated by potential partners' use of a card scheme to cover some of the costs of setting up and administrating a card scheme. If such an arrangement could be agreed, this would reduce the fees charged for entitlement cards.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/3">There are no plans to hold medical records on entitlement cards. The consultation paper discusses holding, at the cardholder's consent, a limited amount of medical information that could be used in an emergency, for example, current medical information on allergies.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/4">There are no plans for the issuing authority for any entitlement card to make checks with the banking sector.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/5">The set up and issuing costs for a universal scheme outlined in the consultation paper are based on the costs of building on the driving licence and passport systems extrapolated to cover all of the resident population. There is no separate estimate for a voluntary scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/6">It is not possible to estimate how many people would apply for an entitlement card as opposed to an entitlement card issued in the form of a photocard driving licence or a passport card. On the assumption that those who do not hold driving licences and passports at present all opt for an entitlement card and that these cards would be lost or stolen at the same rate as driving licences were in 2000&ndash;01 (which is the latest date for which complete figures are available), it is estimated that 424,000 cards would be reported as lost or stolen each year once a scheme was fully implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/7">A list of those organisations to which copies of the consultation paper have been or are in the process of being sent has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/8">The Government has invited views from all of these organisations. We intend to contact other appropriate organisations as they are suggested to us.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/9">The consultation paper requests views on what information should be held in any central register which might be used to administer a card scheme and what information should be displayed or stored on the card itself.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/10">The proposed central register and entitlement card/driving licence would hold core personal information necessary to administer an effective scheme. The information to be held on the card and in the register would include the holder's name; date and place of birth; residential address; validity dates of card(s) and issuing authority; digitised image of signature; photograph; National Insurance number; driver number; a unique personal number; nationality; sex; employment status; and possibly biometric information.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/11">The central register would also include cross references to other personal identifiers used in schemes linked to the entitlement card such as passport number and driver number. It might also include any secret password, pass phrase or PIN used to help authenticate transactions if it was decided to incorporate such a facility in a card scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/12">The consultation paper invites views on what specific measures should be included in any entitlement card scheme to ensure compatibility with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/13">The consultation paper goes into detail about how a scheme would comply with all eight principles. Paragraphs 6.15 and 6.16 of the consultation paper discuss compliance with the Sixth and Seventh Principles of the Data Protection Act. The Sixth Principle stipulates that personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under the Act. The Seventh Principle stipulates that appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/14">The procedures adopted for any entitlement card scheme would build on the experience and expertise of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the UK Passport Service, both of which have a great deal of experience in administering large databases of personal information, including where they are administered by a third party under contract. Both are well placed to develop detailed procedures to comply with the requirements of the Seventh Principle should the Government decide to implement a scheme in this way.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/15">Paragraph 2.9 of the consultation paper assesses the disadvantages of a non-compulsory, non-universal entitlement card scheme. Such a voluntary scheme could not guarantee complete coverage of the population, service providers would need to support different ways of checking the entitlement of the people they served. Benefits for a scheme would therefore be lower than for a scheme where everyone was required to have a card. Those people most likely to benefit from a simple, straightforward means of asserting their rights and entitlements may well be amongst the least likely to apply for a voluntary one. Unless all of society were to hold one, the protections a card scheme could afford to the broader community would be reduced or eliminated.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/16">The costs of a full cost- benefit analysis of an entitlement card scheme, and of a proper risk assessment of the challenges of the procurement and roll-out cannot be determined until a decision is taken on what type of scheme, if any, the Government intend to proceed with. This will not be decided until the views received during the consultation exercise have been carefully analysed.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/17">There are no firm plans to use fingerprints in an entitlement card scheme. The consultation paper discusses the inclusion of biometric information as part of a scheme and fingerprinting is one of the options. In its discussion of the possible use of fingerprints, the paper explains that it would not be necessary to record fingerprints to the same standard used by the police. For example, there would not be a need to identify people using partial fingerprint records such as those retrieved from crime scenes.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/18">Paragraph 3.29 of the consultation document discusses whether the police should have access to any biometric information, such as fingerprints, held on the entitlement card database. Most offenders are already known to the police, who have their own biometric databases of fingerprints and DNA which are more sophisticated than anything envisaged for an entitlement card scheme. It may also cause public unease and a lack of confidence in an entitlement card scheme if the police were to have routine access. However, there may be cases in very closely prescribed circumstances, such as in matters of national security, or the prevention or detection of very serious crimes, where the police might have access to the information. Specific views on this issue are sought in the consultation paper, point 15 (iii).</p>

	<p pid=".67W.2/1">In the last six months, calls answered by the Immigration and Nationality Enquiry Bureau have increased by a third resulting in an average in excess of 21,000 calls a week. This has been attributed to the introduction of new staff (brought in via a regular recruitment programme) and to the new computerised telephone system, which is helping to manage the queues more effectively by giving the answers to commonly asked questions whilst callers are queuing.</p>

	<p pid=".69W.2/1">The Government is determined to tackle child pornography whether on or off line and the criminal law applies equally to both.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.2/2">In January 2001 we raised the maximum penalties for taking, making, distributing or showing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children to 10 years imprisonment (from three years), and the maximum penalty for simple possession of such material to five years (from six months). Also in 2001 we made the importation of indecent or obscene material a serious arrestable offence to allow Customs and Excise officers and the police greater powers in investigating child pornography offences.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.2/3">In response to concerns about the availability of child pornography on the Internet, a hotline for reporting this and other potentially illegal material was established by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) an industry funded organisation, in December 1996. Since its inception over 40,000 items of child pornography have been removed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in response to the notice and take down procedure. The IWF also sends details to the police, or, since the majority of child pornography originates outside the United Kingdom, to the enforcement agency of the country concerned, via the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). In February 2002, the IWF extended its policy, recommending to ISPs that they do not carry newsgroups which have been identified as regularly hosting child pornography or those with names that appear to advertise child pornography.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.2/4">In November 2000, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, announced a &pound;25 million investment in the police over three years specifically to fight hi-tech crime and to enhance the capability of the police at a national and local level to investigate computer related offences, including the possession and distribution of illegal pornography. This included the setting up last year of a National High Tech Crime Unit within the National Crime Squad as a centre of excellence, which has already mounted a number of investigations in this area, as well as providing support to investigations let by other forces.</p>

	<p pid=".70W.8/2">There is no Public Service Agreement target for disorder. However, the Government is committed to the reduction of disorder and anti-social behaviour in our neighbourhoods. Among the important steps we have taken are the measures in the Police Reform Act 2002 to: improve the effectiveness of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs); create community support officers and to stop nuisance use of motor vehicles. The majority of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships now have anti-social behaviour co-ordinators in place to ensure effective local delivery of reduction in anti-social behaviour.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.2/2">There is no central record of monitoring of ethnic or religious groups taking place in Great Britain. The key source of population data for monitoring ethnicity is the Census. Census 1991 data is the latest available and Census 2001 data should become available from the Office for National Statistics for the United Kingdom in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.2/3">The ethnicity question in the 2001 Census is based on a &quot;self-classification&quot; coding system. Individuals can identify themselves against the existing 16 ethnic Census categories, and if none of these capture the individual's ethnicity, additional space is provided where they can identify their ethnicity. As such, the Census captures the full breadth of ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.2/4">For each ethnic group, the Census can provide information on demographic profile, household structure and type of accommodation, health, educational achievement and employment.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.2/5">In relation to the new Race Relations (Amendment) 2000 Act, the Specific Duty requires, among other things, that public bodies carry out ethnic monitoring.</p>

	<p pid=".75W.2/1">Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits. Levels of drug-related crime cannot be measured directly as no routine statistical data are collected on whether an offence may have been committed as a result of drug taking. However, the NEW-ADAM (New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring) research published between 1998 and 2001 sheds some light on the links between drugs and acquisitive crime. The research is insufficiently advanced, however, to reveal the precise links between drugs and violent crime. Neither are we able to supply an estimate of the total value of the goods and money stolen per annum in the United Kingdom to finance the purchase of illegal drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".75W.2/2">NEW-ADAM research by Bennett reported in Home Office Research Study 205, &quot;Drugs and Crime: The Results of the Second Developmental Stage of the NEW-ADAM Programme&quot; and in Research Findings 148 and 183 has shown that the mean number of property crimes committed by those using heroin and cocaine/crack was around 200 in the last 12 months compared to 52 for those using neither heroin nor crack/cocaine. Over forty per cent. of arrestees thought that their drug use and crime were connected, and when asked about this connection, more than two-thirds said that this was due to the need for money to buy drugs. Those who tested positive for three or more drugs reported on average three times the number of offences and eight times the illegal income, as those who did not test positive. They also reported twice as many arrests in the last twelve months.</p>
	<p pid=".75W.2/3">Findings reported in &quot;Arrest Referral: Emerging Findings from the National Monitoring and Evaluation Programme&quot; (Home Office: Sondhi, O'Shea, Williams, 2002) were used to estimate that the total spend on illegal drugs by those seen by Arrest Referral workers as around &pound;550 million (or around &pound;11,000 for an individual), although not all of this figure will be directly attributable to crime. The NEW-ADAM research has also found that in the year 1999&ndash;2000, on average arrestees reported generating just over &pound;5,000 in illegal income, the most common source of which was property crime.</p>

	<p pid=".76W.5/2">By prioritising the email accounts of the most active individuals in the newsgroups, 130 targets were identified around the world. The National Crime Squad produced evidential packs on the targets and briefed officers from the relevant national and domestic police forces. Detailed investigations were then launched against each target; in the United Kingdom each of the ten targets were arrested and subsequently charged and their computer equipment seized. Eleven child victims have been identified as a result of the operation so far. The operation involved the National Crime Squad, Interpol, nine United Kingdom police forces and 12 other international police forces.</p>

For example, we are currently developing proposals aimed at bringing consistency to the training and development of all school support staff, which will be the subject of consultation during the Autumn term; we are also introducing a 3-year degree level qualification in social work in England from September 2003 to replace the current 2-year Diploma courses.</p>

In relation to the private sector, we do not have this information and it would involve disproportionate cost to provide it.

	<p pid=".81W.3/2">Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HM CPSI), which undertakes regular inspections of all CPS Areas and a study by the Joint Standing Committee on Good Practice, (which incorporates membership from both HM CPSI and the CPS) along with the complaints statistics that are compiled on a quarterly basis and are included in the CPS Annual Report reveal the following weaknesses in the CPS complaint's procedure:</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/3" class="indent">(i) There is a wide variation in the quality of complaints processing. Although all CPS Areas maintain a register of complaints received from the public, some Areas record them alphabetically whilst others record them chronologically. There are occasions when it is difficult to identify what has happened to a complaint and whether follow up action has been taken.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/4" class="indent">(ii) The annual target for 2001&ndash;02, was to increase to 93 per cent. the proportion of replies to complaints which are made within 10 days. This target was not met. Timely replies were made in 81.9 per cent. of cases compared with 95.3 per cent. in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/5">The main recommendations suggested include the use of a standard framework for logging complaints and that there should be periodic reviews of complaints by senior management to assess the timeliness and quality of responses to complaints and to analyse any developing trends with a view to identifying aspects of performance and processes which may need improvement or revision.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/6">Performance evaluation is an ongoing process which is assessed by HM CPSI when they revisit a specific CPS Area. HM CPSI reports on CPS Areas can be obtained on request to the relevant CPS Area.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/7">The following good practises within the CPS complaints procedure were identified nationally:</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/8" class="indent">(i) A consistent approach in defining what is a complaint.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/9" class="indent">(ii) The use of a Register to log all complaints.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/10" class="indent">(iii) A consistent approach to time limits (a full response to be sent to the complainant within 3 working days of receipt into the Department, or failing that an acknowledgement to be sent within this time and the full response to be sent within 10 working days).</p>
	<p pid=".81W.3/11">A Good Practice guide, approved by the CPS Board in June, will shortly be circulated to staff via the CPS intranet.</p>

The Code for Crown Prosecutors, which is issued under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, is of fundamental importance to each CPS Prosecutor. It provides guidance on the general principles to be applied in every case irrespective of geography.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/3">Her Majesty's CPS Inspectorate assesses the application of the Code in each Area inspection. Areas are inspected biennially. In his annual report for the year ending September 2001, HM Chief Inspector of the CPS reported that for cases sampled during Area inspections during the year, his inspectors were satisfied in 98.9 per cent. of cases sampled that the initial review decision was in accordance with the evidential test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, and that the public interest test was satisfied in 99.9 per cent. of cases sampled.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.2/2">The Crown Prosecution Service does not record in detail the individual tasks on which individual lawyers are deployed. Following the recommendations in Sir Iain Glidewell's Report the Crown Prosecution Service has been putting in place operational structures that enable its lawyers to spend more time advising the police and preparing the more serious prosecutions, by establishing co-located Criminal Justice Units and Trial Units for Crown Court work. In addition, the government proposes to implement the recommendation of Sir Robin Auld that the CPS should take over responsibility from the police for determining the charge from the outset of the case, which the CPS and police are currently piloting. These structural changes are enabling more early legal advice before charge, and more focus on casework preparation in more serious cases to ensure that prosecutions are built on secure ground.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.2/3">By the end of March 2002, lawyers in 31 CPS Areas had been assigned to Crown Court work in 54 discrete Trial Units; and 42 co-located Criminal Justice Units had been established in 20 Areas. As at the end of June 2002 some 394 lawyers had qualified as Higher Courts Advocates, with the right to conduct cases in the Crown Court.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.2/4">To help facilitate this shift in gravity, by the end of June 2002 some 178 members of the CPS who are not lawyers had been approved to work as Designated Caseworkers, trained to review and present a defined range of the most straightforward cases in the Magistrates' Courts, freeing up lawyer time for more serious cases. In addition, also reflecting Sir Iain Glidewell's Report, the CPS now employs an Area Business Manager in each Area, and a growing number of Unit Business Managers in Areas with Trial Units, enabling lawyer managers, including Chief Crown Prosecutors, to delegate some of their administrative responsibilities and devote more of their time to casework. There remains a cadre of Special Casework lawyers, and the lawyers in the Casework Directorate continue to advise on and conduct cases ranging from terrorism to extradition, to serious fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.2/5">More Crown Prosecutors are benefiting from greater exposure to Crown Court proceedings and their skills, experience and expertise in dealing with the more serious cases are being developed.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.2/2">In 1999 the Crown Prosecution Service introduced an adverse outcomes analysis system. This provides CPS Areas with a consistent framework within which responsibility may be allocated for the failure of cases through a process of self-assessment, including an indication of the number of non-jury acquittals attributable to failings in the CPS review. The following table shows these outcomes as a proportion of all cases completed in the Crown Court during the three years for which figures are available:</p>
	<table>
		<caption>Year ending March:</caption>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".87W.2/6"> <th></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".87W.2/9"> <td>2000</td> <td>0.7 </td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".87W.2/10"> <td>2001</td> <td>0.6 </td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".87W.2/11"> <td>2002</td> <td>0.5 </td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".87W.2/14">These figures suggest that failings in the CPS review account for a small and diminishing proportion of non-jury acquittals.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/15">However, the findings in the HMCPSI Annual Report for 2001&ndash;02 suggest that the level of foreseeable adverse outcomes is higher. Figures published in the Report show that 33.57 per cent. of adverse outcomes were foreseeable, and that 19.02 per cent. should have been the subject of some remedial action or dropping the case sooner. These figures relate to a different reporting period, smaller sample and by reference to a different test than those gathered by the CPS. The disparity is greatly exaggerated in presentation by the fact that CPS use a percentage of their total caseload, while the HMCPSI look at only a sample and calculate as a proportion of the adverse cases. Nonetheless, this disparity is a cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/16">The Service is conscious that its self-assessment procedures require the support of more sensitive information. The CPS and the police have begun to develop a joint case outcomes analysis which will build on existing procedures and will focus on avoidable case failures. Under this system it is intended that the reasons for non-jury acquittals will be jointly analysed to identify trends and individual and more general training needs, as part of a wider strategy for the identification of good practice. The process will be supported by more sophisticated management information generated through the forthcoming Compass Case Management system, which is scheduled to be rolled out across all CPS Areas between April and December 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".88W.2/2">The analysis of adverse outcomes, described in my response to the hon. Member's related question on non-jury acquittals (UIN 69215), includes an assessment of the number of dismissals no case to answer attributable to failings in the CPS review. The following table shows these outcomes as a proportion of all cases completed in the magistrates' courts during the three years for which figures are available:</p>
	<table>
		<caption>Year ending March:</caption>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".88W.2/6"> <th></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".88W.2/9"> <td>2000</td> <td>0.010 per cent.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".88W.2/10"> <td>2001</td> <td>0.008 per cent.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".88W.2/11"> <td>2002</td> <td>0.011 per cent.</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".88W.2/14">As the above figures show, dismissals for no case to answer attributable to failings in the review process form only a very small part of the overall caseload of the Service. However, there was a small increase in the level of these outcomes during 2001&ndash;2002, from 0.008 per cent. of the overall caseload, or 8 per 100,000, to 0.011 per cent., or 11 per 100,000. While this trend is not considered significant, it does show that there is no room for complacency. The arrangements for improved information on case outcomes described in my response to the Hon Member's related question will provide CPS managers, at a local and national level, with a better analysis of the reasons for case failures, and will strengthen their ability to identify and resolve any areas of concern.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.2/2">An assessment of the adequacy of the resources available to the Crown Prosecution Service was made for the purposes of the 2002 Spending Review, the outcome of which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-15">15 July</phrase>. The White Paper, Justice For All, set out a far-reaching program of change for the criminal justice system and for the Crown Prosecution Service. This programme will improve CPS efficiency and ability to proceed with cases for trial including: closer working with the police and increasing the number of Criminal Justice Units collocated with the police and the number of Trial Units as envisaged in the Glidewell report on the CPS; providing earlier and better advice to the police on charging and giving the CPS the responsibility to determine the charge in all but the most routine cases. Early indications from 6 pilot Areas show that giving the CPS the responsibility to determine the charge will lead to significant improvements in performance; changes to trial procedures to improve efficiency and effectiveness; and the development of the CPS's IT system, Compass, which is an essential part of a more joined up approach to information technology across the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid=".92W.2/2">It is extremely difficult to give precise figures. Before 1993, prosecutions were recorded by the name of the defendant and not by the defendant's occupation.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/3">In 1993 a new case-tracking system was introduced by the CPS which allowed prosecutions for manslaughter arising from gross medical negligence to be recorded. But these figures do not distinguish between doctors and other medical staff.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/4">Bearing in mind these caveats, the CPS has estimated that since 1994 twelve doctors have been prosecuted for &quot;medical&quot; manslaughter. Of those, eight were acquitted of all charges and four were convicted of at least one count on the indictment.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/5">There are no central records of the cost of prosecuting particular categories of case.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/6">The principles applied by Crown prosecutors when deciding whether the prosecution of a doctor, or of any other person, is justified are set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The prosecutor must be satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. If there is sufficient evidence the prosecutor goes on to consider whether a prosecution is needed in the public interest. Because manslaughter is such a serious offence, if the evidence is sufficient to justify proceedings a prosecution would normally follow. Cases involving allegations of &quot;medical&quot; manslaughter are considered by the Casework Directorate at CPS headquarters rather than by the CPS Area in which the death occurred.</p>

	<p pid=".95W.5/1">In relation to the Departments for which the Attorney General is responsible, the information available is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/2">The Crown Prosecution Service has a policy of purchasing recycled paper wherever possible. The paper provided under the Department's central contract for office use is 100 per cent. recycled&mdash;approximate cost &pound;500,000. Of the products supplied under the central contract for supply of other paper-based products, in 2001&ndash;02 82 per cent. by volume (approximate cost &pound;80,000) contained an element of recycled content (ranging from 35 per cent. to 100 per cent. pre- and post-consumer waste).</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/3">The Department does not hold information on recycled paper usage back to 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/4">The Treasury Solicitor's Department is able to reply only in general terms, as records have not been, and are not, kept in such a way as to provide this information.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/5">Since 2000, 100 per cent. of white paper purchased has been from recycled stock. The Agency budgeted &pound;100,000 for paper in each of the last two financial years and although the spend on white paper cannot be separately identified, it does make up the bulk of the figure.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/6">Other recycled products bought are not on record, though contracts specify that suppliers should have regard to environmental factors when providing goods to the agency. There are at present no specific plans to increase the proportion of recycled goods procured but the Agency is always ready to consider means of &quot;greening&quot; its operations when it can do so in an efficient and cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/7">The Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, is small and paper usage is comparatively low. Although recycled paper has been used in the past, purchases must be made on a best value for money basis. Until recently, the cost and quality of recycled paper did not provide this compared to virgin paper from sustainable resources. However, recycled paper appears to have improved in both quality and price and the Department has recently recommenced the purchase of recycled paper.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/8">The Serious Fraud Office does not currently purchase recycled paper but will consider the matter again in the light of improvements in price and quality.</p>

	<p pid=".99W.0/1">As independent organisations it is for further education (FE) colleges to agree the pay and the terms and conditions of their staff within the context of the overall resources available to them. We are aware of the differences between salaries in general further education colleges and schools and this issue is being considered as part of the current Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.0/2">We are investing more than &pound;311 million in the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) over the period 2001&ndash;04. TPI is separate to any general pay increase a lecturer may receive. It is designed to help modernise further education (FE) pay arrangements and to recruit, reward and retain lecturers as part of the drive to improve teaching and learning. Research on the first year of TPI implementation indicates that there is a significant move to teachers being better prepared for the task of teaching students; extra pay has been found to support the recruitment of teachers in skill shortage areas and to address casualisation; and there has been a direct positive impact on teacher morale.</p>

	<p pid=".102W.8/2">The flags, patron saints and the national anthem of the United Kingdom are not a separate element of the Citizenship National Curriculum. However, understanding the origins and implications of the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the United Kingdom is an important part of Citizenship which becomes part of the statutory National Curriculum for 11&ndash;16 year olds in September 2002. In this context pupils will have the opportunity to explore the unique qualities that are part of the shared identities of the countries of the United Kingdom. They may also consider the political, religious, social and constitutional systems that affect their lives and communities.</p>

	<p pid=".104W.0/1">The Government's White Paper <i>Schools: achieving success</i> contained the pledge that over time, all primary school pupils who wanted to should have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument. The Music Standards Fund was introduced in 1999 to protect and expand LEA Music Services. Between 1999&ndash;2000 and 2003&ndash;04 total funding of &pound;270 million has been made available to Music Services across England via the Music Standards Fund. LEAs may spend Music Standards Fund in any way which enhances the opportunities for pupils to access musical education of high quality. It is not intended to provide music lessons for musicians.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/2">There is no requirement for LEAs to inform the Department whether Music Standards Fund has been used to increase access to and take up of music lessons for pupils from low-income families. It is for LEAs and individual schools to decide whether to operate a charging policy for instrumental music lessons provided outside of the National Curriculum, and we do not currently hold data on this.</p>

	<p pid=".118W.2/1">It is too early to evaluate fully the impact of smaller class sizes policy on educational achievement. However, there is evidence, some of which pre-dates the smaller class size policy, that smaller class sizes have a beneficial effect on pupil progress, particularly in maths and literacy, in Reception children. I am exploring how schools might make better use of all their resources&mdash;teachers, support staff and ICT through the Transforming School Workforce pathfinder project. The Department has commissioned a pilot survey to examine the feasibility of collecting the detailed school resourcing information needed to evaluate the impact of resource mix on performance.</p>

	<p pid=".121W.2/1">In June last year, the Department published guidance &quot;<i>Promoting Children's Mental Health within Early Years and School Settings</i>&quot;. The guidance is designed to help teachers and others, working alongside mental health professionals, to promote children's mental health and to intervene effectively with those experiencing problems. A four page summary is also available.</p>
	<p pid=".121W.2/2">The National Healthy School Standard (NHSS), which was launched in October 1999, has as one of its specific themes &quot;Emotional Health and Well being&quot;, which includes awareness of mental health issues. The development of emotional health and well being is covered in the National Curriculum as part of the Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) framework. PSHE enables pupils to develop their self-esteem, confidence and well being. It also helps pupils to appreciate the effect of their actions on their own lives and the lives of others, and to understand the limits and codes of personal and social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".121W.2/3">In addition the Department has been working with its partners to develop a long-term strategy on behaviour improvement. A key measure being piloted is the establishment of Behaviour and Education Support Teams. Their role is to provide an effective early intervention model of supportive services to children and young people who are experiencing emotional, behavioural and mental health problems, and their families. These multi-agency Teams will link with Social Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).</p>
	<p pid=".121W.2/4">The Department are working closely with the Department of Health on the National Service Framework (NSF) for children.

Both LEAs are eligible for funding through the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG). The total allocations for EMAG for 2002&ndash;03 are &pound;1,974,000 for Nottingham City and &pound;278,000 for Nottinghamshire. In addition, Nottingham has received a total of &pound;148,500 from this Department's grant to support the children of asylum seekers in schools in the Home Office dispersal areas.</p>

	<p pid=".127W.2/1">The Children and Young People's Unit works to ensure the coherence of Government policies that affect all children and young people who are under 19, and particularly those who are most vulnerable. In November 2001, it launched a consultation exercise to develop an over-arching strategy for all policies and services for children and young people in England. The framework for the strategy includes looking to secure the objective that children should live in a safe and secure community, where they are protected from abuse. The Unit is now considering the responses to the consultation in preparing a final strategy for publication later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".128W.5/1">My Department has already issued advice to Local Education Authorities and schools about dealing with allegations of abuse in Circular 10/95. &quot;<i>Protecting Children from Abuse: The Role of the Education Service</i>&quot;. The Circular advises that schools and colleges should have procedures that are in accordance with the child protection procedures established by the Area Child Protection Committee and, where appropriate, by the local education authority, including procedures to be followed if a member of staff is accused of abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.5/2">This guidance is under review following the introduction of a new statutory duty regarding child protection in the Education Act 2002. The new duty will require governing bodies of schools or Further Education institutions and LEAs to have arrangements for ensuring that their functions are carried out with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and to have regard guidance by the Secretary of State (or the National Assembly for Wales) in making such arrangements. We are planning to consult on this guidance in the autumn, and we hope that all those with an interest, including teachers, governors and LEAs, will contribute to that consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.0/3">As a result of its programme of continuous improvement the ECO has, in partnership with other Government Departments, substantially reduced the time taken to process all applications, and in particular the most complicated and sensitive cases.

	<p pid=".146W.11/2">The purpose of the GATS is to promote economic growth through the expansion of trade in services. Quantifying the benefits of services liberalisation is difficult, but the available estimates suggest positive benefits for both developed and developing countries in particular.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.11/3">For the United Kingdom, liberalisation of services markets should be of particular benefit. The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world and fourth largest importer. In 2001 exports of services amounted to &pound;77 billion and imports were worth &pound;65 billion. Services account for nearly 70 per cent. of our GDP.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.11/4">We believe that liberalisation of services underpinned by effective domestic regulatory frameworks can bring benefits to developing countries. Recent studies point to the economic efficiency and welfare gains that liberalisation can bring. The World Bank estimate that services liberalisation could boost the income of developing countries by nearly $900 billion. This is nearly five times the gain the bank estimate that they would obtain from liberalisation in goods. Liberalisation of infrastructure services such as financial, telecommunications and transport services can help developing countries by fostering the efficiency and growth of other sectors of their economies.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.11/5">Under the GATS countries can decide in which sectors and to what extent they wish to liberalise or privatise and when they think it would be beneficial for them to do so. The EC has made clear in its liberalisation requests that it is not seeking the dismantling of public services nor the privatisation of state owned companies.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.10/1">The Foresight Crime Prevention Panel was set up in April 1999 to run for three years. The Panel considered the likely developments in science, technology and society up to 20 years ahead and how these might impact on crime. The aim was to try and help UK Government, law enforcement, business, science and society prepare for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.10/2">In December 2000 the Panel published a report &quot;Turning the Corner&quot; which included five key recommendations for change. The Panel spent until March 2002 taking forward these recommendations, the three key outputs were:</p>
	<p pid=".149W.10/3" class="indent">a framework for a national e-crime strategy for the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.10/4" class="indent">a wide range of research projects. Many of these will assist the Home Office in its future strategy on business crime: the impact of crime on business; the scope for a crime-proofing code of practice for manufacturers; the incentives needed for the adoption of such a code; and the new crime threats from e-tailing.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.10/5" class="indent">a benchmarking research project which reviewed scientific research on crime prevention in the UK and identified capability gaps. This has paved the way for proposals for a dedicated programme of scientific research, led by the Home Office, to support crime prevention.</p>

	<p pid=".152W.0/2">The UK textiles and clothing industry has already capitalised on the DTI's BIO-WISE programme which encourages companies to exploit the environmental benefits of biotechnology and also the Envirowise programme which provides practical environmental advice to businesses, focusing on resource efficiency and clean technology measures. In collaboration with CBWT, (the Confederation of British Wool Textiles), DTI is supporting a project to predict the effect of textile chemicals on the aquatic environment aimed at reducing effluent emissions at source.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.0/3">Textile and clothing companies are eligible for the full range of export advice and assistance from Trade Partners UK, including assistance under the Support for Exhibitions and Seminars Abroad (SESA) scheme. This scheme helps them attend and exhibit at key overseas trade fairs and exhibitions. The value of support for clothing and textiles events under the SESA scheme in 2001&ndash;02 was &pound;3,740,732.</p>

In 1999&ndash;2000, UK universities identified one spinout for every &pound;8.6 million of research expenditure, compared with one spinout for every &pound;13.9 million in Canadian Universities in 1999, and one spinout for every &pound;53.1 million in the US. The Survey also covered employment, turnover and equity value of spinouts established by universities but responses were incomplete and raised concerns about the burden associated with collecting this data. A modified second survey currently underway seeks a build on data previously collected to provide a more systematic overview of exploitation performance across the higher education sector.</p>

	<p pid=".168W.5/1">The Government take the issue of sexual harassment very seriously. In employment law it is well established that sexual harassment constitutes a form of detriment under the Sex Discrimination Act.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.5/2">Reporting instances of sexual harassment can be channelled through managers, personnel officers or trade union representatives. Many employers also appoint sexual harassment counsellors who are specially trained to deal with complaints.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.5/3">The Government have published leaflets for employers and employees on how to avoid, how to report, and how to deal with sexual harassment. Guidance for women and men on how to report and deal with instances of sexual harassment is also available from the Equal Opportunities Commission, and the Equal Opportunities Commission can help individuals bring a complaint.</p>

	<p pid=".169W.0/1">The Equal Pay Act 1970 makes it unlawful for an employer to pay a woman less than a man for the same job, a job rated as equivalent or a job of equal value. The Act applies equally to men and women. A booklet about the Act is available from the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.0/2">The Equal Opportunities Commission's (EOC) Code of Practice on Equal Pay provides practical guidance and recommends good practice to employers. It is a statutory Code, and can be referred to in Tribunal evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.0/3">The EOC was given extra funding to develop an Equal Pay Toolkit, aimed at helping employers to carry out pay reviews. The kit was launched on the 4 of July.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.0/4">We have made funding available to Trade Unions to train their representatives to negotiate on equal pay issues in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.0/5">The Employment Act (2002) provides a new power to introduce an Equal Pay Questionnaire into the Equal Pay Act. The questionnaire procedure will help women who think they may not be receiving equal pay to request key information from their employers before deciding whether to institute proceedings. We will be consulting interested parties on the design and content of the form later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".176W.3/1">It was intended that a Committee for Protection Against the Effects of the Extraterritorial Application of Legislation Adopted by a Third Country and Actions Based Thereon or Resulting therefrom (anti-boycott) would be established in Brussels to assist EU companies affected by extraterritorial jurisdiction by third countries, and in particular those affected by the extraterritorial aspects of the US trade sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Libya.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.3/2">Thus far, the Committee has not been convened. UK companies are obliged to inform HMG and the European Commission of any extraterritorial action taken against them, but whilst it is clear who would be responsible for representing the UK at any meeting of the Committee, in these times of improved electronic communication, it has not been necessary in practice for it to meet.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.3/3">In addition, as part of the 1997 Understanding between the EU and the US, the US undertook to exempt European individuals and companies from the extraterritorial aspects of US legislation drastically reducing the number of cases occurring, thus further reducing the need for the Committee to meet.</p>

Under the Cabinet Office and Scottish Executive Concordat on Co-ordination of European Union Policy Issues, UK representation falls to the relevant UK Department (in this instance the Office of Government Commerce). The Concordat requires that the Scottish Executive should be fully consulted prior to any meeting of the Committee and provides that it may send observers or, with the prior agreement of the relevant UK Department, represent the UK at meetings. To date, UK representation at meetings of this particular committee has been by officials of the Office of Government Commerce.</p>

The committee has not met for several years and is unlikely to meet again because Directive 76/117/EEC is being superseded by Directive 94/9/EC (the ATEX Directive) and will be repealed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase> when Directive 94/9/EC comes fully into force.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.3/2">The Government is committed to the future of the post office network. &pound;480 million has already been invested in modernisation of the post office network. In addition, the Government as owner of the Consignia Group, has taken steps to strengthen the management of the company, including the appointment of David Mills as Chief Executive for Post Office Limited who has been charged with development of a strategic plan to include widening commercial opportunities for the network.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.3/3">Banking will be a central part of post offices' strategy to move forward. Universal banking services, together with Post Office Limited's plans for an expansion of network banking&mdash;the provision of counter services for ordinary current accounts&mdash;should lead to a substantial increase in the range and volume of banking at post offices, tapping into a very much larger customer base than benefit recipients alone. This should benefit subpostmasters both directly and through increased footfall, providing a major income stream offsetting the loss over time of the benefit book related revenue.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.12/2">The Performance and Innovation Unit's report &quot;Counter Revolution: Modernising the Post Office Network&quot;, showed that the future viability of the network was challenged by the introduction of automated credit transfer. In December 2000, PostComm advised my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on support for rural post offices. This advice was based on research which included consideration of the impact of automated credit transfer. No other research has been commissioned into the effects of this on rural post offices in the last twelve months.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.12/3">As set out in the PIU report the effect on the network will depend on the Post Office's ability to generate replacement business. We are concentrating on supporting the Post Office's efforts to build up these new business opportunities, including universal banking services, so as to mitigate the effects of the move to automatic credit transfer. We will be monitoring the situation closely as the programme unfolds. We have no proposals for other research in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".187W.2/2">The Government does not have a target for card accounts at the Post Office, rather there is an operating assumption of 3 million card accounts at the end of the benefit and tax credit migration period in 2005, but there will be no cap and no eligibility criteria. Numbers will build up over the migration period from April 2003 but the scale of that build up will depend critically on individual consumer decisions which are difficult to predict with any certainty. The Government has agreed contractual terms with the Post Office for the provision of the card account, the details of which are commercially confidential to the parties.</p>

	<p pid=".187W.5/1">The typical payback period for photovoltaic installations is 50&ndash;100 years. The major photovoltaics demonstration programme effectively halves this payback period for the purchaser by offering 50 per cent. grants on this technology. Our rationale for supporting photovoltaics is that it is a technology at a relatively early stage of development, but with significant potential for further cost reduction and for meeting our electricity needs in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".187W.5/2">Solar water heating is a proven and commercial technology with a payback period of 15&ndash;20 years. No financial support is currently available for this technology through central government, although such support is currently being considered under the &pound;10 million Community and Household renewables scheme. Support may, however, be available through local authorities and energy suppliers.</p>

	<p pid=".188W.2/1">Last July I published a consultation document <i>Tackling loan sharks&mdash;and more!</i> which set out proposals for the first major review of our consumer credit laws in almost 30 years.

The baseline reflects trends in energy use and the changing fuel mix in the electricity supply industry. It also includes the emission reductions expected from some policies that were introduced before the Programme was published, such as the climate change levy, the fuel duty escalator to 1999, and the 10 per cent. renewables target.</p>

The White Paper will take account in particular of the report and recommendations of the recent PIU energy review, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution report &quot;Energy&mdash;the Changing Climate&quot;, other recent Parliamentary reports, existing Government commitments and the findings of the current energy policy consultation. The consultation is very wide-ranging and is engaging stakeholders as well as the public through a variety of innovative approaches and events. It includes consideration of the role of all generation sources including nuclear power in delivering future energy policy, and the actions that might be needed to maintain nuclear as energy option. In parallel and specifically relevant to nuclear, the Government has also been consulting on the management of radioactive waste and DTI has recently published a White Paper on managing the public sector civil nuclear legacy.</p>

	<p pid=".199W.8/3">DTI staff working on the regulatory framework for companies, professions and employment, and on DTI policy towards corporate social responsibility, are aware of the ethical issues in these sectors. In some areas, for example in relation to auditors, the DTI has a formal role in underpinning ethical requirements. Heads of Management Unit in these areas have devolved responsibility for specialised training. This is not centrally recorded.</p>

The Department's basic procedure for dealing with complaints is that, if someone has a complaint, they should initially go back to their original contact in the Department; if the complainant is not satisfied with the response, they are invited to contact the official's line manager; if the problem still cannot be resolved, the matter is referred to the Head of the Management Unit for review. This procedure does not affect the complainant's right to approach, via an MP, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration or myself.</p>

	<p pid=".204W.6/2">For target-holders, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme places the responsibility for emissions created by the generation of power with the end user of that power. This provides a strong incentive for energy users to increase their efficiency and to reduce emissions at the point of use. Therefore, if generators were also covered there would be a risk of double counting, where the generators could count emissions reductions made by down-stream users. Therefore, nuclear energy generation is not included in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".205W.0/2">The UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001&ndash;20 will be published very shortly. This will show how the UK will implement the OSPAR Radioactive Substances Strategy. The aim of that Strategy is to ensure progressive reduction of concentrations of radioactive substances in the marine environment so that by 2020 they are close to zero to historic levels.</p>
	<p pid=".205W.0/3">Radioactive discharges from Sellafield have decreased dramatically over the past 25 years, to around 1 per cent. of their peak levels in the 1970s. The Strategy will show that further substantial reductions will be made in the period to 2020. The Environment Agency has carried out a full review of discharge authorisations at Sellafield and are expected to announce their draft decision soon. It will then be for me as Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Health to decide whether we wish to exercise our statutory powers before any changes are put into effect. The Secretary of State for Health and I expect to announce shortly whether we wish to exercise our statutory powers in relation to the Agency's proposed decision on discharges of technetium-99 from Sellafield.</p>

One of the underlying principles of the Paris Convention is that all liability arising from a nuclear accident is channelled to the operator of the nuclear installation on a no fault basis. Present UK legislation requires operators to cover their liability by insurance, (the Nuclear Installations Act 1965) and operator's liability is currently limited to a maximum &pound;140 million per accident.</p>

We will appoint an independent body to oversee the review process which will make recommendations on the option, or combination of options, for managing radioactive waste which would achieve long-term protection for people and the environment.

So we intend, in assessing management options, to include not only materials currently classified as waste but also to consider the consequences of providing for other materials which may have to be managed as waste during the period, such as some separated plutonium, and uranium, as well as certain quantities of spent nuclear fuel.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.2/4">We propose that the new body will be in place by the end of the year. Over the summer and autumn, we shall publish more detailed proposals. These will include details of the new body and its terms of reference. They will also address pressing issues such as arrangements for managing waste safely in the short-term and an announcement on waste substitution. We shall report progress on the other issues covered in the consultation, including decommissioning nuclear sites, the powers of the Environment Agencies, managing spent sealed sources of radioactivity, and waste classification.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.3/2">Risks to worker health from formaldehyde are already addressed by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999 (COSHH). The Health and Safety Commission has approved Maximum Exposure Limits (MELs) for formaldehyde at 2 ppm (parts per million by volume) as an 8-hour time-weighted average, and 2 ppm as a short-term limit with a 15-minute reference period. Under COSHH, exposure by inhalation to a substance with a maximum exposure limit must be reduced as far as is reasonably practicable, and in any case below the MEL.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.3/3">In its documentation summarising the criteria for setting MELs, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) states that formaldehyde has a threshold of detection by smell at around 0.8 ppm. An earlier HSE Toxicity Review notes that the threshold for odour detection varies among individuals, with values in the range 0.05&ndash;1 ppm having been reported; it is expected that all would detect the odour at the latter value. HSE has issued no further advice relating odour to concentration; it does not normally seek to offer advice on odour problems.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.3/4">Industrial formaldehyde emissions to the wider environment are currently regulated by local authorities or, where larger industrial processes are concerned, by the Environment Agency, under the provisions of the Environment Protection Act 1990. Each industrial process requires an authorisation from the regulator. Where formaldehyde emissions are likely to cause environmental harm, each authorisation will contain conditions designed to limit its release. The regulator may at any time vary those conditions if it considers that necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.3/5">The regulatory system established by the 1990 Act is gradually being replaced&mdash;from now to mid-2007&mdash;by that set out in the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000. Each industrial installation will require a permit, which must contain conditions relating to formaldehyde emissions if these are likely to be significant to human health or human senses, or to impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment.</p>

Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where (a) insurance is a condition of a lease (b) the lessor will not except a Government indemnity (c) incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective than other accommodation options [Government Accounting, para. 30.2.11a].</p>

	<p pid=".229W.5/1">There has been good progress in implementing the counter-terrorism measures agreed by EU Heads of Government and Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in September 2001. In particular, the Council of Ministers has adopted the framework decisions on a European arrest warrant; on terrorism; and on joint investigative teams. Practical and effective co-operation between Europe's intelligence and law-enforcement agencies to combat terrorism has also continued to improve. The Seville European Council in June committed the EU to continue to maintain the closest possible coordination with the United States and other partners in the fight against terrorism, and to contribute further to international efforts against terrorism. Through its political dialogue with third countries, the EU is encouraging others to take the necessary legislative and operational actions to combat terrorism. Where appropriate, the EU is seeking to deliver assistance in counter-terrorist disciplines, through existing programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".231W.2/1">We have collated no specific evidence on the influence of politics in prosecution decisions. But we are aware of the parlous state of the judiciary in Sierra Leone, which has been allowed to deteriorate over the past twenty years or more. We also recognise that the confidence of ordinary Sierra Leoneans in the proper functioning of the judiciary is at a low ebb. We are especially concerned about delays in moving forward a large number of outstanding corruption cases, and have made clear our desire that they be brought to an early conclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.2/2">A properly functioning judicial process is an essential element of good governance. We are therefore helping the government of Sierra Leone with judicial reform. Part of our engagement in Sierra Leone has concentrated on law reform, including the refurbishment of court buildings in both Freetown and the provinces that were damaged or destroyed during the civil war.</p>

Having assessed the application and being content that all relevant data was available, the French competent authority forwarded the application to other Member States via the Commission with a favourable opinion. ACRE considered the dossier on T25 maize in June 1996 and gave their advice. Subsequently, and following a favourable opinion from the European Commission Scientific Committee on Plants, the application was approved and consent issued by the French on behalf of the EU in August 1998.</p>

	<p pid=".242W.3/1">The report by the Food Standards Agency's Core Stakeholder Group is fully consistent with existing Government policy in this respect. The development of methods and tests that can distinguish between scrapie and sheep is a key focus for research.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.3/2">Indeed, DEFRA has long recognised the need for a rapid test which can reliably distinguish a &quot;BSE-like&quot; strain of TSE agent from the strains known to represent traditional scrapie. For example, there are two different technologies being studied at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency which show some promise in this regard.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.3/3">A modified version of the Western Blot is now being used (in addition to standard Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry) for statutory testing of all clinical scrapie suspects in GB and for retrospective testing of archived case material. So far, there have been no results which would suggest a &quot;BSE-like&quot; strain.</p>
	<p pid=".242W.3/4">Work on differential testing is not limited to the UK. DEFRA also monitors and collaborates on research developments throughout the world. The European Commission's Scientific Steering Committee recently published a strategy to apply a common protocol for testing scrapie cases for BSE across Europe.</p>

We believe that this arrangement offers significant advantages in terms of flexibility and meeting the different needs of the fishing industries in different Member States.

	<p pid=".246W.0/1">I refer the hon. Member to the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-29">29 July</phrase> from my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State. She wrote to all Members with the results of the consultation on radioactive waste management, and announced the next steps of the policy making process.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/2">The consultation on <i>Managing radioactive waste safely,</i> published by the UK Government and the devolved administrations, ran from <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-12">12 September 2001</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-12">12 March 2002</phrase> and 330 responses were received. A summary of the responses has been placed in the Library of the House, and those of the devolved administrations. The summary lists other events during the consultation period, including recommendations from two Parliamentary Select Committees and a number of research reports. Copies of individual responses are available in my Department's Library, and in those of the relevant Departments in the devolved administrations.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/3">In her letter, my right hon. Friend said that the Government and the devolved administrations had considered these responses and recommendations and decided the next steps in the policy process. In particular, we propose to press ahead with a review of waste management options. The review will seek the views of interested stakeholders, the public and government departments. We will appoint an independent body to oversee the review process which will make recommendations on the option, or combination of options, for managing radioactive waste which would achieve long-term protection for people and the environment. We will review all options and revise the timetable to a four stage process rather than five as proposed in the original consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/4">The review process must engage with stakeholders and the public. The review will therefore start by setting the framework for debate by establishing broad agreement on the wastes to be considered, the range of management options for each of them, and the criteria against which these options should be assessed. We want to promote a dynamic and extensive process of public engagement. This approach, coupled with regular reports to our Parliaments and Assemblies, will reach far more people and encourage active involvement in decision making, rather than occasional opportunities to react to consultation papers.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/5">The waste from our existing nuclear facilities will arise over the next century or so. So we intend, in assessing management options, to include not only materials currently classified as waste but also to consider the consequences of providing for other materials which may have to be managed as waste during the period, such as some separated plutonium, and uranium, as well as certain quantities of spent nuclear fuel.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/6">We propose that the new body will be in place by the end of the year. Over the summer and autumn, we shall publish more detailed proposals. These will include details of the new body and its terms of reference. They will also address pressing issues such as arrangements for managing waste safely in the short-term and an announcement on waste substitution. We shall report progress on the other issues covered in the consultation, including decommissioning nuclear sites, the powers of the Environment Agencies, managing spent sealed sources of radioactivity, and waste classification.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/7">In the meantime we are not planning any changes to legislation or guidance on this issue.</p>

	<p pid=".247W.11/2">The Department does not hold samples of GM crops authorised for commercial use in the in the United States. GM crops are only permitted to be imported into EU countries if they also have consent under EU directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms to the the environment. Importers must ensure that grain and seed imports have the necessary authorisation. DEFRA's GM inspectorate at the Central Scientific Laboratory (CSL) carry out audits to check compliance. CSL has the capability to perform tests to check for unauthorised GM presence as necessary. The tests look for non-specific DNA sequences that are characteristic of the genetic modification process.</p>

	<p pid=".251W.2/3">The Environment Agency is in the process of assessing the costs and resources required for administering and enforcing the new designations under the Nitrates Directive. Initial indications are that both options cost around &pound;2 million each, excluding costs arising from staff training and resolving boundary disputes. This similarity between costs arises because even if the whole territory had been designated, the Agency would have adopted the same priority based approach to enforcement that it will be using in the newly designated areas.</p>

	<p pid=".251W.5/1">Imports of illegally logged timber can only be seized at import by HM Customs and Excise where the timber concerned is covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and can be identified as having been imported in breach of its requirements. The same is true of other Member States of the EU. Thus, even if producing countries establish independent verification of legal compliance with chain-of-custody tracking to ensure timber was legally or illegally logged, Customs cannot seize or reject imports of illegally logged timber unless they are covered by CITES. New EU-wide legislation is needed to empower customs authorities to prevent entry of illegally logged timber. The UK is working within the EU to identify what legislation is needed and how it can be introduced.</p>

	<p pid=".268W.5/1">The draft Directive was adopted by the Commission in January 2002 and DEFRA launched a public consultation on the proposals on April 12. Extensive study has been carried out throughout this period to assess the impact of the draft Directive. Through direct consultation with a selection of stakeholders, and using the responses received to the public consultation, DEFRA recently produced an extended partial Regulatory Impact Assessment (COM (02) 17) which considers the potential benefits and costs of the draft Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".268W.5/2">The assessment indicates that much of the environmental damage that would fall within the scope of the proposed regime is already subject to existing domestic legislation. It does suggest however, that the proposed Directive could have additional positive environmental benefits, by requiring higher standards of remediation and by encouraging operators to take additional precaution. Businesses could face additional costs through, amongst other things, possible financial security requirements, and additional expenditure on precautionary measures. Additional study is being carried out in this area in order to quantify such costs.</p>
	<p pid=".268W.5/3">In requiring higher standards of remediation, the responsibilities of the Competent Authority, which is designated by the Member State to require operators to take preventative or restorative measures, would be increased. Under the Commission's proposal, the Competent Authority would have a duty to take action to remedy damage if the liable party could not be found. A preliminary assessment provided by selected enforcement agencies indicates that the Directive would largely constitute an extension of existing responsibilities although there would be some new duties. Therefore there may be some resource implications.</p>
	<p pid=".268W.5/4">The Government supports a regime which is equitable, proportionate, clear, insurable, easy to implement, does not damage business competitiveness, and delivers clear environmental benefits. Consequently, assessment of the potential impact of the draft Directive is ongoing to inform the UK position in the negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".269W.2/1">The purpose of the proposed Directive is to establish a framework for the prevention and remediation of environmental damage in accordance with the principle that the polluter pays. This represents an important and significant development in EC environmental law. The Government has therefore conducted a public consultation on the proposals, and the UK position on the detail of the proposal will be finalised in the light of the comments received.</p>

	<p pid=".269W.2/3">The partial regulatory impact assessment submitted to Parliament (COM (02) 17), indicates that much of the environmental damage covered by the Directive is already the subject of existing domestic regimes, but the proposals go further in some respects. The Directive would set higher standards of remediation and introduce the concepts of equivalent compensation and interim losses. Further benefits would arise from introducing a regime across the European Community which would harmonise the rules and standards for environmental liability across member states. Provided that the right balance between costs and benefits is achieved, this proposal could therefore play a useful part in safeguarding the environment.</p>

It concludes that much of the environmental damage covered within the scope of the proposed Directive is already subject to a number of domestic regimes.</p>
	<p pid=".270W.0/2">However, the assessment does establish that there could potentially be positive environmental benefits, resulting in particular from the setting of higher standards of remediation that would require more extensive remediative action. Furthermore, the introduction of equivalent remediation, which would require restorative action to be carried out at an alternative site, and the concept of compensation for interim losses would go further than existing legislation.</p>

These controls are supplemented by a non-statutory Code of Practice and the &quot;Safe Sludge Matrix&quot; a voluntary agreement drawn up in 1998 by Water UK (representing the water companies) and the British Retail Consortium.</p>
	<p pid=".270W.9/3">The Government welcomes the development of the Matrix and has indicated that it will reflect the tighter standards it contains in revised regulations. We plan to issue a consultation document seeking views on the proposed revisions in the very near future.</p>

	<p pid=".273W.5/1">Bottlenose dolphins are protected in the Great Britain under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Section 9 of the 1981 Act makes it an offence to intentionally kill or injure this species. In England and Wales this protection was strengthened by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 that introduced a new offence of intentional or reckless disturbance.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.5/2">The bottlenose dolphin is also listed under Annex II of the Council Directive (92/43/EEC) on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. This requires the designation of protected areas for bottlenose dolphins. Three such areas have been designated as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) for their local bottlenose dolphin populations. Cardigan Bay and the Lleyn Peninsula and the Sarnau in Wales and the Moray Firth in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.5/3">As part of the UK's biodiversity strategy, the Government has developed action plans for the conservation of certain species and habitats. Small dolphins, which include bottlenose dolphins, have such a plan. This aims to maintain the dolphins' current range and abundance and, in the longer term, to increase the ranges of small dolphin populations where appropriate. The plan's objectives include minimising the incidental capture of dolphins in fishing nets, reducing acoustic disturbance and improving coastal water quality by reducing pollution. A co-ordinated steering group has been set up to take forward cetacean action plans and comprises representatives from non-government organisations, such as the RSPCA, the government, fishermen and other stakeholders.</p>

A report issued in 1997 estimated the UK urban fox population at 33,000. In a survey of 139 councils conducted in 2001, most expressed the opinion that the urban fox population density in their area had risen.</p>
	<p pid=".278W.3/3">The Department holds no figures on the levels of urban fox populations for each of the past five years.</p>

	<p pid=".282W.2/2">Part I of the Local Government Act 2000 placed a duty on English local authorities to prepare a community strategy. The delivery of improved long term economic, social and environmental quality of life, contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK, lies at the heart of community strategies; indeed community strategies are required, by law, to promote sustainable development. The Government believes community strategies will promote the mainstreaming of sustainable development across local authorities' functions. Where they have effective and holistic Local Agenda 21 strategies, there may be good reasons for local authorities to continue to implement LA21. However, the Government feels that, in the long term, LA21 strategies will effectively be subsumed by community strategies. Whilst there are no requirements placed on local authorities to produce specific community renewable energy or alternative energy strategies, energy use, as an important element of sustainable development, can be considered as part of the community strategy process.</p>
	<p pid=".282W.2/3">For energy providers, the Renewables Obligation under the Utilities Act 2000 requires all licensed electricity suppliers in Great Britain to supply a specified and growing proportion of their supplies from renewable energy in order to meet the Government's target that 10 per cent. of electricity sales will come from renewable sources by 2010.</p>

The Forum is also pursuing other initiatives in its ten point action plan, which was launched in March this year. Work of the Forum is being led by the Meat and Livestock Commission, which as part of its remit undertakes promotional support for the benefit of sheep producers. Many marketing issues, including the export of sheep for slaughter, involve commercial decisions in which the Government only has a limited role.

	<p pid=".285W.8/1">Light is excluded from the statutory nuisance regime of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. During the debate of the associated bill in the House of Lords, floodlighting as a statutory nuisance was rejected on the basis of the low incidence of reported problems, and the perceived looseness of the proposed term &quot;floodlighting&quot;. However I recognise that intrusion from security lighting has become a growing problem, and in view of this I will consider what measures may be used to address this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.8/2">Currently where there is a proposal for which a planning application is required, the local planning authority has the power to control many sorts of lighting installation by imposing planning conditions. In this situation, the authority can refuse permission, or grant permission with conditions which could specify in detail what sort of external light installations would be allowed. In any other circumstances, since the courts have ruled that emitting light does not of itself constitute development, the matter is outside planning controls.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.8/3">I understand that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to amend planning legislation in this area. Instead, this Government continues to publicise and to recommend the advice given in &quot;<i>Lighting in the Countryside: Towards good practice</i>&quot;, which is available on our website at: <a href="http://www.planning.odpm.gov.uk/litc/index.htm">http://www.planning. odpm.gov.uk/litc/index.htm</a> This publication, which is also relevant to those in towns and cities, indicates a way forward which we believe is preferable to further regulation.</p>

This includes legislative protection for certain species, where such protection is necessary to address the causes of population decline, as well as a range of wider environmental policies. Of particular importance is the UK's national response to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The UK Biodiversity Action Plan was published in 1995 and more recently a significant number of specific Action Plans have been finalised, including 436 biodiversity, 391 species and 45 habitat related action plans. These are targeted at the conservation needs of rare species and of habitats and are being implemented through broad partnerships of government, statutory conservation agencies and the voluntary sector. The Biodiversity Action Plans encourage positive actions for rare species at a range of scales, from national to local, and by a range of organisations. Monitoring will provide feedback on the efficacy of the implementation of the plans.</p>

The provisional targets are highest for urban areas such as Sheffield (80 per cent.) and Leeds (66 per cent.) and lower for more rural areas such as North Yorkshire (53 per cent.).</p>

Up to date Information is not currently available for all local authority area in the region. Information supplied by individual local authorties to the Yorkshire and Humber Assembly shows that Sheffield (82 per cent.) and Leeds (74 per cent.) both exceeded their provisional targets in 2001. In North Yorkshire, Harrogate achieved 69 per cent. whilst the more rural district of Richmondshire achieved 32 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".289W.6/1">Following the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat has set each water company an annual leakage target to progressively reduce leakage to its economic level by 2003. This is defined as the level at which the costs to make further reductions in leakage are greater than the costs of supplying additional water from its sources. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-25">25 July</phrase>, Ofwat published details of company performance against their targets for 2001&ndash;02. Of the twenty-one companies set targets, nineteen met them and are now at or on course to reach their Economic Level of Leakage by 2003. Ofwat considers that the two that did not will recover their positions by 2002&ndash;03. Thames Water was subject to special measures rather than being set a volumetric target in 2001&ndash;02, due to its unsatisfactory performance in managing leakage. The company's performance in this respect continues to be deficient. Ofwat is taking a number of increased measures to ensure that Thames Water brings its leakage under control by 2003&ndash;04, including the setting of local leakage targets for 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".289W.9/1">Devolved Administrations attend meetings of the EU Committee on agricultural structures and rural development where they consider the agenda to contain items of sufficient interest. Scottish Executive representatives attended in December to hear of the Commission's revised reporting requirements, in February when its annual modification to the Scottish Rural Development Programme was considered, and in July to look at proposed simplification of the Rural Development Regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".289W.9/2">Our approach is one of teamwork in which we seek to ensure that there is an agreed UK line on issues covered by the Commission committees, taking into account devolved administration views in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations. In particular, where the rural development programmes of the Scottish Executive or the other devolved administrations are being dealt with by the Committee, we would normally expect representatives from the relevant administration to speak on behalf of the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".291W.6/1">The Department is aware of a number of studies of the populations of mammals and birds in England. The most recent comprehensive estimates of rabbit, hare, fox, otter and mink populations were published by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee in <i>A Review of British Mammals: population estimates and conservation status of British Mammals other than cetaceans (1995).</i></p>
	<p pid=".291W.6/2">Estimates indicate that rabbit populations are increasing at around 1&ndash;2 per cent. each year. Brown hare populations are probably in continuing decline. Mountain hare populations are thought to be stable but, as expected, very localised. Fox populations appear to be stable in rural areas and increasing in urban areas. The otter is benefiting from reintroductions to the wild and is continuing to spread and increase. American mink numbers may be declining in some areas as a result of the spread of otters.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.6/3">The British Trust for Ornithology conducts surveys of bird numbers in Britain. A 1988&ndash;91 survey estimated 590,000 magpie territories and 160,000 jay territories in Britain. Magpie numbers are estimated to have increased by a mean rate of 4&ndash;5 per cent. a year between 1966 and 1986 and to have stabilised thereafter. Jay populations have tended to increase on farmland and to decrease in woodland since the survey and overall, the population remained relatively stable or increased slightly up to 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.6/4">Grey or hooded crows are not regular breeders in England, although the picture is complicated by the existence of hybrids with the carrion crow.</p>

	<p pid=".292W.0/1">I have already announced special grant funding of an extra &pound;40 million for local authorities for this year. This is in addition to the &pound;6 million already allocated for the last financial year. Additional help for future years was included in the Spending Review announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-15">15 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.0/2">The funding will enable local authorities to make full use of treatment facilities now up and running in the UK. Five &quot;fridge eating&quot; sites have been operating for a number of weeks. Two are due to come on line in August, and a further three later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.0/3">Under a voluntary, industry-led approach, the UK traditionally recovers value from around 70 per cent. of the tyres disposed of each year, although this dipped in 2000 due to the closure of a major tyre reprocessing facility. Since then, significant new tyre reprocessing capacity has been developed.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.0/4">As well as having sufficient tyre reprocessing capacity, it will be important that the framework supporting the tyre landfill ban promotes responsible tyre disposal and recovery. Earlier this year, DTI issued a discussion document on used tyre issues which examined a possible statutory producer responsibility model. We are currently considering next steps in the light of the responses received.</p>

	<p pid=".292W.3/1">Mechanical biological treatment is used to manage the residue remaining after the recyclables have been removed from municipal waste. It employs conventional, proven techniques to remove any remaining recyclables and to stabilise the organic content by composting or anaerobic digestion. This material can then be landfilled or used as a fuel for energy recovery. The process is widely used in Germany and Italy and also in Austria and the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.3/2">MBT is specifically designed to complement waste management strategies that are focussed on material recovery through recycling and composting by providing a flexible way of dealing with the residue. This type of treatment can assist in reaching the targets for the reduction of biodegradable municipal waste disposed of to landfill as set out in the Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.3/3">A bid by Shanks that includes mechanical biological treatment recently won preferred bidder status for a 25 year waste disposal contract with East London Waste Authority. Shanks will be using Italian technology under licence.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.3/4">My understanding is that Island Waste Services produces a fuel from the residual municipal solid waste after material recovery including separate composting of green waste. The treatment of the fuel is solely by mechanical means, to achieve size reduction, without any element of biological treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".293W.2/1">The Government already has a number of measures in place that will increase the future amount of household waste which is recycled. These measures include setting statutory performance standards for the percentage of waste that local authorities must recycle by 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06, and additional financial support to help local authorities deliver these standards.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.2/2">The standards we have set for local authorities take account of the performance that the authorities were reporting at the time. As a result, whilst all authorities are required to improve, there are variations in the percentages that authorities must deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.2/3">Our ambitions on waste disposal extend well beyond 2005&ndash;06 and we will seek continuous improvement in our recycling rates. We will consider longer-term recycling standards for individual local authorities in the light of experience and any technological developments. As a part of that consideration, we will take a view on the demands for improvement we place on those who are currently lower and higher performing authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.2/4">Generally, we consider local authorities are best placed to decide locally how best to meet existing standards, taking account of the nature of the local waste stream and issues such as the type of housing in their area. We have no plans for centrally imposing greater uniformity in the way local authorities collect and dispose of waste.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.2/5">In November the Secretary of State announced that the Government's Strategy Unit would be carrying out a study on waste strategy. This study is assessing what extra instruments, changes to targets or regulations, and/or additional funding may be required to ensure that the strategy is effectively delivered and that we are able to develop more sustainable waste management. The Strategy Unit are due to report later in the year and we will make final decisions on future resources, and consider other policy measures, when the conclusions of the study are known.</p>

In 2001&ndash;02 most of the campaign's resources were reallocated to rural support, during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, and expenditure was &pound;0.6 million. The Department is currently reviewing the effectiveness of public awareness activities in this area and in the meantime, in the current financial year, is making only minimal financial commitments on the &quot;Are You Doing You Bit?&quot; campaign. The distribution of budgets for public awareness activities for the following three financial years has yet to be decided, in the light of the overall figures for the Department settled in this year's Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid=".296W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-10">10 July</phrase>, the European Commission published its proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. These form a good basis for discussion, and in many ways respond to UK calls that significant reform of the CAP is required. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out the UK's initial response to the proposals at the <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-15">15 July</phrase> EU Agriculture Council. As she explained, the Government believes that the general thrust of the proposals of further market reform, decoupling of direct payments from production, and reinforcement of the rural development regulation is the right one. But in a number of key areas we consider that the proposals do not go far enough and do not adequately respond to the challenges ahead. In particular, the Commission's proposals on modulation would simply recycle money within the CAP while we would like to have seen a proposal which reduced subsidies while delivering real budgetary savings.</p>

All the results are published on a website: <a href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/committees/PRC/prc.htm">www.pesticides.gov.uk/committees/PRC/prc.htm</a></p>
	<p pid=".297W.5/2">The Maximum Residue Levels regulations apply equally to imports. Additionally, the general provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 apply at all times. The food safety requirements are that food must not have been rendered injurious to health; be unfit; or be so contaminated&mdash;whether by extraneous matter or otherwise&mdash;that it would be unreasonable to expect it to be sold in that state. These legislative controls are backed up by the monitoring programme described above. Around half of the samples tested are of imported food.</p>
	<p pid=".297W.5/3">The Government has no plans to introduce statutory targets to reduce the use of pesticides in food production</p>

	<p pid=".305W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence aims to be as helpful as possible in responding to hon Members' questions. Where it is appropriate to refer hon Members to other documents as part of the substantive reply, this may be done by making hard copies available in the Libraries of the House, or by reference to material available on the MOD website at <a href="http://www.mod.uk">http://www.mod.uk</a>. However, some documents referred to in parliamentary answers are published by organisations outside the Department and these will not necessarily be appropriate for inclusion on the Department's website. Additionally, not all documents produced by the Department are available electronically.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.8/2">If a document on the Department's website has been referred to in a parliamentary answer it will generally continue to be available there. Some information of a transitory nature&mdash;for example the operational low flying timetable&mdash;will be updated periodically, but most reports and policy papers are retained permanently without amendment. Because the structure of the Department's website changes over time, document addresses given in parliamentary answers may also change, but significant documents will almost certainly continue to be available elsewhere on the website.</p>

However, it does form part of the Bristol Travel To Work Area where there is a number of MOD establishments including the headquarters for the Defence Procurement Agency and the Warship Support Agency that are both based at Abbey Wood in Bristol North-West. Abbey Wood opened in 1995 with the relocation of the then Procurement Executive. Over 500 staff were recruited locally in 1995&ndash;96. Now over 5,800 people work at the site; this will rise to over 6,800 in late 2002 with the further co-location of Warship Support Agency staff. In April 1994 there were 294 Full Time Equivalent civilian posts in the Bristol Travel To Work Area, which had increased to 4,039 Full Time Equivalent civilian posts by July 2001 largely as a result of the creation of the Abbey Wood headquarters.</p>

	<p pid=".307W.6/3">The Ministry of Defence does not routinely impose a requirement for a standard level of professional indemnity insurance in contracts with small consultants. Most consultants will take out professional indemnity insurance with a policy value consistent with the risks associated with their business. Unless there are compelling business reasons to the contrary, MOD would not wish to interfere in this decision.</p>
	<p pid=".307W.6/4">As MOD does not routinely impose a requirement for a standard level of professional indemnity insurance, then the question of exceptions to a standard level does not usually arise. However, MOD would not wish to allow any variations in the levels of professional indemnity insurance which could distort competition or could in any other way be seen as discriminatory. Inevitably, some contracts do carry special risks and, in these cases, it may be beneficial on value for money grounds for the MOD to exclude or limit the contractor's liability. Finally, as with previous Administrations, it is not this Government's practice to provide details of discussions that form part of the process of policy development and analysis.</p>

	<p pid=".309W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/2">The Government's policy on Criterion Eight of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria remains as stated in the criteria announced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-26">26 October 2000</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2000-10-26.199"><i>Official Report,</i> column 199W</phrase>. However, as stated by my noble Friend, Lord Sainsbury of Turville on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-04">4 March 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-03-04.73"><i>Official Report,</i> column 73</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;the Government have recognised the need to consider how criterion eight . . . can most effectively be applied in assessing relevant export licence applications. The Government agree that there is a need for clearer procedures within Whitehall for reaching decisions where sustainable development is an issue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/4">The Government have agreed a two-stage process for assessing the impact of relevant proposed exports on sustainable development as defined in Criterion 8. First a non-exhaustive list of countries identifies those where sustainable development is most likely to be an issue. Second, in cases involving exports to those countries, the Government will look in more detail at the possible impact of relevant proposed exports on the economy or the sustainable development of the recipient country. All Departments involved in the export licensing process have agreed guidance for officials to assist with this process. This guidance is not on the interpretation of policy, which remains as set out in the Criteria, but in the procedures developed to assist in compiling the data necessary for the Government to make decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/5">The list of countries will reflect those destinations where the prevailing macro-economic and development conditions mean that an export is most likely to trigger concern about economic impact or sustainable development as defined in Criterion 8. Those countries eligible for concessional loans from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) have been chosen for these purposes as representing the world's poorest. Because the economic and development situation in these countries differs, this part of the process will identify, on a country by country basis, which ELAs the Department of Trade and Industry will pass to the Department for International Development, as well as to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Ministry of Defence, for more detailed assessment and advice. The Government will keep the list of countries under constant review to take account of changing circumstances. The list will be published on the DTI website. Additionally, at the request of any Government Department involved in the licensing process, any ELA may be examined for its impact on the economy or sustainable development of the recipient country as defined in Criterion 8 should that Government Department consider this appropriate in the light of the individual circumstances of that application.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/6">To assist in carrying out the assessment required under Criterion 8 where an ELA has been identified as requiring this further detailed assessment, the Government have devised a series of indicators. In the interests of transparency, consistency and predictability, I will outline the nature of these indicators.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/7">The indicators take account of both the conditions prevailing in the importing country and the potential impact of the export. They are designed to help assess whether the proposed export would seriously undermine the economy of the recipient country and whether it would seriously hamper its sustainable development as defined in Criterion 8. The indicators are: relative levels of military and social expenditure and level of military spending as a percentage of GNP; aid dependency compared with the regional average; state of public finances; balance of payments; external debt sustainability; economic and social development, i.e. GNP/capita and Human Development Index; the status of any IMF or World Bank-sponsored economic reform programme. The assessment will take into account the impact of the proposed export on the above indicators.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/8">Criterion 8 refers to</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/9" class="indent">&quot;the compatibility of the arms exports with the technical and economic capacity of the recipient country, taking into account the desirability that states should achieve their legitimate needs of security and defence with the least diversion for armaments of human and economic resources&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/10">The Department for International Development will raise any concerns about &quot;least diversion&quot; by reference to the other agreed indicators.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/11">The cumulative impact of all arms imports to the destination country, not just exports from the UK, would be captured by the Criteria as a whole and by the above indicators.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/12">Sources of information will include the IMF <i>Government Financial Statistics Yearbook</i>, IMF <i>Country Reports</i> and <i>Surveys</i>, IMF/World Bank <i>Annual Progress Reports on the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility</i> and, where appropriate, completion point documents from the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Information in the IMF's periodic publication, <i>Recent Economic Developments</i> and the World Bank's <i>World Development Indicators</i> as well as OECD statistics, data and country summaries may also be drawn on.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/13">Export licensing decisions rest with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, taking account of both advice from other Departments, and whether to issue or refuse a licence would be consistent with the Consolidated Criteria as a whole. The Department for International Development as the lead Department for advice on sustainable development issues, will invariably provide advice, although other Departments may also provide advice.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.8/14">The F680 process, through which the Government provide advice to industry on proposals for marketing or promoting products overseas, does not constitute an export licence. Neither is the existence or otherwise of an F680 approval a factor which is taken into account in the licensing decision. However, the Government have also decided to make procedural changes to the F680 process. Rather than as previously, commenting through FCO, the Department for International Development will be invited formally to comment directly on F680 applications.</p>

	<p pid=".311W.2/2">The Export Control Act 2002 will give the Government new powers allowing for controls to be imposed on arms trafficking and brokering.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.2/3">The Government have proposed to set these powers to establish controls on the supply and delivery, and on acts calculated to promote the supply or delivery, of controlled goods from any overseas country to any arms-embargoed destination, and of long-range missiles and equipment whose export the Government had already banned because of evidence of its use in torture from any overseas country to any other country. These controls will apply where any part of the activities takes place in the United Kingdom and to activities by United Kingdom persons anywhere.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.2/4">The Government have also proposed to use the new powers in the Export Control Act to establish controls on various activities connected to trade in military equipment whose export is already subject to control. The activities that will be subject to control include acquisition or disposal of goods. They also include arranging a contract for the acquisition or disposal of goods, or doing any act calculated to promote the arranging of such a contract in return for a fee. The controls will apply where any part of the activities takes place in the United Kingdom. The controls will not apply to a person whose sole involvement in the movement of goods is to provide transportation, finance, insurance or general advertising or promotional services.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.2/5">The Government propose to establish a register of information on all those applying for licences under the Export Control Act, regardless of nationality, both for exports and for the activities described above, thus creating a database available to be used for licensing and enforcement purposes.</p>

	<p pid=".313W.5/1">12 Mechanised Brigade is a grouping of Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery regiments and supporting units, together with many supporting cap badges that are based throughout the country. The major units are stationed at Aldershot, Pirbright and Tidworth.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/2">The Brigade is an integral part of the Formation Readiness Cycle (FRC). As such, it spends one year providing troops for standing operations, one year in intensive training for war fighting, and on year as the Army's High Readiness Mechanised Brigade. During the High Readiness Year, the Brigade is liable for short-notice deployments in response to emerging crisis throughout the world. Under the FRC, elements of 12 Mechanised Brigade are already deployed: the Welsh Guards are in the Balkans, and Brigade Headquarters and 228 Signal Squadron, as well as 1 Battalion the Staffordshire Regiment (Armoured Infantry Battalion) will deploy to Kosovo (Operation AGRICOLA) between November 2002 and May 2003. The Brigade routinely requires augmentation from individuals or formed sub-units to meet the particular requirements of the roles it performs.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/3">Currently, 12 Mechanised Brigade's strength is 2,773 personnel; 98 per cent of its required liability of 2,824 personnel. There are no specific recruitment drives aimed at manning 12 Mechanised Brigade, however, action is being taken in a wide range of areas with the aim of increasing Army recruiting, both for officers and soldiers, co-ordinated by the Army Training and Recruiting Agency's Recruiting Group. Indeed, from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, 93 Regimental Recruiting Teams (RRTs), encompassing existing RRTs and the former Mobile Display Teams, staffed by Field Army personnel have been in operation.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.8/2">Pay As You Dine (PAYD) trials are to be progressively launched at 10 military sites within Great Britain over the next eight months. The first two trials will begin at Hyde Park Barracks, London (target start early September 2002) and HMS Seahawk, Helston, Cornwall (target start by the end of September 2002). A start date for the third trial at RAF Henlow, Bedfordshire has not yet been finalised, but is expected to be towards the end of October 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.8/5">Negotiations with industry about launching trials at these remaining sites will not begin until the first two trials are successfully underway, so it is not possible to be precise about start dates, but the aim is to have all ten trials running by April 2003.</p>

Annington Homes Ltd is a commercial organisation, and I would suggest that my hon Friend contacts them directly for information about their financial arrangements. DHE also acquires a proportion of its new housing stock through Public Private Partnership arrangements for which its partners do raise funds on the commercial market.</p>

Under the WPS, War Disablement Pensions or Gratuities would not be awarded in cases where the level of disability is assessed at 0 per cent. Under the AFPS, a Service Attributable Pension would similarly not be paid for conditions where the level of disability is assessed at 0 per cent. Service Invaliding Pensions may be in payment for attributable conditions at 0 per cent. but we could only establish the numbers involved by a review of individual files.

	<p pid=".320W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence does not recognise &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; as a medical condition. It accepts that some veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict have become ill and that many believe this ill health is unusual and related to their Gulf experience. A large number of multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms have been reported by some Gulf veterans as well as recognised medical conditions. The overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or &quot;syndrome&quot;. With the exception of certain infectious diseases that are notifiable by statute, primary care doctors in England and Wales do not report centrally illnesses experienced by their patients. Therefore, the MOD is not able to assess the number of Gulf veterans in the Portsmouth, South constituency who have reported illnesses to their doctors. MOD is advised of cancer registrations in England, Wales and Scotland. We have published data on the incidence of cancer-related deaths in Gulf veterans as compared to a comparable group of Service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf. Gulf veterans who wish to be examined by a physician expert in Gulf veterans' illnesses can be referred by their doctors to the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP) which is funded by the MOD. As of <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-18">18 July 2002</phrase>, 16 Gulf veterans had been seen at the GVMAP who were recorded as living in the Portsmouth, South constituency. Of these 12 were assessed as well at the time of their consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".323W.8/1">The White Paper on the Strategic Defence Review: A New Chapter, Cm5566, addressed this issue (paragraphs 31&ndash;32 and 91). Since the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) was published in 1998 the risk of large scale conflict in Europe has further reduced, and relations with Russia have seen a step change improvement. But we have also routinely deployed our Armed Forces on more operations concurrently than we envisaged in the SDR, though the scale of these deployments has been in some respects smaller than we envisaged at the time of the SDR. That has created the risk of overburdening key enabling units, who are essential for all expeditionary deployments (for example, communicators, engineers and movements personnel).</p>

	<p pid=".324W.2/1">Discussions on this broad ranging topic take place routinely both bilaterally and in multilateral fora. We recognise the importance of such co-operation, and are engaged in a number of initiatives in Europe aimed at paving the way for more effective defence industrial co-operation, improving the management of co-operative equipment projects, as well as identifying further opportunities to co-operate where it makes military, industrial and economic sense to do so. Specifically in the defence manufacturing co-operation field, along with our colleagues in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden, we signed the Letter of Intent Framework Agreement in July 2000 related to measures to facilitate the restructuring and operation of the European defence industry. This Agreement represents a commitment by the six nations to remove obstacles to industrial restructuring and co-operation. All six nations, in conjunction with industry, continue to implement the Agreement.</p>

Warrior is also due to receive a major upgrade in 2010 which will result in a new turret, an improved cannon and a more sophisticated gun control system.</p>

Many other Task Group warships will also include air defence assets for self protection and decoy systems against air and surface launched anti-ship missiles.

	<p pid=".328W.9/1">The United Kingdom military aircraft sector is efficient, innovative and highly competitive, and with these qualities it has very strong potential for success in the future. Given the importance of the industry for the supply of equipment to our Armed Forces, not to mention its role as a significant employer, the Government has of course a close interest in its success. The industry already benefits from a large programme of Ministry of Defence work on projects including JSF, Eurofighter, Nimrod, A400M and Apache. Future programmes such as the Future Strategic Transport Aircraft project are also likely to result in a significant programme of work for UK companies. And we will continue to take industrial factors into account within the medium of our competitive procurement policy.</p>
	<p pid=".328W.9/2">The Government is committed to investing in defence research and technology in partnership with industry, which is crucial in sustaining a viable and competitive industrial base long-term, while focusing more effectively on areas where we achieve best return and where UK industry can be world class. We have also recently extended the tax breaks that are available to companies investing in research and technology.</p>
	<p pid=".328W.9/3">We will also continue to pursue vigorously the importance of liberalising defence trade and technology flows between our allies.

	<p pid=".329W.2/1">Since February 1999 the Ministry of Defence has conducted research into the feasibility of introducing a ground-to-ground target identification system. As a result we have successfully demonstrated a Battlefield Target Identification Device (BTID): We are now fully engaged with our NATO allies as part of the US-led Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrator programme, which aims to develop a joint coalition concept of operations and to demonstrate interoperability amongst national BTID prototype solutions. A decision on whether to introduce a ground-to-ground target identification system has yet to be made.</p>

	<p pid=".329W.5/2">The cost of the Tracer programme to the United Kingdom to the end of June was some &pound;120 million. By the time the assessment phase contract is concluded at the end of July 2002 we expect to have spent a further &pound;11 million. Although in October 2001 the Ministry of Defence agreed with the United States DoD not to proceed beyond the assessment phase with this collaborative programme, we expect to apply directly the technical maturity and military utility of a number of key armoured vehicle technologies to the Future Rapid Effect System programme.</p>

	<p pid=".342W.2/2">&pound;191.2 million for drugs misuse treatment services has been allocated to health authorities (HAs) in 2002&ndash;03, this represents an increase of &pound;51.5 million or 36.9 per cent. over 2001&ndash;02, through the pooled treatment budget.</p>
	<p pid=".342W.2/3">Allocations to HAs in 2002&ndash;03 for drugs misuse treatment services through the pooled treatment budget were informed by a new weighted capitation formula. This formula weights populations of 15&ndash;44 year olds for utilisation rates by age and sex, additional need and the market forces factor. All HAs received an increase of at least 30 per cent. over their allocation for 2001&ndash;02. The Department provided indicative allocations to drug action team level, but the final decision on allocations lies with the HA.</p>
	<p pid=".342W.2/4">It should also be noted that additional funding from mainstream health budgets, social services community care budgets and the treatment element of the arrest referral scheme budget are allocated for drug treatment services at local level.</p>

	<p pid=".343W.3/1">In May 2002, we welcomed the publication of the Government funded national sentinel audit of epilepsy-related death. The audit looked at investigations into epilepsy deaths, care provided prior to death and contact with bereaved families. We have given a commitment to consider in full the recommendations of the audit and to develop an action plan later this year to address the key issues. It will need to take account of and feed into a range of other initiatives including the national service framework for long term conditions (NSF), which will have a focus on neurological conditions such as epilepsy. We expect to meet with the epilepsy voluntary organisations shortly, and will consult with others as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/2">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a summary report of the audit. The publication draws the attention of local National Health Service clinicians and organisations to the need to establish or review policies and practices regarding the management of epilepsy and epilepsy related deaths.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/3">The Department is also undertaking a range of other initiatives to improve services for the care and management of people with epilepsy. For example, we have:</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/4" class="indent">Asked NICE to develop a clinical guideline, due in summer 2004, for the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy to help address widespread variations in clinical practice and contribute to the improvement of services. This will be supported by a technology appraisal, due autumn 2003, of the clinical and cost effectiveness of new anti-epileptic drugs in children and adults, to help promote appropriate uptake and equitable access.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/5" class="indent">Announced that the NSF for long term conditions is expected to develop standards of care for specific neurological conditions, including epilepsy. The NSF is currently planned for publication in 2004 and implementation is expected to start from 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/6" class="indent">Developed the expert patients programme, which aims to provide training in self-management skills for people with long term chronic conditions. The first pilot phase will include people with epilepsy.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/7" class="indent">Provided funding to the Joint Epilepsy Council (JEC) to develop its <i>National Statement of Good Practice for the Treatment and Care of People who have Epilepsy</i>, which was published in May 2002. The statement makes a series of recommendations for good quality epilepsy services. It is intended to facilitate commissioning and will be of use to NHS purchasers, providers and service users.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/8" class="indent">Provided funding to the National Society for Epilepsy for its <i>Living Well</i> Project. The project aims to promote independent living by providing locally based short-term courses for people with epilepsy to develop self-help and self-management techniques.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/9">Local health and social care organisations are responsible for planning and providing services for people with epilepsy, including the frequency of contact. The recently announced budget settlements for the NHS, representing an annual average increase of 7.5 per cent. above inflation over the five years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08, and personal social services (PSS), representing an annual average increase of 6.0 per cent. above inflation over the three years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06, will provide the investment needed to support the services which best meet patients' and users' needs.</p>

	<p pid=".344W.2/2">The Department fully supports the need for an increase in the number of neurologists. Recommendations by the medical workforce review team are for the numbers of consultants in neurology to grow by some 50 per cent. by 2010, from 326 in 2001 to 496 in 2010, and some of those consultants may choose to specialise in epilepsy.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.2/3">There are already about 100 epilepsy specialist nursing posts which have been developed in both hospital and community settings. Primary care trusts will be able to decide about the level of future demand in this area. They are best placed to understand local health needs and commission services to meet them.</p>

	<p pid=".346W.5/1">Increasing participation in sport and physical recreation has an important role to play in raising the rates of physical activity and improving public health. The importance of physical activity is recognised in the NHS Plan and national service frameworks. The national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD) requires the National Health Service, working closely with local authorities, to develop local programmes of effective policies on increasing physical activity.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.5/2">The Health Development Agency has issued guidance to support the preventive aspects of the NSF for CHD. The document contained examples of effective interventions and set out who should be involved in the development of these programmes, including sport and leisure partners. Last year, we also published a national quality assurance framework for exercise referral systems. These schemes rely on close liaison and partnership working between health and leisure professionals.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.5/3">We recently announced the launch of a new &pound;2.5 million programme on exercise, which is being developed with Sport England and the Countryside Agency. The work forms part of a partnership between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health. The money will be used to set up nine pilots, based in neighbourhood renewal areas, which will test out different community approaches, including sports and active recreation projects, to increasing physical activity.</p>

Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget statement on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-17">17 April 2002</phrase> announced unprecedented annual average increases for the National Health Service in England of 7.3 per cent. per annum over five years from 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08, on the basis of stage 1 resource budgeting. This is the level of increase recommended by the Wanless report under its &quot;fully engaged&quot; scenario.

Potential suppliers must first submit an expression of interest in response to the 37-day advertisement in the <i>Official Journal</i> of European Communities and must accompany that expression with evidence requested by the contracting organisation. From those who satisfy this first stage, tenders would be invited from some or all, and a period of 40 days is usually allowed for potential bidders to submit bids.

	<p pid=".353W.0/2">The UK Standard Clinical Products Reference Source will comprise four distinct elements. Of these, two are already in production: The SNOMED CT drug core, under the terms of the contract between the Department and the College of American Pathologists, and the primary care drug dictionary, on behalf of the Department by the prescription pricing authority.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.0/3">The remaining two elements are the secondary care drug dictionary and the medical devices dictionary. I can confirm that the maintenance of both these dictionaries will be undertaken in accordance with public procurement European Union and <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities regulations and with the National Health Service information authority's procedures for the letting of contracts.</p>

The report considers the potential risk reduction, costs and practicability of a range of further precautionary measures against the theoretical risk of BSE in sheep. Estimates provided by the Meat and Livestock Commission, one of the stakeholders on the group, indicate that the turnover of the sheep sausage casings sector is &pound;24 million per annum, and that the loss of income to licensed abattoirs from the sales of sheep intestine to the sausage casings industry would be approximately &pound;6.5 million per annum. No analysis has been made of the compensating increase in turnover for other suppliers that could arise if other sausage casings were to be substituted for those made from sheep intestines.</p>

However, the FSA continues to advise that it is sensible to wash fruit and vegetables before eating for reasons of general food hygiene.</p>
	<p pid=".356W.5/2">This follows the FSA's request to the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) to reconsider the then Deputy Chief Medical Officer's (CMO) advice to consumers about washing and peeling fruit and vegetables in relation to pesticide residues. The ACP assured the Agency and the Department that there are no active substances currently in use where an assumption about the need for washing and peeling was made as part of their approval. The ACP concluded that washing or peeling fruit and vegetables is not required as a protection against pesticide residues and this effectively supersedes the old advice.</p>
	<p pid=".356W.5/3">The FSA's advice is that when pesticide residues are found in fruit and vegetables, in the vast majority of cases they do not give rise to any health concerns. Where, very occasionally a residue is found which could lead to the acceptable daily intake for the pesticide concerned being exceeded the FSA demands immediate action to remove that risk.</p>

	<p pid=".358W.11/1">The Government have revised and widely distributed their child protection guidance <i>Working Together to Safeguard Children.</i> This document sets out how all agencies and professionals should work together to promote children's welfare and protect them from abuse and neglect. It is addressed to those who work in the health and education services, the police, social services, the probation service, and others whose work brings them into contact with children and families. All those who work with children and families are expected to retain a clear focus on the welfare of the child and be alert to, and know how to respond quickly and decisively to, potential indicators of abuse and neglect. This greater awareness should make it easier for children to be heard when they report abuse and neglect.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.11/2">In addition, a range of new mechanisms have been introduced that make it easier for children to report abuse and neglect. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".358W.11/3" class="indent">the appointment of the first ever Children's Rights Director for England&mdash;Roger Morgan&mdash;to act as a powerful champion for some of the most vulnerable children in our country, and to monitor and review the effectiveness of the arrangements in relation to dealing with complaints and representations made by, or on behalf of, children about regulated children's services.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.11/4" class="indent">the Education Act 2002, which places a statutory requirement on Local Education Authorities and the governing bodies of schools and further education institutions to have arrangements to ensure that their functions are exercised with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, and to have regard to guidance issued by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State when drawing up those arrangements. These new duties will reinforce schools' responsibility to have effective arrangements for identifying and responding to signs of neglect and abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.11/5" class="indent">the participation of children and young people in day to day decision making as a key principle underpinning the Government's <i>Quality Protects</i> Programme. Objective 8 of the Government's objectives for children's social services says that local authorities should enhance the involvement of young people in the planning and delivery of services, and in decisions which affect their daily lives, including giving children and young people access to independent advocacy services and mechanisms for speeding up the complaints procedure.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.11/6">The Government are also providing funding to ChildLine, which was established to listen to children and young people and to offer them counselling, information, support and protection.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.11/7">Area child protection committees are responsible for deciding what child protection information and advice to make available to members of their local community. However, leaflets advising adults what to do when they have concerns about the welfare of a child or that a child may be suffering, or at risk of suffering, abuse or neglect have also been produced on a national basis by a number of voluntary organisations. These include the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's <i>Handle with Care</i> (about the dangers of shaking babies) and <i>Partners in Protecting Children</i>. In addition, there are a number of leaflets which provide advice to children, such as Kidscape's <i>Stop Bullying and You Can Beat Bullying</i>.</p>

Friend on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-04">4 July</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-07-04.571"><i>Official Report</i>, column 571W</phrase> states, we do have information on a wide range of conditions, in particular for deaths and hospital admissions which are coded accorded to the international classification of diseases in line with practice in other countries. These can answer many questions, but where there is not a specific code for the condition this is not possible. In the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy this is included within an overall code for muscular dystrophy and is therefore not separately identifiable. We have no plans for collecting separate data in this area.</p>

This includes the provision of confidential contraceptive advice to under 16s within the established legal framework, the provision of early pregnancy testing and non-judgmental advice and, where abortion is the agreed course, quick referral to National Health Service funded abortion services in line with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists evidence based guideline The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2000).</p>

	<p pid=".370W.8/1">The independent advisory group on teenage pregnancy was established to provide advice to Government and monitor the success of the national teenage pregnancy strategy. The group includes a membership drawn from a wide range of individuals and organisations with experience of working with young people and teenage parents. The first annual report of the group set out forty-nine recommendations to Government on the further delivery of the national strategy. The Government response addresses these recommendations to set out a forward action plan for the next phase of delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.8/2">In addition to the independent advisory group, the teenage pregnancy unit has put in place arrangements to consult and involve the non-statutory sector, faith groups, relevant professional organisations, regional and local teenage pregnancy co-ordinators, young people and parents in tackling teenage pregnancy. The views of these organisations and individuals were taken into account in developing the Government response.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.2/1">The Government's position on conscientious objection to abortion remains unchanged. Section 4 of the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, provides that, except where treatment is necessary to save the life of or prevent grave permanent injury to the pregnant woman,</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;no person shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement, to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection.&quot;</p>

Doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion should make their views known to the patient and enable the patient to see another doctor without delay if that is the patient's wish.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/4">The General Medical Council (GMC) booklet &quot;Good Medical Practice&quot; states that general practitioners' views about a patient's lifestyle or beliefs must not prejudice the treatment they provide or arrange. If they feel their beliefs might affect the treatment, this must be explained to the patient who should be told of their right to see another doctor. Breach of this guidance may expose a doctor to a charge of serious professional misconduct and disciplinary action by the GMC.</p>

In the absence of the patient's consent, and if the treatment falls within the provisions of Section 58, the doctor in charge of the patient's treatment will request a second opinion to certify the treatment proposed.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.5/2">The SOAD must decide whether the patient is in fact refusing the treatment or incapable of making a decision on it and whether the treatment should be given. The SOAD acts as an individual and must come to his or her own independent opinion as to whether or not the treatment is a reasonable one.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.5/3">In order to form his or her own opinion the SOAD is statutorily obliged to consult with a nurse and another non-nursing/medical professional, both of whom have been professionally concerned with the patient's medical treatment. The SOAD should also interview the patient in private and the doctor in charge of the treatment as well as considering the medical notes and statutory detention documents.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.5/4" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> Section 58 relates to the administration of the following forms of treatment in the absence of consent: Electro-Convulsive Therapy at any time; and Medication for mental disorder if three months or more have elapsed since the first administration of medication.</p>

	<p pid=".382W.2/1">Significant action has been taken at both national and local levels to tackle the problem of violence as part of the cross-Government National Health Service zero tolerance zone campaign. Many NHS trusts have taken the opportunity to launch local campaigns with a focus on specific areas of concern.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.2/2">Recent surveys conducted in the NHS indicate that almost all NHS trusts have now published policies for reducing the incidence of violence, and also provide evidence that a wide range of measures are being introduced by employers to tackle this problem. These include the installation or upgrading of hospital CCTV systems, other changes to the physical environment and the provision of safety awareness training to staff. Many trusts have also reviewed the support available to staff when violent incidents do occur.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.2/3">For the first time ever, new money has been allocated specifically to support the efforts of managers and staff in tackling violence in the NHS. The new funding is expected to be matched by employers, which means that over the three years over &pound;3 million will be invested in new initiatives to protect staff. The money is supporting a range of initiatives from making improvements to risk assessment process to the purchase of personal alarms. In 2001&ndash;02, over &pound;791,110 central funding has been invested to support 173 new local measures to protect staff.</p>

	<p pid=".385W.2/2">All the statutory regulations are immediately accessible on the Department's website and the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) internet website. The Care Homes Regulations were published in December 2001 following extensive consultation and were immediately placed on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.2/3">The NCSC wrote to all pre-existing care homes on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-08">8 March 2002</phrase> with a guide to the application of the Care Standards Act. The guide included general information about legal requirements, including the requirement for care homes to obtain criminal records checks on staff. The guide included addresses for obtaining more information. The guide also included an application form for providers to apply for the relevant national standards document. Each set of national standards includes the appropriate regulations at the back.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.2/4">The NCSC sent a registration pack to all unregistered care homes in February 2002 and sends a registration pack to all new applicants. The pack advises applicants to check the legal requirements before submitting their application to the NCSC.</p>
	<p pid=".385W.2/5">In addition, the NCSC wrote to all providers in June reminding them of their obligations. This information can be found on the NCSC's website, which also sets out guidance to help providers manage their staff recruitment until the Criminal Records Bureau is fully meeting its targets. The NCSC has also co-operated with the care homes' umbrella organisations, to arrange for publication of this information on their internal sites.</p>

	<p pid=".388W.8/2">We have issued National Minimum Standards across the range of children's services. The standards for fostering services, which accounts for two thirds of all children in care, state that the carer should be provided with a written health record for each child placed in their care, and that this should be updated during the period of the placement. In addition, before a placement begins, the carer should be provided with as full a description as possible of the health needs of a child and clear procedures governing consent for the child to receive medical treatment. Where it is an agency placement, the responsible authority should pass the information on to the agency, who in turn passes it on to the carer. Similar arrangements apply to those placed in children's homes.</p>

	<p pid=".389W.2/3">The Commission for Social Care Inspection will create a single comprehensive Inspectorate for social care, bringing together the inspection functions of the social services inspectorate, including a number of their function with the Audit Commission, and the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) and including the regulation of social care providers. The NCSC and the social services inspectorate will continue with their existing work until the new body goes live.</p>

Use may reduce or postpone admissions to residential or nursing care and can improve the quality of life for carers.

	<p pid=".392W.8/3" class="indent">The Valuing People Support Team is fully operational and is continuing to develop effective links with Learning Disability Partnership Boards.

	<p pid=".394W.2/4">The <i>Valuing People</i> Support Team is continuing to develop links with local learning disability partnership boards and will also provide information on progress with implementation. A national survey of people with learning disabilities has been commissioned which will describe users' experiences of services and help to identify areas where improvement is needed.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.2/5">The &pound;2 million learning disability research programme will help to improve the evidence base. Projects being funded include ones designed to assess the effects of the <i>Valuing People</i> programme.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.2/6">The learning disability task force's annual report, due later this year, will provide an overview of progress by all partners in the implementation programme and advise on any aspects of implementation where particular action might be required.</p>

	<p pid=".396W.6/2">As part of the Department's commitment to improving access to primary care nationally, we have increased the primary care trust primary care access fund by &pound;83.5 million to &pound;168 million, with at least &pound;48 million dedicated in 2002&ndash;03 to improving access in primary care and implementing advanced access. Richmond and Twickenham Primary Care Trust has received &pound;150,000 from the primary care access fund.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.6/3">In 1997 the Kingston and Richmond Health Authority used improvement grants to fund schemes that improved physical access to surgeries and improved communications with surgeries.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.6/4">From 1998 the new primary care organisations within Richmond and Twickenham began to work with local general practitioners (GPs) to explore new ways of working. Teddington, Twickenham and Hamptons successfully bid to participate in the national primary care collaborative focussing on improved coronary heart disease (CHD) care, improving access to primary care and managing capacity. Funding available for this scheme totalled &pound;149,000 over two years. This has allowed primary care teams to scrutinise the demand on their services and look to manage that demand using a variety of methods including telephone triage/consultations by GPs, nurse triage, changing the skill mix by employing health assistants. A further &pound;110,000 was spent on innovative projects that focused on partnership developments, for example, with the voluntary sector, community pharmacy, to improve access by ensuring that patients were seen by the right professional in the right place.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.6/5">The programme extends from pilot sites and is being extended to the whole of Richmond. Available resources this year are &pound;150,000 and will be spent on further improving access.</p>
	<p pid=".396W.6/6">The primary care organisations continued to support the improvements of physical access to surgeries by investment in for example, induction loops, tactile signage, and ramps. In 2001&ndash;02 at least &pound;220,000 was invested in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".405W.5/1">Since publication of the NHS Plan, patient environment action teams (PEATs) teams have undertaken four rounds of assessment visits to acute NHS trusts each evaluating performance and progress against 19 separate elements. Scores are combined to produce a rating. Each element of the patient environment was scored on a scale of one to four, where one is poor and four is excellent.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.5/2">On the question of weighting; whilst every aspect of the assessment is important, we recognise that patients will see some areas as of greater importance than others. For this reason, in determining the final rating a hospital receives, particular attention is paid to the hospital's performance in areas of ward cleanliness, tidiness and decoration and the condition of ward furniture so that defects in these areas are not masked by good performance in other areas of assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.5/3">The clean hospitals programme has had a clear impact on standards of cleanliness, decoration and supporting services. Hospitals up and down the country have responded magnificently to this, the biggest clean-up campaign in the history of the National Health Service, to the extent that by October last year there were no hospitals in England where cleaning standards were found to be less than acceptable. The latest round of PEAT visits have recently been completed and the results will be available shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.2/1">The Department does not collect information on the number of extended hospital stays as a result of adverse events nor figures on their financial cost. However, as reported in <i>An Organisation with a Memory</i>&mdash;a report of an expert group on learning from adverse events chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, it is estimated that there may be around 850,000 adverse events each year in the National Health Service which research suggests may lead to three million preventable additional hospital bed days. It is estimated that extended hospital stays as a result of adverse events costs the NHS approximately &pound;2 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/2">The Government established the National Patient Safety Agency in July 2001 to improve the safety of NHS patient care by promoting a culture of reporting and learning from adverse events, and to manage the national reporting system to support this function.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/3">By collecting and analysing data on adverse events the agency will be able to identify trends and patterns of avoidable adverse events, provide feedback to organisations to enable them to change their working practices, help develop models of good practice and systems solutions at national level and support ongoing education and learning.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/4">From September 2001 the National Patient Safety Agency ran a pilot in a small sample of trusts designed to test the system for collecting data on adverse incidents and near misses from the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-18">18 June 2002</phrase>, the National Patient Safety Agency held a conference and presented initial findings of the pilot. The results of the data collection are preliminary and few conclusions can be drawn from this data at this stage. The agency will publish audited figures when they are available. The agency will be working to implement a national reporting system across the NHS from 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/6">This will provide us with a firm evidence base on the scale of the problem and its financial consequences&mdash;a baseline allowing us to understand the real extent and nature of adverse events, and act on that knowledge.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/7">The Department has set a specific target which requires the NHS by 2005 to reduce by 40 per cent. the number of serious errors in the use of prescribed drugs. The Department will shortly be publishing a report highlighting processes and individual medicines that are commonly involved in medication errors. The report will also identify a range of measures that professionals and NHS organisations can use to systematically drive down the risk of medication errors across the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.2/8">The Department has broadly welcomed the Audit Commission's report on medicines management in NHS hospitals, <i>A Spoonful of Sugar.</i> Chief pharmacists and their staff play a key part in medicines management and it is helpful to see this role highlighted. The report reinforces the Department's medicines management performance management framework.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.0/1">It is recognised that the manual writing of prescriptions and the manual dispensing of drugs is associated with a significant error rate. Measures to combat this include the following.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.0/2">In primary care technologies are already in place within general practitioner's (GP's) clinical practice system to help identify the risks involved in prescribing of drugs to patients. PRODIGY is a computer-based decision and learning support system contained within the GP practice system, which offers a series of recommendations in prescribing and organisation of treatment for conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.0/3">In secondary care information for health the strategy for information services in the National Health Service recommended the introduction of electronic records into all acute trusts. Electronic prescribing systems were specifically mentioned as part of those electronic records. It is intended by 2008 that all acute trusts will have electronic prescribing systems, most acute trusts by 2005. The use of these systems will lead to a reduction in errors that can occur.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.0/4">In the pharmacy, &quot;Pharmacy in the Future&mdash;Implementing the NHS Plan&quot;, emphasised the need to re-engineer hospital pharmacy services to be more efficient, timely and safe and more patient focussed. Use of modern automation technology was seen as one way of facilitating this. This was reinforced in the Audit Commission report &quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot;. Consideration is currently being given to the commissioning of a national specification for automated dispensary systems for the NHS and earmarking of funding for their introduction.</p>

According to the National Audit Office Summarised Accounts for the National Health Service (2001) a provision of &pound;4.4 billion was calculated for liabilities relating to all current clinical negligence claims and ones which may arise from incidents which have incurred but not yet been reported.

	<p pid=".413W.5/1">The information requested can only be provided at a disproportionate cost. This is because the Department's Parliamentary database does not readily provide this information, which could only be obtained therefore by a manual count of the records. The Department has received over 10,000 written questions this Session so far. Even to perform the calculations on a reasonable sample would incur a disproportionate cost. A new database is being developed for the next session that should be able to provide this kind of management information on a routine basis.</p>
	<p pid=".413W.5/2">The Department fully recognises the need to ensure that hon. Members receive prompt, timely and helpful replies to their questions. Ministers make every effort to ensure that this important instrument of accountability is given the priority that it needs and deserves. Where there are regrettable delays in answering questions this stems from a proper desire to maintain high standards of accuracy and helpfulness in replies. We will, however, continue to strive to make further progress with the equally important yardstick of timeliness.</p>

We are supporting the work of these agencies by contributing significant amounts of funds, including 19.7 per cent. of the C=69.3 million ECHO budget (made up of C=47.8 million to Rep. of Serbia, C=14 million to Kosovo and C=7.5 million to Rep. of Montenegro).</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/2">In addition to this, we are working very closely with the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities on a programme of social and economic reforms that will help to improve the living conditions of the poorest people in the FRY, including refugees and IDPs. We are funding a &pound;3.2 million programme of social policy reforms that will strengthen the delivery of social welfare, health, employment and education services in Serbia. We are also working closely with the World Bank on a major social services adjustment credit that will enable the Serbian authorities to make further progress in these areas.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/3">These plans are described in detail in our Country Strategy Paper for the FRY, which is available in the library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".415W.5/1">Food insecurity in Nepal is severe and is greatest in the hill and mountain regions. There is growing concern over a possible humanitarian crisis emerging in the mid- and far-west regions of Nepal due to the initial failure of this year's monsoon in these areas.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.5/2">The situation is being made worse by the conflict. The Maoists have looted food intended for development programmes, but more seriously the army has imposed food restrictions in at least 8 districts, preventing traders from going into the hills and severely restricting the food individuals can carry. The harvest is already down in these areas because of the late monsoon, and because men did not return from seasonal work in India to take part in planting. Fear of both Maoists and security forces was the key factor. With little accurate information currently available, DFID will support more intensive monitoring by the World Food Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.5/3">As regards water security, access to drinking water is not a major problem though the safety of this water is questionable. DFID is currently supporting programmes to enhance water supply and sanitation across rural Nepal.</p>

	<p pid=".416W.3/1">There are no proposals for a statement on commodity prices at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.3/2">The prices of a number of internationally traded commodities have fallen dramatically in recent years. This has had an effect in producer countries at the household level (e.g. ability to purchase food and medicines) as well as at a higher, national, level (e.g. in terms of foreign exchange earnings, debt repayment ability etc.).</p>
	<p pid=".416W.3/3">Many of the poorest countries, particularly in Africa, remain dependent on a narrow range of commodity exports. We are committed to helping commodity dependent exporting countries reduce their vulnerability to the effects of world commodity prices.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.3/4">The UK, through its development programme and other endeavours at the international level, is supporting a range of actions that seek to expand the trade opportunities of these countries in order to reduce their dependence on primary agricultural commodity exports. Existing trade barriers (including tariff escalation) are a major impediment to this. The UK is not only working to secure reform of international trade rules in general but also to reduce the impact of protectionist regimes such as the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.3/5">There is scope for creating a more favourable domestic environment within commodity dependent countries themselves. This is necessary to generate the economic growth and other conditions that contribute to developing the means by which they can reduce their vulnerability to external shocks such as unfavourable price movements. The UK provides support to a variety of activities in this regard. These range from actions to enable local institutions to become more efficient and innovative, through to securing improvements in the regulatory framework in order to facilitate the development of local enterprises and attract foreign investment.</p>

AITIC is a Swiss NGO which has since 1998 been supporting countries with little or no representation in Geneva by drafting briefing notes on difficult issues, offering a neutral forum for discussion, organising workshops and training seminars, running an &quot;early warning system&quot; on key issues, etc. The UK strongly supports this work and has made a commitment of &pound;1m to support the first phase of AITIC's work as an IGO. This forms part of the UK's overall commitment to allocate &pound;45m (of which &pound;38 million has already been committed) to trade-related capacity-building work between 1998 and 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".419W.0/1">The UNHCR programme in Kenya currently assists a refugee population of over 213,000; 129,000 of whom are Somalis and 70,000 are Sudanese. The cost of the programme was over $25.2 million in 2001 (see table below), and has a budget of $18.1 million in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/2">UNHCR's programme aims to provide international protection and humanitarian assistance to refugees in Kenya while exploring durable solutions to assist refugees, mainly voluntary repatriation to their country of origin.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/3">Unfortunately local integration of refugees is extremely limited, due to limited freedom of movement, access to resources, markets and job opportunities. In addition, continued conflict in refugees' countries of origin seriously limits opportunities for repatriation. As a result, UNHCR's main activities, in cooperation with the Government of Kenya (as well as WFP, UNICEF and UNESCO), have been in providing asylum for refugees by guaranteeing their legal protection and physical security; as well as offering income generating activities, refugee employment, education, vocational training and healthcare. UNHCR also offers assistance to refugees who wish to voluntarily repatriate themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/4">The hon. Lady's second question asked if the Secretary of State will make a statement on the UNHCR's resettlement policy in East Africa, with specific reference to Kenya.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/5">UNHCR's resettlement policy in East Africa, as elsewhere, is to help refugees with particular refugee needs and concerns over repatriation and local integration, to seek asylum in third countries. DFID has not discussed resettlement with UNHCR, the Kenyan Government or refugees.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/6">The hon. Lady's third question asked what links the Secretary of State's Department has with the UNHCR offices in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/7">DFID contributed &pound;550,000 in 2000&ndash;01 and a similar amount in 2001&ndash;02 to UNHCR's programme in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/8">DFID staff based in London and Nairobi undertook a monitoring mission on the UNHCR Kenya programme in January 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/9">The hon. Lady's fourth question asked what discussions the Secretary of State's Department has had with (a) the UNHCR, (b) the Kenyan Government and (c) refugees in Kenya regarding the resettlement of refugees in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/10">Both DFID and BHC officials in Nairobi are in regular contact with UNHCR Kenya. We continue to monitor closely the refugee situation in the established camps and the border areas of Kenya through regular dialogue with UNHCR officials and other concerned agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/11">The hon. Lady's fifth question asked what action the Secretary of State has taken to counter corruption in the Kenyan offices of the UNHCR.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/12">Allegations of corruption in UNHCR's offices in Kenya led to the security section of UNHCR undertaking an investigation in December 1999. The report, issued in June 2000, did not substantiate the allegations but recommended further investigation take place. While UNHCR branch officers in Nairobi were following up the allegations, threats were made against three officers. This led to the Inspector General of UNHCR calling in the UN Office of Investigation and Oversight Services (OIOS) in October 2000 to conduct an investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/13">The findings of the OIOS investigation suggested that outside expertise was needed. Hence in December OIOS approached 4 donor governments (including the UK) to provide qualified staff to participate in an international investigation task force. DFID provided (on secondment) the services of a Detective Chief Inspector. The UK cost of this secondment was &pound;13,117. Overseas costs were met by UNHCR.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.0/14">The hon. Lady's sixth question asked if the Secretary of State will provide a breakdown of the UNHCR's spending in Kenya.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.2/2">The human rights situation in Rwanda has improved for the majority of individuals since 1997. The establishment of the Human Rights Commission and the Commission for National Unity and Reconciliation are evidence of the Government of Rwanda's commitment to eliminating human rights abuses and to the reconciliation process. The Government have held successful local level elections in 2001 supported by DFID, but the end of the transitional period brings new challenges as Rwanda moves towards full national elections in 2003.

	<p pid=".421W.8/16">We are currently developing a partnership with the Ethiopian Government and as part of this process we are formulating our Country Assistance Plan for Ethiopia. Our Plan will be based on the Ethiopian Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which includes a commitment to good governance. We are considering support through our programme for Civil Service Reform and capacity building of local government. We also have a Partnership Fund, which has the objective of increasing awareness, accountability and responsiveness of government to the public and civil society.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.8/20">Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which has been signed by Ethiopia, is monitored by the Committee of the Rights of the Child, who examine reports submitted by States' such as Ethiopia. Under the CRC, UNICEF has a legal obligation to promote and protect child rights by supporting the work of the Committee. DFID has been supporting UNICEF to increase its capacity to apply human rights principles and the provisions of the Convention in the design and implementation of its programmes. UNICEF has been testing out rights-based programming in East Africa including Ethiopia. DFID is also funding a project to rehabilitate street children into their communities and to raise awareness of children's issues in Addis Ababa.</p>

	<p pid=".423W.0/1">My Department funded the International Planned Parenthood Federation's (IPPF) European Network to provide technical assistance to the Russian Family Planning Association (RFPA) from March 1995 to June 2002. The purpose of our support has been to ensure that accurate information about reproductive health is disseminated in Russia, through the leadership of the RFPA. The total value of funding provided to IPPF during this period has been &pound;390,000, over two project phases. Annual expenditure since 1997 has been as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".423W.0/2" class="indent">FY 1997&ndash;1998&mdash;&pound;23,567</p>
	<p pid=".423W.0/3" class="indent">FY 1998&ndash;1999&mdash;&pound;39,001</p>

	<p pid=".423W.0/7" class="indent">FY 2002&ndash;2003&mdash;&pound;55,000 (expected)</p>
	<p pid=".423W.0/8">My Department spent approximately &pound;206 million on sexual and reproductive health in financial year 2001&ndash;02. My Department's expenditure on this project in that year therefore represents less than 0.07 per cent. of annual expenditure. The RFPA is a non-governmental organisation, based in Moscow. My Department reviewed this project in January 2002 and concluded that its purpose was likely to be largely achieved. No further assistance to the RFPA is planned.</p>

	<p pid=".426W.3/1">Deforestation is a serious problem in many countries but it affects people in different ways and is not always harmful. It is driven by many factors that vary in nature and scale from place to place. Some of these factors, such as unsustainable timber extraction, are linked to the forest sector while others, such as agricultural and energy policies, lie outside the forest sector.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.3/2">Each country has a particular set of circumstances, in terms both of the direct and underlying causes of deforestation and of the scope for action in addressing them.

We have also supported work by the Intergovernmental Forum on Forest on the underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation.</p>

The UK will continue to play its part in meeting urgent humanitarian needs.

	<p pid=".428W.2/1">My Department continues to monitor closely the humanitarian situation in Angola, which remains serious. Millions of Angolans are living under life threatening conditions and humanitarian agencies are working at full capacity to alleviate the worst aspects of the humanitarian crisis in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.2/2">We recently contributed &pound;1 million to the 2002 United Nations Inter Agency Consolidated Appeal for Angola to ensure that critical needs are met and gaps in humanitarian assistance are covered during the sudden onset of emergencies. We also recently contributed &pound;300,000 toward the International Red Cross country appeal for 2002 and &pound;450,000 toward Medecins Sans Frontieres emergency health and sanitation programmes in Kuito, one of the worst effected areas in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.2/3">We are planning to spend some &pound;2 million on humanitarian aid during the current financial year. We are also examining the potential for a specific DFID contribution to assist with the demobilisation of UNITA fighters.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.2/4">Her Majesty's Government remains in close contact with the Government of Angola and international partners. We will remain at the forefront of diplomatic and political efforts to ensure that the internationals system engages effectively with the Government of Angola to deliver humanitarian aid more effectively, so that the peace process is reinforced.</p>

	<p pid=".431W.2/1">The Government are supporting an expanding programme to combat HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland). Part of this involves strengthening South Africa's lead on essential drugs for the South African Development Community, and strengthening the essential drugs programme in South Africa to improve legislation, procurement and pricing for HIV/AIDS and other drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.2/2">We are also taking action at a global level. The Working Group on Access to Medicines, which I chair, is working with the pharmaceutical industry, foundations, developing countries and the World Health Organisation, World Trade Organisation and the European Commission to look at the feasibility of a global differential pricing mechanism for essential medicines. But the Government recognises that affordability is only one of four key factors that influence access to medicines. Others are the need for sustainable financing, the rational selection and use of existing drugs and reliable health and supply systems.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.2/3">On sustainable financing we have pledged $200 million over 5 years to the Global Fund to Fight TB, AIDS and Malaria (GFATM), of which South Africa is already a beneficiary and to which other countries in the region have access. We have also committed over &pound;1 billion since 1997 to strengthening developing countries' health systems, building their capacity both to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection and use of drugs.</p>

	<p pid=".431W.5/1">There are two relevant committees; they cover the EC's PHARE (originally: Poland and Hungary Assistance for the Reconstruction of the Economy) and ISPA (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession) programmes. The mandate of the PHARE Committee is to oversee the implementation of Council Regulation EEC Number 3906 of <phrase class="date" code="1989-12-18">18 December 1989</phrase>, which established PHARE, and its subsequent amendments. The ISPA Committee oversees the implementation of Council Regulation EC Number 1267&ndash;1999, which established ISPA. They determine the strategy framework for PHARE and ISPA, and approve annual and multi-annual allocations to country and regional programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.5/2">The PHARE Committee has met eight times in the last year, the ISPA Committee, three times. The UK is represented by the Department for International Development (DFID) and the UK Permanent Representation to the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.5/3">The annual cost to public funds of the Committee's work principally comprises the work of DFID officials in assessing and discussing with the EC strategy and programme proposals, as well as the costs of attendance at meetings of the Committees. The precise amounts concerned are not readily available.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.5/4">The items most recently considered under the Phare Committee were: the final part of the 2002 National Programme for Slovenia, the OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office) 2002 Multi-Beneficiary Programme and the SIGMA (Support for Improvement in Governance and Management) 2002 Multi-Beneficiary Programme. The ISPA Committee recently considered a range of nineteen environment and seven transport projects across the range of Candidate countries.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.5/5">Pre-accession programmes and/or work related to them are subject to scrutiny by Select Committees of Parliament. Under Council Decision 1999/468/EC the EC has undertaken to publish an annual report on the working of committees. The first such report was deposited in the libraries of both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-26">26 February</phrase> (Commission Document 5685/02). We have encouraged the EC to make available on its website a record of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions.</p>

	<p pid=".433W.2/1">We published a revised strategy for improving the poor performance of the European Community development programme in August 2001, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. We welcome the positive steps that have recently been taken, including establishment for the first time of an EC Development Policy with poverty reduction as the central objective. The Commission are also delegating significant new responsibilities to their offices overseas in order to improve communication with developing country partners and cut delays. The Government is working with other member states, the Commission and the European Parliament to try to ensure that these measures begin to have an impact on the ground and allow the European Community to make a much more significant contribution to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We are also working to try to reach agreement that a much greater share of EC aid should be allocated to low income countries where it will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In 2000, only 38 per cent. of EC aid was spent in low-income countries compared to 70 per cent. in 1990.</p>
	<p pid=".433W.2/2">Our objective is to reverse this decline in order to secure radical improvement in the effectiveness of EC aid. Not all member states, Commissioners or MEPs support this objective.</p>
	<p pid=".433W.2/3">The Government will continue to push for allocations based on developmental needs to countries committed to reducing poverty through all the channels available to us including the 2003 budget negotiations and the revision of the Asia and Latin America Regulation.</p>

	<p pid=".436W.8/1">In Afghanistan women have begun to return to work and girls are going back to school. Two women hold office in the Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) and 11 per cent. of seats in the Loya Jirga are guaranteed for women. The UK is working closely with the AIA and the rest of the international community, to ensuring women's full and effective participation in civil, cultural, economic, political and social life throughout Afghanistan. To date this includes an allocation of $1 million to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) for a programme to support Afghan women's leadership through awareness raising, capacity building and gender mainstreaming; as well as local level, quick impact recovery projects supporting women. We are also providing support directly to the Ministry for Women.</p>

	<p pid=".436W.14/1">At the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Ottawa last November, we raised this concern and asked Bank and Fund staff to revisit the debt sustainability analyses of all commodity dependent low-income countries, including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). The IMF and World Bank analysis, published last month, shows that, although the situation varies from country to country, the external debt indicators for most HIPC countries have deteriorated, and a result several HIPC countries now face unsustainable debt burdens. Following UK pressure, the World Bank and IMF Boards have agreed to provide additional relief countries in this situation. This was reconfirmed at the Spring Meetings last month.</p>

These forecasts take account of all the various factors affecting the countries' economic situation, including the impact of HIV/AIDS, and the need for concessional borrowing to finance their poverty reduction strategies.</p>
