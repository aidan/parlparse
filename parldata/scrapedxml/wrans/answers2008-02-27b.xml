	<p pid="b.1569W.6/1">There are a large number of factors that affect the career progression of women, and how much they earn. These include differences in men and women's labour market experience (for example as a result of women taking time out to look after children), skills and education, occupational segregation, lack of quality part-time work (especially for women returning from maternity leave), historical culture, gender stereotyping, and pay discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.6/2">Research published in 2006 by the Department of Work and Pensions<sup>(1)</sup> tends to support the theory that gender differences in the labour market stem from the division of parental duties (including child care) between mothers and fathers in the home. Research published in the British Social Attitudes survey, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-23">23 January 2008</phrase>, suggests that only one in six men now believe that a woman's place is in the home, compared with one in three in 1989. However the same survey found that 77 per cent. of people with partners say that the woman usually or always does the laundry, a similar proportion to that found in 1994 (81 per cent.). The British Social Attitudes Survey also found that the most liberal division of labour between women and men is found among couples where the woman works full-time, earns more than her partner, or has a partner who does not work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569W.6/3">The Government are working to enable families to have real choices about how they live their lives, including how they balance responsibilities at home and at work. The Government is committed to reducing the inequalities that still exist at home and in the workplace, including reducing the gender pay gap, through the introduction of practical measures across a wide front, for example the encouragement of flexible and good quality part-time working, improved maternity and paternity leave, better access to child care, and introduction of the minimum wage.</p>

	<p pid="b.1570W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-07">7 February 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1570W.2/2">The gender pay gap for full-time public sector workers (based on the median) was 10.2 per cent. in 2007 compared to 20.0 per cent. in the private sector. In 1997 the figures were 13.5 per cent. and 23.8 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1570W.2/3">Closing the pay gap between men and women in both the public and private sectors is a high priority for us, as Harriet Harman made clear in my statement to Parliament on women's priorities last July. We see it as an essential part of enabling families to have real choices about how they live their lives, because the pay gap plays such a large part in the unequal division of labour in the home, preventing fathers from playing a more active role in their children's early years and preventing women from fulfilling their opportunities to work. To galvanise this, closing the pay gap is now one of the indicators in the new Equalities Public Service Agreement. This will help to build on other practical measures we have introduced, such as: giving the parents of young, or disabled, children and the carers of adults the right to request flexible working, and providing more access to child care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1570W.2/4">In the field of local government, we have issued &pound;500 million of capitalisation directions to 46 local authorities in the current financial year (which enables those authorities to treat equal pay costs as capital expenditure, which they can then borrow against) to enable them to make equal pay back-payments. The Minister for Local Government confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-05">5 February</phrase> that the Government will continue to support councils through a further equal pay capitalisation round in 2008-09. Capitalisation can only be used by local authorities to meet equal pay back-payments, and not for any other costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1570W.2/5">Through the Equality Act 2006, which came into effect in April 2007, we also introduced a general duty on public authorities to promote gender equality and eliminate unlawful discrimination and harassment. The Act and subsequent legislation also imposed specific duties on certain listed public authorities, including central and local government, which include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1570W.2/6" class="indent">drawing up and publishing a gender equality scheme every three years, which shows what authorities plan to do to improve gender equality (including the gender pay gap), and how they will do this. In drawing up such a scheme, authorities must gather relevant information and data, and consult employees and stakeholders to identify specific gender equality objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1570W.2/7" class="indent">ensuring that the impact of new legislation, policies, employment and service delivery changes on men and women is assessed. These assessments must also be published.</p>

	<p pid="b.1572W.7/1">Table 1 gives the number of persons charged for possession and supply of cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, amphetamine and cannabis for 2005-06 and 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/2">The court datasets do not hold information on the number of prosecutions and convictions for different drug types as these do not constitute separate offences by legislation. It is possible, however, to determine the class of drug. Table 2 outlines this information for the number of prosecutions and convictions for possession, possession with intent to supply unlawfully and the unlawful supply of illegal drugs. Data cover the calendar years 2005 and 2006 (the latest available years) and are collated on the principal offence rule; so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/3">It is not possible to reconcile PSNI data routinely on the number of persons charged with offences and prosecution and conviction data as PSNI data denote each offence as it has been initially recorded and this may differ from the offence for which a suspect or suspects are subsequently proceeded against in the courts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1578W.0/6" class="indent">In 2003, when a stake in QinetiQ was being sold to the Carlyle Group, the Aquilla and Chertsey sites had already been identified as surplus to QinetiQ's business requirements. QinetiQ's obligation to pay the proceeds to the Department were set out in the Aquilla and Chertsey loan note.

	<p pid="b.1578W.0/7" class="indent">I am unable to comment on the likely future receipts from clawback as this very much depends on the future use of sites by QinetiQ, along with the company's schedule for disposal, the timing and terms and conditions of any sale. MOD officials are aware of two prospective sales at Bincleaves in Weymouth and Eastney in your constituency. This information is in the public domain as a result of planning applications or consultations made by the company.</p>

	<p pid="b.1597W.2/2">We have not undertaken or evaluated research on this subject and have no plans to do so. Many difficulties can emerge following divorce or parental separation and children can be affected in a variety of ways. The Government believe that, where possible, parents should work together to agree contact and residence arrangements themselves and in the best interests of their children. The Children's Plan contains a commitment to improve support during and after family breakdown, including helping children to maintain contact with both parents. Where contact cases come to court, the child's welfare must be the court's paramount consideration. The Children and Adoption Act 2006 has extended the maximum duration of Family Assistance Orders from six to 12 months. This will expand the potential support that CAFCAS8 can provide in assisting families to respect agreements over contact The other provisions in the 2006 Act, when implemented, will give the courts more flexible powers in contact cases, including introducing contact activities, monitoring court-ordered contact, and new enforcement powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1598W.2/18">This includes cases received which were not subsequently considered to fall within the housing ombudsman's remit and those which were dealt with using mediation and other forms of dispute resolution. The HOS deals with most disputes in a conciliatory manner, using a range of alternative forms of dispute resolution as well as working with landlords and tenants through prevention initiatives to sustain and improve their relationship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1598W.2/19">Formal investigations account for a minority of the work considered by the housing ombudsman. The average percentage of investigations into cases over the 10-year period has been 14 per cent., of which 27 per cent. resulted in findings of maladministration and 77 per cent. non-maladministration (although in the latter cases, the ombudsman frequently makes recommendations for improvements to the bodies involved).</p>
	<p pid="b.1598W.2/20">The number of cases considered by the HOS has increased over the last 10 years. The number of properties within the housing ombudsman's remit has doubled over this period and awareness of the service and that of member landlords' own complaints procedures has increased resulting in the higher volume of complaints submitted to the HOS.</p>

	<p pid="b.1599W.8/1">The target for the number of new homes to be built in local authority areas is stated in the relevant regional spatial strategy. For the Leicester city council area, this is the regional spatial strategy for the East Midlands (RSS8) adopted in March 2005. However, that document only covers the period to 2021, and only specifies a figure for the former structure plan area of Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutland. That figure is 3,150 homes a year over the period 2001-2021.</p>
	<p pid="b.1599W.8/2">The regional spatial strategy for the East Midlands is under review. That review is intended to cover the period 2001-26 and to apportion housing targets down to the local authority level. The Secretary of State is currently considering the recommendations of the panel report into the examination in public of the East Midlands Regional Assembly's draft, with a view to adopting the strategy with any amendments towards the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1599W.8/3">Neither the adopted 2005 regional spatial strategy nor the emerging review includes targets for the size of housing to be delivered. This is because it is not Government policy for the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to determine the size of housing that should be built in local authority areas. Instead, Government policy on planning for housing which is set out in Planning Policy Statement 3 requires local planning authorities to state the proportions of market housing demand likely to arise from multi-person households including families with children, and to specify the size and type of affordable housing required in particular areas, through their local development frameworks.</p>

	<p pid="b.1619W.12/1">The ban on burying fallen stock on-farm was introduced by the EU Animal By-Products Regulation 1774/2002. The Regulation aims to protect public and animal health from any potential risks associated with the burial of fallen stock. It was introduced on a precautionary basis, influenced by evidence provided in a number of scientific opinions from the EU's scientific steering committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.1619W.12/2">The environmental effects of such a ban have not been assessed. However, the voluntary National Fallen Stock scheme, run by the National Fallen Stock Company (NFSCo), operates in a way that encourages as many local operators as possible to collect fallen stock and limits the &quot;carcase miles&quot; travelled.</p>
	<p pid="b.1619W.12/3">The EU Animal By-Products Regulation that imposed the burial ban also provides for the approval of new disposal methods once their effectiveness has been assessed by the European Food Safety Authority. One potential method undergoing research, and in which the NFSCo has taken an interest, is the use of bioreducers. Subject to this research eventually being submitted for, and passing, such an assessment, these may provide a route for on-farm disposal of some fallen stock in the future.</p>

On rare occasions, additional premises such as film sets have been approved using zoo specifications.

	<p pid="b.1621W.2/2">The Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA), in its role as a World and EU Community Reference Laboratory for avian influenza, collaborates at an international level with many leading institutes so that information and expert advice can be shared. In particular, the VLA chairs and leads a working group, which conducts detailed scientific analysis of wild bird surveillance (AIWBS) data on avian influenza from all EU member states; this helps to continually advise and develop the European AIWBS strategy. In addition, the VLA provides direct advice, through its expert consultants, to DEFRA, EU member states, and the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1621W.2/3">The VLA also participates in global projects to improve and continuously develop surveillance strategies with a particular focus on HPAI H5N1. This is achieved via a number of formal partnerships funded through EU projects, and also by close interactions with international organisations such as the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO).</p>
	<p pid="b.1621W.2/4">DEFRA obtains expert advice on the ecology and biology of waterfowl and other wild birds from the Ornithological Expert Panel, which comprises representatives from the major international non-governmental organisations working in this field, along with Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.</p>

With a view to providing additional protection for stocks of bass, I announced last year a review of bass nursery areas and inshore netting restrictions, for the benefit of both inshore recreational and commercial bass fishing. I am also currently consulting on a draft recreational sea angling strategy which considers a package of measures for the development of recreational sea fishing.

	<p pid="b.1621W.8/2"><i> </i>The most recent advice on bass from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea was produced in 2004. This was based on analytical assessments of UK inshore bass stocks and concluded that bass stocks appear to be fished sustainably. Updated assessments have been carried out on behalf of DEFRA by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) in 2006 and 2008. These confirm the earlier assessment and indicate that levels of bass landings by the commercial fishing industry (including the inshore sector) reflect the increase in stock abundance since the mid 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="b.1621W.8/3">Bass are fully mature at eight years and older. Although stock assessments by CEFAS indicate that adult bass are more abundant than historically, large adult bass tend to be less available inshore, where smaller younger bass are more prevalent.</p>

If there is a need to trace specific species or specimens because of conservation fears, then the UK CITES management authority can apply a condition to any certificate which stipulates the seller must inform the management authority of any sale and who the specimen is sold to.

	<p pid="b.1625W.2/1">Departmental policy on fishing vessel decommissioning in the years 2006 to 2008 has been that general decommissioning schemes are not the most effective, nor the fairest way of reducing fleet capacity.

	<p pid="b.1625W.2/2">However, smaller targeted schemes can work when linked with other management measures. For example, the 2007 scheme for South-West beam trawlers was linked to the agreement of a long-term management plan for Western Channel sole.</p>

	<p pid="b.1625W.5/1">Where there is refuse or fly-tipping on public land, then the relevant local authority has a duty to clear it and bear the cost of removal. However, neither the local authority nor the Environment Agency are under any legal obligation to assist with the removal of illegally dumped waste from privately owned land.</p>
	<p pid="b.1625W.5/2">Some authorities are ready to work with landowners to investigate and prosecute repeated incidents of fly-tipping and to tackle specific problems or issues. However, to place a duty on the authorities and the Environment Agency to remove waste from private land would create a fly-tippers' charter. This would encourage illegal dumping rather than tackle the problem. Moreover, such a duty would place significant additional burdens on local authorities and the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1625W.5/3">For these reasons, we do not intend to bring forward proposals that would mean fly-tipped waste on private land is be treated in the same way as on public land.</p>
	<p pid="b.1625W.5/4">Among recent measures that have been introduced, the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 gave courts the power to make an order against anyone convicted of the main offence of illegal waste disposal to pay for costs incurred by a landowner in removing waste that has been illegally deposited.</p>
	<p pid="b.1625W.5/5">DEFRA also sits on the National Fly-tipping Prevention Group which identifies better ways of preventing and tackling fly-tipping on private land by working closely with organisations like the National Farmers Union, the Country Land and Business Association, Network Rail and the National Trust.

	<p pid="b.1632W.8/1">The only source of farm household income data measures income before tax is deducted. The official DWP low income threshold is based on income after tax. One would expect the number below 60 per cent. of the median to be lower after tax as the tax system is designed to reduce some of the inequalities in income. Household income data for rural households are not available so the answer to part <i> (b)</i> is based on working age adults living in low income households. Therefore, the answers given in part <i> (a)</i> and part <i> (b)</i> are not directly comparable. In addition it should be noted that the data used to answer part <i> (a)</i> are based on the English population while those in part <i> (b)</i> are based on incomes in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.1632W.8/3">For the population as a whole, the Government have a preferred measure of &quot;low income&quot; defined as 60 per cent. of the median equivalised income for all UK households after tax. It may be presented either before housing costs or after housing costs. The Farm Business Survey is not able to provide figures for household income net of tax, so farm household incomes cannot be compared directly with the low income threshold. Instead they are compared with a modified low income threshold defined as 60 per cent. of the England median, equivalised income before tax (and before housing costs). This has been calculated from 2004-05 Family Resources Survey data. Table 1 shows that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1632W.8/4" class="indent">i. the mean income for farm households was higher than the national mean but the median income was about the same;</p>
	<p pid="b.1632W.8/5" class="indent">ii. both mean and median farm incomes were lower than for the population of self-employed households; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1632W.8/6" class="indent">iii. 31 per cent. of farm households were below the modified low income threshold (gross before housing costs) in 2005-06 compared with 21 per cent. for all households and 18 per cent. for self-employed households.</p>

	<p pid="b.1643W.5/1">Effective tax rates for gambling products are calculated as: total tax divided by the tax base. Total tax is equal to duty receipts, plus net VAT where applicable (bingo and gaming machines), while the tax base is gross profits (stakes minus winnings i.e. net stakes).</p>
	<p pid="b.1643W.5/2">Most of the information required to make these calculations is from statutory returns to HMRC (supported by data collected by the Gambling Commission).

	<p pid="b.1654W.2/17">The fee charged for a sign language course will vary between colleges and providers, and information on individual courses offered by providers is not held centrally. The fees charged to a learner for a sign language course will be based on the level of funding the college or provider receives from the LSC for that learner, for example whether they are a priority learner. It is therefore not possible to provide an average cost of a sign language course,</p>
	<p pid="b.1654W.2/18">The Government continue to provide full fee remission to learners that fall within the national entitlement categories, i.e. where the learner is in receipt of an income-related benefit and studying on an LSC funded course. Learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities are also a priority for Government funding. The national fee assumption for adult learners who are required to contribute to their learning is 32.5 per cent. for 2006-07 with the public purse meeting the remainder of the costs of the course.</p>

	<p pid="b.1656W.5/1">The Student Loans Company (SLC) is responsible for producing the student loans application forms and guidance. In previous years, the application form has proactively sought the student's consent to share financial information with their HE institution. The SLC share this information with HE Institutions registered with the Higher Education Bursary Scholarship System, so that entitlement to a bursary can be assessed. The Office for Fair Access monitoring shows 12,000 students on full state support have declined to give consent so failing to collect their bursaries, DIUS ministers and officials have therefore worked closely with the SLC to improve the bursary consent arrangements on the 2008-09 student finance application form The introduction of an opt-out clause, giving both the student and their sponsor an opportunity to opt out of consenting for their personal information to be shared with universities for bursary purposes, should increase the numbers of students assessed for and receiving bursaries. Clear guidance states that a decision to opt out of sharing data with universities does not affect entitlement to other forms of student support.</p>

	<p pid="b.1657W.3/1">The Government recognises the benefits that have been demonstrated by the 101 single-non emergency number service in the initial live areas, but it is vital that we target our resources to those areas which will have the greatest impact and which will contribute most to the protection of the public and security of the country. It is on this basis and in the context of significant pressures on resources and competing policing and security priorities, that it was decided not to continue to fund centrally the ongoing operation and roll out of the 101 service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1657W.3/2">However, the Home Office will continue to provide funding for the national 101 infrastructure and will be making the learning and good practice from 101 available, to help enable and encourage local areas to embed the benefits in local services and to develop locally funded 101 services where possible. I welcome the work currently being taken forward to this effect by the Greater London Assembly together with London Councils, individual boroughs and the Metropolitan police in their plans to pilot the 101 service locally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1666W.3/2">Setting a target relating to the seizure of Class A drugs would risk creating perverse incentives by encouraging the pursuit of seizures at the expense of a focus on the criminal networks and markets doing the most harm. We believe that the performance of SOCA is better measured on the basis of the quality of understanding of serious organised crime; the amounts of criminal assets recovered; evidence that criminals are finding the UK a less attractive market; and the quality of SOCA's relationships with others. SOCA reports against these measures in its annual reports.</p>

	<p pid="b.1680W.2/2">BERR have conducted four surveys of flexible working which collected data specifically on employees with caring responsibility. These are the second and third Work-Life Balance Employee Surveys, and the first and second Flexible Working Employee Surveys. Reports on these surveys can be downloaded or ordered from the BERR website:</p>

	<p pid="b.1680W.2/4">The most recent figures, from the 2006 Third Work Life Balance Employee Survey, estimate that 64 per cent. of employees with caring responsibilities for adults either said they were currently working flexibly, or had done so in the last 12 months. This compares with 56 per cent. of all employees.</p>

However, the reports of all social care inspections, with the exception of children's homes, are available on the website of the Chief Inspector and Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted). Reports relating to children's homes are excluded to ensure that inappropriate individuals cannot access the addresses of children's homes and that individual children within those homes cannot be identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.6/3">While the existing legislative framework does not prevent the publication of children's homes reports, the National Care Standards Commission (Registration) Regulations 2001, as amended, currently prohibit the Chief Inspector from publishing that part of her register which includes the address of a children's home. Therefore, when a children's homes report is requested, a copy of a redacted report&mdash;which excludes the address of the home is made available. The Chief Inspector will shortly be launching a consultation to take account of the views of children, service providers and local authorities as to whether children's homes reports should be published on the Ofsted website. We will consider what steps to take, if any, when the findings of that consultation become available.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-13">13 February 2008</phrase> Northamptonshire Local Safeguarding Children Board published the Executive Summary of a Serious Case Review (SGR) into Jessica Randall's death. It found that those procedures which were designed to protect Jessica were never activated, and that the outcome for her might have been different had the various indicators and signs noticed by agencies been acted upon. Every child death is a tragedy and Jessica's particularly so. I do not see, however, any reason at this time for an independent inquiry. The perpetrator of Jessica's murder has been jailed for life and local services have accepted unreservedly the serious case review's conclusions and are committed to implementing the changes necessary to better protect children in the future. That is the best way forward to ensure the lessons of Jessica's short life are fully learnt.</p>

The Dedicated Schools Grant is purely revenue funding and does not include any capital allocation.

	<p pid="b.1689W.5/2">The capital element of allocations, included in the four figures in the following chart, can vary greatly from year to year. This is because capital grants are based on need as well as on pupil numbers, and form part of an expanding capital programme. Capital expenditure at local authority level may occur in a different year to the year of allocation, as it is dependent on a local authority's capital planning arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1690W.0/1">The Department does not collect information on the average length of the school lunch break. Schools are required by law to hold two sessions per day during a school term, with a break in between. But it is for schools to decide how long that break should be. We are aware that some schools have reduced the length of the lunch break for a variety of reasons. But we are also aware that having insufficient time to eat lunch can put pupils off taking a school lunch. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families wrote to schools last year asking them to consider their lunchtime arrangements as a means of improving school lunch take-up. As part of its Million Meals campaign to improve school lunch take-up, the School Food Trust is also working closely with schools to improve lunchtime arrangements, including ensuring that pupils have sufficient time to eat their meal.</p>

	<p pid="b.1690W.3/1">The aim of the OPEN pathfinder was:</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.3/2" class="indent">to rigorously test the system for reliability, appropriateness, ease of use, and integration with schools' financial management systems;</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.3/3" class="indent">to ascertain the user-opinion from a small number of schools using OPEN to determine if it should be made more widely available for schools across England; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.3/4" class="indent">to engage with suppliers to understand functionality and user needs from their perspective when trading with schools, and encourage signup to OPEN.</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.3/5">In order for a greater number of transactions to take place, a greater number of schools' suppliers also need to be available on OPEN for them to transact with. As this was a pathfinder, limited resources were available to engage with the educational supplier marketplace and effort was concentrate on those suppliers nominated by schools that they usually traded with in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.3/6">As such, no savings target was set for the pathfinder phase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.3/7">At present savings are only made in the form of transactional savings, i.e. the amount of time being saved by schools' purchasers compared to that where a 'traditional' transaction (their usual method of purchasing) would have taken place. The process of developing the methodology for savings made on the price of goods being purchased is still under development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1690W.3/8">Due to the limited number of suppliers on OPEN during this pathfinder phase, the Department expected rates would be lower than could be reasonably expected with full take-up by both schools and suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1698W.2/1">A forced marriage is a marriage conducted without the full consent of both parties and where duress is a factor. It is a human rights abuse and is not sanctioned by any culture or religion. In an arranged marriage both parties consent of their own free will, and so arranged marriages are legal. We have encouraged schools through guidance to make available information about helplines and access to support for students who might be the subject of forced marriage. Following recent concerns that information was not being provided to students, my Department is looking into this issue, jointly with the Forced Marriage Unit. We will report back to the House in March.</p>

'Aiming high for young people: a ten year strategy for positive activities', which was published in July 2006, announced the launch of a new programme of capital investment based on the reinvestment of unclaimed assets from dormant bank accounts and &pound;60 million of new DCSF funding.

The two funds which are designed to work in tandem and are spent at young people's discretion are allocated through local authorities. The YCF can be used to provide new or improving existing facilities and equipment. This investment will continue over the next three years up to 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.1701W.0/19">The expenditure is shown as a percentage of the Department's net resource outturn, as given in the departmental resource accounts published for each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1701W.0/20">The figures include the costs of duty travel, for officials based in the UK and overseas, and the costs of travel for UK based staff and their families on their arrival at and departure from post, as well as leave journeys undertaken whilst at post.</p>
	<p pid="b.1701W.0/21">The recent increase in expenditure can be attributed in part to the increased number of staff based in posts in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the costs of travel out of the country are high. Another contributory factor is that some travel payments which were formerly paid as allowances to staff are now paid from the travel budget. It is not possible to provide further detail without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1702W.9/2">Currently, the FCO's preferred suppliers for vehicles, used by its heads of posts, are Jaguar for saloon cars and Land or Range Rover where four wheel drive capability is essential. This arrangement is supported by central contracts with those companies, which have been negotiated against strict value for money criteria. Posts which consider that there are overriding reasons on either value for money, security or maintenance grounds not to purchase flag cars manufactured by our preferred suppliers must submit a detailed case for ministerial approval.</p>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has concerns about some criminal investigations by the police which appear politically motivated, the treatment of detainees, the use of corporal punishment and inconsistent sentencing policy. Freedom for the media and political activists has improved noticeably over the last two years, but concerns remain. The first multi-party elections, scheduled for later in 2008, will be the first real test for these developments.</p>

However, in the course of their normal duties, including attendance at international conferences, some Government officials and scientists did have contact with South African counterparts who were subsequently identified as having worked on Project Coast. When allegations of UK assistance to Project Coast emerged, full investigations were held.

And under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929, it is an offence for any person intentionally to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive. Injury to a foetus, if proved, is likely to be treated in law as an injury to the mother and prosecutable under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

This is because of constraints imposed by the need to provide separate accommodation for different classes of prisoner, i.e. by sex, age, security category, conviction status, single cell risk assessment and due to geographical distribution of prisons and prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="b.1721W.0/1">The information requested as set out in the table is subject to important qualifications. The Prison Service Incident Reporting System processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The numbers provide a good indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute. Assault data are complex and may include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact incidents and allegations. Information on assault incidents may involve more than one assaulter or more than one victim. In a proportion of incidents only the victim is known.</p>
	<p pid="b.1721W.0/2">Assault information is recorded at establishment level in four categories:</p>
	<p pid="b.1721W.0/3" class="indent">Prisoner on Prisoner, Prisoner on Officer, Prisoner on Other and Other. Recording of assaults on prison officers sometimes includes assaults on other prison staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.1726W.0/1">The prison capacity programme has &pound;2.2 billion allocated to deliver around 11,700 places. Further to this, up to &pound;120 million has been provisionally allocated for the land purchase including three Titans in the post&mdash;2011 SR period and this will be subject to the usual SR process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726W.0/2">This programme will provide around 2,300 places in three new prisons and a further 7,500 places to be provided in three Titan prisons. The remaining places in the programme are provided in expansions to existing prison sites and conversions of some surplus MOD and NHS sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726W.0/3">Although land is still to be purchased for the Titans, no additional expenditure on land purchase has been required for the other three prisons as the land is already in NOMS ownership.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726W.0/4">It is estimated that the proportion of costs across the whole capacity programme will be 3 per cent. for architectural or design fees, 90 per cent. for construction fees and less than 1 per cent. for legal fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726W.0/5">Where new prisons are to be procured through the Design, Construct Manage Finance (DCMF) process, the bids are evaluated on the cost per prisoner place over the lifetime of the proposed contract. A breakdown of the regime elements at the new prisons such as health care, exercise, education and detoxification facilities cannot be provided at this stage of the current ongoing DCMF competition.</p>

	<p pid="b.1726W.3/1">The following table shows the number of mortgage possession orders made in all London county courts since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726W.3/2">These figures do not indicate how many houses have been repossessed through the courts, since not all the orders will have resulted in the issue and execution of warrants of possession.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726W.3/3">The civil procedure rules state that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated. However, county courts jurisdictions are not coterminous with London borough boundaries, and therefore any single court's repossession actions are likely to relate to homes in a number of different boroughs.</p>

They are not used for serious matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1728W.5/5" class="indent">the options taken up to date include, apologising to the victim verbally or in writing, agreeing to change behaviour, payment for the damage caused, to act responsibly on public transport in future and to work with a mentor to facilitate a return to school.

	<p pid="b.1732W.2/1">The A and E data at national level do not allow us to examine causes of poor performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1732W.2/2">It is for primary care trusts and strategic health authorities (SHAs) to work with national health service organisations to ensure they are providing an appropriate level of high quality care for patients. SHAs are actively engaged in this and working closely with challenged organisations to address issues that may arise which affect performance. These issues vary depending on local circumstances. All trusts need to be working to this operational standard.</p>

	<p pid="b.1735W.5/1">Women invited to participate in the national health service cervical screening programme need to understand the potential benefits and harms in doing so and to be able to make an informed choice about whether or not they wish to take part in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1735W.5/2">This is why all eligible women receive a national information leaflet on cervical screening, Cervical Screening - The Facts. This leaflet is included with each screening invitation and contains comprehensive and understandable information about cervical screening. It can be viewed at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1735W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/cervical/publications/in-04.html">www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/cervical/publications/in-04.html</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1735W.5/4">The Cancer Reform Strategy noted concerns about the fall in the number of young women taking up their invitation to be screened. That is why the NHS cancer screening programme have commissioned the Improvement Foundation to undertake work at a local level targeting this age group. The lessons learned from this work, due in 2009, will be shared with strategic health authorities and local screening programmes to develop best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1735W.5/5">The NHS cancer screening programme's press office is developing an information pack to be issued to all local screening programmes and also developing a public relations strategy, including articles in appropriate media publications, posters etc. In addition, Cancer Research UK have commissioned research on this issue, which we will monitor closely and will share the findings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1735W.5/6">Continued local action in this area is also essential and we will continue to monitor levels of cervical screening coverage through the Office for National Statistics/Information Centre for health and social care annual cervical screening statistical bulletin.</p>

	<p pid="b.1740W.5/1">A simplified system of banded national health service dental charges was introduced in 2006-07, alongside new commissioning and remuneration arrangements for NHS primary dental care services. Services were also evolving ahead of the changeover as increasing numbers of dental practices converted from the former general dental services (GDS) contract to personal dental service (PDS) pilots where remuneration was based on levels of care rather than item of service fees. However, levels of charge income reduced in PDS pilots because of the need to retain the old charge structure which was not calibrated to take account of the new ways of working stimulated by the new terms of service. This effect was particularly noticeable in 2005-06 when the number of PDS pilots reached their peak. The following table shows charge income for the four-year span 2003-04 to 2006-07 to give a perspective on these trends ahead of the adoption of the new charge structure in April 2006.</p>

However, PCTs may offer dentists assistance with the start up costs of establishing new dental practices at their discretion, if they consider this appropriate and necessary. The Government have also made &pound;100 million capital funds available to PCTs over the two years 2006-07 and 2007-08 to give them additional scope to help dentists modernise or expand dental practices for the benefit of NHS patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.1742W.0/1">The information requested is shown in the following tables. Fluoridation of water offers the best prospect of reducing inequalities in oral health, but comparisons between expenditure levels in different areas are affected by a number of factors. There is no simple and direct relationship between expenditure levels and relative oral health needs. The legacy of the previous general dental service contract is that the pattern of services largely reflects where dentists previously chose to set up in practice, and how much national health service dental work they chose to undertake. In addition, levels of patient demand for dental care may not necessarily reflect levels of oral health need. The Department has no data on the levels of private dental care provided in different areas. Expenditure per head is calculated from resident population figures, but patients may attend dental surgeries outside their areas of residence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1748W.2/1">The new general medical services contract introduced a number of steps to incentivise and improve access to general practice. New allocation and funding mechanisms such as the global sum, Quality and Outcomes Framework and enhanced services reward the work associated with each additional patient under new practice-based contracts. Therefore, every new additional patient registration attracts additional funding for each practice. In addition, substantial investment in primary care has enabled new and extended premises for general practices to increase their capacity and accept a greater number of patients to their lists.</p>

	<p pid="b.1749W.8/1">There is no requirement for any general practitioner (GP) practice to extend their opening hours. Under proposals put to the BMA's General Practitioners Committee, the average GP practice which provides three hours extended opening per week could expect to receive around &pound;19,000 per year, where they choose to provide such services to their patients. This would be funded by making more effective use of existing resources within the current GP contract arrangement. In addition, we have offered to invest an additional 1.5 per cent. increase through the GP contract, worth just over &pound;100 million. This would be a further boost in investment, provide greater improvements for patients and is a good deal for GPs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1758W.5/1">The Department will be making an announcement shortly on how much funding it will making available to the FRANK campaign in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.1758W.5/2">The FRANK campaign is the key mechanism used by the Government for making the public aware of the harms associated with drug use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1758W.5/3">In 2007-08 the Department made &pound;2 million available to the FRANK campaign. We are not able to provide a breakdown of spend by individual drug but in 2007-08 there was an enhanced focus on cannabis within the FRANK programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1758W.5/4">In addition to this funding the Department for Children, School and Families and the Home Office also invest resources for the purpose of educating the public on the use of cannabis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1758W.5/5">Implementation of the Department's research strategy &quot;Best Research for Best Health&quot; is resulting in an expansion of our research programmes and in significant new funding opportunities for health research. The National Institute for Health Research, set up as part of that implementation process, has awarded a &pound;2 million programme grant to support research on improving physical health and reducing substance use, particularly cannabis use, in severe mental illness. Research on cannabis use and psychosis will also form part of the work programme of the Institute's South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and Institute of Psychiatry Biomedical Research Centre which the Department began funding in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1758W.5/6">Over the past three years alone, total spending on the national health service in England has increased from &pound;69 billion in 2004-05 to over &pound;90 billion in 2007-08. Following the settlement of the comprehensive spending review last October, total expenditure on the NHS will rise to &pound;110 billion by 2010-11. We have made very substantial resources available to the NHS from which to provide treatments and services for the population. However, the responsibility for the provision of all NHS services now rests with primary care trusts (PCTs) and NHS funds are not ringfenced for particular treatments. Ultimately, PCTs in conjunction with their relevant strategic health authority should plan, develop, commission or provide heath services, and decide what proportion of their budgets they spend on particular health services, including mental health services, according to the needs of their local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1758W.5/7">To ensure that people with mental health problems are aware of the risks associated with cannabis use the Department have published a &quot;Cannabis and Your Mental Health&quot; resource pack which includes a range of resources to help highlight the harmful effects of cannabis use for people with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1758W.5/8">The Department is also committed to improving the help and care available to people with concurrent mental illness and substance misuse problems&mdash;known as dual diagnosis. The Department has published &quot;Dual Diagnosis in in-patient and day hospital settings&quot; to take forward this aim. This guidance makes clear that the ability to provide dual diagnosis patients with the treatment and care they require, should be the norm in mental health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1758W.5/9">In addition there are people with less severe mental health problems who receive their treatment for cannabis use within a specialist drug treatment service setting. To support practitioners in treatment services in providing the most appropriate treatment for cannabis misuse we have made available substantial resources to drug treatment services through the Pooled Treatment Budget and also National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have published guidance on treatment for cannabis users as part of their psycho-social guidelines &quot;Drugs Misuse Psycho-Social Intervention Guidelines&quot;, published in July 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1768W.2/1">There are many hundreds of contracts negotiated annually between national health service bodies and private sector suppliers for a full range of services and equipment that involve elements of public private partnerships. These range from service contracts with private hospitals and social care placements to leases of equipment and private finance initiative contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.2/2">Of the three major areas of public private partnership contracts for which information is collected centrally&mdash;private finance initiative (PFI) schemes, NHS local improvement finance trusts (NHS LIFT) and independent treatment centres (ISTCs)&mdash;lists have been placed in the Library. For PFI and NHS LIFT the lists show only those schemes which have reached financial close as it is not possible to predict final capital values and annual payments on schemes which are still in the planning or procurement stages. The lists show the estimated capital value of each scheme (an approximation to asset value), where appropriate, as well as the annual unitary payment made by each NHS body to their private sector partner.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.2/3">For ISTCs, the table shows the total contract value for Wave 1 schemes. The total contract value represents the estimated nominal value at the time of signing, calculated in accordance with an estimate of the inflation index as specified in each contract. Procurement of Phase 2 of the ISTC programme is ongoing and all contractual values remain commercial in confidence at this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.2/4">In the case of the PFI schemes, under current accounting standards the facilities do not appear on the balance sheet of the NHS body during the life of the contract; and by the end of the contract all the debt raised by the private sector has been paid back. So although the facility will have a residual value when it reverts to the ownership of the NHS trust or primary care trust at the end of the contract, it will go on their balance sheets as an asset without an off-setting liability or 'debt'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.2/5">In the case of NHS LIFT schemes the facilities also do not appear on the balance sheet of the NHS body during the life of the contract. However, the shorter contract lengths (typically 25 years compared with 30 or more in a PFI scheme) mean there is a small outstanding debt owed by the NHS LIFT project company at the end of the contract (i.e. their outstanding borrowings). In NHS LIFT this is a project company 'risk' in terms of recouping enough from the future use or disposal of the asset to meet this debt (known as 'residual value risk'). The NHS body has an option to buy the facility or walk away from the contract, in which case the project company must look to sell the facility on the open market or lease it out again. So again, there is no 'debt' owed by the NHS body at the end of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.2/6">In the case of the ISTCs, where the contract lengths are much shorter, many of the contracts involve a residual value payment to the contractor at the end of the term. This means that in this case the 'residual value' risk lies with the NHS (i.e. the risk here is that the theoretical residual value will exceed the actual market value that can be achieved). So there is a 'debt' owed by the NHS body at the end of the contract. Information on the ISTC contracts that involve residual value (RV) payments and the amounts in each case have also been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1769W.2/1">The length of time a patient treated by Wirral primary care trust waits for psychological therapies varies with the severity of their condition. However, since December 2007, waiting times for mild to moderate mental health treatment are under 18 weeks, and waiting times for more complex therapies and cognitive behaviour therapy are, in the vast majority of cases, a maximum of 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769W.2/2">Average waiting times for psychological therapies are not collected centrally. These waiting times will improve over the next few years as the Government's substantial additional investment in improving access to psychological therapies, announced in October last year, begins to be rolled-out across England.</p>
