	<p pid="b.1W.3/1">Bilateral and regional free trade agreements determine market access, not subsidies. However, completing multilateral trade negotiations-the Doha Development Agenda-would tackle developed countries' trade-distorting agricultural subsidies. The UK has helped to ensure an ambitious EU offer in these negotiations. At its most recent summit last November, the G20 restated its commitment to completing the Doha negotiations. In G20 discussions on the price volatility of agricultural commodities, the UK is arguing for deeper and more transparent markets throughout the G20 in which the role of distorting subsidies and trade practices-such as export restrictions-is greatly reduced. Furthermore, the UK is arguing for a very substantial reduction in subsidies to agriculture as part of current negotiations on the future of the common agricultural policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.2W.0/1">The pre-market authorisation of meat and other products derived from cloned animals and the mandatory labelling of food derived from offspring of cloned animals have not been discussed at recent meetings of the EU Agriculture Council. They have been discussed by the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Governments of EU member states (COREPER). COREPER agreed the approach to be taken by the Council at meetings of the Conciliation Committee set up to try to resolve differences between the Council and the European Parliament on proposed amendments to the EU Novel Foods Regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2W.0/2">The UK Government made it clear in COREPER discussions that it considers that a ban on cloning and food from clones would be disproportionate in terms of food safety and animal welfare. We are content with pre-market authorisation of food from cloned animals as required by existing novel foods legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2W.0/3">The Government also made it clear that mandatory labelling of meat or milk products derived from animals with a clone in their ancestry would be unenforceable and impractical because there is no traceability system that can be applied to imported or home produced products from descendants of clones. As there are no food safety issues, the cost of introducing a mandatory system, which would need to comply with international trade rules, cannot be justified.</p>

	<p pid="b.2W.3/1">Under the EU novel foods regulation, food from cloned animals must be authorised before it can be legally marketed anywhere in the EU. There are no EU or UK rules prohibiting the sale of meat and milk products from the offspring of cloned animals. The European Commission and other member states do not consider that food from an animal descended from a clone falls within the scope of this legislation. The Food Standards Agency is considering results from a recent consultation before deciding whether to adopt the Commission's position and expects to make an announcement shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.6W.0/2">DEFRA anticipates minimum net cumulative administrative savings resulting from abolitions or changes in functions of our public bodies over the spending review period of approximately &#163;18.58 million which is broken down as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.6W.0/12">In addition we estimate that the withdrawal of funding to the Sustainable Development Commission (which pre-dates the spending review public bodies reform process) and its abolition will save approximately &#163;2 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.6W.0/13">These are our best current estimates of planned net savings to emerge from these reforms and are dependent upon the individual timetables for implementation-many of which require the Public Bodies Bill and subsequent secondary legislation or discussions with the devolved administrations. Consequently, not all savings figures can be determined precisely at this stage. The following table summarises the position for each of the bodies asked about.</p>

	<p pid="b.10W.8/1">Direct subsidies to fishermen can undermine attempts to deliver sustainable fisheries, and lead to unintended environmental harm. As stated in the UK response to the Commission's Green Paper on Common Fisheries Policy reform, our view is that both policy makers and industry should aim to phase out permanent fisheries subsidies at both EU and international level. However, we do recognise that to achieve sustainable fisheries there may be a role for adaptation support.</p>
	<p pid="b.10W.8/2">The European Fisheries Fund (EFF) is intended to help secure a sustainable and profitable fishing industry in line with the objectives of the common fisheries policy. In the UK the fund is used to support an industry that is both environmentally and economically sustainable and well managed in line with policies for the protection of the marine and freshwater environment. All applications for funding under the EFF are closely scrutinised and assessed before they are approved to ensure they meet the criteria laid down in the EU regulations and adhere to the UK's strategic and operational programmes for implementing and delivering the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.12W.11/1">DEFRA has funded research to investigate the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock by dietary and nutritional control. These studies have showed that feeding ruminant livestock foods such as maize silage, naked oats and higher sugar grasses can reduce the amount of methane they produce.</p>
	<p pid="b.12W.11/2">Research carried out by Reading University and the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS), under projects commissioned by DEFRA in January 2005 and April 2007, showed that it is nutritionally possible to reduce nitrogen excretion from cattle and sheep and their methane emissions. For example: increasing the proportion of maize silage from 25 to 75% in a short-term trial was found to reduce methane emission per kg milk by 6%; high-sugar grasses could reduce an animal's methane emissions by 20% for every kilo of weight gain; naked oats could reduce methane emissions from sheep by 33%; and crushed rapeseed could reduce methane production from dairy cows by 20% per litre of milk produced. In the longer term, the benefits gained by changing animals' diets will need to be considered against other environmental impacts, as well as how practical or costly they are for the farming industry to implement.</p>

Its report, which is available on the HPA website, concluded that while it is not possible to rule out adverse health effects completely, any potential damage from modern, well run and regulated incinerators is likely to be so small that it would be undetectable.</p>

Work will be undertaken to assess the effects of feeding extruded linseed on methane emissions from dairy cows.

	<p pid="b.18W.11/1">The Government are focused on ensuring that pesticides do not harm people and the environment, including bee populations. A comparative study of grooming behaviour in bees and termites is not needed for these purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.11/2">Under European legislation, pesticide active substances are evaluated at EU level according to specific data requirements. For bees, a fundamental need is to consider potential impacts on the overall performance of the population and a new data requirement will be introduced on the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on overwintering bee populations. The need for this was fully supported by the UK and is in line with advice from pesticide regulatory scientists and the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides following review of the 2009 Buglife report.</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.11/3">Effects of insecticides on grooming behaviour are not currently a standard data requirement in the regulatory process, and have not been identified as a requirement in the revised regime to be introduced shortly by Council Regulation 1107/2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.19W.5/1">The Wildlife Incident Investigation scheme (WIIS) investigates cases reported to Government that may involve pesticide poisoning. Typically 400 cases are submitted annually with about 30% of these eventually being determined to be pesticide poisoning incidents. On average there are 32 cases per year involving either honey bees, feral bees or bumble bees and of these around 11 (30%) are determined to be pesticide poisoning cases.</p>

Preliminary analysis of 2010 data from England, Scotland and Wales indicates there were five WIIS cases involving the detection of two different neonicotinoids (imidacloprid and thiacloprid) either singly or in combination with other pesticides in bees. Given the nature of the WIIS, conclusions, in .terms of trends cannot be drawn from such small numbers, particularly as more sensitive analytical methods have recently been introduced.</p>

	<p pid="b.21W.0/1">Neonicotinoid pesticides are already subject to restrictions made to reduce the potential risk they pose to bees. Neonicotinoid insecticides are authorised through the rigorous EU pesticides approval process. Products are authorised in the UK after a national risk assessment. The Government have regularly considered the available evidence in this area and I see no basis for further restrictions at this stage. The position will-be kept under review in the light of continuing scrutiny of new research and discussions with other regulatory authorities. The 2009 Buglife report was reviewed by the Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive for any new scientific information which might be of relevance for the pesticides risk assessment process, and CRD's assessment was considered by the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP). Ministers receive advice from the ACP on pesticides issues but do not routinely meet the Committee. The CRD assessment and ACP comments have been published on the CRD website. The review highlighted a need for data on the impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on overwintering of bees in the risk assessment process. This issue had already been identified by regulators and is being addressed through changes to the EU regulatory system. Some pesticide approval holders are already carrying out work to develop field data on overwintering effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bees as part of the pesticides approval process. CRD has already assessed one such study, and for the crop/pesticide concerned this indicated that there are no effects on honey bees and honey bee survival.</p>
	<p pid="b.21W.0/2">The term 'colony collapse disorder (CCD)' has been used to describe high levels of abnormal colony losses in the USA. Although there have been some significant losses in the UK in recent years, there is no evidence to suggest that CCD is present. Indeed, there has been a significant reduction in the number of colonies that have been lost. In 2010, 5.8% of colonies inspected in England and Wales were found to be dead compared to 6.9% in 2009. Last year's losses were also the lowest level since 2001.</p>

	<p pid="b.21W.3/1">The pesticides risk assessment considers the risk to groundwater and surface water for each product and use and the surface water assessment specifically looks at the risk to aquatic life. This assessment does not suggest that there should be a significant issue from neonicotinoid pesticides. That conclusion is not challenged by existing Environment Agency monitoring which tests for a range of pesticides in surface and ground water. This monitoring includes imidacloprid and clothianidin and has not detected any residues of these two neonicotinoids (although it would be unlikely to detect residues at the low levels expected). There does not appear to be a need for further targeted monitoring of neonicotinoid pesticides in water bodies.</p>

	<p pid="b.23W.2/1">Regional spatial strategies did not specifically provide a mechanism for supporting the setting of recycling targets for local authorities.

The current review of waste policies being conducted by the Government will set out the framework of support we want to give to local authorities to manage waste more sustainably. However, it is for local authorities to decide what aspirations on recycling are appropriate for their area depending on their wider waste management goals and individual circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.26W.6/1">The Localism Bill will abolish Regional Strategies and introduce a Duty to Co-operate, which will require local planning authorities and public bodies to engage constructively and on an ongoing basis to prepare local plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.6/2">In the spirit of partnership working we expect local planning authorities to collaborate with infrastructure providers from an early stage in the local planning process to ensure that they are actively involved in shaping proposals. Water companies are statutory consultees to local plans in the current system, and are able to feed in their views on local plan growth from a water infrastructure perspective. We would want this to continue in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.6/3">All water undertakers. in England produce statutory 25-year Water, Resources Management Plans (WRMPs) that identify how they will ensure a secure and sustainable supply of water. In developing these plans water undertakers will have access to information on growth from the local plans in their areas. The public consultation process for WRMPs provides a means by which water undertakers and planning authorities may validate forecast growth and future needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.6/4">Since October 2010 unitary and county councils have been given a new role as lead local flood authorities (LLFAs), and a duty under the Flood and Water Management Act to have local flood risk management strategies for their areas. We would expect these strategies to consider drainage for new developments, and for LLFAs to work with water undertakers and developers to ensure that arrangements are adequate and sustainable. The Local Government Association has recently published guidance to help LLFAs develop their strategies. We expect LLFAs will begin to publish their strategies in 2012 and there is a requirement that relevant authorities and the public should be consulted about them. LLFAs across England have also been provided with funding of &#163;21 million for 2011-12, rising to &#163;36 million in 2012-13, to undertake their new roles.</p>

These vacancies were primarily in the financial sector. We did this was for indicative purposes only and, for this reason, did not consider it necessary to keep a record. These advertised salaries ranged between &#163;70,000 and &#163;120,000. We then sought advice from our recruitment consultants who recommended a salary range corroborating the range identified by our internal research. Having received this advice, we took the view that this range was too high (whilst taking into account the knowledge, experience and capabilities required for this statutory office) and advertised a lower rate equivalent to an IPSA Grade F position (pay band &#163;60,000 to &#163;73,000, full-time equivalent).</p>

The services are provided under a contract which was awarded following a competitive tender in October 2009. Other cleaning costs are allocated according to occupancy so that the civil list, the privy purse and the royal collection each meet an appropriate share of the total cleaning contract costs.</p>

Since only UK-based bookmakers are liable for betting duty, there is no loss from overseas bookmakers that advertise and transact in the UK.

We have not attempted to separate out the tourism impact of each event individually, but we intend to capitalise on the huge tourism opportunity they will create by constructing a marketing fund of more than &#163;100 million, with major companies already pledging support to help match the &#163;50 million of public money the Government have committed through VisitBritain. The marketing campaign is aiming to deliver four million extra visitors to the UK over the four years, &#163;2 billion in additional visitor spending and 50,000 new jobs across the country.</p>

It contains a range of provisions designed to facilitate cross-border trading and promote greater integration of national markets, including a requirement on EU system operators to publish 10-year network development plans to identify where grid reinforcements are needed across the EU. Furthermore, the European Commission will be proposing legislation on energy infrastructure in the autumn which will include mechanisms for selecting the infrastructure projects which will be necessary for the EU to meet the low-carbon and energy security challenges over the coming decades (&quot;projects of European interest&quot;). It will also seek to tackle any remaining barriers to infrastructure investment, particularly as regards finance and planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.0/2">The UK Government, together with nine other countries, are helping to address this infrastructure challenge through the North Seas Offshore Grid Initiative. This initiative is considering how we might better coordinate offshore grid development in the North, Irish and Baltic seas and tackle any planning, market, regulatory and technical barriers. The experience gained from this initiative should also be helpful for other large-scale cross-border infrastructure projects which will be needed across the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.52W.3/1">The UK has a robust and transparent regulatory regime for protecting people and society from the hazards of the nuclear industry that is overseen by an independent nuclear safety operator. This regime ensures that risks of nuclear accidents are minimised. Under that regime, nuclear operators must satisfy the nuclear regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), that they have adequate engineering and administrative measures in place to ensure this-this is largely achieved via a written safety case. Safety cases must include assessments of the likelihood of nuclear accidents and measures to mitigate them. They provide the basis for ONR giving permissions for nuclear activities at sites. The likelihood of a nuclear accident at a nuclear site with costs greater than &#163;l billion, based on the assessment of safety cases by the ONR, is estimated at less than 1 in 10,000 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.52W.6/1">There are 10 operating nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom that use diesel generators or gas turbines to supply back-up power to ensure adequate cooling of the reactor in the event of a national grid power failure to the site. In addition, each station has secondary back-up systems to ensure that, should a primary back-up system fail, sufficient capacity would continue to be available to ensure adequate levels of cooling. The 10 stations are shown in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="b.52W.6/17">It is not possible to test these back-up systems under 'full emergency conditions' because this would require a disconnection of the site from the national grid. However, it is a requirement of the nuclear installations licensing regime that each operating power station must carry out routine tests of its systems at regular intervals. Those intervals vary from weekly to three monthly tests, depending on the age and design of the back-up system. While occasional faults have occurred in the period of the last 10 years, adequate power supplies have been maintained at all 10 operating stations to secure the availability of sufficient cooling for the reactors.</p>

The 2010 spending review set an overall cap for DECC's tax and spending through policies that entail levy-funded spending. This cap will be managed through a new control framework, as announced at the Budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.63W.8/1">Domestic violence and sexual abuse are criminal offences and as such the civilian police would have jurisdiction in such matters. However, there may be occasions when the civilian police pass jurisdiction back to the service and on these occasions, the service police and Service Prosecuting Authority would have the lead, as this is not a matter which could be dealt with summarily by a commanding officer. Overseas, the service police will undertake the duties that would fall to police forces in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.2/1">Domestic violence and sexual abuse manifest themselves in many forms and incidents require a wide range of skills from a variety of service and civilian support agencies if they are to be dealt with effectively. No organisation therefore has sole or statutory responsibility for detecting, dealing with, or offering support in response to all forms of such abuse within the service community. However, examples of the agencies involved would include: service welfare organisations; padres/chaplains; medical practitioners; local authority children's services/adult social care; woman's aid; independent domestic violence advisers; and civilian and service police forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.67W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) does not have monthly targets for job reductions.</p>
	<p pid="b.67W.8/2">As set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), the MOD civilian work force is expected to decrease by around 25,000 to 60,000 by 2015. Of these, we expect around 5,000 to be transferred outside of Defence through the sale of certain trading funds such as the Defence Support Group.

	<p pid="b.67W.8/8">Some of these will be delivered through natural turnover and some through redundancy. We will continue to recruit to prevent critical skills shortages in certain roles; and maintain the right mix of trained and experienced personnel for the future. The Secretary of State for Defence set out in his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2011-03-01.21"><i> Official Report</i>, column 21WS</phrase>, the process and timetable for the armed forces redundancy schemes, which will be conducted in a series of tranches.

Under this tranche the Royal Navy is seeking a reduction of around 1,600, the Army of around 1,000, and the RAF of around 1,100.

	<p pid="b.70W.3/1">This agreement was drawn up with the trade unions as the basis for managing staff surpluses. Its primary aim is to provide a framework for examining measures with the aim of minimising or avoiding compulsory redundancy and it is consistent with the overarching efficiency and relocation support programme. We have invited the Trade Unions to take part in discussions about possible measures. A number of the measures referred to in the Managing Staff Surpluses Agreement are already in place and the use of voluntary early release, as a principal response to the challenges set by the strategic defence and security review and spending review 2010, and the need to deal with the deficit in the defence budget, is explicitly provided for in that agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.70W.6/1">Civil servants provide the Ministry of Defence (MOD) with a broad spectrum of skills ranging from policy and administrative support to nuclear engineering. Each functional skills area is assigned a skills champion to provide a strategic input into civilian skills planning for their function. They advise on major trends and issues affecting their community; seek to enhance professionalism; identify key corporate work force/skills needs; and help shape and influence appropriate interventions to address those needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.6/2">When introducing the Voluntary Early Release Scheme (VERS) we recognised the need to implement it in such a way as to retain critical skills. Early in the process, skills champions identified the skills that needed to be retained by the Department and within individual business areas; their advice was used in the design of the criteria which will be used to select individuals for release.</p>

	<p pid="b.72W.2/1">External recruitment to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) for grades below the senior civil service (SCS) is carried out by the People Pay and Pensions Agency (PPPA). Where external recruitment for SCS level posts is required, recruitment agencies may be asked to carry out an initial search for suitable candidates. In financial year (FY) 2010-11 the MOD spent &#163;90,015 on recruitment agency fees in connection with SCS level recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.72W.2/2">MOD support to staff who are leaving on redundancy or voluntary release includes access to the outplacement service (MODOPS). MODOPS is a contractor-operated service which helps staff to find work outside the civil service, giving guidance on subjects including job-searching, CV writing, interview preparation and financial planning. MODOPS also provides on-line support for a period of time after leaving. In FY 2010-11, the MOD spent &#163;72,515 on MODOPS programmes. These costs reflect the previous contract pricing; a new pricing structure has recently been negotiated which will significantly reduce costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.72W.2/3">The Defence Academy is the primary provider of training and education to civilian personnel, both through courses run on-site, and through the provision of e-learning, including the running of Defence e-learning centres. Specialist and functional training is also procured from a range of external suppliers. Some training is also delivered locally, usually by civilian or military staff for whom training is not a full-time responsibility, but the costs of locally delivered training are not separately identified and could be compiled only at disproportionate cost. Details of expenditure on staff training in FY 2010-11 are not yet available. In FY 2009-10, this expenditure was &#163;65.127 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.79W.14/1">The main supply estimate and supplementary estimates for financial year 2010-11 for war pensions benefits did not change and remained at &#163;972 million. However, the unaudited end of year forecast for financial year 2010-11 is now &#163;935 million. This equates to a 3.8% reduction, which reflects the fall in the number of benefits paid and new claims processed each year due to the age of the war pensions scheme's customer base and the introduction of the new Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Compensation Scheme in April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.79W.14/2">The estimate for financial year 2011-12 prepared in January 2010 was &#163;965 million. This was reduced by 2.8% to &#163;938 million in January 2011 based on an overall 4% reduction due to mortality rates in the number of claimants or potential claimants and the change from retail prices index to consumer prices index as the basis for indexation.</p>

Where the local authority has Civil Parking Enforcement (CPE) power under the Traffic Management Act 2004, the local authority may serve a higher level Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) if a vehicle is parked without clearly displaying a valid Blue Badge. Where the local authority does not have CPE power, it would be for the police to take enforcement action. In addition to any PCN or Fixed Penalty Notice issued, if the motorist is misusing someone else's Blue Badge to park in the bay, they could be prosecuted and fined up to &#163;1,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.8/2">Parking enforcement in private car parks is a matter for car park operators and their customers. However, I wrote to the main supermarkets on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-22">22 March 2011</phrase>, to further encourage them to actively monitor and enforce their disabled parking bays. I wait to hear their plans.</p>

The abolition of the RHC is expected to involve one-off costs associated with the termination of the contract of one employee of BRB (Residuary) Ltd. If the power of designation is transferred, modest ongoing costs are likely to be incurred, most of which are likely to be absorbed by the Museum of Science and Industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.96W.11/1">The Information requested is not held centrally. In England, the NHS Breast Screening Programme invites women aged 50 to 70 to be screened every three years. To make the service more convenient and accessible to women, 80% of the programme is provided by mobile screening units, which visit different areas covered by the local breast screening service in a three-year cycle. Therefore, women do not necessarily receive their first invitation in the year of their 50th birthday. As long as a woman is registered with a general practitioner, she should be invited for breast screening before her 53rd birthday. The objective is to cover as many women as possible in the three-year screening round.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.11/2">In order to ensure that all women receive their first invitation for breast screening by their 50th birthday, the programme is currently being extended to women aged 47 to 49. The extension is being conducted as part of a randomisation project with women aged 71 to 73, which will give directly comparable mortality data on the effectiveness of screening in these ages. The project is being run over two three-year screening rounds, with all local screening services expected to be screening women in both age groups from 2016.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.11/3">As at the end of March 2011, 43 of the 82 local screening services in England had extended, and it is anticipated a further 16 will have extended by the end of May. &quot;The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011/12&quot; states that commissioners should ensure that all screening services continue to take part in the breast screening age extension randomisation project.</p>

	<p pid="b.101W.2/1">As now, general practitioners (GPs) following our reforms may hold financial interests in organisations to which they refer patients or contract services. However, the Health and Social Care Bill proposes clear statutory duties on commissioners in relation to procurement and in relation to anti-competitive behaviours. A clear set of underpinning rules and guidance will be developed to apply to GP consortia, so that they have the necessary support to make decisions that are fair and transparent and avoid any perceived conflicts of interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.2/2">In addition, the Bill also includes a requirement that each consortium's constitution sets out arrangements for decision-making and managing potential conflicts of interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.2/3">Our proposed approach is that GP consortia should be able to proceed on the basis of 'assumed responsibility' rather than 'earned autonomy'. This will mean that consortia are free, within the legislative framework, to make the decisions that they judge are right for patients and value for money. However, there will be a clear duty on the NHS Commissioning Board, or if necessary, the economic regulator, to intervene if there are concerns that a consortium has not met its duties in relation to fairness and choice or has engaged in anti-competitive behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.2/4">In addition, GPs have to follow ethical guidance published by the General Medical Council, 'Good Medical Practice' This sets out that any commercial interests GPs have in organisations related to health care must not affect the way they prescribe, treat or refer patients. GPs must also inform the patient if they are referring them to an organisation in which they have a commercial interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.102W.2/1">It is intended that the National Health Service Commissioning Board will take over responsibility for commissioning guidelines and the allocation of resources for NHS services from the Department. It would be for the Board to decide how best to allocate resources in a way that supports the principle of securing equivalent access to NHS services relative to the prospective burden of disease and disability. The Health and Social Care Bill also includes a duty for the Board to narrow inequalities in access to healthcare, and the outcomes delivered by that healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.2/2">During the transition to the Board, the Secretary of State for Health has asked the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA), an independent committee comprising general practitioner (GP), academics and NHS managers, to continue to oversee the formulae for the distribution of NHS resources. ACRA's work programme will include consideration of the allocation of funds to GP consortia, and will examine the issue of unmet need. However, this work programme does not pre-empt any decisions to be made by the NHS Commissioning Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.2/3">In addition, from 2013-14, the Department will allocate a ring-fenced public health grant to local authorities, based on relative population health. A new health premium will reward communities for the improvements in health outcomes they achieve, and incentivise action to reduce health inequalities. Disadvantaged areas will see a greater premium if they make progress, recognising that they face the greatest challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.102W.2/4">Further detail on the allocations and processes will be announced in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.107W.0/1">A written ministerial statement was delivered on the <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-10">10 February 2011</phrase> launching our formal response to Professor Mansell's report, &quot;Raising our Sights: Services for Adults with Profound Intellectual and Multiple Disabilities&quot;. We accept and support the conclusions of the report. Copies of the report and our response have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.107W.0/2">Following the publication of Professor Mansell's report, departmental officials have had discussions with key partners, including the Department for Education and the Department for Communities and Local Government regarding the report's recommendations. The Green Paper on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities addressed improving transitions, including for those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. The Green Paper was informed by learning from the cross-government Getting A Life programme. The Getting A Life sites have produced, and are now implementing, a pathway into paid employment and full lives for young people with severe learning disabilities. The Getting A Life cohort included individuals with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.107W.0/3">The elements of good service and good practice examples included in this report sits very clearly within the programme of work which the Government are leading to support independent living for people with learning disabilities and to support local service planning and commissioning to meet identified needs in their locality.</p>
	<p pid="b.107W.0/4">National health service bodies should be ensuring services meet the needs of all patients, including those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. The Health and Social Care Bill will translate duty onto local authorities and general practitioner (GP) consortia and place them under a new duty to agree a Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy. This is a new requirement through which the partners at the Health and Wellbeing Board have to agree a shared strategy for commissioning, which will have regard to their Joint Strategic Needs Assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.107W.0/5">Local authorities with their partner third sector organisations have responsibilities to offer services where there are assessed needs. Person centred approaches are the most positive way to ensure that individual needs are met in and across settings that are fully accessible to the individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.107W.0/6">Annual GP health checks for people with learning disabilities are also a local way of ensuring all individuals with learning disabilities can access the right interventions for their health and well being.</p>
	<p pid="b.107W.0/7">Departmental records show that we have about 120 items of correspondence about &quot;Raising Our Sights&quot; report.</p>

However, departmental records show that, since May 2010, the correspondence unit, which processes ministerial correspondence, has received 123 items of correspondence that urge the Department to accept the recommendations made in the March 2010 report 'Raising our sights: services for adults with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities'. The report, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, includes discussions around the issues raised in this PQ.</p>

Maternity support workers include: Maternity nursery nurse, nursing assistant auxiliary, health care assistant, support worker, nurse learner.<br/> 3. Data Quality:<br/> The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.<br/> 4. Monthly data:<br/> As from 21 July 2010 The NHS Information Centre has published experimental, provisional monthly NHS work force data. As expected with provisional, experimental statistics, some figures may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. The monthly work force data is not directly comparable with the annual work force census; it only includes those staff on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) (ie it does not include primary care staff or bank staff), it also includes locum doctors (not counted in the annual census). There are also new methods of presenting data (headcount methodology is different and there is now a role count). This information is available from September 2009 onwards at the following website:<br/> www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/provisionalmonthlyhchsworkforce<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care Monthly Workforce Statistics.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.117W.8/1">Clause 65 of the Bill makes provision for mergers involving national health service foundation trusts to be considered by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) under the Enterprise Act 2002. This ensures that there is a fair playing field for all providers of health care services. This replaces the current system whereby the Co-operation and Competition Panel advises Monitor on the impact of such mergers between NHS foundation trusts and Monitor takes the decisions as to whether the merger can go ahead, whether remedies are required or whether the merger cannot go ahead. The OFT currently considers mergers between NHS foundation trusts and private providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.118W.2/1">Co-operation and competition are not mutually exclusive. Co-operation remains a crucial part of the delivery of national health service-funded services where it delivers improvements in quality, innovation and productivity for the benefit of patients. To this end, section 72 of the NHS Act 2006 places NHS providers under a duty to co-operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.2/2">One of the key aims of the reforms, as set out in existing departmental procurement guidance, is to promote greater collaboration and dialogue between general practice clinicians and clinicians in provider organisations. This will ensure that commissioned pathways across provider boundaries are clear and safe and that patients receive seamless provision that is responsive to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.2/3">However, agreements between providers and commissioners that preclude competition and are likely to have an adverse effect on patients and taxpayers are not permitted. Such anti-competitive behaviour may include agreements between competing service providers to share geographic areas or customers, to co-ordinate their bids or to limit output and innovation. Where services are commissioned on an Any Qualified Provider basis, commissioners will need to ensure that those services (and the associated patient outcomes) are specified in a way that does not give an unfair advantage to established providers. The Competition Act offers protection against this sort of behaviour by giving a general prohibition on agreements that prevent, restrict or distort competition.</p>

	<p pid="b.129W.2/1">Transplantation is undertaken in national health service and private hospitals across the United Kingdom. There are no fully independent transplant centres as such, as all centres in England and Wales, whether they undertake transplants from living or deceased donors, are required to comply with the provisions of the Human Tissue Act 2004; ensure all living donation is authorised by the Human Tissue Authority and notify all procurement and transplantation of organs to NHS Blood and Transplant. From August 2012, all centres undertaking transplantation will also need to be licensed to meet the requirements of the EU Organ Directive 2010/53/EU. The centres, and the town or city in which they are based, are detailed in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.129W.2/2">In the last five years the National Commissioning Group has undertaken two investigations where concerns have arisen over clinical outcomes. These are an external review of the heart and lung transplant service at Papworth hospital in 2007 and a review of outcomes in the heart transplant service at Harefield hospital in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.130W.2/1">To estimate patient survival rates following transplant, patients are followed up until either death or the 30th day, one year or five year time point is reached. The mortality rates at 30 days are only held for cardiothoracic transplants. Unadjusted and risk-adjusted survival rates and 95% confidence intervals are given for each centre in the following tables based on data from the UK Transplant Registry maintained by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT).</p>
	<p pid="b.130W.2/2">The risk-adjusted rate gives an estimate of what the survival rate at a centre would have been if they had had the same mix of patients as that found across all centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.130W.2/3">The confidence interval rate gives an indication of the uncertainty or precision of an estimate, and is influenced by the number of transplants a particular centre undertakes. Estimates from larger data sets tend to be more precise and meaningful than those from smaller data sets. Confidence intervals are calculated with a stated probability, usually 95%.</p>
	<p pid="b.130W.2/4">Survival rates are not presented if there are five or fewer transplants at a centre in a given time period. Where there were no transplant failures or patient deaths within the post-transplant period of interest, the survival estimate is shown as 100% and a confidence interval is not shown as it cannot be estimated.</p>

In general, we do not have sufficient information to estimate the cost of expert reports for types of cases, nor for different types of report. This in part stems from the fact that for some types of personal injury cases for which we have data (notably the dataset referred to in annex A to the Jackson impact assessment), we only have data on disbursements paid by defendants, which may not equal the full cost of the disbursements.</p>

	<p pid="b.136W.6/1">The package of measures the Government are taking forward is designed to make the costs of civil litigation more proportionate. In personal injury claims, a regime of qualified one way costs shifting will be introduced, which will mean that the majority of defendants will not recover their costs in cases which they win. In other areas, the proportionality test will mean that if a winning defendant has spent a disproportionate amount on the case, they will only be able to recover a proportionate sum. Finally, it is not the claimant's costs which will be capped by the reforms. It is the amount of damages which may be taken as part of the lawyer's fee. In personal injury cases this will be subject to a cap of 25% of damages, excluding those for future care and loss.</p>

	<p pid="b.142W.8/1">The Government are committed to encouraging the public to resolve their issues out of court without recourse to public funds, using simpler, more informal remedies where they are appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.142W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-23">23 February</phrase> I announced that we will be increasing awareness and understanding of family mediation through a new Pre-Application Protocol for Family Mediation Information and Assessment meetings. This will begin to harmonise the position between self-funding and publicly funded individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.142W.8/3">In our recent Legal Aid consultation paper we proposed that most family private law proceedings-other than cases where domestic violence or forced marriage is involved and child abduction cases-be removed from the scope of legal aid. Crucially, however, as we believe that supporting families at their most difficult moments is vitally important, it is proposed that free mediation for the types of dispute that previously were in scope will continue to those who are eligible. This will mean that those vulnerable people who need support will be able to benefit from mediation.</p>
	<p pid="b.142W.8/4">In 2009-10, we spent &#163;14.4 million pounds on publicly-funded family mediations. With the proposed legal aid reforms, it is anticipated that, subject to increased demand for publicly funded mediations, an additional &#163;5 million pounds will be spent annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.142W.8/5">We look forward to receiving the final recommendations from the independently-chaired Family Justice Review panel this autumn. This will help us to consider how the use of dispute resolution could be further encouraged across the family justice system.</p>

The Government will put forward proposals in June, and will then begin formal consultation on the necessary changes to scheme regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.152W.0/2">The Government are committed to ensuring the changes are fair to pension scheme members and to taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="b.152W.0/3">An impact assessment covering the judicial pensions schemes has been produced and may be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.167W.5/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase>, 6,976.31 fully-qualified probation officers (full-time equivalents) were employed by Probation Trusts in England and Wales. This includes all those in the senior probation officer, senior practitioner, probation officer and practice development assessor job-groups and is the latest available staff-in-post figure for those grades. It has been drawn from administrative IT systems which, as with any large-scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.5/3">To protect Probation Trusts and front-line probation services, the Government have undertaken a radical streamlining of NOMS, which will achieve savings of at least 33% at national and regional level. This means that the efficiency savings Probation Trusts will need to find are limited to about 10% of their expenditure over the four years of the spending review period. Like NOMS, Probation Trusts can make savings by reducing bureaucracy and finding new ways of working: this will enable resources to be concentrated on sustaining front-line provision.</p>

We have also asked consultees whether certain categories of cases should be exempted from the mediation process.

	<p pid="b.168W.5/2">Additionally, prisoners may also be held overnight in police cells as a &quot;lockout&quot;. Lockouts can arise from a number of factors, including late court sittings, which can compromise the contractors' ability to deliver the prisoner to prison prior to the reception closure time.</p>
	<p pid="b.168W.5/3">In 2010 a total of 220 prisoners were held overnight in a police cell as a lockout.</p>

	<p pid="b.176W.2/1">Prisoners, including those convicted of terrorist related offences, do not have an administrative right of appeal against the inclusion of conditions onto their licence. They are able to challenge the conditions of their licence, either by making representations to their probation offender manager and the probation trust which employs him or to the Parole Board or by applying for a judicial review. Information on the number of offenders who submit such challenges and/or do so successfully is not held centrally. To provide this information would require a manual interrogation of individual offender records. Such an exercise would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.177W.2/1">The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 requires sentencers when sentencing offences committed after <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase> to follow guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for England and Wales or its predecessor the Sentencing Guidelines Council, unless it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.177W.2/2">The requirement 'to follow' is a requirement to sentence within the offence range set in a guideline; it does not require the court to sentence within any category range set within that offence range. Typically an offence range is divided into category ranges for offences of different categories of seriousness. Sentencers are free to sentence outside the category range if they see fit. Sentencers may sentence above the offence range if it would be contrary to the interests of justice not to do so, provided that the top of the offence range in the guideline is set lower than the maximum penalty available in law for the offence. Where the sentencer departs from the guidelines he or she must explain the reasons for doing so in open court.</p>
	<p pid="b.177W.2/3">Any previous convictions, where they are recent and relevant, should be regarded as an aggravating factor which should increase the severity of the sentence. This statutory aggravating factor is reflected in sentencing guidelines. The guideline &quot;Overarching Principles: Seriousness&quot; issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council in 2004 states that it will be an aggravating factor that an offender has previous convictions,</p>
	<p pid="b.177W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;particularly where a pattern of repeat offending is disclosed&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.179W.12/1">The decision by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) in November 2010 to resume its work in Burma was informed by the success of the multi-donor Three Diseases Fund which was established following GFATM's withdrawal from the country in 2005. The Three Diseases Fund has demonstrated that it is possible to deliver aid effectively in Burma through United Nations agencies, international non-governmental organisations and local community-based organisations. GFATM's operations in Burma will be modelled on those of the Three Diseases Fund.</p>

	<p pid="b.183W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is closely monitoring food prices in developing countries. Together with other members of the G20, the UK is developing measures to manage international food price volatility and mitigate the impact on the poorest. Measures being explored include better market information on grain stocks and strengthening international disciplines on export restrictions on food.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.2/2">Though high prices harm consumers, higher prices can sometimes benefit producers by increasing their income. However, DFID's bilateral programme is ensuring that the poor are better able to cope with higher food prices. For example, DFID support the Productive Safety Net Programme in Ethiopia which ensures that 8 million previously dependent on emergency aid maintain a basic standard of living. Improving agricultural production in developing countries will help to ensure food is affordable in the long term. For example DFID support in Malawi has helped over 2 million people access high yielding maize and legume seeds.</p>

	<p pid="b.184W.2/1">Yes. Around 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions result from deforestation, more than global emissions from all means of transport, so it is important that we work quickly to stem the loss of forests around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.2/2">The UK is playing a leading role in these efforts, providing &#163;300 million over the period 2010-12 for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. This money is helping to reduce poverty in communities which depend on forests for a living and protect the rich biodiversity found in tropical forests, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The UK has also committed &#163;2.9 billion for climate finance from 2011-15, and we will be reviewing how best to use part of this additional funding to complement our existing efforts to reduce global rates of deforestation. Long-standing UK support to combat illegal logging and curb the related trade in illegally harvested timber also makes an important contribution to global efforts to stem the loss of forests.</p>

According to World Bank figures, in 2009 GNI per capita in Trinidad and Tobago was US$16,700. Provisional figures show that &#163;30,000 of UK ODA was provided to Trinidad and Tobago in 2010. This relates to a legacy commitment made by the British Government in 1970, that it would assume responsibility from overseas governments for the payment of pensions due to expatriate colonial civil servants who had been appointed by or on behalf of the Secretary of State of the Colonies. A proportion of these pension payments are classified as ODA in line with the internationally agreed definition of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Final 2010 ODA figures will be published in the Department for International Development (DFID) publication Statistics on International Development (SID) later this year.

	<p pid="b.187W.3/1">Housing options advice is a key part of local authorities' work to prevent homelessness. Housing options services are now standard practice among the great majority of local authorities. Local authorities recorded 165,000 cases in 2009-10 where homelessness was prevented or relieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.3/2">It is accepted good practice that a person seeking assistance should receive a written summary of housing options discussed. However we know housing options advice works best when schemes are developed locally that take account of local needs and local markets, and focus on giving the individual appropriate housing advice. Requiring local authorities to provide advice in writing through legislation would be overly bureaucratic and risk creating a &quot;tick box&quot; exercise that focuses on the process rather than providing a person with high quality advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.193W.3/1">The Government are committed to planning policies which take account of the needs of a diverse population, including people with profound learning disabilities and those who look after them. Planning Policy Statement 1, 'Delivering Sustainable Development', asks local planning authorities to take into account the needs of all the community, including particular requirements relating to disability, when writing local plans. Local plans should promote development which helps to create socially inclusive communities, including suitable mixes of housing, and ensures access to health services, housing and community facilities (both in terms of location and physical access) for all.</p>

	<p pid="b.197W.2/1">Information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected quarterly at local authority level. Data collected includes the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to ensure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available and this information is also collected. Data is published in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available in the House of Commons Library or via the DCLG website:</p>

	<p pid="b.197W.2/5">These figures include households placed in temporary accommodation by their local authority, usually whilst the authority is discharging a main homelessness duty to secure suitable accommodation until a settled home becomes available for the applicant household. They do not include households who are not in priority need.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.2/6">The department also holds information on Supporting People Client Records. These show the number of clients whose predominant needs relate to homelessness who enter direct access hostels funded by Supporting People. These statistics measure the flow of clients into hostels over the year rather than the total number of people residing in hostels. The data is available from the University of St Andrews:</p>

Previously only local authorities where there was a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to provide a count. All areas across England now provide counts or robust estimates giving a clear national picture. Latest statistics show 1,768 rough sleepers in England on any one night. The Government have also set up a cross-departmental ministerial working group on homelessness to address the complex causes and improve support for homeless people.</p>

	<p pid="b.202W.8/1">The Government's role in specific local government pay and workforce issues is extremely limited as they are, rightly, a matter for the individual councils as the employer. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has, however, called on councils to show leadership in pay restraint and for chief executives earning the most senior salaries to take a voluntary pay cut. In addition, he has set out his intention to use guidance under provisions in the Localism Bill to set out the Government's view that decisions about salaries over &#163;100,000 should always be subject to a vote of Full Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.8/2">A member entitled to a pension under the Local Government Pension scheme (LGPS) must inform a new scheme employer and their LGPS administering authority about that new employment, as the LGPS provides administering authorities with discretionary powers to reduce or extinguish the amount of pension payable to a scheme member who has entered new employment with a scheme employer. No specific guidance is issued on abatement as each LGPS administering authority is required to formulate and keep under review its policy concerning abatement. In doing so, an administering authority must be aware of the extent to which any policy not to apply to abatement could lead to a serious loss of confidence in the public service.</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.2/1">As you know, the Government are committed to providing more opportunities for the transfer of responsibility to civil society and the voluntary sector. As part of this, we are introducing new 'Rights to Provide' for public sector workers to form employee-led organisations and take over the services they deliver:</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.2/2" class="indent">Local authority employees will be able to use the Right to Challenge to trigger a procurement process for services, in which they can compete alongside others.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.2/3" class="indent">Central Government Departments will develop bespoke Rights to Provide for their employees</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.2/4" class="indent">Employees across the public sector will exercise Rights to Provide developed on a service-specific basis. The Department of Health has already announced a new Right to Provide in NHS and care services where clinically appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.2/5">Numerous employees have already expressed an interest in creating and developing new mutuals. There are now 21 Mutual Pathfinders across a wide range of public services-all forming new mutual organisations, with the support of <i> pro bono</i><i> </i>mentoring from experts in employee ownership and business management. This is in addition to more than &#163;900 million of NHS spending that will go to social enterprises founded under DH's Right to Request initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.2/6">Co-Operatives UK, the Employee Ownership Association and Local Partnerships have collaborated to establish the Mutuals Information Service, providing telephone advice and guidance to employees considering mutualisation. The service has taken hundreds of calls since its launch in November; the Cabinet Office is working closely with Central Government groups seeking to mutualise through its recently-announced Enterprise Incubator Unit. The formation of MyCSP as a Mutual Joint Venture has already been announced, and more bodies going down this route will be announced in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.224W.3/1">I have had no specific representations on this issue but I am aware that for some people the length of time to settle their child support claim is unacceptable and MPs post bags reflect this. The performance of the Child Support Agency is stable and their December 2010 quarterly summary of statistics shows that:</p>

	<p pid="b.224W.6/1">Although the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, which is also responsible for the Child Support Agency, has improved its effectiveness over the past few years, we recognise that much more needs to be done. More than 3 million children live in separated families, but only around 50% of those benefit from an effective maintenance arrangement. In addition the annual running costs of the statutory maintenance scheme is approximately &#163;460 million, on average a cost of over 40p for each &#163;1 of child maintenance collected or arranged and this does not represent value for money to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.224W.6/2">The consultation document published in January:</p>

	<p pid="b.224W.6/5">outlines our assessment of some of the issues of the current system and sets out our plans for the radical re-shaping of the child maintenance system.</p>
	<p pid="b.224W.6/6">We want to make it the norm in society that parents take responsibility for putting in place financial support for their children post separation. Research suggests that just over half of parents currently using the statutory maintenance scheme feel they could make their own financial arrangements for their children with the right help. For those families who cannot make a family-based arrangement, the Government are continuing to invest in a new streamlined child maintenance scheme to replace the existing CSA schemes in order to deliver a significantly improved service.</p>

	<p pid="b.231W.0/1">The Chancellor announced in the emergency budget that from 2011 the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be used to measure the growth in prices for the purposes of uprating disability living allowance and attendance allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.231W.0/2">We believe that the CPI is a more appropriate and stable measure of the cost of living for recipients of disability living allowance and attendance allowance than the retail price index (RPI) because the cost of goods and services which are used to measure it are more relevant to these benefit recipients. CPI is also the headline of inflation in the UK and the one that is reported in the press and is internationally recognised.</p>

	<p pid="b.235W.0/1">Local authority circular (LAC) 5/19 provides technical guidance and is not school specific. In it HSE gives advice to local authority regulators and others on the risks from asbestos to enable them to answer inquiries about possible or inadvertent exposures. It includes generic advice for employers, employees and members of the public. To that extent school staff and school children, who may be inadvertently exposed if all the required systems fail to prevent significant exposures, are covered by the advice in the LAC.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.0/2">There are no plans to revise the LAC as a direct result of the discussions of the HSE's independent advisory committee WATCH (Working Group on the Assessment of Toxic Chemicals). It has been established for some time that the lower the exposure to asbestos, the lower the risk of disease, and that based on current evidence it is not possible to identify safe thresholds. The LAC's medical advice to anyone concerned that they may have had significant exposure remains current.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.0/3">Under the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 employers are required to prevent exposure to asbestos and, if this is not reasonably practical, reduce exposure to the lowest level reasonably practicable below the control limit. Neither the WATCH conclusions, which are shortly to be published, nor the Supreme Court judgment in the recent civil law compensation case Knowsley Metropolitan borough council <i> v.</i> Willmore imply any alteration to the existing duties under the regulations are required.</p>

	<p pid="b.238W.2/1">There are advantages in paying the housing component to individuals, rather than the current system of payments direct to landlords. This would encourage people to manage their own budget in the same way as other households.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.2/2">However, we also recognise the importance of stable rental income for social landlords to support the delivery of new homes and will develop universal credit in a way that protects their financial position, Options for achieving this could include some ongoing use of direct payments to landlords, use of direct debits, and a protection mechanism which safeguards landlords' income. We will work closely with the devolved administrations, providers and lenders in developing the new system.</p>

	<p pid="b.238W.8/1">It is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Definitions of low income households are set out in the annual National Statistics publication &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot;. This reports numbers of individuals in households below or persistently below 50%, 60% and 70% of median household income both before and after deducting housing costs. One of the reasons why the median rather than the mean is used is because the median is much less affected by extreme values. Therefore any immigration of foreign-born millionaires and billionaires might have a very slight upwards effect on the median, but both the impact on the median and on the poverty statistics would be negligible.</p>

	<p pid="b.248W.5/1">The Social Security Advisory Committee recommended proceeding with some changes but delaying others until they have been considered in light of the findings of the Independent Review. We do not agree with this approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.5/2">We believe that the WCA needs to be continuously improved over time and the changes we made as a result of the Regulations (S.I. No 228 2011) are part of this improvement process. These changes were undertaken following significant consultation with technical experts and disability groups to refine the WCA.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.5/3">They improve the assessment and make the technical descriptors clearer and more consistent to apply. We also expect that they will increase the number of individuals with severe disabilities being allowed into the support group and ensure the assessment better accounts for an individual's adaptation to their condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.5/4">Since the Social Security Advisory Committee reported, Professor Harrington's independent review has also been published. We have committed to implementing all of his recommendations, many of these address concerns raised by SSAC. This will help us to further improve the WCA and refine the process.</p>

	<p pid="b.261W.8/1">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) is legally responsible for funding individual institutions. Ministers have no role in the process. Currently the council directly funds 124 of the 249 FE colleges in England. We are though seeking to encourage new providers, including FE colleges into the system. When the new funding system is introduced in 2012/13 funding will follow the informed choices of students rather than direct grant. Where colleges and other providers are able to offer high quality programmes at a price which offers good value for money, we would wish to see them able to expand. We will consult after any proposals on this are announced in the forthcoming Higher Education White Paper.</p>

However, the Department is considering how student number controls might apply in the future regulatory system, including options for a fund to support expansion of those providers which best offer students high-quality programmes at a price that represents good value. We will consult after any proposals are announced in the forthcoming Higher Education White Paper.</p>

The initiative announced by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-04">4 November 2010</phrase> is aimed at promoting the development of Tech City further as a world-leading tech cluster and, as a result, so far over a dozen leading companies and universities have committed to investing in Tech City.</p>

	<p pid="b.268W.2/3">This will include engaging further with the above mentioned companies to turn their commitment into tangible investments, and engaging with a second wave of companies to do the same; putting together propositions for the best non-UK venture capital firms and business angels to encourage them to focus on deals in the UK and to expand their operations in the UK; and identifying experienced entrepreneurs and business people to take up roles as mentors or non-executive directors to help the development of early stage companies and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.2/4">The TCIO is made up of four experienced entrepreneurs, four UKTI business specialists and four other UKTI officials. Project meetings are convened at No 10 on a weekly basis to review progress against TCIO's delivery plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.276W.2/4" class="indent">I refer you to my response dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-07">7 March 2011</phrase> to Parliamentary Question 044778:</p>
	<p pid="b.276W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Education, how many children's deaths were recorded in an Ofsted significant incident report as resulting from suspected (a) abuse and (b) neglect in (i) 2008, (ii) 2009 and (iii) 2010.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.276W.2/6" class="indent">In my response I explained that Ofsted does not hold 'significant incident reports'. However, Ofsted receives serious incident notifications from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.276W.2/7" class="indent">Data on the number of children's deaths owing to 'abuse' and 'neglect' in either serious incident notifications or serious childcare incident briefings for the period requested are not readily available and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.276W.2/8" class="indent">I provide more detail here to assist you. Serious incident notifications are made immediately after a serious incident, when it is not possible in the majority of cases to determine the exact cause of death or the possible contributory factors to the death. Such determination takes place at a later stage, as the result of post mortem or inquest processes. It would therefore be inappropriate for Ofsted staff to be asked to make judgements on these important issues in the light of information provided within the initial serious incident notifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.276W.2/9" class="indent">For these reasons, Ofsted does not detail 'cause of death' on our database. In order to ascertain individual information about each serious incident, Ofsted staff would be required to investigate each serious incident notification by reading the initial information and forming a view based only on this information. Local authorities are not obliged to update the initial information to Ofsted. Any judgement about whether a death may have been as the result of abuse and/or neglect would therefore require too great a level of subjective judgement on the part of our staff, who are dependent on the depth of information known to, and submitted by, each local authority. Such a manual interrogation of any information held would also require a level of staff time which would, as stated above, incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.282W.0/3">Once the cost of providing bursaries of &#163;1,200 to the most vulnerable groups is taken into account, &#163;165 million will be available to schools, colleges and training providers to award discretionary bursaries. This would be sufficient to provide a bursary of &#163;800 to 15% of 16 to 19-year-olds in full-time education or training, more than covering those who were eligible for free school meals in year 11.</p>

	<p pid="b.287W.2/2">The SFR provides detailed statistics for 16, 17 and 18-year-olds both separately and aggregated to 16-18 on whether they are participating in education, and if so at what type of institution, what level and type of course or programme, and type of attendance (full time or part time). Additionally, for young people who are in employment, statistics are given for whether they are also participating in education and training, either independently or funded by their employer. These statistics are calculated on an academic age basis; this means that the SFR refers to three distinct cohorts of young people in their first, second and third year post compulsory schooling. For selected statistics a time series of participation in education and/or employment is available from 1985, updated each year, with the most recently published figures relating to the end of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/3">Further, statistical tables are published in addition to the main SFR that disaggregate participation in education (but not employment) into the local authority of residence of the young person. These are available for 16 and 17-year-olds in a time series extending back to 1994. Most recently figures were published for end 2009, with further updates planned annually every second or third week in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/4">Separately, the Department releases figures for the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) at local authority level. The data are based on operational data currently collected by local authorities. The result of this data collection is the Client Caseload Information System (CCIS), which is used by local authorities to keep track of the participation of individual young people in their area. CCIS enables local authorities to assess whether the young person is currently in education, training or employment, and whether an offer of education and training has been made, or for young people who are NEET whether an appropriate intervention has been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.287W.2/5">The Department is committed to continue publishing participation data in the forms described above. The next release of the SFR showing the participation of 16-18-year-olds at the end of 2010 is planned for June 2011, with a disaggregation into local authority areas for 16 and 17-year-olds to follow in March 2012. Similarly, CCIS will continue to be the means by which local authorities collect and record offers of education and training for young people.</p>

This will report towards the end of the 2011 and copies will be placed in the House Libraries. Our initial view, however, is that, while the programme has been effective in helping to raise school standards it was expensive and adopted an approach that was too centralised.</p>
	<p pid="b.290W.2/2">The recent Schools White Paper: 'The Importance of Teaching' set out our view that the primary responsibility for school improvement should rest with schools. The wider system should be designed so that our best schools and leaders can take on greater responsibility, leading improvement work across the system. We are putting the building blocks of a self improving school system in place, increasing the numbers of Teaching Schools and National and Local Leaders of Education and intervening only where schools are under-performing.</p>

In addition to this, the Charity Commission has published a Statement of Recommended Practice which clarifies how charities should prepare their accounts in order to reflect these legal requirements. This states that charities which are subject to a statutory audit should include a note in their accounts disclosing the number of employees whose pay was &#163;60,000 or above, presented in &#163;10,000 bandings.

	<p pid="b.295W.0/1">The Control of Asbestos Regulations and the Codes of Practice published by HSE do not differentiate between the risks at different levels of exposure to asbestos fibres. No exposure level is deemed to be safe. The Regulations and Codes of Practice require all reasonable steps to be taken to manage asbestos to prevent exposure to all types of asbestos fibres, and cover school buildings. Therefore no guidance is currently issued by the Department on the level of exposure to asbestos that constitutes a risk to school staff and children.</p>
	<p pid="b.295W.0/2">The Department has however asked the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Partnerships for Schools to produce a website to develop the awareness among key personnel of their responsibilities in relation to asbestos in schools. The intended users of the website are head teachers, governors, teachers, support staff; and those local authority officers identified as duty holders under the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006. The objectives of the website are to ensure that all these groups are aware of their responsibilities and of the risks if asbestos is not managed properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.295W.0/3">In the event of asbestos fibres being found, the school or local authority should refer to HSE guidance note Local Authority Circular 5/19 &quot;The level of risk from occupational exposure to asbestos: guidance for HSE and LA staff when responding to enquiries&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.304W.2/1">Subject to its successful passage, the Education Bill will abolish the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) and repeal all of its statutory duties and powers as set out in Part 3 and Schedule 3 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.304W.2/2">From April 2012, the YPLA's functions will become the responsibility of the Secretary of State and its funding functions will be administered by a new Education Funding Agency (EFA). The EFA will be established as an executive agency within the Department for Education. It will be responsible for calculating and distributing funding directly to all academies, free schools and providers of 16-19 education and training. The EFA will also distribute resources to local authorities for them to pass on, as now, to those primary and secondary schools that are not yet academies.</p>
	<p pid="b.304W.2/3">The Education Bill also sets out changes to provisions in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. It proposes that the YPLA's power to intervene in sixth form colleges and associated duties in respect of an intervention policy should be repealed, also with its power to appoint members to a sixth form college's governing body. The requirement for sixth form colleges to gain consent of the YPLA before they exercise their supplementary powers in relation to certain investments, borrowing and related matters would be removed. The Bill transfers to the Secretary of State the YPLA's powers in respect of instruments and articles of government of a new sixth form college and amendments to instruments and articles of existing colleges. It also transfers to the Secretary of State the YPLA's power to make payments to local authorities in relation to certain loan liabilities. The Secretary of State's duty to consult the YPLA before making an order dissolving a further education corporation or sixth form college would also be repealed.</p>

	<p pid="b.328W.5/2">Expenditure on public service pensions reflects the pensions promises made to public servants over the last few decades and is dependent on a range of factors including the number of pensions in payment, the size of these pensions and also annual inflation.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.5/3">Contribution receipts reflect the promises being made to today's public servants and are dependent on the number of individuals accruing a pension and the salaries they earn.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.5/4">Receipts and expenditure are not expected to balance. For example, the level of receipts can exceed expenditure when a work force is growing. This is a separate issue to the long-term sustainability of a scheme, which is to do with the ability of the scheme to meet liabilities as they fall due.</p>
	<p pid="b.328W.5/5">Detailed information and data, including past levels of expenditure and receipts, for individual public service pension schemes is available from the relevant Government Department, and for many of the schemes is published in annual resource accounts, copies of which are placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.334W.5/1">The Government have not received any representations on this matter. Many amateur sports clubs have been able to register with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) as Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs) and benefit from a range of tax reliefs, similar to the tax reliefs normally given to charities. These reliefs include exemption from corporation tax on interest, on trading income and income from property (within limits) and capital gains tax on disposals of assets. There are a number of specific VAT reliefs for charities including the construction of certain buildings. Unfortunately, there are no equivalent VAT reliefs for CASCs. The application of VAT reliefs is governed by European agreements that have been signed by successive governments. Under these agreements, we cannot extend or introduce new zero rates to cover supplies to CASCs.</p>

	<p pid="b.348W.0/1">The application process for the Communities Against Gangs, Guns and Knives Fund opened on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-25">25 March 2011</phrase>. The Fund will provide &#163;4 million to voluntary and community sector organisations working across England and Wales to reduce gang, gun and knife related violence by young people over the next two years. The new fund provides &#163;0.5 million more per year than the Community Fund and is open to organisations based in any part of England and Wales, rather than just the 10 areas covered by the Tackling Knives Action Programme in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.348W.0/2">The criteria for the fund are focused on organisations working with young people at risk of involvement in gang, gun and knife crime or to support those who are already involved to leave that lifestyle. Organisations supported by the Community Fund will be eligible to bid for the new fund for two years' funding. Those with a proven track record will be well placed to meet the criteria. Each successful organisation will receive grants of &#163;10,000 each per year. Existing Community Fund recipients and other interested voluntary and community based organisations have been asked to lodge their applications by the closing date of <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-15">15 April 2011</phrase>.</p>

However, during negotiations at official level we have made dear that we are keen to see the adoption of a strong convention that will protect and promote human rights worldwide. We are not convinced that the convention as currently drafted achieves those aims and discussions continue in other meetings with our Council of Europe partners on how our concerns may be best addressed.</p>

	<p pid="b.351W.6/1">In the Government's strategic vision to end violence against women and girls, published in November 2010, we committed &#163;28 million of Home Office funding for specialist services on a stable basis over the next four years. This money will be used to improve the response to rape and domestic violence, provide more training and early intervention programmes, introduce new powers and provide better support for victims. As part of this commitment, we have almost doubled the number of Home Office funded Independent Sexual Violence Advisors from 44 to 87. For domestic violence the funding will be used to contribute to existing and new Independent Domestic Violence Adviser and Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences Co-ordinator posts. There will also be continued funding for the National Domestic Violence Helpline, Men's Advice Line and Broken Rainbow helpline. Separate funding has also been allocated to continue and enhance support provided by the Sojourner Project during 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="b.351W.6/2">In addition, the Ministry of Justice recently announced the provision over the next three years of up to &#163;10.5 million in grant funding for existing rape support centres. Also, in the first phase of a wider programme of work to develop new rape support centres where there are gaps in provision, up to &#163;600,000 in funding will be provided over the next 12 months to develop new centres in Hereford, Trafford, Devon and Dorset.</p>

	<p pid="b.362W.3/2">There are several factors that are likely to affect the net income of police officers over the next two years. The Government's policy is to freeze the pay of public sector workers earning over &#163;21,000 for two years. We would expect this to apply to police officers, but will take account of any recommendations from the Police Negotiating Board. We have also recently received the first part of Tom Winsor's review of remuneration and conditions of service for police officers and staff, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-08">8 March 2011</phrase>. This report contains a number of recommendations on police officer and staff pay. Before any of them could be implemented they would be subject to consideration by the police negotiating machinery. The Secretary of State for the Home Department said in her written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2011-03-31.37"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 37-38WS</phrase>, that she will direct the Police Negotiating Board and Police Advisory Board for England and Wales to consider the proposals that are within their respective remits for police officers in England and Wales. It would not be appropriate to pre-empt that consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.362W.3/3">In response to Lord Hutton's interim report, the Government has also announced its intention to increase the employee contributions of public sector workers by, on average, around three percentage points. The proposed increase would be phased in over three years from April 2012. Any increase in the pension contributions for police officers would be subject to consultation with the Police Negotiating Board.</p>

	<p pid="b.367W.5/1">These data are shown in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="b.367W.5/2">Due to changes in recording practice, data on police recorded offences are not comparable across the period requested. The counting rules for recorded crime were revised in April 1998 and the coverage was expanded. Trends were also affected by the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002, which required the police to record a crime unless there was &quot;no credible evidence to the contrary&quot;. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 in May 2004 also altered the definition and coverage of sexual offences, including rape.</p>
	<p pid="b.367W.5/3">Data on police recorded offences of rape for each year since 1997 by police force area are provided in Table A. Data on domestic violence incidents reported to the police have been collected by the Home Office since 2003-04 and the available data are provided in Table B. Some data have been estimated due to lack of provision of data from police forces. All estimated figures are indicated in the table. Data for earlier years are not available centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.367W.5/4">Detection rates are a ratio of crimes detected in a period to crimes recorded in a period. They are not based on tracking whether individual crimes recorded in a period have eventually been detected.</p>
	<p pid="b.367W.5/5">In addition to the recorded crime revisions mentioned above, detection data trends have also been affected by additional changes. Revised guidance on detections was issued in April 1999 which formalised detection procedures, placing a greater emphasis on the evidential basis on which detections can be claimed.</p>
	<p pid="b.367W.5/6">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very small limited set of circumstances. This has significantly reduced the number of non-sanction detections which has been reflected in the overall detection rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.367W.5/7">The Home Office carried out research published in July 2007 which found that the reduction in detection rates was likely to be largely due to changes in recording practices resulting from the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard, counting rules and detections guidance (Feist et al, 2007).</p>
	<p pid="b.367W.5/8">Detection rates for rape offences are provided in Table C. Detection rates for domestic violence offences are not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="b.388W.5/1">As the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU does not create any new justiciable rights or change the current status of fundamental rights as they apply in EU law, the Government do not believe it would be a cost effective use of resources to estimate the proportion of UK residents that do not feel well informed about the Charter.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.5/2">The Charter and the Lisbon treaty have not changed the content or effect of EU fundamental rights as they apply in EU law. It has long been recognised that fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Court of Human Rights and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the member states, constitute general principles of EU law (as confirmed by Article 6(3) TEU). The Charter and the Lisbon treaty do not give the European Court of Justice or national courts any new powers to strike down national laws and practices for breaching fundamental rights. Furthermore, the UK is required to comply with the fundamental rights restated in the Charter only when it is giving effect to EU law, reflecting the long-standing case law of the European Court of Justice. These limits on the effects of the Charter are confirmed by both Protocol No 30 to the treaties and the terms of the Charter and the treaties themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.392W.0/1">The bilateral relationship with India sits on solid foundations, and the UK is committed to making this partnership stronger, wider and deeper to mutual benefit. Since my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's visit, and the summit with Indian Prime Minister Singh in July 2010, we have set in train an ambitious agenda of practical co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.0/2">A number of further visits, including by Cabinet Ministers, have taken place in both directions. A significant UK trade delegation accompanied the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Dr Cable)</phrase>, on a visit to India in January for the annual Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) talks. In February, the India-UK Chief Executive Officers (CEO) Forum met for the first time, with CEOs from both countries discussing ways to improve bilateral trade and investment with the Prime Minister and other Ministers. This was followed by a first visit by the Minister for Trade and Investment, my noble Friend Lord Green, to India in March. One of the largest ever foreign investment deals in India was announced in March when BP signed a new $7.2 billion oil and gas partnership with Reliance Industries.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.0/3">A new phase in the UK/India education and research initiative will further enhance co-operation between educational institutions and provide a platform for the increased ties in science and technology that will help drive economic growth on both sides. Co-operation also continues in the areas of defence, counter terrorism and climate change. India's new membership of the UN Security Council also provides an opportunity to engage even more closely on key international issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.0/4">In the next 12 months, we expect to support an ever-increasing number of firms doing business in and investigating the Indian market to encourage progress toward the agreed target to double trade by 2015. We will support trade missions both ways, work with relevant bodies such as the UK India Business Council (UKIBC), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), and the Indian High Commission to promote opportunities, and encourage greater collaboration and business through Government-to-Government mechanisms such as the next PM-PM summit, economic and financial dialogue, JETCO and CEO Forum. We will also promote the successful conclusion of an EU-India Free Trade Agreement and work with India towards a conclusion of the Doha Round, which will give rise to trade opportunities for both countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.395W.2/1">Each evacuation takes place in different circumstances and under different constraints. This makes it difficult to compare evacuations directly. In Lebanon in 2006, some 4,500 persons, including around 2,000 British nationals, were safely evacuated by British forces, the majority by sea. The recent crises in Tunisia and Egypt were examples of how we have assisted the departure of British nationals from a country without reaching the stage of a formal evacuation. In Tunisia we worked closely with tour operators to repatriate more than 3,000 British nationals. In Egypt we helped over 2,000 British nationals to leave the country by commercial means and arranged two charter flights to facilitate the departure of a further 200 British nationals and their dependants. In Libya, around 140 British nationals were evacuated by sea and over 450 by air, using a combination of civilian and military flights. In addition, over 150 British nationals were evacuated from remote desert locations using military assets. In total the UK evacuated over 1,600 people from Libya, including nationals from 54 countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.395W.2/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) always carries out a lessons learned exercise following any crisis, including evacuations. Additionally, the FCO is carrying out a review of arrangements for leading an evacuation of British nationals in a crisis. The review will consider the contingency arrangements that the FCO has in place and the triggers and procedures for moving to a crisis footing and mounting civilian and military evacuation operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.396W.0/1">The Government strongly condemn the continued prevalence of anti-Semitism around the world and promote policies to tackle this through a range of international organisations. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's overseas missions have a responsibility to monitor and raise human rights in their host countries and routinely raise our concerns with host Governments, including freedom of religion or belief when appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.396W.0/2">Attitudes towards Jewish people across the Arab world are linked to attitudes towards Israel. We receive independent research on these issues from institutions such as Chatham House, Carnegie Middle East Centre and the Brookings Institute. The latter, in association with the University of Maryland, produced a report last autumn mapping Arab public opinion towards Israel, across six Arab states, from 2008 until 2010. They reported that in 2010 just over half of the respondents were prepared for peace with Israel upon a successful conclusion of the peace process.</p>

	<p pid="b.398W.0/1">Leaked fuel oil from the wreck of the MV Oliva has washed ashore on Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands. It has impacted both protected wildlife and the fisheries on which the islands' economy relies. The Tristan Authorities and community are working hard to help the wildlife affected by the oil. The greatest impact has so far been on the Northern Rockhopper penguins, some 4,000 of which have been moved to Tristan Island for cleaning and rehabilitation. The fisheries at Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands will remain closed until testing has been completed. The full impact on the wildlife and fisheries will take time to assess.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.0/2">The responsibility to clean up the damage caused to the environment of the Tristan da Cunha islands, and to compensate the Tristan community for any losses lies with the ship's owners and insurers. We are determined that they will continue to meet this responsibility in full. We have also been in close touch with the Tristan da Cunha Authorities throughout and are ensuring that they have all the advice and support they need from across Government and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.0/3">While the Government are quite clear that all costs resulting from this incident must be borne by the owners and insurers of the vessel, a top-up to Tristan da Cunha's financial reserves of &#163;500,000 has been made from Foreign and Commonwealth Office funds to protect the community against immediate and short-term expenditure. A salvage tug carried the first material for the clean up to the islands. Additional equipment and personnel arrived at Tristan Island on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-04">4 April 2011</phrase> and a further vessel carrying supplies reached Tristan on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-12">12 April</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.399W.8/2">The Council President's budget is part of the general budget of the European Council and Council of Ministers (Section II of the European Union budget). For 2012, the Council has proposed savings of 4.4% which we have welcomed, although we believe that the Council should go even further. Indeed, the EU institutions must set an example of reform, with a robust value for money drive, in line with the austerity measures and public spending reprioritisation in member states.</p>

	<p pid="b.405W.8/1">Due to the increased threat to our embassy staff the visa section was forced to close in October 2010. There were a number of outstanding visa applications at this time. Consequently, a temporary visa officer was despatched to Sana'a to work through outstanding visa applications. All non-settlement applications were taken to the visa hub in Abu Dhabi for processing. Once decisions were reached, all documentation was couriered either directly to the applicants or via the embassy in Sana'a. Embassy staff in Sana'a notified all applicants of settlement visas, and those whose paperwork was returned to the British embassy in Sana'a, that they should attend the embassy to collect their paperwork and receive full refunds where appropriate. There are no outstanding documents or applications in Sana'a other than those awaiting collection by the applicants.</p>
	<p pid="b.405W.8/2">Visa applicants are responsible for applying to alternative visa points. Yemeni nationals have been able to apply on-line to a number of regional Visa Application Centres (VACs) including Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Cairo and Amman. All visa centres ensure supporting documentation is safely couriered to applicants when the visa process is concluded. If the VACs are unable to deliver visas, passports and other documentation by post, for instance if the address is incomplete, they send them to the British embassy in Sana'a. The applicants are contacted and asked to collect papers. Due to heightened concerns over security, access to the Embassy was not permitted for a period, but this is now possible, and those needing to collect applications have been contacted and informed.</p>
