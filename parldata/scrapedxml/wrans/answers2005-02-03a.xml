	<p pid="a.1008W.8/1">There are currently no changes proposed in respect of the role played by the custody sergeant as set out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). We are, however, proposing under Clause 111 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill that chief officers of police should be able to develop a more flexible approach to the staffing of their custody suites by making use of police staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.8/2">The Thematic Inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary published in July 2004 on Workforce Modernisation concluded that the role of police staff could be extended to perform that of the custody officer. The Report recognised the importance of suitable training and transitional arrangements; and identified that the ability to use staff custody officers would enable the release of experienced supervisors to front-line duties and could strengthen the independence of the custody officer role as set out in PACE.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008W.8/3">We are proposing to ensure that these benefits can be fully assessed through establishing a programme of pilot sites looking at selection, training and practical application at the police station.</p>

If the UK civil authorities are dealing with a case, then the Army Chain of Command will not normally seek to intervene. Queens Regulation 7.007b, which refers to dangerous driving as involving a risk to the general public, points to such a case being dealt with by the civil authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.3/3">In terms of jurisdiction, Section 70 of the Army Act 1955 applies the range of criminal offences to all personnel subject to military law, rendering a soldier liable for trial by court-martial for an offence contrary to English criminal law. Exceptions to this apply to a number of serious offences, which if they are alleged to have been committed in the UK must be tried by the civil authorities. Other offences alleged to have been committed in the UK may alternatively be tried by the civil authorities.</p>

The process renders the risk to equipment and personnel as low as reasonably practical (ALARP), in accordance with statutory Health and Safety requirements. In addition, there is extensive guidance, both general and specific to platforms and to weapon systems, contained in various Royal Navy publications such as BRdl043&mdash;Gunnery and Guided Weapon Practices&mdash;User Instructions.

	<p pid="a.1016W.8/1">The only Panther vehicle the Army is receiving is the Panther command and liaison vehicle. This will be used mainly for a variety of command and liaison roles, and is not primarily a reconnaissance vehicle. It will, however, be used in some formations for tasks such as engineer reconnaissance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.8/2">Panther is a wheeled vehicle, and its required top speed is 110 km/h on tarmac roads and 30 km/h cross country. It is being procured in two variants, known as Group 2 and Group 3, and depending on the role it will be crewed by between two and four soldiers. Group 2 variants, which are to be used in higher threat roles, will be armed with a General Purpose Machine Gun mounted in an Overhead Weapon Station with a thermal imager, while Group 3 variants will have no vehicle armament. Panther will have suitable armour for its role, but the specification of the armour is classified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.8/3">BAE Systems Land Systems is the lead contractor for the project, and 401 Panther vehicles (326 Group 2 and 75 Group 3) have been ordered, at a basic cost (excluding VAT) of &pound;320,000 each for Group 2 and &pound;240,000 each for Group 3. This does not include the cost of Bowman radios and some other equipment. The overall cost of the programme is &pound;193 million.</p>

I referred to continuing discussions with Swan Hunter, which had in fact concluded. I now wish to correct the record and confirm that a &pound;84 million amendment was made to the contract with Swan Hunter following value for money considerations and to ensure the delivery of the new Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) capability. This decision followed the programme encountering technical difficulties. The revised contract is not a financial support package for Swan Hunter but one that offers the best value for money to the taxpayer in the delivery of these ships.</p>

	<p pid="a.1019W.4/1">The Department has followed the approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in supporting the use of climate change scenarios to project future impacts at various levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.4/2">The UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) was set up to facilitate an integrated assessment of the impacts of climate change in the UK through the production of a common set of tools, including climate change scenarios, and through shared expertise. This assessment has progressed through regional and sectoral studies led by stakeholder partnerships. A report summarising the results from UKCIP studies will be published later this year, and copies made available in the Libraries of both Houses. Further information about UK regional and sectoral climate change impacts is available from <a href="http://www.ukcip.org.uk">www.ukcip.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.4/3">From time-to-time, I convene a group of UK experts on climate change to produce an academic review of the impacts of climate change in the UK. The last such review was in 1996, prior to the establishment of the UKCIP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.4/4">In terms of impacts for the world as a whole, the Department contributes to the definitive assessments of this type, those developed by the IPCC. Specifically, the Department funds the Technical Support Unit for Working Group II (on climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability), provides support for the UK co-chair of this working group and also funds the Data Distribution Centre that makes the results from the IPCC available to climate researchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.4/5">Other work that has been conducted or supported by the Department in assessing the impacts of climate change is summarised in Defra's Global Atmosphere Division Research Programme Annual Report (the latest publication was for 2002&ndash;03), which is available in the Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1022W.2/2">The UK National Allocation Plan (NAP) was submitted to the Commission in April 2004 and was approved on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>. The NAP clearly stated that the figure for the total number of allowances to be allocated was provisional pending finalisation of the emissions projections, the review of Climate Change Agreement targets, and the receipt of verified data from installations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.2/3">Although we are still awaiting a formal response from the Commission on the proposed amendments to the NAP (submitted <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-10">10 November 2004</phrase>), the EU Emissions Trading Scheme has commenced operation. Under the terms of their greenhouse gas emissions permits which were issued during the course of last year, operators began monitoring their carbon dioxide emissions on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January</phrase> this year. There has been an active market in contracts for future delivery of emissions allowances for some time. UK operators will be able to trade on the spot&quot; market once allowances have been issued, which is anticipated to be at the end of March. We plan to announce the installation allocations in early February which will provide UK operators with greater certainty about their allocation. The delay in trading will not affect the fact that operators covered by the Scheme will be required to surrender allowances in line with their carbon dioxide emissions for 2005, as the first year of Phase 1 of the Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.2/4">Other member states have also found the implementation of the scheme challenging. Denmark is the only country which is currently in a position to spot trade, and a number of other member states expect to be in a position to spot trade by the end of February. Italy, the Czech Republic, Poland and Greece are yet to receive approval of their NAP from the European Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1022W.5/1">The UK National Allocation Plan (NAP) was submitted to the European Commission in April 2004, and was approved in July. The total number of allowances to be allocated was set at 0.7 per cent. below the projected UK emissions 2005&ndash;07. The NAP clearly stated that this figure (total number of allowances) was provisional and based on interim projections.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.5/2">Following the finalisation of energy projections, UK emissions 2005&ndash;07 are now estimated to be 56 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub> higher than was estimated in April. The Government have proposed to increase the total number of allowances, but just by 20 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub> . The effect of this is to increase the level of effort required from our NAP to 5 per cent. below projected emissions, making the UK NAP a more ambitious plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.5/3">The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is one of the measures in place to help us achieve our national goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in CO <sub>2</sub> on 1990 levels by 2010. We hope to use the Climate Change Programme review to determine the number of allowances to be issued to UK installations in Phase 2 of the Scheme (2008&ndash;12).</p>

	<p pid="a.1023W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.5/2">We have increased flood defence and coast erosion funding to the Environment Agency and other operating authorities up from &pound;312 million in 1997&ndash;98 and set to rise to &pound;570 million next year and for each of the following two years. However, although building and maintaining physical defences will reduce the risk of flooding, that risk can never be completely eliminated. Plans exist at local, regional and central levels to respond to potential and actual flood events.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.5/3">In addition to building and maintaining defences, the Environment Agency maintains its own local, regional and national level contingency plans to deal with potential or actual flooding. As part of its remit, the Agency also maintains a flood warning system to ensure as high a level of preparedness as possible by the public and the local, regional and central responders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.5/4">At the national level, Defra has the lead Department role for flood emergencies and our Lead Department Plan sets out the co-ordination arrangements at local, regional and central levels for flooding from rivers or the sea. Alongside this Plan other Departments and Agencies maintain their own plans in their areas of responsibility to respond to, for example, the consequences of floods. There are also provisions for Government co-ordination when necessary through the arrangements operated by the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.5/5">The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 formalises a number of duties on local authorities, the emergency services and other organisations involved, including the Environment agency, in responding to any emergency. Among these are contingency planning and risk assessment for emergencies at the local level, including flooding: for example, local flood response plans were activated in the case of both the Boscastle flood in August last year and the January 2005 Carlisle flood.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.5/6">The Government have also set up a Regional Resilience Team in each of the English regions to enhance the co-ordination of planning for wide impact events, such as major flooding, and to improve lines of communication between central Government and local responders during the response to an incident. These arrangements worked successfully in relation to the Boscastle and Carlisle floods.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.5/7">The Environment Agency, with other responders, also carries out a regular programme of exercises to test its capability at all levels. Last year, EA led a national level exercise&mdash;Exercise Triton&mdash;to test the preparedness of organisations at all levels, local, regional and national to a simulated national scale event involving flooding of the East Coast from Lincolnshire to Hampshire, with offsets in Gwent and North Wales. A lessons identified report will be published in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.1029W.0/1">The precise scale of likely damage which could be caused by a tsunami type wave is difficult to predict as this would depend on both size and origin. However, the flood maps published on the internet by the Environment Agency now show the potential extent of an extreme flood (estimated at a 0.1 per cent. or 1 in 1,000 annual probability) for all coastal areas of England. While this was never intended to cover tsunami-type events, these maps are clearly indicative of the areas most at risk in such an occurrence. Assessments of such risks for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are matters for the devolved Administrations. However, the Environment Agency Flood maps also cover Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.1029W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029W.3/2">These UN resolutions relate to a variety of sustainable development and environmental issues considered by the UN General Assembly over the course of the last eight years. The majority are Second Committee resolutions (relating to economic and sustainable development matters), which are traditionally proposed by the Group of 77 countries. With the exception of resolution A/RES/55/8&mdash;on which a vote was called (the UK/EU voted in favour)&mdash;all of the resolutions were adopted by consensus. So the UK supported the adoption of all of the resolutions referred to in the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029W.3/3">Co-sponsorship usually reflects a degree of approval beyond mere acceptance of a consensus (the EU often, but not always, co-ordinates on which resolutions merit co-sponsorship by member states, even though co-sponsorship is recorded individually). We do not hold centrally information on those resolutions the UK/EU has co-sponsored or proposed. However, co-sponsorship details can be accessed publicly through the UN documentation centre at <a href="http://www.un.org">www.un.org</a>.documents. Details of the individual countries or groups that proposed, or introduced&quot;, a resolution can also be obtained from this source.</p>

	<p pid="a.1030W.2/1">The Office of Water Services have not directly assessed the impact of household insurance on supply pipe leakage. However, they have reported that leakage from householders' supply pipes accounted for about 28 per cent. of total water company leakage in 2003&ndash;04. The numbers of repairs and replacements of householders' supply pipes and the proportion of leakage attributed to households' supply pipes have been at similar levels over the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030W.2/2">A total of 52,907 repairs and 6,472 replacements of household supply pipes were undertaken in 2003&ndash;04. Some 91 per cent. of repairs and 46 per cent. of replacements of household supply pipes were carried out by water companies free of charge. Where charges are made, these may be covered by household insurance policies such as those promoted by some water companies.</p>

In the same period awards totalling &pound;81 million have been made to local authorities for projects submitted under the Rural Bus Challenge scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1038W.8/2">A number of other initiatives have been of particular relevance to transport provision in rural areas. In 2002 we extended eligibility to Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) to a wide range of community transport operations. Some 700 community transport groups are now claiming the grant, many of them in rural areas. Last year we introduced changes to regulations making it easier to provide flexible and demand responsive bus services and making these services eligible for BSOG. We have also issued guidance to authorities on the introduction of accessibility planning which provides a framework for improving accessibility in rural areas and elsewhere.</p>

The estimated budget for 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;28.2 million. The reason for the increase in expenditure between 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 is because the ALI was building up to full capacity with substantial increases in inspection activity for both DfES and Jobcentre Plus.</p>

	<p pid="a.1046W.2/1">DFID fully recognises the key contribution that civil society organisations (CSO) have to play in tackling HIV and AIDS. We are therefore actively working to promote CSO involvement in national AIDS responses. We are, for example, working to find ways to help the flow of resources from national AIDS commissions to NGOs and CSOs. These, including faith-based organisations, have an important role in helping to meet the needs of children affected by AIDS&mdash;orphans and vulnerable children&mdash;in terms of protection, care and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1046W.2/2">At the Global Partners' Forum on orphans and vulnerable children held in Washington DC in December 2004, I announced how the UK would meet our target of spending at least &pound;150 million over the next three years to meet the needs of orphans and vulnerable children. Most of this will be spent in Africa where the impacts of AIDS on children are most severe. DFID will mainly be providing funds though our country programmes to support national responses. We are however, already providing funds through NGOs to support vulnerable children in Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In a number of countries, such as Kenya and Zimbabwe, we are supporting the rapid assessment analysis and action plan process (RAAAP), which has been led by UNICEF. This has resulted in the development of 16 national action plans for orphans and vulnerable children. Effective civil society involvement in their implementation is an important issue for us and we will be working with UNICEF to ensure that civil society organisations are appropriately included in these programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1046W.2/3">An additional means of ensuring that civil society organisations are appropriately involved in responding to the needs of children affected by AIDS will be provided as we renew our agreements with key UK NGOs such as HelpAge International and Save the Children to include relevant AIDS-related work as a key objective. Out of the 18 partnership agreements we have with UK-based NGOs, 14 have specific objectives on HIV and AIDS.

	<p pid="a.1047W.0/1">Both DFID and the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) recognise the benefits of consultation. It can improve the design of projects and policies, and increase developing countries' ownership of their own development.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/2">The IFIs have a diverse range of consultation guidelines for different types of policies and projects; DFID believes that this is appropriate. The EU guidelines on consultation also specifically state that</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/3" class="indent">the method and extent of the consultation performed must always be proportionate to the impact of the proposal subject to consultation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/4">DFID does not believe it is appropriate to impose domestic guidelines on a multilateral organisation. Instead, we work with multilateral organisations to encourage them to make their consultations more transparent and comprehensive. In particular, we encourage IFIs to consult widely with affected parties, allowing an appropriate amount of time both for consultation and feedback. DFID also stresses the importance of ensuring that the consultation is tailored to local needs. In the ongoing negotiations of the 14th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), the arm of the World Bank which lends to the world's poorest countries, the UK has been pushing for strengthened documentation of stakeholder feedback from consultations required under the World Bank's safeguard policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.0/5">DFID believes that this approach works. For example, we successfully encouraged the Asian Development Bank to carry out extensive internal and external consultations on its Inspection Function. Consultation documents were posted on the Bank's website for comment; public consultation meetings were held with a wide range of people, including those affected by the project; and consultation workshops were held in 10 of the Bank's member countries. The Bank recognised how valuable this consultation process was, and later held extensive consultations on its public information and disclosure policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1048W.2/1">The joint World Health Organisation (WHO) and World Bank World report on road traffic injury prevention brings much needed attention to the global impact of road accidents on low and middle income countries. DFID welcomes the UN resolution on Improving Road Safety noting the recommendations of the World Report and inviting the WHO to act as co-ordinator on road safety issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1048W.2/2">The Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP) was established to increase awareness of road safety and promote sustainable reductions in death and injury on roads in developing and transition countries. DFID has supported the GRSP since it was founded in 1999. Our support in recent years has reduced as this partnership between businesses, civil society and Governments has become established drawing in contributions from a growing membership and our support is set to end in March this year. Since 1997, DFID has also supported a number of research projects under the theme improve transport safety and reduce the impact of accidents particularly for poor people in rural and urban areas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1048W.2/3">DFID is currently leading on setting up a new Transport Knowledge Partnership (TKP), which will serve as a means of disseminating knowledge on transport in the developing countries. The TKP will be launched later this month in Manila and is intended to become a common platform for development agencies and governments to share transport related knowledge and lessons, including road safety activities such as GRSP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1048W.2/4">DFID has maintained constant support to the transport sectors of developing countries. The funding we have provided has been in the region of &pound;50 million to &pound;60 million year on year since 1997. However as the total bilateral spend has doubled from 1997 to the present, the percentage allocated has fallen from 5.7 per cent. in 1997&ndash;98 to 2.1 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04. In addition to this project expenditure, DFID contributions to the multilateral donor organisations support the transport sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1048W.2/5">Road transport forms approximately 40 per cent. of the transport portfolio. The following table gives expenditure for road-transport related projects for each year since 1997. The table also shows expenditure on road safety related projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.1050W.5/1">The UK's initiative aims to provide full relief on multilateral debt service so that no country committed to poverty reduction has to choose between servicing their debt and funding development. The UK will pay 10 per cent. of the debt service owed to the International Development Association (IDA) and African Development Fund (AfDF) on behalf of eligible countries. All low income countries with a demonstrated commitment to use additional resources provided by debt relief could be eligible. These countries are those that have reached Completion Point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and all other IDA-only (i.e. eligible to borrow only from the most concessional lending arm of the World Bank) Low-Income Countries (LICs) that have a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) approved by the World Bank. Sri Lanka has also been added in light of the impact of the South East Asia tsunami.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.5/2">The list of currently eligible countries comprises 15 post-Completion Point HIPCs, four IDA-only LICs with PRSCs, and Sri Lanka. The initiative is effective from the start of 2005 covering debt service through to 2015, when a review will consider further needs. The UK's share of debt service payments for the currently eligible countries over the next three years will be around US $161 million. The cost to the UK for these countries through to 2015 will be US $884 million. This represents the minimum cost to the UK of this initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.5/3">As more countries progress through the HIPC Initiative, or have PRSCs approved, the list of eligible countries will expand. The cost to the UK through to 2015 for all countries that could potentially qualify would be US $1,921 million. This represents the maximum cost to the UK of this initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.5/4">Tanzania has formally completed the HIPC process and is therefore currently eligible to benefit from this relief. The UK will pay 10 per cent. of its debt service costs to IDA and the AfDF, which will amount to approximately US$ 14 million over the next three years, and US $74 million through to 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.5/5">The UK is calling on all developed countries to join us in this initiative to provide full relief on multilateral debt service. For the World Bank and African Development Bank the cost of this full relief through to 2015 for currently eligible countries would be US $8.8 billion and US $19.2 billion for all potentially eligible countries. Full relief on debts owed to the International Monetary Fund could add up to another US $5 billion through to 2015 and the UK is proposing that this be financed by a sale or revaluation of the International Monetary Fund's gold reserves.</p>

	<p pid="a.1056W.2/1">Most of the matters for which the Department is responsible in England have been devolved in Scotland to the Scottish Executive. However, there are some reserved areas in which the Government have introduced initiatives which affect Edinburgh, North and Leith.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/2">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/3">In November 2000 we introduced free television licenses for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Edinburgh, North and Leith with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was &pound;2,810.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/4">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing Department for Culture, Media and Sport gambling premises to Licensing Boards. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and Licensing Boards will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Edinburgh, North, and Leith, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/5">No statistics are available for international visits or expenditure by constituency. However, VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination benefit all parts of the country, including Edinburgh, North and Leith.</p>

	<p pid="a.1057W.2/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Kingston upon Hull, North since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/2">In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. A school sport partnership involving eight School Sport Co-ordinators and 47 Primary Link teachers is based at St. Mary's College in Kingston upon Hull, North, which received a Sport England Lottery grant of over &pound;390,000 towards its costs. St. Mary's College has also benefited from a Sport England grant of almost &pound;2.5 million to improve its sports facilities, and over 40 sports projects in Kingston upon Hull, North have benefited from Awards for All grants worth over &pound;140,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Funding to Arts Council England, Yorkshire and the Humber has increased by 85 per cent. since 1997&ndash;98. Kingston upon Hull, North has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals in Kingston upon Hull, including regular funding for the Hull Truck Theatre and Hull Time Based Arts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/4">Schools in Kingston upon Hull, North were included in the first phase of the Creative, Partnerships programme which began in 2002. Creative Partnerships aims to give school children and their teachers the opportunity to explore their creativity by working on sustained projects with creative organisations and individuals, including artists, theatre companies, dance studios, museums, orchestras, film-makers and historic buildings. Funding of &pound;65 million was allocated for the period 2002&ndash;05 to develop Creative Partnerships, and the programme will receive at least a further &pound;86 million in 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/5">Schools in Kingston upon Hull, North also benefit from the Humber Youth Music Action Zone, know as Music4U, which is run by a consortium of local authorities, including Kingston upon Hull City Council, and the National Centre for Early Music. Music4U was set up in September 2001 and has so far been awarded three grants totalling over &pound;760,000. It has already reached over 15,000 children and young people, 85 per cent. of whom were first-time participants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/6">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Kingston upon Hull North will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/7">Kingston upon Hull, North also benefits from museums initiatives in Kingston upon Hull. Kingston upon Hull Museums is a partner in the Yorkshire and Humber Hub, which will receive &pound;3.36 million in the period 2003&ndash;06. Wilberforce House in Kingston upon Hull is benefiting from funding as part of the Renaissance in the Regions initiative to establish it as a centre for study, teaching and collections access as part of the 200thanniversary of the abolition of slavery in 2007. Kingston upon Hull Museums' collections relating to local history have been designated as part of our Designation Scheme to recognise outstanding collections in non-national museums. Since 2000 they have received grants totalling over &pound;220,000 from the Designation Challenge Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/8">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/9">In November 2000 we introduced free television licenses for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Kingston upon Hull, North with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 3,815.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/10">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11pm on new year's eve to 11am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/11">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Kingston upon Hull, North, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/12">Tourism in Kingston upon Hull has increased with the assistance of Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including Yorkshire Forward. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Kingston upon Hull, North. Although no assessment is made of the precise effect of this support for tourism in Kingston upon Hull, North, we estimate that total expenditure from overnight stays in the Yorkshire and Humber region by overseas and domestic visitors rose from &pound;1.95 billion in 2000 to almost &pound;2.25 billion in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/13">English Heritage has awarded grants worth almost &pound;940,000 to Kingston upon Hull since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including a grant of &pound;20,000 to St. Alban, Hall Road in Kingston upon Hull, North.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/14">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Kingston upon Hull, North has benefited from over 200 awards totalling over &pound;10.5 million. Of these, 46 awards worth over &pound;3.8 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/15">In addition, Kingston upon Hull and four other Yorkshire cities have been jointly awarded &pound;1.75 million in Lottery funding from the Urban Cultural Programme, which was established by the Millennium Commission and Arts Council England to build on the success of the Government's competition to select the UK's nomination for European Capital of Culture 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1060W.3/1">Under the measure proposed in clause 8 of the National Lottery Bill, investment income will be shared out in the same fixed proportions as each distributor's share of operator-related lottery income. This will end the current arrangement whereby those distributors that manage to reduce their balances receive proportionately less investment income, and it will also make the estimation of future income simpler and more transparent for all. When this measure takes effect the Heritage Lottery Fund will therefore receive 16.67 per cent. of all the income that the lottery generates for good causes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1063W.3/1">Due to the nature of the statistics held by PSNI, it is not possible to ascertain how many specific attacks upon taxi drivers occurred between <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-27">27 January 2005</phrase>, as victims are not identified by occupation. However, the DCU Commander in North Belfast reports that between those dates 124 incidents involving taxis occurred. These incidents vary in nature and include incidents where persons run off without paying, as well as more serious offences such as assault and aggravated criminal damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.3/2">The vast majority of those incidents are unrelated to the recent series of attacks upon taxis and taxi drivers in North Belfast. The recent spate of attacks upon taxis in that area can be attributed to organized criminality with links both to the UVF and LVF. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December 2004</phrase>, North Belfast DCU has recorded 12 incidents involving taxis. On three of those occasions a taxi driver was threatened. On 10 of those occasions a taxi has been set alight.</p>

There are various matters which the Chief Constable may take into account before making a decision.

	<p pid="a.1072W.0/1">The midwife-led unit in Craigavon Area Hospital is currently operating with two rather than three midwives. These temporary arrangements were put in place due to staff sickness and a high level of obstetric activity within the main delivery suite and the maternity wards. This action has been necessary in order to ensure that a safe service is provided across all the trust's maternity services. I would emphasis that the extent of change was the reallocation of one midwife only and that this measure is temporary, circumstance-specific, and under continual review.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072W.3/1">There is a range of organisations, both statutory and voluntary, within Northern Ireland involved in the provision of support to migrant workers including the provision of information on services. Some provide welcome packs&quot; in English and a variety of minority languages where there is a demand. The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister has provided funding from its minority ethnic voluntary organisation fund for this purpose, for example to the South Tyrone Empowerment Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.3/2">Also the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland is planning a booklet for migrant workers outlining where and how to seek advice, support and redress against racism and to access public services. This booklet is due to be published in March 2005. It is anticipated that the booklet will be published in a variety of languages.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.3/3">However, we recognise that we still have a great deal to do in facing the challenges posed by the arrival of increasing numbers of migrant workers in Northern Ireland. This has been brought into stark relief by the horrific ordeal of the Ukrainian national who had her legs amputated after suffering from frostbite as a result of sleeping rough. Clearly, Government and others need to establish, as a matter of urgency, what lessons we can learn from this horrific experience. To this end a multi-agency review and assessment meeting is being facilitated by the northern health and social services board in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.3/4">I have asked my officials to investigate whether there are gaps in provision of information services and welcome packs, how to plug any gaps and the scope for setting out minimum standards. We recognise, however, the crucial role of the voluntary and community sector in providing information that is tailored to specific communities across Northern Ireland and we would wish this to continue. I also wish to see employers and trade unions working with us on this important area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.3/5">The rapid changes in the composition of the migrant worker population in Northern Ireland and the sheer diversity of source countries for migrant workers means that it is unlikely to be practical to offer every single migrant worker, regardless of the language they speak, a welcome pack in their own mother tongue. However, I would hope that such packs could be made available in those languages that are most frequently used.</p>

	<p pid="a.1073W.2/1">Research commissioned by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister&mdash;Migrant Workers in Northern Ireland&quot; (June 2004) indicates that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/2" class="indent">migrant workers are a growing category of employees in Northern Ireland and they are a necessary factor for many employment sectors due to a shortage of available local labour&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/3">I have arranged for copies of the research report to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/4">This research indicates the difficulty in identifying the total number of migrant workers in Northern Ireland with any degree of accuracy. In particular, nationals from countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) and family members of EEA nationals are exempt from immigration control and have a right to enter, reside and work in the UK without the permission of any UK authority. Thus there is no central body that records their migration to Northern Ireland. Migrant workers from outside the EEA are allowed to work here under work permit arrangements which are regulated by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/5">The 2001 Census indicates that there were 5,940 people in Northern Ireland who were born in EU countries (excluding the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) and 20,719 people born in non-EU countries. This gives a maximum figure of 26,659 people who could be classified as migrant workers or dependents of migrant workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/6">Home Office records show that 3,253 applications for work permits were approved from employers with a Northern Ireland postcode in 2003 and 3,827 in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/7">I have asked my officials to work with their colleagues in other Government Departments including the Home Office, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, trades unions and business interests to see how they can work together in this area, to improve the availability of information on flows of migrant workers into Northern Ireland&mdash;to ensure that Government Departments, agencies and others can respond effectively to the needs of migrant workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/8">The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland is to be commended for the lead that it is taking in gathering examples of good practice in the employment of migrant workers. Many employers in both the public and the private sector are to be commended, too, for their good practice in working with and supporting employees from overseas. The Equality Commission has held a range of seminars and roundtable discussions to encourage employers and service providers to meet their obligations to migrant workers. Together with Business in the Community it is organising a Migrant Workers: Building on Best Practice&quot; conference for later in the year. I strongly support this initiative. I would wish to see greater exchange of good practice between employers (including trade unions) and recognition by all employers of their responsibilities&mdash;legal and moral&mdash;towards their workers and society in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/9">I do not have details of the English language skills of migrant workers. We do know that the language barrier is a problem for many migrant workers, their family members and members of minority ethnic groups who do not speak English as their first language or who speak little English and for the statutory agencies involved in the provision of services. Government are committed to effective communication with all its customers and to ensuring that services are as accessible as possible to all members of the community, including people from minority ethnic groups and migrant workers. DHSSPS does not have information on the number of migrant workers accessing emergency medical services. In emergencies hospitals use interpreting services provided by Language Line and other providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/10">For its part, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) introduced new interpretation procedures in September 2004. Telephone interpreters are available 24hours a day, seven days a week, and are available from any phone, including mobiles, from any location. This has considerably increased the Police Service's ability to liaise quickly with individuals who cannot understand English. Face-to-face interpreters are also available if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.2/11">Finally, the PSNI is currently working with its telephone interpretation service provider to investigate ways of handling emergency calls made by people who cannot speak English.</p>

	<p pid="a.1075W.5/23">1.This information relates to resources in both operational regions of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, rural and urban. They provide a snapshot only of resources at 3pm and 3am on early and night shift on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-23">23 November 2004</phrase>, and should be read in that context. These figures can vary due to shift changeovers and variable shift patterns.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075W.5/24">2.The support provided to response and community policing teams has an important role in frontline service delivery. Community safety teams, domestic violence officers etc. all provide a frontline service, and deal with victims, perpetrators and witnesses on a daily basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075W.5/25">3.It is not possible to state how many officers attached to all headquarters departments were on duty on that date as only manual records are held and a manual search would be required that would incur disproportionate cost. This includes murder investigation teams, serious crime teams etc.</p>

	<p pid="a.1087W.6/1">The results of the Soundings Exercise were published in June 2003. This considered the level of interest in holding referendums on establishing elected regional assemblies in the English regions. Copies are already available in the Library of the House and on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1087W.6/2">No polls, focus groups or other measures of public opinion on this subject have been undertaken since then by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Some research was undertaken to measure the effect of the Your Say Information Campaign in increasing awareness of the referendums but this was not a measure of public opinion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1098W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.2/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goodsand services and transport. Disabled people in Edinburgh, North and Leith will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1098W.2/22">Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with over 1,700 in Edinburgh, North and Leith alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.2/23">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18-years-old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 1,400 families in Edinburgh, North and Leith.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.2/24">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.2/25">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of October 2004, around 3,265 pensioners in Edinburgh, North and Leith are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;42.90 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.2/26">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70+ payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.2/27">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80+ annual payment is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.1099W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/2">Since 2001 the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Hull, North will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly families with severely disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 25 per cent. of adults and 4 per cent. of children in the Yorkshire and Humberside region are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/5">Information on the numbers of customers in Hull, North who are in receipt of disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) is in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.1099W.2/22">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Hull, North, the proportion in employment has risen to 63.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/23">Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with over 4,300 in Hull, North alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/24">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures for 2002&ndash;03 show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 3,400 families in Hull, North.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/25">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/26">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of October 2004, around 4,760 pensioners in Hull, North are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;39.61 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/27">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally for this year eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70 plus payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/28">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80 plus annual payment are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.2/29">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 12.6 thousand pensioners in Hull, North have benefited from this increase.</p>

The Coalition Provisional Authority quickly took steps to stop smuggling and the black market in oil products, but much more needs to be done to identify and plug leaks in the system that have arisen as a result of a long history of smuggling under the former regime and the fact that Iraq has the cheapest petrol and petroleum products in the region. We expect the Iraqi authorities under the newly elected Government to remain committed to combating smuggling and reducing subsidies for oil products, which will go a long way to reducing the scale of the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.1107W.2/1">Although levels of participation in the elections were impressive it is clear that terrorist violence and intimidation deterred some Iraqis from voting, particularly in Sunni areas. The Government attach great importance to an inclusive political process as the best means of isolating those seeking to undermine progress. We welcome the emphasis Iraq's political and religious leaders have put on a constitutional process which reflects the full diversity of Iraqi society and Prime Minister Allawi's call on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January</phrase> for national dialogue that guarantees all Iraqis a voice in the next Government.</p>

I have placed a list of the Small Grants Scheme spend 2002 to 2004 by country in the Library of the House. The Department for International Development funds the scheme. Funds are made available to civil society and religious organisations for activities that promote the development or maintain the economy of a territory outside the United Kingdom, or the welfare of its people. A breakdown of each project is not held centrally by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1110W.5/1">We have yet to take any final decisions on the most appropriate way to mark this important anniversary. The UK already provides public, operational and financial support to a number of projects which will leave a lasting memorial to the victims of these crimes, including the establishment of the purpose-built Potocari cemetery outside Srebrenica and the creation of a memorial room with the support of the Imperial War Museum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110W.5/2">The best tribute to the victims of this crime would be to bring the perpetrators to justice.

	<p pid="a.1111W.2/1">As soon as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) received news of the tsunami disaster it activated its emergency crisis plan that deals with major emergencies involving British nationals overseas. Under this plan, posts in the affected region were reinforced with trained consular staff both from London and other regional posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/2">Between <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-26">26 December</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January</phrase>, the FCO sent a total of 105 extra staff to Thailand. As of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January</phrase>, 51 of these extra staff remained in Thailand. 27 were supporting the embassy in Bangkok and 24 were manning the temporary mission in Phuket. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-26">26 December</phrase>, a rapid deployment team of 10 FCO staff was sent out from London to the high commission in Colombo. A further eight team members were deployed between 28 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December</phrase>. As of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-24">24 January</phrase>, one member of this team remained in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/3">In London, a tsunami crisis unit of 16 full-time staff providing 24 hour cover has been in operation. FCO staff have also been deployed to the Casualty Bureau in Hendon and, for a period of 10 days, to Heathrow airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/4">It is far from clear as yet what the total financial cost of the consular operation will be but it will almost certainly exceed that of any recent consular crisis. The cost includes the deployment of police officers to the affected region for family liaison and forensic investigation. We expect some tsunami-related activity to continue into the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/5">Since October 2003 a proportion of each UK passport fee has gone towards establishing an Emergency and Disaster Reserve (EDR) which is controlled jointly by the FCO and Her Majesty's Treasury. By the end of financial year 2004&ndash;05, allowing for previous non-tsunami claims yet to be paid, there will be roughly &pound;5 million in the EDR which we hope will be sufficient to cover the majority of the 2004&ndash;05 claim. In the event that total claims exceed the capacity of the EDR, we will need to consider how best to meet that cost, including by seeking access to the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limits Reserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.1115W.2/1">No specific guidance has been issued to the national health service on proposed mergers of ambulance services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.2/2">However, under section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, NHS bodies are under a duty to consult and involve patients, the public and their representatives in the planning of changes to services and to involve them in decisions affecting the operation of services. Should a proposal to change services represent a substantial development or variation, NHS bodies are under a duty to consult relevant local authority overview and scrutiny committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.2/3">Once the results of these consultations are known, if the trust boards and strategic health authority agree that a merger should take place, they are required to write to the Secretary of State for Health asking that the Department take action to merge the organisations. If that request is approved by Ministers, an order will be drawn up dissolving the organisations in question and creating a replacement organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.2/4">There are no set standards for what the Secretary of State would take into account when considering a request to merge NHS organisations. But as a general rule, before approving the merger of any NHS trusts, the Secretary of State would seek to satisfy himself that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.2/5" class="indent">appropriate consultation has been undertaken locally;</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.2/6" class="indent">any organisational changes are in the interests of patients and staff; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.2/7" class="indent">the merger will help improve performance against the requirements and standards set out in National Standards, Local Action and other relevant documents.</p>

	<p pid="a.1125W.2/2">Between 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06, Swale PCT will receive an increase in funding in excess of &pound;23 million (32 per cent.).

Swale PCT received above average growth in each of these years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1125W.2/3">I am informed that Swale PCT has for the year 2004&ndash;05 budgeted for &pound;200,000 for the crisis resolution health team (CRHT), rising to &pound;350,000 for 2005&ndash;06. The CRHT has now started to see patients and is expected to be at full strength by the end of March 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.1126W.2/4">In the three years to March 2006, the Government are investing over &pound;300 million in the development of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) provided by the NHS and local authorities. This is additional to their spending on CAMHS funded by general allocations. The total level of expenditure in 2005&ndash;06 is a matter for local decision. In 2005&ndash;06, the Department will be allocating an additional &pound;97,000 to Swale PCT and &pound;1.7 million to Kent county council. This funding will help to achieve the Department's public service agreement standard of a comprehensive CAMHS in every area by 2006.</p>
